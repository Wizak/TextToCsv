 cast upon the breakers by horatio alger jr chapter i a faithless guardian well good by rodney i leave school tomorrow i am going to learn a trade i am sorry to part with you david couldnt you stay another term no my uncle says i must be earning my living and i have a chance to learn the carpenters trade where are you going to duffield some twenty miles away i wish i were in your shoes you have no money cares and can go on quietly and complete your education i dont know how i am situated david i only know that my guardian pays my expenses at this boarding school yes you are a star boarder and have the nicest room in the institution i am only a poor day scholar still i feel thankful that i have been allowed to remain as long as i have who is your guardian a mr benjamin fielding of new york is he a business man i believe so do you know how much you will inherit when you come of age asked david after a short pause i havent an idea it seems to me your guardian ought to have told you i scarcely know my guardian five years ago i spent a week at his home i dont remember much about it except that he lives in a handsome house and has plenty of servants since then as you know i have passed most of my time here except that in the summer i was allowed to board at the catskills or any country place i might select yes and i remember one year you took me with you and paid all my expenses i shall never forget your kindness and how much i enjoyed that summer rodney ropes smiled and his smile made his usually grave face look very attractive my dear david he said it was all selfishness on my part i knew i should enjoy myself much better with a companion you may call that selfishness rodney but it is a kind of selfishness that makes me your devoted friend how long do you think you shall remain at school i dont know my guardian has never told me his plans for me i wish he would i shall miss you rodney but we will correspond wont we surely you know i shall always feel interested in you and your welfare david was a plain boy of humble parentage and would probably be a hard working mechanic in fact he was looking for nothing better but rodney ropes looked to be of genteel blood and had the air of one who had been brought up a gentleman but different as they were in social position the two boys had always been devoted friends the boarding school of which rodney was as his friend expressed himself a star pupil was situated about fifty miles from the city of new york it was under the charge of dr sampson a tall thin man of fair scholarship keenly alive to his own interest who showed partiality for his richer pupils and whenever he had occasion to censure bore most heavily upon boys like david hull who was poor rodney occupied alone the finest room in the school there was a great contrast between his comfortable quarters and the extremely plain dormitories occupied by less favored pupils in the case of some boys the favoritism of the teacher would have led them to put on airs and made them unpopular with their school fellows but rodney had too noble a nature to be influenced by such considerations he enjoyed his comfortable room but treated his school fellows with a frank cordiality that made him a general favorite after david left his room rodney sat down to prepare a lesson in cicero when he was interrupted by the entrance through the half open door of a younger boy rodney he said the doctor would like to see you in his office very well brauner i will go down at once he put aside his book and went down to the office of dr sampson on the first floor the doctor was sitting at his desk he turned slightly as rodney entered take a seat ropes he said curtly his tone was so different from his usual cordiality that rodney was somewhat surprised am i in disgrace he asked himself dr sampson doesnt seem as friendly as usual after a brief interval dr sampson wheeled round in his office chair i have a letter for you from your guardian ropes he said here it is do me the favor to read it here with some wonder rodney took the letter and read as follows dear rodney i have bad news to communicate as you know i was left by your father in charge of you and your fortune i have never told you the amount but i will say now that it was about fifty thousand dollars until two years since i kept it intact but then began a series of reverses in which my own fortune was swallowed up in the hope of relieving myself i regret to say that i was tempted to use your money that went also and now of the whole sum there remains but enough to pay the balance of your school bills leaving you penniless how much i regret this i cannot tell you i shall leave new york at once i do not care at present to say where i shall go but i shall try to make good the loss and eventually restore to you your lost fortune i may be successful or i may not i shall do my best and i hope in time to have better news to communicate one thing i am glad to say i have a casket containing your mothers jewels these are intact i shall send you the casket by express knowing that you will wish to keep them out of regard for your mothers memory in case you are reduced to the necessity of pawning or selling them i am sure that your mother could she be consulted would advise you to do so this would be better than to have you suffer from want there is nothing further for me to write except to repeat my regret and renew my promise to make up your lost fortune if i shall ever to able to do so your guardian benjamin fielding rodney read this like one dazed in an instant he was reduced from the position of a favorite of fortune to a needy boy with his living to make he could not help recalling what had passed between his friend david and himself earlier in the day now he was as poor as david poorer in fact for david had a chance to learn a trade that would yield him a living while he was utterly without resources except in having an unusually good education well said dr sampson have you read your letter yes sir your guardian wrote to me also this is his letter and he placed the brief epistle in rodneys hands dr sampson i have written my ward rodney ropes an important letter which he will show you the news which it contains will make it necessary for him to leave school i inclose a check for one hundred and twenty five dollars keep whatever is due you and give him the balance benjamin fielding i have read the letter but i dont know what it means said dr sampson can you throw any light upon it here is my letter doctor you can read it for yourself dr sampsons face changed as he read rodneys letter it changed and hardened and his expression became quite different from that to which rodney had been accustomed this is a bad business ropes said the doctor in a hard tone he had always said rodney before yes sir that was a handsome fortune which your father left you yes sir i never knew before how much it amounted to you only learn when you have lost it mr fielding has treated you shamefully yes sir i suppose he has but he says he will try to make it up to me in the future pish that is all humbug even if he is favored by fortune you will never get back a cent i think i shall sir you are young you do not know the iniquities of business men i do i prefer to hope for the best just as you please have you anything more to say to me only that i will figure up your account and see how much money is to come to you out of the check your guardian has sent you can stay here till monday then you will find it best to make new arrangements very well sir rodney left the room realizing that dr sampsons feelings had been changed by his pupils reverse of fortune it was the way of the world but it was not a pleasant way and rodney felt depressed chapter ii the casket of jewels it was not till the latter part of the afternoon that the casket arrived rodney was occupied with a recitation and it was only in the evening that he got an opportunity to open it there was a pearl necklace very handsome a pair of bracelets two gold chains some minor articles of jewelry and a gold ring a locket attracted rodneys notice and he opened it it contained the pictures of his father and mother his father he could barely remember his mother died before he was old enough to have her image impressed upon his memory he examined the locket and his heart was saddened he felt how different his life would have been had his parents lived he had never before realized the sorrow of being alone in the world misfortune had come upon him and so far as he knew he had not a friend even dr sampson who had been paid so much money on his account and who had always professed so great friendship for him had turned cold as he was standing with the locket in his hand there was a knock at the door come in he called out the door opened and a stout coarse looking boy dressed in an expensive manner entered good evening john said rodney but not cordially next to himself john bundy who was the son of a wealthy saloon keeper in the city of new york had been a favorite with dr sampson if there was anything dr sampson bowed down to and respected it was wealth and mr bundy senior was reputed to be worth a considerable fortune in rodneys mood john bundy was about the last person whom he wanted to see ha said john espying the open casket where did you get all that jewelry it contains my mothers jewels said rodney gravely you never showed it to me before i never had it before it came to me by express this afternoon it must be worth a good pile of money said john his eyes gleaming with cupidity i suppose it is have you any idea what it is worth i have no thought about it what are you going to do with it it wont be of use to you especially the diamond earrings he added with a coarse laugh no answered rodney shortly my eyes wouldnt my mother like to own all this jewelry shes fond of ornament but pa wont buy them for her rodney did not answer i say ropes i mustnt forget my errand will you do me a favor what is it lend me five dollars till the first of next month my allowance comes due then now i havent but a quarter left what makes you apply to me bundy because you always have money i dont suppose you are worth as much as my father but you have more money for yourself than i have i have had perhaps but i havent now why whats up what has happened i have lost my fortune john whistled this was his way of expressing amazement why what have you been doing how could you lose your fortune my guardian has lost it for me that amount to the same thing when did you hear that this morning is that true are you really a poor boy yes john bundy was astonished but on the whole he was not saddened in the estimation of the school rodney had always ranked higher than he and been looked upon as the star pupil in point of wealth now that he was dethroned john himself would take his place this would be gratifying though just at present and till the beginning of the next month he would be distressed for ready money well thats a stunner he said how do you feel about it shall you stay in school no i cant afford it i must get to work isnt there anything left not a cent there may be a few dollars and then said bundy with a sudden thought there is this casket of jewelry you can sell it for a good deal of money i dont mean to sell it then youre a fool thats all ive got to say i dont suppose you will understand my feeling in the matter but these articles belonged to my mother they are all i have to remind me of her i do not mean to sell them unless it is absolutely necessary i would sell them quickern a wink said bundy whats the good of keeping them we wont discuss the matter said rodney coldly do you mind my telling the other boys about your losing your money no it will be known tomorrow at any rate there is no advantage in concealing it a heavy step was heard outside it stopped before the door i must be getting said bundy or ill get into trouble it was against the rule at the school for boys to make calls upon each other in the evening unless permission were given john bundy opened the door suddenly and to his dismay found himself facing the rigid figure of dr sampson the principal how do you happen to be here bundy asked the doctor sternly please sir i was sympathizing with ropes on his losing his money said bundy with ready wit very well i will excuse you this time im awful sorry for you ropes said bundy effusively thank you responded rodney you can go now said the principal i have a little business with master ropes all right sir good night good night wont you sit down dr sampson said rodney politely and he took the casket from the chair yes i wish to have five minutes conversation with you so these are the jewels are they yes sir they seem to be quite valuable went on the doctor lifting the pearl necklace and poising it in his fingers it will be well for you to have them appraised by a jeweler it would sir if i wished to sell them but i mean to keep them as they are i would hardly advise it you will need the money probably you do not know how near penniless you are no sir i dont know your guardian as you are aware sent me a check for one hundred and twenty five dollars i have figured up how much of this sum is due to me and i find it to be one hundred and thirteen dollars and thirty seven cents yes sir said rodney indifferently this leaves for you only eleven dollars and sixty three cents you follow me do you not yes sir have you any money saved up from your allowance a few dollars only sir ahem that is a pity you will need all you can raise but of course you did not anticipate what has occurred no sir i will throw off the thirty seven cents said the principal magnanimously and give you back twelve dollars i would rather pay you the whole amount of your bill said rodney ahem well perhaps that would be more businesslike so you dont wish to part with any of the jewelry ropes no sir i thought perhaps by way of helping you i would take the earrings and perhaps the necklace off your hands and present them to mrs sampson rodney shuddered with aversion at the idea of these precious articles which had once belonged to his mother being transferred to the stout and coarse featured consort of the principal i think i would rather keep them he replied oh well just as you please said dr sampson with a shade of disappointment for he had no idea of paying more than half what the articles were worth if the time comes when you wish to dispose of them let me know rodney nodded but did not answer in words of course ropes went on the doctor in a perfunctory way i am very sorry for you i shall miss you and if i could afford it i would tell you to stay without charge but i am a poor man yes said rodney hastily i understand i thank you for your words but would not under any circumstances accept such a favor at your hands i am afraid you are proud ropes pride is ahem a wrong feeling perhaps so dr sampson but i wish to earn my own living without being indebted to any one perhaps you are right ropes i dare say i should feel so myself when do you propose leaving us some time tomorrow sir i shall feel sad to have you go you have been here so long that you seem to me like a son but we must submit to the dispensations of providence and dr sampson blew a vigorous blast upon his red silk handkerchief i will give you the balance due in the morning very well sir rodney was glad to be left alone he had no faith in dr sampsons sympathy the doctor had the reputation of being worth from thirty to forty thousand dollars and his assumption of being a poor man rodney knew to be a sham he went to bed early for tomorrow was to be the beginning of a new life for him chapter iii a strange disappearance when it was generally known in the school that rodney was to leave because he had lost his property much sympathy was felt and expressed for him though he had received more than ordinary attention from the principal on account of his pecuniary position and expectations this had not impaired his popularity he never put on any airs and was on as cordial relations with the poorest student as with the richest im awfully sorry youre going rodney said more than one is it really true that you have lost your property yes it is true do you feel bad about it i feel sorry but not discouraged i say rodney said ernest rayner in a low voice calling rodney aside are you very short of money i havent much left ernest because i received five dollars last week as a birthday present i havent spent any of it you can have it as well as not rodney was much moved my dear ernest he said putting his arm caressingly around the neck of the smaller boy you are a true friend i wont forget your generous offer though i dont need to accept it but are you sure you have money enough asked ernest yes i have enough for the present by the time i need more i shall have earned it there was one boy already introduced john bundy who did not share in the general feeling of sympathy for rodney this was john bundy he felt that rodneys departure would leave him the star pupil and give him the chief social position in school as to scholarship he was not ambitious to stand high in that i say ropes he said complacently im to have your room after youre gone i congratulate you returned rodney it is an excellent room yes i spose itll make you feel bad where are you going i hope you will enjoy it as much as i have done oh yes i guess theres no doubt of that im going to get pa to send me some nice pictures to hang on the wall when you come back here on a visit youll see how nice it looks i think it will be a good while before i come here on a visit yes i spose itll make you feel bad where are you going to the city of new york youll have to live in a small hall bedroom there why will i because you are poor and it costs a good deal of money to live in new york itll be a great come down it will indeed but if i can earn enough to support me in plain style i wont complain i suppose youll call and see me when you come to new york perhaps so if you dont live in a tenement house pa objects to my going to tenement houses theres no knowing what disease there may be in them it is well to be prudent said rodney smiling it did not trouble him much to think he was not likely to receive a call from his quondan schoolmate here is the balance of your money ropes said dr sampson drawing a small roll of bills from his pocket later in the day i am quite willing to give you the odd thirty seven cents thank you doctor but i shant need it you are poorly provided now i would pay you a good sum for some of your mothers jewelry as i told you last evening thank you said rodney hastily but i dont care to sell at present let me know when you are ready to dispose of the necklace here the depot carriage appeared in the street outside and rodney with his gripsack in one hand and the precious casket in the other climbed to a seat beside the driver his trunk he left behind promising to send for it when he had found a new boarding place there was a chorus of good byes rodney waved his handkerchief in general farewell and the carriage started for the depot be you goin for good asked joel the driver who knew rodney well and felt friendly to him yes joel its kind of sudden isnt it yes what makes you go bad news joel be any of your folks dead it is not death i havent any folks im alone in the world its because ive lost my property and am too poor to remain in school thats too bad said the driver in a tone of sympathy where are you goin to the city are you goin to work yes i shall have to if you was a little older you might get a chance to drive a street car but i spose youre too young yes i dont think they would take me ive thought sometimes i should like such a chance myself said joel ive got tired of the country i should like to live in the city where theres theaters and shows and such like do you know what the drivers on street cars get no i never heard i wish youd find out and let me know you can send the letter to joel phipps groveton then find out if its easy to get such a chance i will i shall be glad to oblige you you always was obligin rodney ive asked jack bundy to do it you know his folks live in the city but he never would hes a mighty disagreeable boy he never liked you didnt he no i surmise he was jealous of you he used to say you put on so many airs it made him sick i dont think any of the other boys would say that no but they could say it of him do you think his father is rich i have always heard that he was i hope hes better about paying his debt than jack i lent him twenty five cents a year ago and i never could get it back the distance from the school to the station was a mile joel fetched the carriage round with a sweep and then jumped off opened the door and then helped the passengers to disembark if that word is allowable how soon does the train start joel asked rodney in about five minutes then i had better purchase my ticket without delay dont forget to ask about horse car drivers no i wont i should like to have you come to new york i know no one there and i should feel glad to see a familiar face the train came up in time and rodney was one of half a dozen passengers who entered the cars he obtained a place next to a stout man dressed in a pepper and salt suit is this seat engaged asked rodney yes to you and his fellow passenger laughed rodney laughed too for he saw that the remark was meant to be jocose he put his gripsack on the floor at his feet but held the casket in his lap he did not like to run any risk with that are you a drummer asked the stout man with a glance at the casket no sir i thought you might be and that that might contain your samples no sir that is private property he had thought of telling what it contained but checked himself he knew nothing of his companion and was not sure how far it might be safe to trust a stranger i used to be a drummer myself in the jewelry line continued his companion and i carried a box just like that ah indeed then you are not in that business now no i got tired of it i deal in quite a different article now indeed suburban lot you dont happen to have any of them with you the stout man roared with laughter giving rodney the impression that he had said a very witty thing thats a good one he remarked the best ive heard for a long time no i havent any of the lots with me but ive got a circular just cast your eye over that and he drew a large and showy prospectus from his pocket if you should be looking for a good investment he continued you cant do any better than buy a lot at morton park it is only eighteen miles from the city and is rapidly building up you can buy lot on easy installments and i will myself pick one out for you that is almost sure to double in value in a year or two thank you said rodney but i shall have to invest my money if i get any in a different way as what for instance in board and lodging good that is even more necessary than real estate how long have you been in the business sir about six months and how does it pay very well if you know how to talk i should think you might do well then thank you i appreciate the compliment what business are you going into that is if you are going to the city i am going to the city but i have no idea yet what i shall do perhaps you may like to become an agent for our lots i shall be ready to employ you as sub agent if you feel disposed thank you sir if you will give me your card i may call upon you the short man drew from his card case a business card it bore the name adin woods royal building nassau st morton park lots come to see me at any time he said and we will talk the matter over here the train boy came along and rodney bought a copy of puck while the agent resumed the perusal of a copy of a magazine for an hour the cars ran smoothly then there was a sudden shock causing all the passengers to start to their feet were off the track shouted an excitable person in front of rodney the instinct of self preservation is perhaps stronger than any other rodney and his seat mate both jumped to their feet and hurried to the door of the car not knowing what was in store for them but fortunately the train had not been going rapidly it was approaching a station and was slowing up so though it had really run off the track there was not likely to be any injury to the passengers we are safe said adin woods the only harm done is the delay i hope that wont be long suppose we go back to our seat they returned to the seat which they had jointly occupied then rodney made an alarming discovery my casket he exclaimed where is it what did you do with it left it on the seat it may have fallen to the floor rodney searched for it in feverish excitement but his search was vain the casket had disappeared chapter iv in pursuit of a thief were the contents of the casket valuable asked the land agent yes it contained my mothers jewels all the more valuable because she is dead replied rodney were they of much intrinsic worth they must be worth several hundred dollars at least then they must be found said adin woods energetically they have evidently been taken by some passenger during the five minutes we were away from our seat were you inquiring about the casket asked a lady sitting opposite yes madam can you give any information about it just after you left your seat the man that sat behind you rose and reaching over for it went to the rear end of the car and got out i wish you had stopped him madam he was so cool about it that i thought he might be a friend of the young gentleman i didnt know him he must have been a thief what was his appearance madam asked the lot agent he was a thin dark complexioned man with side whiskers coming half way down his cheeks and you say he got out of the rear end of the car yes sir he wont get on the train again said the agent turning to rodney he thinks the casket valuable enough to pay him for the interruption of his journey what shall i do then asked rodney feeling helpless and at a loss which way to turn follow him said the agent briefly he will probably stop over in the village a day and resume his journey tomorrow even if i found him i am afraid i shouldnt know how to deal with him then ill tell you what ill do ill stop over with you and help you make it hot for him ive had a spite against thieves ever since i had a valuable overcoat stolen in one of my journeys i shall feel very much obliged to you mr woods but wont it interfere with your business not materially if we succeed in overhauling the rascal i shall feel sufficiently repaid for the small interruption but come on we cant afford to linger here while he is carrying off the plunder i dont know how i can repay you mr woods said rodney gratefully you can buy a lot of me when you get rich enough i will certainly do so though i am afraid it will be a long time first you dont know what good fortune may be in store for you did you notice madam in which direction the thief went yes i was looking out of the window he went over the road to the left that leads to the village you will see mr ropes that i was right about his plans dont call me mr ropes call me rodney i will it dont seem natural to dub a boy mr now rodney follow me the two passengers set out on the road that led to the village they could see the latter easily for it was not more than a mile away he will be surprised to think we have struck his trail so quick said the agent where shall we go first to the hotel if there is one the village seems small yes there are only a few hundred inhabitant probably it is not a place where a traveler would be likely to interrupt his journey unless he had a special object in doing so like our dishonest friend however i think we shall be able to balk his little game ten minutes walk brought them to the village looking about they saw a small hotel just across the way from a neat white chapel follow me said the agent they went into the public room in which there was a small office the book of arrivals was open and adin woods went forward and examined it silently he pointed to a name evidently just written for the ink was scarcely dry this was the name louis wheeler philadelphia this may or may not be his real name said mr woods in a low voice do you wish to register gentlemen asked the clerk we will take dinner and if we decide to stay will register later by the way i recognize this name but it may not be the man i suppose yes the gentleman just registered would you mind describing him he was a tall dark man as near as i can remember and he carried a small casket in his hand yes and a gripsack oh yes said the agent his face lighting up with satisfaction it is the man i mean where is he now in his room did he say how long he intended to stay no sir he said nothing about his plans did he seem specially careful about the casket yes sir he carried that in his hands but let the servant carry up the gripsack my friend said the agent in an impressive tone i am going to surprise you the country clerk looked all curiosity is it about mr wheeler he asked yes the man is a thief he stole the casket which contains valuable jewelry from my young friend here we are here to demand a return of the property or to arrest him is there a policeman within call i can summon a constable do so but dont breathe a word of what i have told you the clerk called a boy in from the street and gave him instructions in a low voice he went at once on his errand and in ten minutes a stout broad shouldered man made his appearance this gentleman sent for you mr barlow said the clerk what can i do for you asked the constable help me to recover stolen property that i will do with pleasure if you will tell me what you want me to do adin woods held a brief conference with the constable then he led the way up stairs followed immediately by rodney while the constable kept a little behind his room is no said the bell boy the agent paused before the door of no and knocked come in said a voice the agent opened the door and entered accompanied by rodney a glance showed that the occupant answered the description given by the lady in the car louis wheeler changed color for he recognized both the agent and rodney what is your business he asked in a tone which he tried to make indifferent that answered woods pointing to the jewel casket on the bureau it looked to him as if wheeler if that was his name had been trying to open it i dont understand then i will try to make things clear to you you have doubtless by accident he emphasized the last word taken from the car a casket belonging to my young friend here you are mistaken sir said wheeler with brazen hardihood that casket belongs to me indeed what does it contain i fail to see how that is any of your business returned wheeler determined if possible to bluff off his visitors i admire your cheek sir i really do but i am too old a traveler to be taken in by such tricks i propose to have that casket well sir you are the most impudent thief and burglar i ever met you break into a gentlemans room and undertake to carry off his private property unless you go out at once i will have you arrested that you can do very readily for i have an officer within call louis wheeler changed color he began to see that the situation was getting serious there is a great mistake here he said i agree with you the agent went to the door and called constable barlow the constable promptly presented himself do you want me sir he asked that depends on this gentleman here if he will peacefully restore to my young friend here yonder jewel casket i am willing to let him go otherwise and he glanced at wheeler significantly perhaps i have made a mistake admitted the thief i had a casket exactly like this possibly i have taken the wrong one i have the key to the casket here said rodney and i can tell you without opening it what it contains what did yours contain asked the agent jewelry answered wheeler shortly what articles never mind i am inclined to think this casket belongs to the boy rodney you can take it and mr wheeler will probably find his where he left it no objection was made and the discomfited thief was left a prey to mortification and disappointment rodney handed a dollar to the constable which that worthy official received with thanks and he and the agent resumed their journey by an afternoon train they saw nothing further of louis wheeler who sent for dinner to be served in his room chapter v a young financial wreck you have been very fortunate in recovering your jewels said the agent i owe it to you replied rodney gratefully well perhaps so if i have rendered you a service i am very glad and i am very glad to have found so good a friend i hope you will let me pay for your ticket to new york it wont be necessary the interruption of our journey wont invalidate the ticket we have an hour later they reached new york what are your plans rodney asked adin woods who by this time had become quite intimate with his young companion i shall call on my guardian and perhaps he may give me some advice as to what i do where would you advise me to go to a hotel no it will be too expensive i know of a plain boarding house on west fourteenth street where you can be accommodated with lodging and two meals breakfast and supper or dinner as we call it here for a dollar a day i shall be glad to go there for the present at least i havent much money and must find something to do as soon as possible we will both go there and if you dont object we will take a room together that will give us a larger apartment mrs marcy is an old acquaintance of mine and will give you a welcome rodney was glad to accept his companions proposal they proceeded at once to the boarding house and fortunately found a good room vacant on the third floor mr woods went out in the evening to make a call but rodney was glad to go to bed at nine oclock the next morning after breakfast rodney consulted his companion as to what he should do with the casket do you want to raise money on it asked the agent no i shall not do this unless i am obliged to have you any idea as to the value of the jewels no then i will take you first to a jeweler in maiden lane a friend of mine who will appraise them afterwards i advise you to deposit the casket at a storage warehouse or get tiffany to keep it for you i will do as you suggest maiden lane is a street largely devoted to jewelers wholesale and retail rodney followed mr woods into a store about midway between broadway and nassau street a pleasant looking man of middle age greeted the agent cordially what can i do for you he asked do you wish to buy a diamond ring for the future mrs woods not much i would like to have you appraise some jewelry belonging to my young friend here the casket was opened and the jeweler examined the contents admiringly this is choice jewelry he said does your friend wish to sell not at present answered rodney when you do give me a call i will treat you fairly you wish me to appraise these articles yes sir if you will it will take me perhaps fifteen minutes the jeweler retired to the back part of the store with the casket in about a quarter of an hour he returned of course i cant give exact figures he said but i value the jewelry at about twelve hundred dollars rodney looked surprised i didnt think it so valuable he said i dont mean that you could sell it for so much but if you wish to dispose of it i will venture to give you eleven hundred thank you if i decide to sell i will certainly come to you now said the agent i advise you on the whole to store the casket with tiffany shall i have to pay storage in advance asked rodney anxiously i think not the value of the jewels will be a sufficient guarantee that storage will be paid rodney accompanied adin woods to the great jewelry store on the corner of fifteenth street and union square and soon transacted his business now you wont have any anxiety as to the safety of the casket said the agent your friend of the train will find it difficult to get hold of the jewels now i shall have to leave you as i have some business to attend to we will meet at supper rodney decided to call at the office of his late guardian benjamin fielding it was in the lower part of the city on his way down town he purchased a copy of a morning paper almost the first article he glanced at proved to be of especial interest to him it was headed skipped to canada rumors have been rife for some time affecting the business standing of mr benjamin fielding the well known commission merchant yesterday it was discovered that he had left the city but where he has gone is unknown it is believed that he is very deeply involved and seeing no way out of his embarrassment has skipped to canada or perhaps taken passage to europe probably his creditors will appoint a committee to look into his affairs and report what can be done later an open letter has been found in mr fieldings desk addressed to his creditors it expresses regret for their losses and promises if his life is spared and fortune favors him to do all in his power to make them good no one doubts mr fieldings integrity and regrets are expressed that he did not remain in the city and help unravel the tangle in which his affairs are involved he is a man of ability and as he is still in the prime of life it may be that he will be able to redeem his promises and pay his debts in full if sufficient time is given him i can get no help or advice from mr fielding thought rodney i am thrown upon my own resources and must fight the battle of life as well as i can alone he got out in front of the astor house as he left the car he soiled his shoes with the mud so characteristic of new york streets shine your boots asked a young arab glancing with a business eye at rodneys spattered shoes rodney accepted his offer not so much because he thought the blacking would last as for the opportunity of questioning the free and independent young citizen who was doing what he hoped to do that is making a living for himself is business good with you asked rodney it ought to be with the street in this condition yes me and de street commissioner is in league together he makes business good for me and do you pay him a commission asked rodney smiling i cant tell no official secrets it might be bad for me you are an original genius am i i hope you aint callin me names oh no i am only paying you a compliment what is your name mike flynn were do you live mike at the lodge i suppose you mean at the newsboys lodge yes how much do you have to pay there six cents for lodgin and six cents for supper and breakfast that

suit of clothes to be sure but i havent much money you are better off than i am hows that asked mike incredulously youve got work to do and i am earning nothing if youve got money enough to buy a box and brush you can go in with me i dont think i should like it mike it would spoil my clothes and i am afraid i wouldnt have money enough to buy others i keep my dress suit at home the one i wear to parties havent you got any father or mother mike how does it happen that you are living in new york alone my farder is dead and me mudder she married a man wot aint no good hed bate me till i couldnt stand it so i just run away where does your mother live in albany some time when you earn money enough you can ask her to come here and live with you they dont take women at the lodge no i suppose not said rodney smiling besides shes got two little girls by her new husband and she wouldnt want to leave them by this time the shine was completed and rodney paid mike if i ever come to the lodge ill ask for you he said where do you live now im just staying at a place on fourteenth street but i cant afford to stay there long for they charge a dollar a day geewholliker that would bust me and make me a financial wreck as the papers say how did you lose your fortune and get reduced to blacking boots asked rodney jocosely i got scooped out of it in wall street answered mike jay gould cleaned me out and i suppose now he has added your fortune to his youve hit it boss well good day mike ill see you again some day all right im in my office all de mornin chapter vi an impudent adventurer while rodney was talking with mike flynn he was an object of attention to a man who stood near the corner of barclay street and was ostensibly looking in at the window of the drug store as rodney turned away he recognized him at once as his enterprising fellow traveler who had taken possession of the casket of jewels he did not care to keep up an acquaintance with him and started to cross the street but the other came forward smiling and with a nod said i believe you are the young man i met yesterday in the cars and afterwards at kentville yes sir i just wanted to tell you that i had got back my jewel box the one for which i mistook yours indeed said rodney who did not believe a word the fellow said quite an amusing mistake i made it might have proved serious to me very true as i shouldnt have known where to find you to restore your property i dont think that would have troubled you much thought rodney where did you find your box he asked in the car that is the conductor picked it up and left it at the depot for me where are you staying here in the city at the astor house no i have found a boarding house on west fourteenth street if it is a good place i should like to go there what is the number i cant recall it though i could find it answered rodney with reserve for he had no wish to have his railroad acquaintance in the house is the gentleman who was traveling with you there also yes sir he is a very pleasant gentleman though he misjudged me ha ha my friends will be very much amused when i tell them that i was taken for a thief why i venture to say that my box is more valuable than yours very likely said rodney coldly good morning good morning i hope we may meet again rodney nodded but he could not in sincerity echo the wish he was now confronted by a serious problem he had less than ten dollars in his pocketbook and this would soon be swallowed up by the necessary expenses of life in a large city what would he do when that was gone it was clear that he must go to work as soon as possible if his guardian had remained in the city probably through his influence a situation might have been secured now nothing was to be looked for in that quarter he bought a morning paper and looked over the want column he found two places within a short distance of the astor house and called at each one was in a railroad office my boy said the manager a pleasant looking man the place was taken hours since you dont seem to get up very early in the morning i could get up at any hour that was necessary replied rodney but i have only just made up my mind to apply for a position you wont meet with any luck today it is too late get up bright and early tomorrow morning buy a paper and make early application for any place that strikes you as desirable thank you sir i am sure your advice is good if you had been the first to call here i should have taken you i like your appearance better than that of the boy i have selected thank you sir this boy may not prove satisfactory call in six days just before his week expires and if there is likely to be a vacancy i will let you know thank you sir you are very kind i always sympathize with boys i have two boys of my own this conversation quite encouraged rodney it seemed to promise success in the future if he had probably impressed one man he might be equally fortunate with another it was about half past twelve when he passed through nassau street all at once his arm was grasped and a cheery voice said where are you going rodney mr woods he exclaimed with pleased recognition yes its your old friend woods you are not the only railroad friend i have met this morning who was the other the gentleman who obligingly took care of my jewel box for a short time you dont mean to say you have met him where did you come across him in front of the astor house almost two hours since did you speak to him he spoke to me you will be glad to hear that he has recovered his own casket of jewels adin woods smiled he must think you are easily imposed upon he said to believe any such story anything more he said his friends would be very much surprised to hear that he had been suspected of theft so he wanted to clear himself with you yes he asked where i was staying i hope you didnt tell him i only said i was at a boarding house on west fourteenth street but didnt mention the number he thinks you have the casket with you and that he may get possession of it it is well that you stored it at tiffanys i think so now i have no anxiety about it do you think he will find out where we live probably as you gave him a clew but rodney it is about lunch time and i confess i have an appetite come and lunch with me but i am afraid mr woods i shall not be able to return the compliment there is no occasion for it i feel in good humor this morning i have sold one lot and have hopes of disposing of another the one lot pays me a commission of twenty dollars i wish i could make twenty dollars in a week sometimes i only sell one lot in a week it isnt like a regular business it is precarious still take the year through and i make a pretty good income come in here we can get a good lunch here and he led the way into a modest restaurant not far from the site of the old post office which will be remembered by those whose residence in new york dates back twenty years or more now we will have a nice lunch said the agent i hope you can do justice to it i generally can responded rodney smiling i am seldom troubled with a poor appetite ditto for me now what have you been doing this morning looking for a place with what success pretty good if i had only been earlier rodney told the story of his application to the manager of the railroad office you will know better next time i think youll succeed i did when i came to new york at the age of twenty two i had only fifty dollars that small sum had to last me twelve weeks you can judge that i didnt live on the fat of the land during that time i couldnt often eat at delmonicos even beefsteak johns would have been too expensive for me however those old days are over the next day and the two following rodney went about the city making application for positions but every place seemed full on the third day mr woods said i shall have to leave you for a week or more rodney where are you going to philadelphia theres a man there who is a capitalist and likes land investments i am going to visit him and hope to sell him several lots he once lived in this city so he wont object to new york investments i hope you will succeed mr woods i think if you are going away i had better give up the room and find cheaper accommodations i am getting near the end of my money you are right it is best to be prudent that evening rodney found a room which he could rent for two dollars a week he estimated that by economy he could get along for fifty cents a day for his eating and that would be a decided saving he was just leaving the house the next morning gripsack in hand when on the steps he met louis wheeler his acquaintance of the train where are you going asked wheeler i am leaving this house i have hired a room elsewhere wheelers countenance fell and he looked dismayed why i have just taken a room here for a week he said you will find it a good place but i wouldnt have come here if i hadnt thought i should have company i ought to feel complimented rodney was convinced that wheeler had come in the hopes of stealing the casket of jewels a second time and he felt amused at the fellows discomfiture you havent got your jewel box with you no i can take that another time then its still in the house thought wheeler with satisfaction it wont be my fault if i dont get it in my hands well good morning he said come around and call on me thank you chapter vii at the newsboys lodging house within a week rodney had spent all his money with the exception of about fifty cents he had made every effort to obtain a place but without success boys born and bred in new york have within my observation tried for months to secure a position in vain so it is not surprising that rodney who was a stranger proved equally unsuccessful though naturally hopeful rodney became despondent there seems to be no place for me he said to himself when i was at boarding school i had no idea how difficult it is for a boy to earn a living he had one resource he could withdraw the box of jewels from tiffanys and sell some article that it contained but this he had a great objection to doing one thing was evident however he must do something his friend the lot agent was out of town and he hardly knew whom to advise with at last mike flynn the friendly bootblack whose acquaintance he had made in front of the astor house occurred to him mike humble as he was was better off than himself moreover he was a new york boy and knew more about hustling than rodney did so he sought out mike in his office good morning mike said rodney as the bootblack was brushing off a customer oh its you rodney said mike smiling with evident pleasure how youre gettin on not at all thats bad can i help you just say the word and ill draw a check for you on the park bank is that where you keep your money its one of my banks you dont think id put all my spondulics in one bank do you i wont trouble you to draw a check this morning i only want to ask some advice ive got plenty of that i havent been able to get anything to do and i have only fifty cents left i cant go on like that thats so ive got to give up my room on fourteenth street i cant pay for it any longer do you think i could get in at the lodge yes ill introduce you to mr oconnor when shall i meet you at five oclock well be in time for supper all right at five oclock mike accompanied rodney to the large newsboys lodging house on new chambers street mr oconnor the popular and efficient superintendent now dead looked in surprise at mikes companion he was a stout man with a kindly face and rodney felt that he would prove to be a friend mr oconnor let me introduce me friend mr rodney ropes said mike could you give me a lodging asked rodney in an embarrassed tone yes but i am surprised to see a boy of your appearance here i am surprised to be here myself admitted rodney the superintendent fixed upon him a shrewd but kindly glance have you run away from home he asked no sir it is my home that has run away from me have you parents no sir do you come from the country yes sir where have you been living at a boarding school a few hours from new york why did you leave it because my guardian sent me word that he had lost my fortune and could no longer pay my bills you have been unfortunate truly what do you propose to do now earn my living if i can i have been in the city for about two weeks and have applied at a good many places but in vain then you were right in coming here supper is ready and although it is not what you are used to it will satisfy hunger mike you can take rodney with you within five minutes rodney was standing at a long table with a bowl of coffee and a segment of bread before him it wouldnt have been attractive to one brought up to good living as was the case with him but he was hungry he had eaten nothing since morning except an apple which he had bought at a street stand for a penny and his stomach urgently craved a fresh supply of food mike stood next to him the young bootblack who was used to nothing better ate his portion with zest and glanced askance at rodney to see how he relished his supper he was surprised to see that his more aristocratic companion seemed to enjoy it quite as much as himself i didnt think youd like it he said anything tastes good when youre hungry mike thats so and i havent eaten anything except an apple since morning is dat so why didnt you tell me id have stood treat at de boss tweed eatin house i had money but i didnt dare to spend it i was afraid of having nothing left when rodney had eaten his supper he felt that he could have eaten more but the craving was satisfied and he felt relieved he looked around him with some curiosity for he had never been in such a motley gathering before there were perhaps one hundred and fifty boys recruited from the street to about all of whom except himself the term street arab might be applied the majority of them had the shrewd and good humored celtic face many of them were fun loving and even mischievous but scarcely any were really bad naturally rodney with his good clothes attracted attention the boys felt that he was not one of them and they had a suspicion that he felt above them get on to de dude remarked one boy who was loosely attired in a ragged shirt and tattered trousers he means me mike said rodney with a smile i say patsy glenn what do you mean by callin me friend rodney a dude demanded mike angrily coz hes got a dandy suit on what if he has wouldnt you wear one like it if you could you bet then just let him alone hes just got back from de inauguration whered you pick him up mike never mind hes one of us how much money have you got in your pocket rodney thirty two cents he cant put on no frills wid dat money thats so i take it all back and patsy offered a begrimed hand to rodney which the latter shook heartily with a pleasant smile that turned the tide in favor of rodney the boys gathered around him and he told his story in a few words i used to be rich boys he said but my guardian spent all my money and now i am as poor as any of you youd ought to have had me for your guardian rodney observed mike i wish you had you wouldnt have lost my money for me true for you i say so boys if we can find rodneys guardian whatll we do to him give him de grand bounce suggested patsy drop him out of a high winder said another whats his name i dont care to tell you boys hes written me a letter saying he will try to pay me back some day i think he will he isnt a bad man but he has been unlucky mike at the request of mr oconnor showed rodney a locker in which he could store such articles of clothing as he had with him after that he felt more at home and as if he were staying at a hotel though an humble one at eight oclock some of the boys had already gone to bed but mike and rodney were among those who remained up rodney noticed with what kindness yet fairness the superintendent managed his unruly flock unruly they might have been with a different man but he had no trouble in keeping them within bounds it was at this time that two strangers were announced one a new york merchant named goodnow the other a tall slender man with sandy whiskers of the mutton chop pattern good evening mr goodnow said the superintendent who recognized the merchant as a friend of the society good evening mr oconnor i have brought my friend and correspondent mr mulgrave of london to see some of your young arabs i shall be glad to give him all the opportunity he desires the englishman looked curiously at the faces of the boys who in turn were examining him with equal interest they are not unlike our boys of a similar grade but seem sharper and more intelligent he said but surely pointing to rodney that boy is not one of the arabs why he looks like a young gentleman he is a new comer he only appeared tonight he must have a history may i speak with him by all means rodney this gentleman would like to talk with you rodney came forward with the ease of a boy who was accustomed to good society and said i shall be very happy to speak with him chapter viii rodney finds a place surely said the englishman you were not brought up in the street oh no answered rodney i was more fortunate then how does it happen that i find you here among the needy boys of the city because i am needy too but you were not always poor no i inherited a moderate fortune from my father it was only within a short time that i learned from my guardian that it was lost i left the boarding school where i was being educated and came to the city to try to make a living but surely your guardian would try to provide for you he is no longer in the city who was he asked otis goodnow mr benjamin fielding is it possible why i lost three thousand dollars by him he has treated you shamefully it was not intentional i am sure said rodney he was probably drawn into using my money by the hope of retrieving himself he wrote me that he hoped at some time to make restitution you speak of him generously my lad said mr mulgrave yet he has brought you to absolute poverty yes sir and i wont pretend that it is not a hard trial to me but if i can get a chance to earn my own living i will not complain goodnow a word with you said the englishman and he drew his friend aside cant you make room for this boy in your establishment otis goodnow hesitated at present there is no vacancy he said make room for him and draw upon me for his wages for the first six months i will do so but before the end of that time i am sure he will justify my paying him out of my own pocket there was a little further conference and then the two gentlemen came up to where rodney was standing with mr oconnor my boy said mr mulgrave my friend here will give you a place at five dollars a week will that satisfy you rodneys face flushed with pleasure it will make me very happy he said come round to my warehouse here is my business card tomorrow morning said the merchant ask to see me at what time shall i call sir at half past nine oclock that is for the first morning when you get to work you will have to be there at eight there will be no trouble about that sir now it is my turn said the englishman here are five dollars to keep you till your first weeks wages come due i dare say you will find them useful thank you very much sir i was almost out of money after the two gentlemen left the lodging house rodney looked at the card and found that his new place of employment was situated on reade street not far from broadway its you thats in luck rodney said his friend mike whod think that a gentleman would come to the lodging house to give you a place yes i am in luck mike and now im going to make you a proposal what is it why cant we take a room together it will be better than living here sure you wouldnt room with a poor boy like me why shouldnt i you are a good friend and i should like your company besides i mean to help you get an education i suppose youre not a first class scholar mike about fourth class i guess rodney then you shall study with me then when you know a little more you may get a chance to get out of your present business and get into a store that will be bully said mike with pleasure now wed better go to bed i must be up bright and early in the morning well engage a room before i go to work there was no difficulty about rising early it is one of the rules of the lodging house for the boys to rise at six oclock and after a frugal breakfast of coffee and rolls they are expected to go out to their business whatever it may be mike and rodney dispensed with the regulation breakfast and went out to a restaurant on park row where they fared better now where shall we go for a room asked rodney theres a feller i know has a good room on bleecker street said mike how far is that a little moren a mile all right let us go and see bleecker street once stood in better repute than at present it is said that a t stewart once made his home there now it is given over to shops and cheap lodging houses finally the boys found a room decently furnished about ten feet square of which the rental was two dollars and a half per week mike succeeded in beating down the lodging house keeper to two dollars and at that figure they engaged it when will you come asked mrs mccarty right off said mike ill need a little time to put it in order me and my partner will be at our business till six oclock returned mike you can send in your trunks during the day if you like my trunk is at the windsor hotel said mike ive lent it to a friend for a few days mrs mccarty looked at mike with a puzzled expression she was one of those women who are slow to comprehend a joke and she could not quite make it seem natural that her new lodger who was in rather neglige costume should be a guest at a fashionable hotel i will leave my valise said rodney and will send for my trunk it is in the country mike looked at him not feeling quite certain whether he was in earnest but rodney was perfectly serious youre better off than me said mike when they reached the street if i had a trunk i wouldnt have anything to put into it ill see if i cant rig you out mike ive got a good many clothes bought when i was rich you and i are about the same size ill give you a suit of clothes to wear on sundays will you exclaimed mike his face showing pleasure id like to see how i look in good cloes i never wore any yet it wouldnt do no good in my business you wont want to wear them when at work but wouldnt you like to change your business yes have you ever tried whatd be the use of tryin theyd know i was a bootblack in these cloes when you wear a better suit you can go round and try your luck id like to said mike wistfully i dont want you to tell at the store that you room with a bootblack it isnt that i think of mike i want you to do better im going to make a man of you i hope you are sometimes ive thought id have to be a bootblack always when do you think youll get the cloes i shall write to the principal of the boarding school at once asking him to forward my trunk by express i want to economize a little this week and shall have to pay the express charges ill pay up my part of the rent rodney a quarter a day rodney had advanced the whole sum as mike was not in funds if you cant pay a dollar a week i will pay a little more than half there aint no need ill pay my half and be glad to have a nice room ive got three or four pictures at the school and some books ill send for them later on and well fix up the room will you well have a reglar bang up place i tell you thatll be better than livin at the lodge still that seems a very neat place it is lucky for poor boys that they can get lodging so cheap but it isnt like havin a room of your own rodney i say when were all fixed ill ask some of me friends to come in some evenin and take a look at us theyll be sprised certainly mike i shall be glad to see any of your friends it may seem strange that rodney carefully as he had been brought up should have made a companion of mike but he recognized in the warm hearted irish boy illiterate as he was sterling qualities and he felt desirous of helping to educate him he knew that he could always depend on his devoted friendship and looked forward with pleasure to their more intimate companionship after selecting their room and making arrangements to take possession of it the boys went down town rodney stepped into the reading room at the astor house and wrote the following letter to dr sampson dr pliny sampson dear sir will you be kind enough to send my trunk by express to no bleecker street i have taken a room there and that will be my home for the present i have obtained a position in a wholesale house on reade street and hope i may give satisfaction will you remember me with best wishes to all the boys i dont expect to have so easy or pleasant a time as i had at school but i hope to get on and some time perhaps in the summer to make you a short visit yours truly rodney ropes chapter ix the first day at work a little before half past nine rodney paused in front of a large five story building on reade street occupied by otis goodnow he entered and found the first floor occupied by quite a large number of clerks and salesmen and well filled with goods well young fellow what can i do for you asked a dapper looking clerk i would like to see mr goodnow hes reading his letters he wont see you rodney was provoked do you decide who is to see him he asked youre impudent young feller am i perhaps you will allow mr goodnow to see me as long as he told me to call here this morning thats a different thing returned the other in a different tone if youre sure about that you can go to the office in the back part of the room rodney followed directions and found himself at the entrance of a room which had been partitioned off for the use of the head of the firm mr goodnow was seated at a desk with his back to him and was employed in opening letters without turning round he said sit down and i will attend to you in a few minutes rodney seated himself on a chair near the door in about ten minutes mr goodnow turned around who is it he asked perhaps you remember telling me to call at half past nine you saw me at the newsboys lodging house ah yes i remember i promised my friend mulgrave that i would give you a place what can you do are you a good writer shall i give you a specimen of my handwriting yes sit down at that desk it was a desk adjoining his own rodney seated himself and wrote in a firm clear neat hand i will endeavor to give satisfaction if you are kind enough to give me a place in your establishment then he passed over the paper to the merchant ah very good said mr goodnow approvingly you wont be expected to do any writing yet but i like to take into my store those who are qualified for promotion he rang a little bell on his desk a boy about two years older than rodney answered the summons send mr james here said the merchant mr james a sandy complexioned man partially bald made his appearance mr james said the merchant i have taken this boy into my employ i dont know if one is needed but it is at the request of a friend you can send him on errands or employ him in any other way very well sir i can find something for him to do today at any rate as young johnson hasnt shown up very well whats your name my lad rodney ropes make a note of his name mr james and enter it in the books you may go with mr james and put yourself at his disposal rodney followed the subordinate who was the head of one of the departments to the second floor here mr james had a desk wait a minute he said and i will give you a memorandum of places to call at in five minutes a memorandum containing a list of three places was given to rodney with brief instructions as to what he was to do at each they were places not far away and fortunately rodney had a general idea as to where they were in his search for positions he had made a study of the lower part of the city which now stood him in good stead as he walked towards the door he attracted the attention of the young clerk with whom he had just spoken well did you see mr goodnow asked the young man stroking a sickly looking mustache yes has he taken you into the firm not yet but he has given me a place the clerk whistled so you are one of us he said yes answered rodney with a smile then you ought to know the rules of the house you can tell me later on but now i am going out on an errand in about an hour rodney returned he had been detained at two of the places where he called do you remember what i said asked the young clerk as he passed yes the first rule of the establishment is for a new hand to treat me on his first day thats pretty good for you said rodney laughing i shall have to wait till my pay is raised about the middle of the afternoon as rodney was helping to unpack a crate of goods the older boy whom he had already seen in the office below walked up to him and said is your name ropes yes you are wanted in mr goodnows office rodney went down stairs feeling a little nervous had he done wrong and was he to be reprimanded he could think of nothing deserving censure so far as he knew he had attended faithfully to all the duties required of him as he entered the office he saw that mr goodnow had a visitor whose face looked familiar to him he recalled it immediately as the face of the english gentleman who had visited the lodging house the day previous with his employer so i find you at work he said offering his hand with a smile yes sir answered rodney gratefully thanks to you how do you think you will like it very much sir it is so much better than going around the street with nothing to do i hope you will try to give satisfaction to my friend mr goodnow i shall try to do so sir you mustnt expect to rise to be head salesman in a year festina lente as the latin poet has it i shall be satisfied with hastening slowly sir what you understand latin pretty well sir upon my word i didnt expect to find a boy in the news boys lodging house with classical attainments perhaps you know something of greek also he said doubtfully in reply rodney repeated the first line of the iliad astonishing exclaimed mr mulgrave putting up his eyeglass and surveying rodney as if he were a curious specimen you dont happen to know anything of sanscrit do you no sir i confess my ignorance i apprehend you wont require it in my friend goodnows establishment if i do i will learn it said rodney rather enjoying the joke if i write a book about america i shall certainly put in a paragraph about a learned office boy i think you are entitled to something for your knowledge of greek and latin say five dollars apiece and mr mulgrave drew from his pocket two gold pieces and handed them to rodney thank you very much sir said rodney i shall find this money very useful as i have taken a room and am setting up housekeeping then you have left the lodging house yes sir i only spent one night there you are right it is no doubt a great blessing to the needy street boys but you belong to a different class it is very fortunate i went there last evening or i should not have met you and mr goodnow i am glad to have been the means of doing you a service said the englishman kindly shaking hands with rodney who bowed and went back to his work i am not sure but you are taking too much notice of that boy mulgrave said the merchant no fear he is not a common boy you wont regret employing him i hope not then they talked of other matters for mr mulgrave was to start on his return to england the following day at five oclock rodneys day was over and he went back to bleecker street he found mike already there working hard to get his hands clean soiled as they were by the stains of blacking did you have a good day mike asked rodney yes i made a dollar and ten cents heres a quarter towards the rent all right i see you are prompt in money matters i try to be do you know rodney i worked better for feelin that i had a room of my own to go to after i got through i hope ill soon be able to get into a different business i hope so too two days later rodneys trunk arrived in the evening he opened it he took out a dark mixed suit about half worn and said try that on mike mike did so it fitted as if it were made for him you can have it mike said rodney you dont mean it exclaimed mike delighted yes i do i have plenty of others rodney supplemented his gift by a present of underclothing and on the following sunday the two boys went to central park in the afternoon mike so transformed that some of his street friends passed him without recognition much to mikes delight chapter x mike puts on a uniform a wonderful change came over mike flynn until he met rodney he seemed quite destitute of ambition the ragged and dirty suit which he wore as bootblack were the best he had his face and hands generally bore the marks of his business and as long as he made enough to buy three meals a day two taken at the lodging house with something over for lodging and an occasional visit to a cheap theater he was satisfied he was fifteen and had never given a thought to what he would do when he was older but after meeting rodney and especially after taking a room with him he looked at life with different eyes he began to understand that his business though honorable because honest was not a desirable one he felt too that he ought to change it out of regard for rodney who was now his close companion if i had ten dollars ahead he said one day id give up blackin boots what else would you do id be a telegraph boy thats more respectable than blackin boots and it ould be cleaner that is true do you need money to join i would get paid once in two weeks and id have to live till i got my first salary i guess i can see you through mike no you need all your money rodney ill wait and see if i cant save it myself this however would have taken a long time if mike had not been favored by circumstances he was standing near the ladies entrance to the astor house one day when casting his eyes downward he espied a neat pocketbook of russia leather he picked it up and from the feeling judged that it must be well filled now i must admit that it did occur to mike that he could divert to his own use the contents without detection as no one had seen him pick it up but mike was by instinct an honest boy and he decided that this would not be right he thrust it into his pocket however as he had no objection to receiving a reward if one was offered while he was standing near the entrance a tall lady dressed in brown silk and wearing glasses walked up from the direction of broadway she began to peer about like one who was looking for something i guess its hers thought mike are you looking for anything maam he asked she turned and glanced at mike i think i must have dropped my pocketbook she said i had it in my hand when i left the hotel but i had something on my mind and i think i must have dropped it without noticing wont you help me look for it for i am short sighted is this it asked mike producing the pocketbook oh yes exclaimed the lady joyfully where did you find it just here answered mike indicating a place on the sidewalk i suppose there is a good deal of money in it said mike with pardonable curiosity then you didnt open it no maam i didnt have a chance i just found it there may be forty or fifty dollars but it isnt on that account i should have regretted losing it it contained a receipt for a thousand dollars which i am to use in a law suit that is very important for it will defeat a dishonest claim for money that i have already paid then im glad i found it you are an honest boy you seem to be a poor boy also thats true maam if i was rich i wouldnt black boots

i dont care to marry though i appreciate your good wishes i am an old maid from principle i am an officer of the female suffrage association is it a good payin office maam asked mike visibly impressed no but it is a position of responsibility please tell me your name that i may make a note of it my name is michael flynn i see you are of celtic extraction i dont know maam i never heard that i was it isnt anything bad is it not at all i have some celtic blood in my own veins if you ever come to boston you can inquire for miss pauline peabody thank you maam said mike who thought the lady rather a queer lot now i must call upon my lawyer and leave the receipt which i came so near losing well im in luck thought mike ill go home and dress up and apply for a position as telegraph boy when rodney came home at supper time he found mike dressed in his sunday suit whats up now mike he asked have you retired from business yes from the bootblack business tomorrow i shall be a telegraph boy that is good you havent saved up ten dollars have you i saved up two and a lady gave me ten dollars for findin her pocketbook thats fine mike there chanced to be a special demand for telegraph boys at that time and mike who was a sharp lad on passing the necessary examination was at once set to work he was immensely fond of his blue uniform when he first put it on and felt that he had risen in the social scale true his earnings did not average as much but he was content with smaller pay since the duties were more agreeable in the evenings under rodneys instruction he devoted an hour and sometimes two to the task of making up the deficiencies in his early education these were extensive but mike was naturally a smart boy and after a while began to improve rapidly so three months passed rodney stood well in with mr goodnow and was promoted to stock clerk the discipline which he had revived as a student stood him in good stead and enabled him to make more rapid advancement than some who had been longer in the employ of the firm in particular he was promoted over the head of jasper redwood a boy two years older than himself who was the nephew of an old employee who had been for fifteen years in the house jaspers jealousy was aroused and he conceived a great dislike for rodney of which rodney was only partially aware for this dislike there was really no cause rodney stood in his way only because jasper neglected his duties and failed to inspire confidence he was a boy who liked to spend money and found his salary insufficient though he lived with his uncle and paid but two dollars a week for his board uncle james he said one day when do you think i will get a raise you might get one now if it were not for the new boy you mean ropes yes he has just been promoted to a place which i hoped to get for you it is mean grumbled jasper i have been here longer than he true but he seems to be mr goodnows pet it was an unlucky day for you when he got a place in the establishment did you ask mr goodnow to promote me yes but he said he had decided to give archers place to ropes archer was a young clerk who was obliged on account of pulmonary weakness to leave new york and go to southern california how much does ropes get now seven dollars a week and i only get five and i am two years older they ought to have more regard for you uncle james or i as your nephew would get promoted i will see what we can do about it i wish ropes would get into some scrape and get discharged it was a new idea but jasper dwelt upon it and out of it grew trouble for rodney chapter xi missing goods james redwood was summoned one morning to the counting room of his employer mr redwood said the merchant i have reason to think that one of my clerks is dishonest who sir that is what i want you to find out what reason have you for suspecting any one some ladies cloaks and some dress patterns are missing are you sure they were not sold yes the record of sales has been examined and they are not included that is strange mr goodnow said redwood thoughtfully i hope i am not under suspicion oh not at all the losses seem to have taken place in my department true but that doesnt involve you what do you want me to do watch those under you let nothing in your manner however suggest that you are suspicious i dont want you to put any one on his guard all right sir i will be guided by your instructions have you any idea how long this has been going on only a few weeks mr redwood turned to go back to his room but mr goodnow called him back i neednt suggest to you he said that you keep this to yourself dont let any clerk into the secret very well sir james redwood however did not keep his promise after supper he called back jasper as he was about putting on his hat to go out and said jasper i wish to speak with you for five minutes wont it do tomorrow morning i have an engagement put it off then this is a matter of importance very well sir and jasper albeit reluctantly laid down his hat and sat down jasper said his uncle theres a thief in our establishment jasper started and his sallow complexion turned yellower than usual what do you mean uncle he asked nervously what i say some articles are missing that have not been sold such as what ladies cloaks and dress patterns who told you asked jasper in a low tone mr goodnow what the boss certainly how should he know i didnt inquire and if i had he probably wouldnt have told me the main thing is that he does know he may not be sure he is not a man to speak unless he feels pretty sure i dont see how any one could steal the articles without being detected it seems they are detected did did mr goodnow mention any names no he wants to watch and find out the thief i wish you to help me though i am acting against instructions mr goodnow asked me to take no one into my confidence you will see therefore that it will be necessary for you to say nothing i wont breathe a word said jasper who seemed to feel more at ease now that i have told you so much can you suggest any person who would be likely to commit the theft jasper remained silent for a moment then with a smile of malicious satisfaction said yes i can suggest a person who is it the new boy rodney ropes james redwood shook his head i cant believe that it is he i am not in love with the young fellow who seems to stand in the way of your advancement but he seems straight enough and i dont think it at all likely that he should be the guilty person yes uncle james he seems straight but you know that still waters run deep have you seen anything that would indicate guilt on his part i have noticed this that he is very well dressed for a boy of his small salary and seems always to have money to spend that will count for something still he might have some outide means have you noticed anything else jasper hesitated i noticed one evening when he left the store that he had a sizable parcel under his arm and you think it might have contained some article stolen from the stock thats just what i think now nothing of the kind occurred to me at that time for i didnt know any articles were missing that seems important when was it that you noticed this one day last week answered jasper hesitatingly can you remember the day no couldnt you fix it some way no you see i didnt attach any particular importance to it at the time and probably it would not have occurred to me again but for your mentioning that articles were missing there may be something in what you say said his uncle thoughtfully i will take special notice of young ropes after this so will i dont let him observe that he is watched it would defeat our chances of detecting the thief ill be careful do you want to say anything more uncle no by the way where were you going this evening i was going to meet a friend and perhaps go to the theater you couldnt lend me a dollar could you uncle james yes i could but you are not quite able to pay for your own pleasures it costs all my salary to live and its going to be worse next year for i shall have to pay a higher rent when i have my pay raised i can get along better if ropes loses his place you will probably step into it then i hope hell go and that soon when jasper passed through the front door and stood on the sidewalk he breathed a sigh of relief so they are on to us he said to himself but how was it found out thats what id like to know i have been very careful i must see carton at once a short walk took him to a billiard room not far from broadway a young man of twenty five with a slight mustache and a thin dark face was selecting a cue ah jasper he said come at last let us have a game of pool not just yet come outide i want to speak to you jasper looked serious and philip carton observing it made no remonstrance but taking his hat followed him out well what is it he asked something serious it is discovered at the store that goods are missing you dont mean it are we suspected no one is suspected yet but how do you know my uncle spoke to me about it this evening just after supper he doesnt think you are in it no how did he find out through the boss goodnow spoke to him about it today but how should goodnow know anything about it that no one can tell but himself he asked uncle james to watch the clerks and see if he could fasten the theft on any of them that is pleasant for us it is well we are informed so that we can be on our guard i am afraid our game is up for the present at any rate we must suspend operations now have you some money for me well a little a little why there are two cloaks and a silk dress pattern to be accounted for true but i have to be very careful i have to submit to a big discount for the parties i sell to undoubtedly suspect that the articles are stolen wouldnt it be better to pawn them it would be more dangerous besides you know how liberal pawnbrokers are ill tell you what would be better if i had a sufficient number of articles to warrant it i could take them on to boston or philadelphia and there would be less risk selling them there that is true i wish we had thought of that before now we shall have to give up the business for a time how much money have you got for me seven dollars seven dollars exclaimed jasper in disgust why that is ridiculous the articles must have been worth at retail a hundred dollars perhaps so but i only got fourteen for them if you think you can do any better you may sell them yourself next time i thought i should assuredly get fifteen dollars out of it said jasper looking deeply disappointed i had a use for the money too very likely so had i well i suppose i must make it do listen and i will tell you how i think i can turn this thing to my advantage go ahead chapter xii what was found in rodneys room there is a boy who stands between me and promotion continued jasper speaking in a low tone the boy you mentioned the other day yes rodney ropes mr goodnow got him from i dont know where and has taken a ridiculous fancy to him he has been put over my head and his pay raised though i have been in the store longer than he my idea is to connect him with the thefts and get him discharged do you mean that we are to make him a confederate no answered jasper impatiently he would be just the fellow to peach and get us all into trouble then what do you mean to direct suspicion towards him we wont do it immediately but within a week or two it would do me good to have him turned out of the store jasper proceeded to explain his idea more fully and his companion pronounced it very clever meanwhile rodney not suspecting the conspiracy to deprive him of his place and his good name worked zealously encouraged by his promotion and resolved to make a place for himself which should insure him a permanent connection with the firm ten days passed and mr redwood again received a summons from the office entering he found mr goodnow with a letter in his hand well mr redwood he began have you got any clew to the party who has stolen our goods no sir has any thing been taken since i spoke with you on the subject not that i am aware of has any one of the clerks attracted your attention by suspicious conduct no sir answered redwood puzzled humph cast your eye over this letter james redwood took the letter which was written in a fine hand and read as follow mr goodnow dear sir i dont know whether you are aware that articles have been taken from your stock say ladies cloaks and silk dress patterns and disposed of outside i will not tell you how it has come to my knowledge for i do not want to get any ones ill will but i will say to begin with that they were taken by one of your employees and the one perhaps that you would least suspect for i am told that he is a favorite of yours i may as well say that it is rodney ropes i live near him and last evening i saw him carry a bundle to his room when he went back from the store i think if you would send round today when he is out you would find in his room one or more of the stolen articles i dont want to get him into trouble but i dont like to see you robbed and so i tell you what i know a friend mr redwood read this letter attentively arching his brows perhaps to indicate his surprise then he read it again carefully what do you think of it asked the merchant i dont know answered redwood slowly have you ever seen anything suspicious in the conduct of young ropes i cant say i have on the contrary he seems to be a very diligent and industrious clerk but about his honesty i fancied him the soul of honesty so did i but of course we are liable to be deceived it wouldnt be the first case where seeming honesty has been a cover for flagrant dishonesty what do you wish me to do mr goodnow shall i send ropes down to you no it would only give him a chance if guilty to cover up his dishonesty i am ready to follow your instructions do you know where he lodges yes sir then i will ask you to go around there and by some means gain admission to his room if he has any of our goods secreted take possession of them and report to me very well sir half an hour later mrs mccarty rodneys landlady in response to a ring admitted mr james redwood does a young man named ropes lodge here he asked yes sir i come from the house where he is employed he has inadvertently left in his room a parcel belonging to us and i should be glad if you would allow me to go up to his room and take it you see sir said mrs mccarty in a tone of hesitation while you look like a perfect gentleman i dont know you and i am not sure whether in justice to mr ropes i ought to admit you to his room you are quite right my good lady i am sure it is just what i should wish my own landlady to do i will therefore ask you to go up to the room with me to see that all is right that seems all right sir in that case i dont object follow me if you please as they entered rodneys room mr redwood looked about him inquisitively one article at once fixed his attention it was a parcel wrapped in brown paper lying on the bed this is the parcel i think he said if you will allow me i will open it to make sure mrs mccarty looked undecided but as she said nothing in opposition mr redwood unfastened the strings and unrolled the bundle his eyes lighted up with satisfaction as he disclosed the contents a ladys cloak mrs mccarty looked surprised why its a ladys cloak she said and a very handsome one what would mr ropes want of such a thing as that perhaps he intended to make you a present of it no he cant afford to make such present the explanation is simple it belongs to the store perhaps mr ropes left it here inadvertently but he hasnt been here since morning he has a pass key to the front door yes sir then he may have been here would you object to my taking it yes sir you see i dont know you your objection is a proper one then i will trouble you to take a look at the cloak so that you would know it again certainly sir i shall remember it that is all mrs mccarty sir mrs mccarty i wont take up any more of your time and mr redwood started to go down stairs who shall i tell mr ropes called to see him you neednt say i will mention the matter to him myself i am employed in the same store all right sir where is the store i never thought to ask mr ropes reade street near broadway you know where reade street is yes sir my husband used to work in chambers street that is the first street south precisely well i cant stay longer so i will leave apologizing for having taken up so much of your time oh its of no consequence sir he is a perfect gentleman she said to herself as mr redwood closed the front door and went out on the street i wonder whether hes a widower being a widow this was quite a natural thought for mrs mccarty to indulge in particularly as mr redwood looked to be a substantial man with a snug income mr redwood went back to the store and went at once to the office well redwood said mr goodnow did you learn anything yes sir go on i went to the lodging of young ropes and was admitted to his room well and there wrapped in a brown paper i found one of our missing cloaks lying on his bed is it possible i am afraid he is not what we supposed him to be mr goodnow it looks like it i am surprised and sorry do you think he took the other articles that are missing of course i cant say sir but it is fair to presume that he did i am exceedingly sorry i dont mind saying redwood that i took an especial interest in that boy i have already told you the circumstances of my meeting him and the fancy taken to him by my friend mulgrave yes sir i have heard you say that i dont think i am easily taken in and that boy impressed me as thoroughly honest but of course i dont pretend to be infallible and it appears that i have been mistaken in him the merchant looked troubled for he had come to feel a sincere regard for rodney he confessed to himself that he would rather have found any of the other clerks dishonest you may send ropes to me he said mr redwood and you will please come with him we will investigate this matter at once very well sir chapter xiii charged with theft rodney entered mr goodnows office without a suspicion of the serious accusation which had been made against him the first hint that there was anything wrong came to him when he saw the stern look in the merchants eyes perhaps said mr goodnow as he leaned back in his chair and fixed his gaze on the young clerk you may have an idea why i have sent for you no sir answered rodney looking puzzled you cant think of any reason i may have for wishing to see you no sir and rodney returned mr goodnows gaze with honest unfaltering eyes possibly you are not aware that within a few weeks some articles have been missed from our stock i have not heard of it what kind of articles the boy is more artful than i thought soliloquized the merchant all the articles missed he proceeded have been from the room in charge of mr redwood the room in which you among others are employed something in mr goodnows tone gave rodney the hint of the truth if he had been guilty he would have flushed and showed signs of confusion as it was he only wished to learn the truth and he in turn became the questioner is it supposed he asked that any one in your employ is responsible for these thefts it is is any one in particular suspected yes will you tell me who that is if you think i ought to know certainly you ought to know for it is you who are suspected then rodney became indignant i can only deny the charge in the most emphatic terms he said if any one has brought such a charge against me it is a lie you can say that to mr redwood for it is he who accuses you what does this mean mr redwood demanded rodney quickly what have you seen in me that leads you to accuse me of theft to tell the truth ropes you are about the last clerk in my room whom i would have suspected but early this morning this letter was received and he placed in rodneys hands the letter given in a preceding chapter rodney read it through and handed it back scornfully i should like to see the person who wrote this letter he said it is a base lie from beginning to end i thought it might be when mr goodnow showed it to me said redwood in an even tone but mr goodnow and i agreed that it would be well to investigate therefore i went to your room when sir this morning then it is all right for i am sure you found nothing on the contrary ropes i found that the statement made in the letter was true on your bed was a bundle containing one of the cloaks taken from our stock rodneys face was the picture of amazement is this true he said it certainly is i hope you dont doubt my word did you bring it back with you no your worthy landlady was not quite sure whether i was what i represented and i left the parcel there however i opened it in her presence so that she can testify what i found this is very strange said rodney looking at his accuser with puzzled eyes i know nothing whatever of the cloak and cant imagine how it got into my room perhaps it walked there said mr goodnow satirically rodney colored for he understood that his employer did not believe him may i go to my room he asked and bring back the bundle with me observing that mr goodnow hesitated he added you can send some one with me to see that i dont spirit away the parcel and come back with it on these conditions you may go redwood send some one with ropes rodney followed the chief of his department back to the cloak room and the latter after a moments thought summoned jasper jasper he said ropes is going to his room to get a parcel which belongs to the store you may go with him there was a flash of satisfaction in jaspers eyes as he answered with seeming indifference all right i will go i shall be glad to have a walk as the two boys passed out of the store jasper asked what does it mean ropes i dont know myself i only know that there is said to be a parcel containing a cloak in my room this cloak came from the store and i am suspected of having stolen it whew thats a serious matter of course it is all a mistake yes it is all a mistake but how could it get to your room unless you carried it there rodney gave jasper a sharp look some one must have taken it there he said how on earth did uncle james find out an anonymous letter was sent to mr goodnow charging me with theft did you hear that articles have been missed for some time from the stock never heard a word of it said jasper with ready falsehood it seems the articles are missing from our room and some one in the room is suspected of being the thief good gracious i hope no one will suspect me said jasper in pretended alarm it seems i am suspected i hope no other innocent person will have a like misfortune presently they reached rodneys lodgings mrs mccarty was coming up the basement stairs as they entered la mr ropes she said what brings you here in the middle of the day i hear there is a parcel in my room yes it contains such a lovely cloak the gentleman from your store who called a little while ago thought you might have meant it as a present for me i am afraid it will be some time before i can afford to make such present do you know if any one called and left the cloak here no i didnt let in no one at the door was the parcel there when you made the bed well no it wasnt that is curious it shows that the parcel has been left here since now i certainly couldnt have left it for i have been at work all the morning come up stairs jasper the two boys went up the stairs and entering rodneys room found the parcel still on the bed rodney opened it and identified the cloak as exactly like those which they carried in stock he examined the paper in which it was inclosed but it seemed to differ from the wrapping paper used at the store he called jaspers attention to this i have nothing to say remarked jasper shrugging his shoulders i dont understand the matter at all i suppose you are expected to carry the cloak back to the store yes that is the only thing to do i say ropes it looks pretty bad for you jasper said this but rodney observed that his words were not accompanied by any expressions of sympathy or any words that indicated his disbelief of rodneys guilt do you think i took this cloak from the store he demanded facing round upon jasper really i dont know it looks bad finding it in your room i neednt ask any further i can see what you think you wouldnt have me tell a lie would you ropes of course such things have been done before and your salary is small you insult me by your words said rodney flaming up then i had better not speak but you asked me you know yes i did things may look against me but i am absolutely innocent if you can make mr goodnow think so said jasper with provoking coolness it will be all right perhaps he will forgive you i dont want his forgiveness i want him to think me honest well i hope you are i am sure but it wont do any good our discussing it and it doesnt make any difference what i think any way by this time they had reached the store chapter xiv rodney is discharged rodney reported his return to mr redwood and in his company went down stairs to the office with the package under his arm well said mr goodnow inquiringly this is the package sir and it was found in your room yes sir i found it on my bed cant you account for it being there asked the merchant searchingly no sir you must admit that its presence in your room looks bad for you i admit it sir but i had nothing to do with it being there have you any theory to account for it only this that some one must have carried it to my room and placed it where it was found did you question your landlady as to whether she had admitted any one during the morning yes sir she had not this is very unfavorable to you in what way sir it makes it probable that you carried in the parcel yourself that i deny said rodney boldly i expected you to deny it said the merchant coldly if this cloak were the only one that had been taken i would drop the matter but this is by no means the case mr redwood can you give any idea of the extent to which we have been robbed so far as i can estimate we have lost a dozen cloaks and about half a dozen dress patterns this is a serious loss ropes said mr goodnow i should think it would foot up several hundred dollars if you can throw any light upon the thefts or give me information by which i can get back the goods even at considerable expense i will be as considerate with you as i can mr goodnow returned rodney hotly i know no more about the matter than you do i hope you will investigate and if you can prove that i took any of the missing articles i want no consideration i shall expect you to have me arrested and if convicted punished these are brave words ropes said mr goodnow coldly but they are only words the parcel found in your room affords strong ground for suspicion that you are responsible for at least a part of the thefts under the circumstances there is only one thing for me to do and that is to discharge you very well sir you may go to the cashier and he will pay you to the end of the week but your connection with the store will end at once i dont care to be paid to the end of the week sir if you will give me an order for payment up to tonight that will be sufficient it shall be as you say mr goodnow wrote a few words on a slip of paper and handed it to rodney i will leave my address sir and if i change it i will notify you if you should hear anything as to the real robber i will ask you as a favor to communicate with me mr redwood you have heard the request of ropes i will look to you to comply with it very well sir the merchant turned back to his letters and rodney left the office with what feelings of sorrow and humiliation may be imagined i am sorry for this occurrence ropes said mr redwood with a touch of sympathy in his voice do you believe me guilty mr redwood i cannot do otherwise i hope you are innocent and if so that the really guilty party will be discovered sooner or later thank you sir when they entered the room in which rodney had been employed jasper came up his face alive with curiosity well he said how did you come out i am discharged said rodney bitterly well you couldnt complain of that things looked pretty dark for you if i had committed the theft i would not complain indeed i would submit to punishment without a murmur but it is hard to suffer while innocent uncle james said jasper if ropes is going will you ask mr goodnow to put me in his place even mr redwood was disgusted by this untimely request it would be more becoming he said sharply if you would wait till ropes was fairly out of the store before applying for his position i want to be in time i dont want any one to get ahead of me james redwood did not deign a reply i am sorry you leave us under such circumstances ropes he said the time may come when you will be able to establish your innocence and in that case mr goodnow will probably take you back again rodney did not answer but with his order went to the cashiers desk and received the four dollars due him then with a heavy heart he left the store where it had been such a satisfaction to him to work on broadway he met his room mate mike flynn in the uniform of a telegraph boy where are you goin rodney asked mike you aint let off so early are you i am let off for good and all mike whats that i am discharged what for asked mike in amazement i will tell you when you get home tonight rodney went back to his room and lay down sad and despondent some hours later mike came in and was told the story the warm hearted telegraph boy was very angry that boss of yours must be a stupid donkey he said i dont know the parcel was found in my room anybodyd know to look at you that you wouldnt steal some thieves look very innocent the only way to clear me is to find out who left the bundle at the house doesnt mrs mccarty know anything about it no i asked her some one might have got into the house without her knowing anything about it the lock is a very common one there are plenty of keys that will open it if we could find some one that saw a person with a bundle go up the steps that would give us a clew thats so well ask but for several days no one could be found who had seen any such person meanwhile rodney was at a loss what to do he was cut off from applying for another place for no one would engage him if he were refused a recommendation from his late employer yet he must obtain some employment for he could not live on nothing do you think mike he asked doubtfully that i could make anything selling papers such business isnt for you answered the telegraph boy but it is one of the few things open to me i can become a newsboy without recommendations even your business would be closed to me if it were known that i was suspected of theft thats so said mike scratching his head in perplexity then would you recommend my becoming a newsboy i dont know you couldnt make moren fifty or sixty cent a day that will be better than nothing and i can pay the rent or most of it as ill be doin better than you we will wait and see how much i make so rodney swallowed his pride and procuring a supply of afternoon papers set about selling them he knew that it was an honest business and there was no disgrace in following it but one day he was subjected to keen mortification jasper redwood and a friend it was philip carton his confederate were walking along broadway and their glances fell on rodney i say jasper said the elder of the two isnt that the boy who was in the same store with you jasper looked and his eyes lighted up with malicious satisfaction oho he said well this is rich give me a paper boy he said pretending not to recognize rodney at first why its ropes yes answered rodney his cheek flushing you see what i am reduced to what paper will you buy the mail and express here it is cant you get another place asked jasper curiously i might if i could get a recommendation but probably mr goodnow wouldnt give me one no i guess not so i must take what i can get do you make much selling papers very little you cant make as much as you did in the store not much more than half as much do you live in the same place yes for the present oh by the way ropes ive got your old place said jasper in exultation i thought you would get it answered rodney not without a pang come into the store some day ropes it will seem like old times i shall not enter the store till i am able to clear myself of the charge made against me then probably you will stay away a long time i am afraid so well ta ta come along philip as rodney followed with his eye the figure of his complacent successor he felt that his fate was indeed a hard one chapter xv a rich find as jasper and his companion moved away carton said im sorry for that poor duffer jasper why should you be sorry asked jasper frowning because he has lost a good place and good prospects and all for no fault of his own you are getting sentimental philip sneered jasper no but i am showing a little humanity he has lost all this through you through us you mean well through us we have made him the scapegoat for our sins oh well he is making a living a pretty poor one i dont think you would like to be reduced to selling papers his case and mine are different i begin to think also that we have made a mistake in getting him discharged so soon we cant take anything more why not because there will be no one to lay the blame upon he is out of the store that is true i didnt think of that but i invited him to come around and call if he should and something else should be missing it would be laid to him i dont believe he will call i am terribly hard up and our source of income has failed us havent you got a dollar or two to spare no answered jasper coldly i only get seven dollars a week but you have nearly all that you only have to hand in two dollars a week to your uncle look here philip carton i hope you dont expect to live off me i have all i can do to take care of myself carton looked at jasper in anger and mortification i begin to understand how good a friend you are he said i am not fool enough to pinch myself to keep you said jasper bluntly you are a man of twenty five and i am only a boy you ought to be able to take care of yourself just give me a dollar or lend it jasper and i will risk it at play i may rise from the table with a hundred if i do i will pay you handsomely for the loan i couldnt do it mr carton i have only two dollars in my pocket and i have none to spare humph what is that philip cartons eyes were fixed upon the sidewalk there was a flimsy piece of paper fluttering about impelled by the wind he stooped and picked it up it is a five dollar bill he exclaimed in exultation my luck has come back jasper changed his tone at once now philip was the better off of the two that is luck he said shall we go into delmonicos and have an ice if it is at your expense yes that wouldnt be fair you have more money than i yes and i mean to keep it myself you have set me the example come philip you are not angry at my refusing you a loan no i think you were sensible i shall follow your example i will bid you good night i seem to be in luck and will try my fortune at the gaming table i will go with you no i would prefer to go alone that fellow is unreasonable muttered jasper as he strode off discontented did he expect i would divide my salary with him philip carton after he parted company with jasper walked back to where rodney was still selling papers give me a paper he said which will you have i am not particular give me the first that comes handy ah the evening sun will do he took the paper and put a quarter into rodneys hand as he was walking away rodney called out stop heres your change never mind said philip with a wave of the hand thank you said rodney gratefully for twenty five cents was no trifle to him at this time that ought to bring me luck soliloquized philip carton as he walked on it isnt often i do a good deed it was all the money i had besides the five dollar bill and i am sure the news boy will make better use of it than i would that was the young man that was walking with jasper reflected rodney well he is certainly a better fellow than he thanks to this quarter i shall have made eighty cents today and still have half a dozen papers that is encouraging several days passed that could not be considered lucky rodneys average profits were only about fifty cent a day and that was barely sufficient to buy his meals it left him nothing to put towards paying room rent he began to consider whether he would not be compelled to pawn some article from his wardrobe for he was well supplied with clothing when he had a stroke of luck on fifteenth street by the side of tiffanys great jewelry store he picked up a square box neatly done up in thin paper opening it he was dazzled by the gleam of diamonds the contents were a diamond necklace and pin which even to rodneys inexperienced eyes seemed to be of great value some one must have dropped them in coming from the jewelry store he reflected who can it be he had not far to seek there was a card inside on which was engraved mrs eliza harvey with an address on fifth avenue passing through to fifth avenue rodney began to scan the numbers on the nearest houses he judged that mrs harvey must live considerably farther up the avenue in the direction of central park i will go there at once rodney decided no doubt mrs harvey is very much distressed by her loss i shall carry her good news the house he found to be between fortieth and fiftieth street ascending the steps he rang the bell the door was opened by a man servant does mrs harvey live here asked rodney what do you want with her young man demanded the servant in a tone of importance that i will tell her whats your name i can give you my name but she wont recognize it then you dont know her no if its money you want she dont give to beggars you are impudent said rodney hotly if you dont give my message you will get into trouble the servant opened his eyes he seemed somewhat impressed by rodneys confident tone mrs harvey doesnt live here he said is she in the house well yes shes visiting here then why do you waste your time said rodney impatiently he forgot for the time that he was no longer being educated at an expensive boarding school and spoke in the tone he would have used before his circumstances had changed ill go and ask if shell see you said the flunky unwillingly five minutes later a pleasant looking woman of middle age descended the staircase are you the boy that wished to see me she asked yes if you are mrs harvey i am but come in thomas why didnt you invite this young gentleman into the parlor thomas opened his eyes wide so the boy whom he had treated so cavalierly was a young gentleman he privately put down mrs harvey in his own mind as eccentric excuse me maam he said i didnt know as he was parlor company well he is said mrs harvey with a cordial smile that won rodneys heart follow me said the lady rodney followed her into a handsome apartment and at a signal seated himself on a sofa now she said i am ready to listen to your message have you lost anything asked rodney abruptly oh have you found it exclaimed mrs harvey clasping her hands that depends on what you have lost answered rodney who felt that it was necessary to be cautious certainly you are quite right i have lost a box containing jewelry bought this morning at tiffanys what were the articles a diamond necklace and pin they are intended as a present for my daughter who is to be married tell me quick have you found them is this the box asked rodney oh yes yes how delightful to recover it i thought i should never see it again where did you find it on fifteenth street beside tiffanys store and you brought it directly to me yes madam have you any idea of the value of the articles perhaps they may be worth five hundred dollars they are worth over a thousand are you poor yes madam i am trying to make a living by selling papers but find it hard work but you dont look like a newsboy till a short time since i thought myself moderately rich that is strange tell me your story chapter xvi a surprising turn of fortune rodney told his story frankly mrs harvey was very sympathetic by nature and she listened with the deepest interest and latterly with indignation when rodney spoke of his dismissal from mr goodnows store you have been treated shamefully she said warmly i think mr goodnow really believes me guilty rejoined rodney a dishonest boy would hardly have returned a valuable box of jewelry still mr goodnow didnt know that i would do it i see you are disposed to apologize for your late employer i do not forget that he treated me kindly till this last occurrence your consideration does you credit so you have really been reduced to earn your living as a newsboy yes madam i must think what i can do for you i might give you money but when that was gone you would be no better off i would much rather have help in getting a place mrs harvey leaned her head on her hand and looked thoughtful you are right she said let me think rodney waited hoping that the lady would be able to think of something to his advantage finally she spoke i think you said you understood latin and greek i have studied both languages and french also i should have been ready to enter college next summer then perhaps i shall be able to do something for you i live in philadelphia but i have a brother living in west fifty eighth street he has one little boy arthur now nine years of age arthur is quite precocious but his health is delicate and my brother has thought of getting a private instructor for him do you like young children very much i always wished that i had a little brother then i think you would suit my brother better as a tutor for arthur than a young man being a boy yourself you would be not only tutor but companion i should like such a position very much then wait here a moment and i will write you a letter of introduction she went up stairs but soon returned she put a small perfumed billet into rodneys hands it was directed to john sargent with an address on west fifty eighth street call this evening she said about half past seven oclock my brother will be through dinner and will not have gone out at that hour thank you said rodney gratefully here is another envelope which you can open at your leisure i cannot part from you without thanking you once more for returning my jewelry you have thanked me in a very practical way mrs harvey i hope my letter may lead to pleasant results for you if you ever come to philadelphia call upon me at no walnut street thank you as rodney left the house he felt that his ill fortune had turned and that a new prospect was opened up before him he stepped into the windsor hotel and opened the envelope last given him it contained five five dollar bills to one of them was pinned a scrap of paper containing these words i hope this money will be useful to you it is less than the reward i should have offered for the recovery of the jewels under the circumstances rodney felt that he need not scruple to use the money he knew that he had rendered mrs harvey a great service and that she could well afford to pay him the sum which the envelopes contained he began to be sensible that he was hungry not having eaten for some time he went into a restaurant on sixth avenue and ordered a sirloin steak it was some time since he had indulged in anything beyond a common steak and he greatly enjoyed the more luxurious meal he didnt go back to selling papers for he felt that it would hardly be consistent with the position of a classical teacher the post for which he was about to apply half past seven found him at the door of mr john sargent the house was of brown stone high stoop and four stories in height it was such a house as only a rich man could occupy he was ushered into the parlor and presently mr sargent came in from the dining room are you mr ropes he asked looking at rodneys card it is not usual for newsboys to carry cards but rodney had some left over from his more prosperous days yes sir i bring you a note of introduction from mrs harvey ah yes my sister let me see it the note was of some length that is it covered three pages of note paper mr sargent read it attentively my sister recommends you as tutor for my little son arthur he said as he folded up the letter yes sir she suggested that i might perhaps suit you in that capacity she also says that you found and restored to her a valuable box of jewelry which she was careless enough to drop near tiffanys yes sir i have a good deal of confidence in my sisters good judgment she evidently regards you very favorably i am glad of that sir will you tell me something of your qualifications arthur is about to commence latin he is not old enough for greek i could teach either sir and of course you are well up in english branches i think i am my sister hints that you are poor and obliged to earn your own living how then have you been able to secure so good an education i have only been poor for a short time my father left me fifty thousand dollars but it was lost by my guardian who was your guardian mr benjamin fielding i knew him well i dont think he was an unprincipled man but he was certainly imprudent and was led into acts that were reprehensible did he lose all your money for you yes sir what did you do left the boarding school where i was being educated and came to this city did you obtain any employment yes sir i have been employed for a short time by otis goodnow a merchant of reade street and why did you leave because mr goodnow missed some articles from his stock and i was charged with taking them rodney was fearful of the effect of his frank confession upon mr sargent but the latter soon reassured him your honesty in restoring my sisters jewelry is sufficient proof that the charge was unfounded i shall not let it influence me thank you sir now as to the position of teacher though very young i dont see why you should not fill it satisfactorily i will call arthur he went to the door and called arthur a delicate looking boy with a sweet intelligent face came running into the room do you want me papa yes arthur i have a new friend for you will you shake hands with him arthur who was not a shy boy went up at once to rodney and offered his hand i am glad to see you he said rodney smiled he was quite taken with the young boy whats your name the latter asked rodney ropes are you going to stay and make us a visit mr sargent answered this question would you like to have rodney stay he asked oh yes how would you like to have him give you lessons in latin and other studies i should like it i am sure he wouldnt be cross are you a teacher rodney i will be your teacher if you are willing to have me yes i should like it and will you go to walk with me in central park yes then papa you may as well engage him i was afraid you would get a tiresome old man for my teacher that settles it rodney said mr sargent smiling now arthur run out and i will speak further with rodney about you all right papa as arthur seems to like you i will give you a trial as he suggested i should like to have you become his companion as well as teacher you will come here at nine oclock in the morning and stay till four taking lunch with your pupil about the compensation will you tell me what will be satisfactory to you i prefer to leave that to you sir then we will say fifteen dollars a week today is thursday will you present yourself here next monday morning yes sir if you would like an advance of salary you need only say so thank you sir but i am fairly provided with money for the present then nothing more need be said as i am to meet a gentleman at the union league club tonight i will bid you good evening and expect to see you on monday rodney rose and mr sargent accompanied him to the door shaking hands with him courteously by way of farewell rodney emerged into the street in a state of joyous excitement twenty five dollars in his pocket and fifteen dollars a week he could hardly credit his good fortune chapter xvii jaspers perplexity mike flynn was overjoyed to hear of rodneys good fortune fifteen dollars a week he repeated why you will be rich not exactly that mike but it will make me comfortable by the way as i have so much more than you it will only be fair for me to pay the whole rent no rodney you mustnt do that i shall insist upon it mike you would do the same in my place yes i would so you cant object to my doing it you are very kind to me rodney said mike who had the warm heart of his race it isnt every boy brought up like you who would be willing to room with a bootblack but you are not a bootblack now you are a telegraph boy there are plenty that mind me when i blacked boots down in front of the astor house you are just as good a boy for all that how much did you make last week four dollars salary and a dollar and a half in extra tips hereafter you must save your rent money for clothes we must have you looking respectable wont you adopt me rodney asked mike with a laughing face thats a good idea perhaps i will in that case you must obey all my orders in the first place what are you most in want in the way of clothing i havent got but two shirts that is hardly enough for a gentleman of your social position anything else im short on collars and socks then well go out shopping ill buy you a supply of each but you havent begun to work yet no but mrs harvey made me a present of twenty five dollars well go to some of the big stores on sixth avenue where we can get furnishing goods cheap rodney carried out his purpose and at the cost of four dollars supplied his room mate with all he needed for the present see what it is to be rich mike he said it seems odd for me to be buying clothes for my adopted son youre in luck rodney and so am i i hope some time i can do you a favor perhaps you can mike if i should get sick you might take my place as tutor you must know an awful lot rodney said mike regarding his companion with new respect thank you for the compliment mike i hope mr sargent will have the same opinion the next day it is needless to say that rodney did not resume the business of newsboy he was very glad to give it up he dressed with unusual care and took a walk down town as he passed reade street by chance jasper was coming around the corner his face lighted up first with pleasure at seeing rodney for it gratified his mean nature to triumph over the boy whom he had ousted from his position and next with surprise at his unusually neat and well dressed appearance rodney looked far from needing help he might readily have been taken for a boy of aristocratic lineage hallo said jasper surveying rodney curiously how are you this morning jasper returned rodney quietly why aint you selling papers i dont like the business but youve got to make a living quite true are you going to black boots why should i is it a desirable business how should i know asked jasper coloring i didnt know but you might have had some experience at it i havent do you mean to insult me demanded jasper hotly i never insult anybody i will only say that you are as likely to take up the business as i ive got a place how do you know but i have because you were selling papers yesterday and are walking the street today that is true but i have a place engaged for all that i shall go to work on monday jasper pricked up his ears where is it he asked i dont care to tell at present is it true have you got a place yes i dont see how you could mr goodnow wouldnt give you a recommendation there is no reason why he should not what after your taking cloaks and dress patterns from the store i did nothing of the kind sooner or later mr goodnow will find out his mistake probably the real thief is still in his employ jasper turned pale and regarded rodney searchingly but there was nothing in his manner or expression to indicate that his remark had been personal he thought it best to turn the conversation how much pay do you get four dollars more than that you dont get as much as you did at our store yes i get more now it was jaspers turn to show surprise he did not know whether to believe rodney or not but there was something in his face which commanded belief how much do you get he asked you would not believe me if i told you try me returned jasper whose curiosity was aroused i am to get fifteen dollars a week jasper would not have looked more surprised if rodney had informed him that he was to become a cabinet minister youre joking he ejaculated not at all how could you have the face to ask such a price did you pass yourself off as an experienced salesman no i dont understand it at all that is if you are telling the truth i have told you the truth jasper i have no object in deceiving you the salary was fixed by my employer who did you say it was i didnt say jaspers cunning scheme was defeated he felt disturbed to hear of rodneys good fortune but he had a shot in reserve i dont think you will keep your place long he said in a malicious tone why not your employer will hear under what circumstances you left our store and then of course he will discharge you you will be sorry for that wont you asked rodney pointedly why of course i dont want you to have bad luck thank you you are very considerate suppose you lose your place shall you go back to selling papers i hope to find something better to do where are you going now to get some lunch so am i suppose we go together very well providing you will lunch with me i dont want to impose upon you you wont we may not meet again for some time and we shall have this meal to remind us of each other they went to a well known restaurant on park row rodney ordered a liberal dinner for himself and jasper followed his example nothing loath he was always ready to dine at the expense of others but even as he ate he could not help wondering at the strange chance that had made him the guest of a boy who was selling papers the day before he had nearly finished eating when a disturbing thought occurred to him suppose rodney didnt have money enough to settle the bill and threw it upon him when rodney took the checks and walked up to the cashiers desk he followed him with some anxiety but his companion quietly took out a five dollar bill from his pocket and tendered it to the cashier the latter gave him back the right change and the two boys went out into the street you seem to have plenty of money said jasper there are very few who would admit having that smiled rodney i dont see why you sold papers if you have five dollar bills in your pocket i dont want to be idle may i tell my uncle and mr goodnow that you have got a place if you like well good by i must be hurrying back to the store rodney smiled he rather enjoyed jaspers surprise and perplexity chapter xviii rodneys secret is discovered jasper lost no time in acquainting his uncle with rodneys extraordinary good fortune james redwood was surprised but not all together incredulous i dont understand it he said but ropes appears to be a boy of truth perhaps he may have exaggerated the amount of his salary i hardly think so uncle he gave me a tip top dinner down on park row he may have been in funds from selling the articles taken from the store thats so assented jasper who had the best possible reason for knowing that it was not so i wish the boy well said his uncle he always treated me respectfully and i never had anything against him except the loss of stock and it is not certain that he is the thief i guess there isnt any doubt about that yet believing him to be a thief you did not hesitate to accept a dinner from him i didnt want to hurt his feelings replied jasper rather sheepishly do you know what sort of a place he has got or with what house no he wouldnt tell me he thought perhaps you would inform the new firm of the circumstances under which he left us i dont blame him but i am surprised that he should have been engaged without a recommendation shall you tell mr goodnow not unless he asks about ropes i dont want to interfere with the boy in any way in the store as has already been stated jasper succeeded to rodneys place and in consequence his pay was raised to seven dollars a week still it was not equal to what it had been when he was receiving additional money from the sale of the articles stolen by philip carton and himself the way in which they had operated was this philip would come in and buy a cloak or a dress pattern from jasper and the young salesman would pack up two or three instead of one there was a drawback to the profit in those cases as carton would be obliged to sell both at a reduced price still they had made a considerable sum from these transactions though not nearly as much as mr goodnow had lost after the discovery of the theft and the discharge of rodney the two confederates felt that it would be imprudent to do any more in that line this suspension entailed heavier loss on carton than on jasper the latter had a fixed income and a home at his uncles house while philip had no regular income though he occasionally secured a little temporary employment in the meantime rodney had commenced his tutorship his young pupil became very fond of him and being a studious boy made rapid progress in his lessons mr sargent felt that his experiment rash as it might be considered vindicated his wisdom by its success at the end of a month he voluntarily raised rodneys salary to twenty dollars a week i am afraid you are overpaying me mr sargent said rodney thats my lookout good service is worth a good salary and i am perfectly satisfied with you thank you sir i prize that even more than the higher salary only a portion of rodneys time was spent in teaching in the afternoon he and his charge went on little excursions generally to central park one holiday about four months after the commencement of rodneys engagement he was walking in the park when he fell in with jasper jaspers attention was at once drawn to the little boy whose dress and general appearance indicated that he belonged to a wealthy family this excited jaspers curiosity how are you rodney said jasper adroitly it is a good while since i met you yes who is the little boy with you his name is arthur sargent rodney gave this information unwillingly for he saw that his secret was likely to be discovered how do you do arthur asked jasper with unwonted affability for he did not care for children pretty well answered arthur politely have you known rodney long why he is my teacher answered arthur in some surprise jaspers eyes gleamed with sudden intelligence so this was rodneys secret and this was the position for which he was so well paid rodney bit his lip in vexation but made no remark does he ever punish you for not getting your lessons asked jasper without much tact of course not answered arthur indignantly arthur always does get his lessons said rodney i suppose you have a holiday from work today jasper yes i am glad to get away now and then i must bid you good morning now wont you let me call on you where do you live arthur the boy gave the number of his house jasper asked arthur thinking rightly that he would be more likely to get an answer from him than from rodney he walked away triumphantly feeling that he had made a discovery that might prove of advantage to him is that a friend of yours rodney asked little arthur i have known him for some time i dont like him very much why asked rodney with some curiosity i dont know answered the little boy slowly i cant like everybody quite true arthur jasper is not a special friend of mine and i am not particular about your liking him i hope you like me you know i do rodney and he gave rodneys hand an assuring pressure ten minutes after he left rodney jasper fell in with carton the intimacy between them had perceptibly fallen off it had grown out of business considerations now that it was no longer safe to abstract articles from the store jasper felt that he had no more use for his late confederate when they met he treated him with marked coldness on this particular day carton was looking quite shabby in fact his best suit was in pawn and he had fallen back on one half worn and soiled hello exclaimed jasper and was about to pass on with a cool nod stop said philip looking offended i am in a hurry returned jasper i cant stop today you are in a hurry and on a holiday yes i am to meet a friend near the lake ill go along with you jasper had to submit though with an ill grace wouldnt another day do no the fact is jasper i am in trouble you usually are sneered jasper that is so i have been out of luck lately i am sorry but i cant help it as i see how much money do you think i have in my pocket i dont know i am sure i am not good at guessing conundrums just ten cents that isnt much said jasper indifferently let me have a dollar thats a good fellow you seem to think i am made of money said jasper sharply i havent got much more myself then you might have you get a good salary only seven dollars you are able to keep most of it for yourself suppose i am you seem to know a good deal of my affairs havent you any pity for an old friend yes ill give you all the pity you want but when it comes to money its a different matter here you are a man of twenty six ten years older than me and yet you expect me to help support you you didnt use to talk to me like that well i do now you didnt use to try to get money out of me look here jasper i am poor but i dont want you to talk to me as you are doing indeed sneered jasper and i wont have it said carton firmly listen to me and i will propose a plan that will help us both what is it you can easily secrete articles if you are cautious without attracting notice and i will dispose of them and share the money with you jasper shook his head i wouldnt dare to do it he said somebody might spy on me not if you are careful if it were found out i would be bounced like ropes what is he doing have you seen him lately he is getting on finely he is earning fifteen dollars a week you dont mean it yes i do what firm is he working for for none at all he is tutor to a young kid i didnt know he was scholar enough oh yes he knows greek and latin and a lot of other stuff who is the boy i dont feel at liberty to tell i dont think he would care to have you know ill tell you what you can do borrow five dollars of him for me i dont know about that if i were to borrow it would be for myself you can do as you please if you dont do something for me i will write to mr goodnow that you are the thief who stole the cloaks and dress patterns you wouldnt do that exclaimed jasper in consternation wouldnt i i am desperate enough to do anything after a little further conference jasper agreed to do what was asked of him he did not dare to refuse chapter xix jaspers revenge rodney was considerably surprised one evening to receive a call from jasper in his room he was alone as mike had been detailed about a week ago for night duty the room looked more attractive than formerly rodney had bought a writing desk which stood in the corner and had put up three pictures which though cheap were attractive good evening jasper he said it is quite friendly of you to call i hadnt anything else on hand this evening and thought i would come round see how you were getting along take a seat and make yourself at home do you object to cigarettes asked jasper producing one from a case in his pocket i object to smoking them myself but i dont want to dictate to my friends you look quite comfortable here continued jasper in a patronizing tone we try to be comfortable though our room is not luxurious who do you mean by we have you a room mate yes mike flynn rooms with me who is he a newsboy no he is a telegraph boy you dont seem to very particular said jasper shrugging his shoulders i am very particular yet you room with an irish telegraph boy he is a nice boy of good habit and a devoted friend what could i want more oh well you have a right to consult your own taste you have a nice home no doubt i live with my uncle yes he has a good house but i am not so independent as if i had a room outide how are things going on at the store about the same as usual why dont you come in some day for two reasons i am occupied during the day and i dont want to go where i am considered a thief i wish i was getting your income it is hard to get along on seven dollars a week still you have a nice home and i suppose you have most of your salary to yourself yes but there isnt much margin in seven dollars my uncle expects me to buy my own clothes you were lucky to get out of the store old goodnow ought to give me ten dollars dont let him hear you speak of him as old goodnow jasper oh im smart enough for that i mean to keep on the right side of the old chap what sort of a man are you working for mr sargent is a fine man he isnt mean certainly i should like to be in your shoes if i hear of any similar position shall i mention your name asked rodney smiling no i could not take care of a kid i hate them still arthur is a nice boy you are welcome to him what do you have to teach he is studying latin and french besides english branches i know about as much of latin and french as a cow i couldnt be a teacher i say rodney and jasper cleared his throat i want you to do me a favor what is it i want you to lend me ten dollars rodney was not mean but he knew very well that a loan to jasper would be a permanent one had jasper been his friend even this consideration would not have inspired a refusal but he knew very well that jasper had not a particle of regard for him i dont think i can oblige you jasper he said why not you get fifteen dollars a week my expenses are considerable besides i am helping mike whose salary is very small i pay the whole of the rent and i have paid for some clothes for him you are spending your money very foolishly said jasper frowning would i spend it any less foolishly if i should lend you ten dollars there is some difference between mike flynn and me i am a gentleman so is mike a queer sort of gentleman he is only a poor telegraph boy still he is a gentleman i should think you might have money enough for both of us i might but i want to save something from my salary i dont know how long i shall be earning as much i might lose my place so you might and i could hardly expect to get another where the pay would be as good i would pay you on installment a dollar a week urged jasper i dont see how you could as you say your pay is too small for you now oh well i could manage i am afraid i cant oblige you jasper said rodney in a decided tone i didnt think you were so miserly answered jasper in vexation you may call it so if you like you must remember that i am not situated like you you have your uncle to fall back upon in case you lose your position but i have no one i have to hustle for myself oh you neednt make any more excuses i suppose ten dollars is rather a large sum to lend can you lend me five i am sorry but i must refuse you jasper rose from the chair on which he had been sitting then i may as well go he said i am disappointed in you ropes i thought you were a good whole souled fellow and not a miser you must think of me as you please jasper i feel that i have a right to regulate my own affairs all i have to say is this if you lose your place as you may very soon dont come round to the store and expect to be taken back i wont answered rodney smiling i wouldnt go back at any rate unless the charge of theft was withdrawn that will never be let it be so as long as i am innocent jasper left the room abruptly not even having the politeness to bid rodney good evening rodney felt that he was quite justified in refusing to lend jasper money had he been in need he would have obliged him though he had no reason to look upon him as a friend no one who knew rodney could regard him as mean or miserly could he have read jaspers thoughts as he left the house he would have felt even less regret at disappointing him about two days afterward when rodney went up to meet his pupil mr sargent handed him a letter here is something that concerns you rodney he said it doesnt appear to be from a friend of yours with some curiosity rodney took the letter and read it it ran thus mr john sargent dear sir i think it my duty to write and tell you something about your sons tutor something that will surprise and shock you before he entered your house he was employed by a firm on reade street he was quite a favorite with his employer mr otis goodnow who promoted him in a short time all at once it was found that articles were missing from the stock of course it was evident that some one of the clerks was dishonest a watch was set and finally it was found that rodney ropes had taken the articles and one a ladys cloak was found in his room by a detective he was discharged at once without a recommendation for a time he lived by selling papers but at last he managed to get into your house i am sure you wont regard him as fit to educate your little son though i have no doubt he is a good scholar but his character is bad i dont think he ought to have concealed this from you out of friendship for you and because i think it is my duty i take the liberty of writing if you doubt this i will refer to mr goodnow or mr james redwood who had charge of the room in which ropes was employed yours very respectfully a friend you knew all this before mr sargent said rodney as he handed back the letter yes have you any idea who wrote it i feel quite sure that it was a boy about two years older than myself jasper redwood is he related to the man of the same name whom he mentions yes he is his nephew has he any particular reason for disliking you rodney yes sir he came round to my room wednesday evening and asked me to lend him ten dollars i presume you refused yes sir he is not in need he succeeded to my place and he has a home at the house of his uncle he appears to be a very mean boy anonymous letters are always cowardly and generally malicious this seems to be no exception to the general rule i hope it wont affect your feelings towards me mr sargent dont trouble yourself about that rodney i am not so easily prejudiced against one of whom i have a good opinion i suppose this is jaspers revenge thought rodney chapter xx rodney loses his pupil jasper had little doubt that his letter would lead to rodneys loss of position it was certainly a mean thing to plot anothers downfall but jasper was quite capable of it had he secured the loan he asked he would have been willing to leave rodney alone but it would only have been the first of a series of similar applications it was several days before jasper had an opportunity of learning whether his malicious plan had succeeded or not on sunday forenoon he met rodney on fifth avenue just as the church services were over he crossed the street and accosted the boy he had tried to injure good morning ropes he said examining rodneys face curiously to see whether it indicated trouble of any kind good morning responded rodney coolly how are you getting along in your place very well thank you shall i find you at your pupils house if i call there some afternoon yes unless i am out walking with arthur i wonder whether hes bluffing thought jasper i daresay he wouldnt tell me if he had been discharged he takes it pretty coolly how long do you think your engagement will last he asked i dont know i never had a talk with mr sargent on that point do you still give satisfaction rodney penetrated jaspers motives for asking all these questions and was amused i presume if i fail to satisfy mr sargent he will tell me so it would be a nice thing if you could stay there three or four years yes but i dont anticipate it when arthur get a little older he will be sent to school what will you do then i havent got so far as that i cant get anything out of him said jasper to himself i shouldnt be a bit surprised if he were already discharged they had now reached madison square and jasper left rodney the latter looked after him with a smile i think i have puzzled jasper he said to himself he was anxious to know how his scheme had worked he will have to wait a little longer if mr sargent keeps ropes after my letter he must be a fool jasper decided i wonder if ropes handles the mail he might have suppressed the letter but rodney was not familiar with his handwriting and would have no reason to suspect that the particular letter contained anything likely to injure him in the eyes of mr sargent later in his walk jasper met philip carton his former friend was sitting on a bench in madison square he called out to jasper as he passed come here jasper i want to talk with you jasper looked at him in a manner far from friendly i am in a hurry he said what hurry can you be in come and sit down here i must speak to you jasper did not like his tone but it impressed him and he did not dare to refuse he seated himself beside philip but looked at him askance carton was undeniably shabby he had the look of a man who was going down hill and that rapidly i shall be late for dinner grumbled jasper i wish i had any dinner to look forward to said carton do you see this money and he produced a nickel from his pocket what is there remarkable about it it is the last money i have it wont buy me a dinner i am sorry but it is none of my business said jasper coolly you are old enough to attend to your own affairs and i once thought you were my friend murmured philip bitterly yes we were friends in a way now you are up and i am down jasper i want a dollar i dare say you do plenty want that i want it from you i cant spare it you can spare it better than you can spare your situation what do you mean by that asked jasper growing nervous ill tell you what i mean how long do you think you would stay in the store if mr goodnow knew that you were concerned in the theft from which he has suffered was i the only one no i am equally guilty i am glad you acknowledge it you see you had better keep quiet for your own sake if i keep quiet i shall starve do you want to go to prison i shouldnt mind so much if you went along too are you crazy philip carton no i am not but i am beginning to get sensible if i go to prison i shall at least have enough to eat and now i havent what do you mean by all this foolish talk i mean that if you wont give me any money i will go to the store and tell mr goodnow something that will surprise him jasper was getting thoroughly frightened come philip he said listen to reason you know how poor i am no doubt i know you have a good home and enough to eat i only get seven dollars a week and i get nothing i have already been trying to help you i went to ropes the other day and asked him to lend me five dollars i meant it for you did he give it to you he wouldnt give me a cent he is mean and miserly i dont know he knows very well that you are no friend of his though he doesnt know how much harm you have done him hes rolling in money however ive put a spoke in his wheel i hope how i wrote an anonymous letter to mr sargent telling him that ropes was discharged from the store on suspicion of theft you are a precious scamp jasper what do you mean you are not content with getting ropes discharged for something which you yourself did and you too and i too i accept the amendment not content with that you try to get him discharged from his present position then he might have lent me the money said jasper sullenly it wouldnt have been a loan it would have been a gift but no matter about that i want a dollar i cant give it to you then i shall call at the store tomorrow morning and tell mr goodnow about the stolen goods finding that carton was in earnest jasper finally but with great reluctance drew out a dollar and handed it to his companion there i hope that will satisfy you he said spitefully it will for the present i wish hed get run over or something thought jasper he seems to expect me to support him and that on seven dollars a week fortunately for jasper philip carton obtained employment the next day which lasted for some time and as he was paid ten dollars a week he was not under the necessity of troubling his old confederate for loans now and then jasper and rodney met but there were no cordial relations between them jasper could not forgive rodney for refusing to lend him money and rodney was not likely to forget the anonymous letter by which jasper had tried to injure him so three months passed one day mr sargent arrived at home before it was time for rodney to leave i am glad to see you rodney said his employer i have some news for you which i am afraid will not be entirely satisfactory to you what is it sir for the last three years i have been wishing to go to europe with my wife and arthur the plan has been delayed because i could not make satisfactory business arrangements now however that difficulty has been overcome and i propose to sail in about two weeks i hope youll enjoy your trip sir thank you of course it will terminate for a time at least your engagement to teach arthur i shall be sorry for that sir but i am not selfish enough to want you to stay at home on that account i thought you would feel that way i wish i could procure you another position before i go but that is uncertain i shall however pay you a months salary in advance in lieu of a notice that is very liberal sir i think it only just i have been very well pleased with your attention to arthur and i know he has profited by your instructions as well as enjoyed your companionship i hope you have been able to save something yes sir i have something in the union dime savings bank thats well you will remain with me one week longer but the last week arthur will need for preparations two weeks later rodney stood on the pier and watched the stately etruria steam out into the river arthur and his father were on deck and the little boy waved his handkerchief to his tutor as long as he could see him rodney turned away sadly i have lost a good situation he soliloquized when shall i get another chapter xxi continued ill luck rodney set himself to work searching for a new situation but wherever he called he found some one ahead of him at length he saw an advertisement for an entry clerk in a wholesale house in church street he applied and had the good fortune to please the superintendent where have you worked before he asked at otis goodnows on reade street how much were you paid there seven dollars a week very well we will start you on that salary and see if you earn it rodney was surprised and relieved to find that he was not asked for a recommendation from mr goodnow knowing that he could not obtain one he went to work on a monday morning and found his duties congenial and satisfactory seven dollars a week was small compared with what he had received as a tutor but he had about two hundred and fifty dollars in the union dime savings bank and drew three dollars from this fund every week in order that he might still assist mike whose earnings were small one of his new acquaintances in the store was james hicks a boy about a year older than himself didnt you use to work at otis goodnows asked james one day when they were going to lunch yes i know a boy employed there he is older than either of us who is it jasper redwood of course you know him yes answered rodney with a presentiment of evil he felt that it would be dangerous to have jasper know of his present position but did not venture to give a hint of this to james his fears were not groundless only the day after james met jasper on the street anything new asked jasper yes weve got one of your old friends in our store who is it rodney ropes jasper stopped short and whistled he was excessively surprised as he supposed rodney still to be arthur sargents tutor you dont mean it he ejaculated why not is there anything so strange about it yes did ropes bring a recommendation from mr goodnow i suppose so i dont know if he did its forged why should it be goodnow wouldnt give him a recommendation why wouldnt he because he discharged ropes do you want to know why yes for stealing articles from the store it was the turn of james hicks to be surprised i cant believe it he said its true just mention the matter to ropes and youll see he wont deny it i think there must be some mistake about it rodney doesnt look like a fellow that would steal oh you cant tell from appearances rogues are always plausible still mistakes are sometimes made id trust rodney ropes sooner than any boy i know you dont know him as well as i do you dont like him said james shrewdly no i dont i cant like a thief you talk as if you had a grudge against him nothing but his being a thief well what are you going to do about it about what what i have just told you i dont feel that i have any call to do anything you ought to tell your employer i am no telltale said james scornfully then you will let him stay in the store knowing him to be a thief i dont know him to be a thief if he steals anything it will probably be found out jasper urged james to give information about rodney but he steadily refused i leave others to do such dirty work he said and i dont think any better of you let me tell you for your eagerness to turn the boy out of his position you are a queer boy think so if you like retorted hicks i might give my opinion of you at this point jasper thought it best to let the conversation drop he was much pleased to learn that rodney had lost his fine position as tutor and was now in a place from which he might more easily be ousted as he could not prevail upon james hicks to betray rodney he decided to write an anonymous letter to the firm that employed him the result was that the next afternoon rodney was summoned to the office sit down ropes said the superintendent for what store did you work before you came into our house otis goodnows under what circumstances did you leave i was accused of theft you did not mention this matter when you applied for a situation here no sir i ought perhaps to have done so but i presumed in that case you would not have given me a place you are right he would not nor would i have applied had the charge been a true one articles were certainly missing from mr goodnows stock but in accusing me they did me a great injustice how long since you left mr goodnows four months what have you been doing since i was acting as tutor to the son of mr sargent of west fifty eighth street a well known citizen then you are a scholar yes sir i am nearly prepared for college of course he did not know you were suspected of dishonesty on the contrary he did know it i told him and later he received an anonymous letter notifying him of the fact we also have received an anonymous letter here it is do you recognize the hand writing yes answered rodney after examining the letter it was written by jasper redwood who is he a boy employed by mr goodnow for some reason he seems to have a spite against me i admit that it is pretty small business to write an anonymous letter calculated to injure another still we shall have to take notice of this yes sir i suppose so i shall have to bring it to the notice of the firm what they may do i dont know if the matter was to be decided by me i would let you stay thank you sir said rodney gratefully but i am not mr hall you can go now and i will see you again rodney left the office fully persuaded that his engagement would speedily terminate he was right the next day he was sent for again i am sorry to tell you ropes said the superintendent kindly that mr hall insists upon your being discharged he is a nervous man and rather suspicious i spoke in your favor but i could not turn him at any rate i am grateful to you for your friendly effort the superintendent hesitated a moment and then said will this discharge seriously embarrass you are you short of money no sir i was very liberally paid by mr sargent and i saved money i have enough in the savings bank to last me several months should i be idle so long i am glad of it i hope you will remember my boy that this is none of my doing i would gladly retain you i will say one thing more should jasper redwood ever apply for a situation here his name will not be considered so rodney found himself again without a position it seemed hard in view of his innocence but he had confidence to believe that something would turn up for him as before at any rate he had enough money to live on for some time when mike flynn learned the circumstances of his discharge he was very angry id like to meet jasper redwood he said his eyes flashing if i didnt give him a laying out then my name isnt mike flynn i think he will get his desert some time mickey without any help from you or me should hope he will and whatll you do now rodney i dont know sometimes i think it would be well to go to some other city boston or philadelphia where jasper cant get on my track should hope you wont do it i cant get along widout you i will stay here for a few weeks mike and see if anything turns up i might get you in as a telegraph boy that wouldnt suit me it doesnt pay enough rodney began to hunt for a situation again but four weeks passed and brought him no success one afternoon about four oclock he was walking up broadway when feeling tired he stepped into the continental hotel at the corner of twentieth street he took a seat at some distance back from the door and in a desultory way began to look about him all at once he started in surprise for in a man sitting in one of the front row of chairs he recognized louis wheeler the railroad thief who had stolen his box of jewelry wheeler was conversing with a man with a large flapping sombrero and whose dress and general appearance indicated that he was a westerner rodney left his seat and going forward sat down in the chair behind wheeler he suspected that the western man was in danger of being victimized chapter xxii an old acquaintance turns up in his new position rodney could easily hear the conversation which took place between the western man and his old railroad acquaintance i am quite a man of leisure said wheeler and it will give me great pleasure to go about with you and show you our city you are very obliging oh dont mention it i shall really be glad to have my time occupied you see i am a man of means my father left me a fortune and so i am not engaged in any business you are in luck i was brought up on a farm in vermont and had to borrow money to take me to montana four years ago i hope you prospered in your new home i did i picked up twenty five thousand dollars at the mines and doubled it by investment in lots in helena very neat indeed i inherited a fortune from my father a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars but i never made a cent myself i dont know whether i am smart enough come out to montana and ill put you in a way of making some money really now that suggestion strikes me favorably i believe i will follow your advice when shall you return to your western home in about a fortnight i think you must go to the theater tonight there is a good play on at the madison square i dont mind when can i get ticket ill go and secure some it is only a few blocks away do so how much are the tickets a dollar and a half or two dollars each here are five dollars if it wont trouble you too much my dear friend i meant to pay for the tickets however i will pay next time if you will remain here i will be back in twenty minutes louis wheeler left the hotel with the five dollars tucked away in his vest pocket he had no sooner disappeared than rodney went forward and occupied his seat excuse me sir he said to the miner but do you know much of the man who has just left you i only met him here he seems a good natured fellow what of him he said he was a man of independent means isnt he he is a thief and an adventurer the miner was instantly on the alert how do you know this he asked because he stole a box of jewelry from me in the cars some months ago did you get it again yes he left the train but i followed him up and reclaimed the jewelry was it of much value they were family jewels and were worth over a thousand dollars do you think he wants to bunco me i have no doubt of it i have given him money to buy theater tickets do you think he will come back yes he wouldnt be satisfied with that small sum tell me about your adventure with him i will do it later the theater is so near that he might come back and surprise us together i think he would recognize me do you advise me to go to the theater yes but be on your guard where can i see you again are you staying at this hotel yes here is my card rodney read this name on the card jefferson pettrigrew i wish you were going to the theater with us it wouldnt do mr wheeler would remember me then come round and breakfast with me tomorrow at eight oclock sharp i will sir now i will take a back seat and leave you to receive your friend dont call him my friend he seems to be a mean scoundrel dont let him suspect anything from your manner i wont i want to see him expose his plans five minutes afterwards louis wheeler entered the hotel ive got the tickets he said but i had to buy them of a speculator and they cost me more than i expected how much two and a half apiece so there is no change coming back to you never mind as long as you had enough money to pay for them it is all right as a matter of fact wheeler bought the tickets at the box office at one dollar and fifty cent each which left him a profit of two dollars when he saw how easily the western man took it he regretted not having represented that the tickets cost three dollars each however he decided that there would be other ways of plundering his new acquaintance he took his seat again next to the miner it is not very late he said would you like a run out to central park or to grants tomb not today i feel rather tired by the way you did not mention your name i havent a card with me but my name is louis wheeler where do you live mr wheeler i am staying with an aunt on fifth avenue but i think of taking board at the windsor hotel it is a very high toned house and quite a number of my friends board there is it an expensive hotel oh yes but my income is large and i understand now mr wheeler i must excuse myself as i feel tired come at half past seven and we can start for the theater together very well wheeler rose reluctantly for he had intended to secure a dinner from his new acquaintance but he was wise enough to take the hint after he left the room rodney again joined mr pettigrew he didnt give me back any change said the western man he said he bought the tickets of a speculator at two dollars and a half each then he made two dollars out of you i suppose that is the beginning well that doesnt worry me but i should like to know how he expects to get more money out of me i dont understand the ways of this gentry nor i very well if you are on your guard i think you wont be in any danger i will remember what you say you seem young to act as adviser to a man like me are you in business at present i am out of work but i have money enough to last me three months are you like my new acquaintance possessed of independent means not now but i was six months ago how did you lose your money i did not lose it my guardian lost it for me what is your name rodney ropes youve had some pretty bad luck come up to my room and tell me about it i shall be glad to do so sir mr pettigrew called for his key and led the way up to a plain room on the third floor come in he said the room is small but i guess it will hold us both now go ahead with your story in a short time rodney had told his story in full to his new acquaintance encouraged to do so by his sympathetic manner mr pettigrew was quite indignant when told of jaspers mean and treacherous conduct that boy jasper is a snake in the grass he said id like to give him a good thrashing there isnt any love lost between us mr pettigrew but i think it will turn out right in the end still i find it hard to get a place in new york with him circulating stories about me then why do you stay in new york i have thought it might be better to go to philadelphia or boston i can tell you of a better place than either what is that montana do you really think it would be wise for me to go there think i havent a doubt about it i have money enough to get there but not much more i should soon have to find work or i might get stranded come back with me and ill see you through ill make a bargain with you go round with me here and ill pay your fare out to montana if you are really in earnest i will do so and thank you for the offer jefferson pettigrew means what he says ill see you through rodney but i may be interfering with your other friend louis wheeler i shall soon be through with him you neednt worry yourself about that mr pettigrew insisted upon rodneys taking supper with him fifteen minutes after rodney left him mr wheeler made his appearance chapter xxiii mr wheeler has a set back louis wheeler had not seen rodney in the hotel office and probably would not have recognized him if he had as rodney was quite differently dressed from the time of their first meeting he had no reason to suppose therefore that mr pettigrew had been enlightened as to his real character it was therefore with his usual confidence that he accosted his acquaintance from montana after supper it is time to go to the theater mr pettigrew he said jefferson pettigrew scanned his new acquaintance with interest he had never before met a man of his type and he looked upon him as a curiosity he was shrewd however and did not propose to let wheeler know that he understood his character he resolved for the present to play the part of the bluff and unsuspecting country visitor you are very kind mr wheeler he said to take so much trouble for a stranger my dear sir said wheeler effusively i wouldnt do it for many persons but i have taken a fancy to you you dont mean so said pettigrew appearing pleased yes i do on my honor but i dont see why you should you are a polished city gentleman and i am an ignorant miner from montana louis wheeler looked complacent when he was referred to as a polished city gentleman you do yourself injustice my dear pettigrew he said in a patronizing manner you do indeed you may not be polished but you are certainly smart as you have shown by accumulating a fortune but i am not as rich as you perhaps not but if i should lose my money i could not make another fortune while i am sure you could dont you think it would be a good plan for us to start a business together in new york would you really be willing to go into business with me jefferson pettigrew asked this question with so much apparent sincerity that wheeler was completely deceived ive got him dead he soliloquized complacently he hooked his arm affectionately in the montana miners and said my dear friend i have never met a man with whom i would rather be associated in business than with you how much capital could you contribute i will think it over mr wheeler by the way what business do you propose that we shall go into i will think it over and report to you by this time they had reached the theater the play soon commenced mr pettigrew enjoyed it highly for he had not had much opportunity at the west of attending a high class theatrical performance when the play ended louis wheeler said suppose we go to delmonicos and have a little refreshment very well they adjourned to the well known restaurant and mr pettigrew ordered an ice and some cakes but his companion made a hearty supper when the bill came louis wheeler let it lie on the table but mr pettigrew did not appear to see it i wonder if he expects me to pay for it wheeler asked himself anxiously thank you for this pleasant little supper said pettigrew mischievously delmonicos is certainly a fine place wheeler changed color he glanced at the check it was for two dollars and seventy five cents and this represented a larger sum than he possessed he took the check and led the way to the cashiers desk then he examined his pockets by jove he said i left my wallet in my other coat may i borrow five dollars till tomorrow jefferson pettigrew eyed him shrewdly never mind he said i will pay the check i am very much ashamed of having put you to this expense if that is all you have to be ashamed of mr wheeler said the miner pointedly you can rest easy what do you mean stammered wheeler wait till we get into the street and i will tell you they went out at the broadway entrance and then mr pettigrew turned to his new acquaintance i think i will bid you good night and good by at the same time mr wheeler he said my dear sir i hoped you wont misjudge me on account of my unfortunately leaving my money at home i only wish to tell you that i have not been taken in by your plausible statement mr wheeler if that is really your name before we started for the theater i had gauged you and taken your measure sir i hope you dont mean to insult me blustered wheeler not at all you have been mistaken in me but i am not mistaken in you i judge you to be a gentlemanly adventurer ready to take advantage of any who have money and are foolish enough to be gulled by your tricks you are welcome to the profit you made out of the theater tickets also to the little supper to which you have done so much justice i must request you now however to devote yourself to some one else as i do not care to meet you again louis wheeler slunk away deciding that he had made a great mistake in setting down his montana acquaintance as an easy victim i didnt think hed get on to my little game so quick he reflected hes sharper than he looks rodney took breakfast with mr pettigrew the next morning when breakfast was over the montana man said im going to make a proposal to you rodney how much pay did you get at your last place seven dollars a week ill pay you that and give you your meals in return i want you to keep me company and go about with me i shall not be apt to refuse such an offer as that mr pettigrew but are you sure you prefer me to mr wheeler laughed rodney wheeler be blessed returned the miner how long are you going to stay in new york about two weeks then i shall go back to montana and take you with me thank you there is nothing i should like better two days later as the two were walking along broadway they met mr wheeler the latter instantly recognized his friend from montana and scrutinized closely his young companion rodneys face looked strangely familiar to him but somehow he could not recollect when or under what circumstances he had met him he did not however like to give up his intended victim but had the effrontery to address the man from montana i hope you are well mr pettigrew thank you i am very well i hope you are enjoying yourself i should be glad to show you the sights have you been to grants tomb not yet i should like to take you there thank you but i have a competent guide wont you introduce me to the young gentleman i dont require any introduction to you mr wheeler said rodney where have i met you before asked wheeler abruptly in the cars i had a box of jewelry with me answered rodney significantly louis wheeler changed color now he remembered rodney and he was satisfied that he owed to him the coolness with which the western man had treated him i remember you had he said spitefully but i dont know how you came by it it isnt necessary that you should know i remember i had considerable difficulty in getting it out of your hands mr pettigrew said wheeler angrily i feel interested in you and i want to warn you against the boy who is with you he is a dangerous companion i dare say you are right said pettigrew in a quizzical tone i shall look after him sharply and i thank you for your kind and considerate warning i dont care to take up any more of your valuable time rodney let us be going it must have been the kid that exposed me muttered wheeler as he watched the two go down the street i will get even with him some time that man would have been good for a thousand dollars to me if i had not been interfered with you have been warned against me mr pettigrew said rodney laughing mr wheeler has really been very unkind in interfering with my plans i shant borrow any trouble or lie awake nights thinking about it rodney i dont care to see or think of that rascal again the week passed and the arrangement between mr pettigrew and rodney continued to their mutual satisfaction one morning when rodney came to the continental as usual his new friend said i received a letter last evening from my old home in vermont i hope it contained good news on the contrary it contained bad news my parents are dead but i have an old uncle and aunt living when i left burton he was comfortably fixed with a small farm of his own and two thousand dollars in bank now i hear that he is in trouble he has lost money and a knavish neighbor has threatened to foreclose a mortgage on the farm and turn out the old people to die or go to the poorhouse is the mortgage a large one it is much less than the value of the farm but ready money is scarce in the town and that old sheldon calculates upon now i think of going to burton to look up the matter you must save your uncle if you can mr pettigrew i can and i will i shall start for boston this afternoon by the fall river boat and i want you to go with me i should enjoy the journey mr pettigrew then it is settled go home and pack your gripsack you may be gone three or four days chapter xxiv a change of scene now said mr pettigrew when they were sitting side by side on the upper deck of the puritan the magnificent steamer on the fall river line i want you to consent to a little plan that will mystify my old friends and neighbors what is it mr pettigrew i have never written home about my good fortune so far as they know i am no better off than when i went away i dont think i could have concealed my success it may seem strange but ill explain i want to learn who are my friends and who are not i am afraid i wasnt very highly thought of when i left burton i was considered rather shiftless i was always in for a good time and never saved a cent everybody predicted that i would fail and i expect most wanted me to fail there were two or three including my uncle aunt and the friend who lent me money who wished me well i mustnt forget to mention the old minister who baptized me when i was an infant the good old man has been preaching thirty or forty years on a salary of four hundred dollars and has had to run a small farm to make both ends meet he believed in me and gave me good advice outside of these i dont remember any one who felt an interest in jefferson pettigrew you will have the satisfaction of letting them see that they did not do you justice yes but i may not tell them that is none except my true friends if i did they would hover round me and want to borrow money or get me to take them out west with me so i have hit upon a plan i shall want to use money but i will pretend it is yours rodney opened his eyes in surprise i will pass you off as a rich friend from new york who feels an interest in me and is willing to help me rodney smiled i dont know if i can look the character he said oh yes you can you are nicely dressed while i am hardly any better dressed than when i left burton i have wondered why you didnt buy some new clothes when you were able to afford it you see we western miners dont care much for style perhaps not enough still i probably shall buy a suit or two but not till i have made my visit home i want to see how people will receive me when they think i havent got much money i shall own up to about five hundred dollars but that isnt enough to dazzle people even in a small country village i am wiling to help you in any way you wish mr pettigrew then i think we shall get some amusement out of it i shall represent you as worth about a hundred thousand dollars i wish i were very likely you will be some time if you go out to montana with me how large a place is burton it has not quite a thousand inhabitants it is set among the hills and has but one rich man lemuel sheldon who is worth perhaps fifty thousand dollars but put on the airs of a millionaire you are as rich as he then yes and shall soon be richer however i dont want him to know it it is he who holds the mortgage on my uncles farm do you know how large the mortgage is it is twelve hundred dollars i shall borrow the money of you to pay it i understand said rodney smiling i shall enjoy the way the old man will look down upon me very much as a millionaire looks down upon a town pauper how will he look upon me he will be very polite to you for he will think you richer than himself on the whole we are going to act a comedy mr pettigrew what is the name of the man who lent you money to go to montana a young carpenter frank dobson he lent me a hundred dollars which was about all the money he had saved up he was a true friend you are right he was everybody told frank that he would never see his money again but he did as soon as i could get together enough to repay him i sent it on though i remember it left me with less than ten dollars in my pocket i couldnt bear to think that frank would lose anything by me you see we were chums at school and always stood by each other he is married and has two children while you are an old bachelor yes i aint in a hurry to travel in double harness ill wait till i am ready to leave montana with money enough to live handsomely at home you have got enough now but i may as well get more i am only thirty years old and i can afford to work a few years longer i wish i could be sure of being worth fifty thousand dollars when i am your age you have been worth that you tell me yes but i should value more money that i had made myself above five oclock on monday afternoon mr pettigrew and rodney reached burton it was a small village about four miles from the nearest railway station an old fashioned concord stage connected burton with the railway the driver was on the platform looking out for passengers when jefferson pettigrew stepped out of the car how are you hector said the miner in an off hand way why bless my soul if it isnt jeff exclaimed the driver who had been an old schoolmate of mr pettigrews i reckon it is said the miner his face lighting up with the satisfaction he felt at seeing a home face why you aint changed a mite jeff you look just as you did when you went away how long have you been gone four years made a fortune but you dont look like it thats the same suit you wore when you went away isnt it mr pettigrew laughed well no it isnt the same but its one of the same kind i thought maybe youd come home in a dress suit it isnt so easy to make a fortune hector but you have made something aint you oh yes when i went away i hadnt a cent except what i borrowed now ive got five hundred dollars that aint much no but its better than nothing how much more have you got hector well you see i married last year i havent had a chance to lay by so you see i did as well as if i had stayed at home are you going to stay home now for a little while i may go back to montana after a bit is it a good place to make money i made five hundred dollars thats only a little more than a hundred dollars a year frank dobson has saved as much as that and hes stayed right here in burton im glad of that said pettigrew heartily frank is a rousing good fellow if it hadnt been for him i couldnt have gone to montana it doesnt seem to have done you much good as i can see oh well i am satisfied let me introduce my friend mr rodney ropes of new york glad to meet you said hector with a jerk of the head rodney wont you sit inside i want to sit outide with hector all right mr pettigrew who is that boy asked hector with characteristic yankee curiosity as he seized the lines and started the horses a rich young fellow from new york i got acquainted with him there rich is he jefferson pettigrew nodded how rich do you think shouldnt wonder if he might be worth a hundred thousand you dont say why he beat squire sheldon oh yes squire sheldon wouldnt be considered rich in new york how did he get his money his father left him a fortune is that so i wish my father had left me a fortune he did didnt he yes he did when his estate was settled i got seventy five dollars if you call that a fortune but i say what brings the boy to burton his friendship for me i expect besides he may invest in a place theres the old morse place for sale do you think hed buy that it wouldnt be nice enough for him i dont know any place that would be good enough except the squires the squire wouldnt sell oh well i dont know as rodney would care to locate in burton youre in luck to get such a friend say do you think he would lend you a hundred dollars if you were hard up i know he would by the way hector is there any news how is my uncle i think the old man is worrying on account of his mortgage who holds it the squire they do say he is goin to foreclose thatll be bad for the old man itll nigh about break his heart i expect cant uncle raise the money to pay him who is there round here who has got any money except the squire thats so where are you goin to stop jeff i guess ill stop at the tavern tonight but ill go over and call on uncle this evening chapter xxv jefferson pettigrews home news spreads fast in a country village scarcely an hour had passed when it was generally known that jefferson pettigrew had come home from montana with a few hundred dollars in money bringing with him a rich boy who could buy out all burton at least that is the way the report ran when the two new arrivals had finished supper and come out on the hotel veranda there were a dozen of jefferson pettigrews friends ready to welcome him how are you jefferson old boy said one and another pretty well thank you it seems good to be home i hear youve brought back some money yes a few hundred dollars thats better than nothing i reckon youll stay home now i cant afford it boys are ye goin back to montany yes i know the country and i can make a middlin good livin there i say is that boy thats with you as rich as they say i dont know what they say they say hes worth a million oh no not so much as that hes pretty well fixed hasnt he got a father livin no its his father that left the money how did you happen to get in with him oh we met promiscuous he took a sort of fancy to me and thats the way of it do you expect to keep him with you he talks of goin back to montana with me ill be sort of guardian to him youre in luck jeff yes im in luck to have pleasant company maybe well join together and buy a mine would you mind introducin him not at all and thus rodney became acquainted with quite a number of the burton young men he was amused to see with what deference they treated him but preserved a sober face and treated all cordially so that he made a favorable impression on those he met among those who made it in their way to call on the two travelers was lemuel sheldon the rich man of the village how do you do jefferson he said condescendingly very well sir you have been quite a traveler yes sir i have been to the far west and met with some success i am told yes sir i raised money enough to get home i hear you brought home a few hundred dollars yes sir oh well said the squire patronizingly thats good beginning it must seem very little to a rich man like you squire oh no said the squire patronizingly you are a young man i shouldnt wonder if by the time you get as old as i am you might be worth five thousand dollars i hope so answered mr pettigrew demurely by the way you have brought a young man with you i am told yes i should like to make his acquaintance he is rich is he not i wish i was as rich you dont say so about how much do you estimate he is worth i dont think it amounts to quite as much as a quarter of a million still you know it is not always easy to tell how much a person is worth he is certainly a very fortunate young man said the squire impressed what is his name rodney ropes the name sounds aristocratic i shall be glad to know him rodney said mr pettigrew i want to introduce you to squire sheldon our richest and most prominent citizen i am glad to meet you squire sheldon said rodney offering his hand i quite reciprocate the feeling mr ropes but mr pettigrew should not call me a rich man i am worth something to be sure i should say you were squire said jefferson rodney he is as rich as you are oh no returned the squire modestly not as rich as that indeed i hardly know how much i am worth as mr pettigrew very justly observed it is not easy to gauge a mans possessions but there is one difference between us you mr ropes i take it are not over eighteen only sixteen sir and yet you are wealthy i am rising fifty when you come to my age you will be worth much more perhaps i may have lost all i now possess said rodney within a year i have lost fifty thousand dollars you dont say so yes it was through a man who had charge of my property i think now i shall manage my money matters myself doubtless you are right that was certainly a heavy loss i shouldnt like to lose so much i suppose however you had something left oh yes answered rodney in an indifferent tone he must be rich to make so little account of fifty thousand dollars thought the squire how long do you propose to stay in town mr pettigrew he asked i cant tell sir but i dont think i can spare more than three or four days may i hope that you and mr ropes will take supper with me tomorrow evening say the next day and well come tomorrow i must go to my uncles oh very well squire sheldon privately resolved to pump rodney as to the investment of his property he was curious to learn first how much the boy was worth for if there was anything that the squire worshiped it was wealth he was glad to find that mr pettigrew had only brought home five hundred dollars as it was not enough to lift the mortgage on his uncles farm after they were left alone jefferson pettigrew turned to rodney and said do you mind my leaving you a short time and calling at my uncles not at all mr pettigrew i can pass my time very well jefferson pettigrew directed his steps to an old fashioned farmhouse about half a mile from the village in the rear the roof sloped down so that the eaves were only five feet from the ground the house was large though the rooms were few in number in the sitting room sat an old man and his wife who was nearly as old it was not a picture of cheerful old age for each looked sad the sadness of old age is pathetic for there is an absence of hope and courage such as younger people are apt to feel even when they are weighed down by trouble cyrus hooper was seventy one his wife two years younger during the greater part of their lives they had been well to do if not prosperous but now their money was gone and there was a mortgage on the old home which they could not pay i dont know whats goin to become of us nancy said cyrus hooper well have to leave the old home and when the farms been sold there wont be much left over and above the mortgage which louis sheldon holds dont you think the squire will give you a little more time cyrus no i saw him yesterday and hes sot on buyin in the farm for himself he reckons it wont fetch moren eighteen hundred dollars thats only six hundred over the mortgage it isnt that nancy theres about a hundred dollars due in interest we wont get moren five hundred dollars surely cyrus the farm is worth three thousand dollars so it is nancy but that wont do us any good as long as no one wants it moren the squire i wish jefferson were at home what good would it do i surmise he hasnt made any money he never did have much enterprise that boy he was allus a good boy cyrus thats so nancy but he didnt seem cut out for makin money still it would do me good to see him maybe we might have a home together and manage to live just then a neighbor entered have you heard the news she asked no what is it your nephew jefferson pettigrew has got back you dont mean so there jefferson thats one comfort and they say he has brought home five hundred dollars thats moren i thought hed bring where is he over at the tavern hes brought a young man with him leastways a boy thats got a lot of money the boy yes hes from new york and is a friend of jeffersons well im glad hes back why didnt he come here its likely he would if the boy wasnt with him perhaps he heard of my misfortune i hope itll all come right mr hooper my if there aint jefferson comin to see you now i see him through the winder i guess ill be goin youll want to see him alone chapter xxvi the boy capitalist how are you uncle cyrus said jefferson pettigrew heartily as he clasped his uncles toil worn hand and aunt nancy too it pays me for coming all the way from montana just to see you im glad to see you jefferson said his uncle it seems a long time since you went away i hope youve prospered well uncle ive brought myself back well and hearty and ive got a few hundred dollars im glad to hear it jefferson youre better off than when you went away yes uncle i couldnt be much worse off then i hadnt a cent that i could call my own but how are you and aunt nancy were gettin old jefferson and misfortune has come to us squire sheldon has got a mortgage on the farm and its likely well be turned out youve come just in time to see it is it so bad as that uncle cyrus why when i went away you were prosperous yes jefferson i owned the farm clear and i had money in the bank but now the moneys gone and theres a twelve hundred dollar mortgage on the old place and the old man sighed but how did it come about uncle you and aunt nancy havent lived extravagantly have you aunt nancy you havent run up a big bill at the milliners and dressmakers you was always for jokin jefferson said the old lady smiling faintly but that is not the way our losses came how then you see i indorsed notes for sam sherman over at canton and he failed and i had to pay then i bought some wild cat minin stock on sams recommendation and that went down to nothin so between the two i lost about three thousand dollars ive been a fool jefferson and it would have been money in my pocket if id had a guardeen so you mortgaged the place to squire sheldon uncle yes i had to i was obliged to meet my notes but surely the squire will extend the mortgage no he wont ive asked him he says he must call in the money and so the old place will have to be sold and nancy and i must turn out in our old age again the old man sighed and tears came into nancy hoopers eyes therell be something left wont there uncle cyrus yes the place should bring six hundred dollars over and above the mortgage thats little enough for its worth three thousand so it is uncle cyrus but what can you do with six hundred dollars it wont support you and aunt nancy i thought mebbe jefferson i could hire a small house and you could board with us so that we could still have a home together ill think it over uncle if there is no other way but are you sure squire sheldon wont give you more time no jefferson i surmise he wants the place himself theres talk of a railroad from sherborn and thatll raise the price of land right around here itll probably go right through the farm just south of the three acre lot i see uncle cyrus you ought to have the benefit of the rise in value yes jefferson it would probably rise enough to pay off the mortgage but its no use thinkin of it the old farm has got to go i dont know about that uncle cyrus why jefferson you havent money enough to lift the mortgage said the old man with faint hope if i havent i may get it for you tell me just how much money is required thirteen hundred dollars includin interest perhaps you have heard that i have a boy with me a boy from new york named rodney ropes he has money and perhaps i might get him to advance the sum you want oh jefferson if you only could exclaimed aunt nancy clasping her thin hands it would make us very happy ill see rodney tonight and come over tomorrow morning and tell you what he says on account of the railroad i shall tell him that it is a good investment i suppose you will be willing to mortgage the farm to him for the same money that he pays to lift the present mortgage yes jefferson ill be willin and glad itll lift a great burden from my shoulders ive been worryin at the sorrow ive brought upon poor nancy for she had nothing to do with my foolish actions i was old enough to know better jefferson and im ashamed of what i did well uncle cyrus ill do what i can for you now let us forget all about your troubles and talk over the village news you know ive been away for four years and i havent had any stiddy correspondence so a good deal must have happened that i dont know anything about i hear frank dobson has prospered yes franks pretty forehanded hes got a good economical wife and theyve laid away five or six hundred dollars in the savings bank i am glad of it frank is a good fellow if it hadnt been for him i couldnt have gone to montana when he lent me the money everybody said hed lose it but i was bound to pay it if i had to live on one meal a day he was the only man in town who believed in me at that time you was a littless shifless jefferson you cant blame people i wasnt quite sure myself how youd get along no doubt you are right uncle cyrus it did me good to leave town i didnt drink but i had no ambition when a man goes to a new country its apt to make a new man of him that was the case with me are you goin back again jefferson yes uncle im going to stay round here long enough to fix up your affairs and get you out of your trouble then ill go back to the west i have a little mining interest there and i can make more money there than i can here if you can get me out of my trouble jefferson ill never forget it nancy and i have been so worried that we couldnt sleep nights but now im beginnin to be a little more cheerful jefferson pettigrew spent another hour at his uncles house and then went back to the tavern where he found rodney waiting for him he explained briefly the part he wished his boy friend to take in his plan for relieving his uncle i shall be receiving credit to which i am not entitled said rodney still if it will oblige you i am willing to play the part of the boy capitalist the next morning after breakfast the two friends walked over to the house of cyrus hooper aunt nancy came to the door and gave them a cordial welcome cyrus is over at the barn jefferson she said ill ring the bell and hell come in no aunt nancy ill go out and let him know i am here presently cyrus hooper came in accompanied by jefferson uncle cyrus said the miner let me introduce you to my friend rodney ropes of new york im glad to see you said cyrus heartily im glad to see any friend of jeffersons thank you sir i am pleased to meet you jefferson says you are goin to montany with him i hope to do so i am sure i shall enjoy myself in his company how far is montany jefferson it is over two thousand miles away uncle cyrus it must be almost at the end of the world i dont see how you can feel at home so far away from vermont jefferson smiled i can content myself wherever i can make a good living he said wouldnt you like to go out and make me a visit no jefferson i should feel that it was temptin providence to go so far at my age you never were very far from burton uncle cyrus i went to montpelier once answered the old man with evident pride it is a nice sizable place i stopped at the tavern and had a good time it was the only journey the old man had ever made and he would never forget it uncle cyrus said jefferson this is the young man who i thought might advance you money on a new mortgage suppose we invite him to go over the farm and take a look at it so as to see what he thinks of the investment sartain jefferson sartain i do hope mr ropes youll look favorable on the investment it is jeffersons idea but it would be doin me a great favor mr pettigrew will explain the advantages of the farm as we go along said rodney so they walked from field to field jefferson expatiating to his young friend upon the merits of the investment rodney asking questions now and then to carry out his part of the shrewd and careful boy capitalist when they had made a tour of the farm jefferson said well rodney what do you think of the investment i am satisfied with it answered rodney mr hooper i will advance you the money on the conditions mentioned by my friend mr pettigrew tears of joy came into the eyes of cyrus hooper and his worn face showed relief i am very grateful young man he said i will see that you dont regret your kindness when will squire sheldon be over to settle matters uncle cyrus asked jefferson he is comin this afternoon at two oclock then rodney and i will be over to take part in the business chapter xxvii the failure of squire sheldons plot on the morning of the same day squire sheldon sat in his study when the servant came in and brought a card its a gentleman thats come to see you sir she said lemuel sheldons eye brightened when he saw the name for it was that of a railroad man who was interested in the proposed road from sherborn i am glad to see you mr caldwell he said cordially rising to receive his guest what is the prospect as regards the railroad i look upon it as a certainty answered enoch caldwell a grave portly man of fifty and it is sure to pass through our town yes i look upon that as definitely decided the next question is as to the route it will take went on the squire upon that point i should like to offer a few suggestions i shall be glad to receive them in fact i may say that my report will probably be accepted and i shall be glad to consult you thank you i appreciate the compliment you pay me and though i say it i dont think you could find any one more thoroughly conversant with the lay of the land and the most advisable route to follow if you will put on your hat we will go out together and i will give you my views i shall be glad to do so the two gentlemen took a leisurely walk through the village going by cyrus hoopers house on the way in my view said the squire the road should go directly through this farm a little to the north of the house the squire proceeded to explain his reasons for the route he recommended to whom does the farm belong asked caldwell with a shrewd glance at the squire to an old man named cyrus hooper ahem perhaps he would be opposed to the road passing so near his house i apprehend that he will not have to be consulted said the squire with a crafty smile why not because i hold a mortgage on the farm which i propose to foreclose this afternoon i see so that you will be considerably benefited by the road yes to a moderate extent but if a different course should be selected how then if the road goes through the farm i would be willing to give a quarter of the damages awarded to me to you understand i think i do after all it seems the most natural route i think there can be no doubt on that point of course the corporation will be willing to pay a reasonable sum for land taken i think i can promise that as i shall have an important voice in the matter i see you are a thorough business man said the squire i hold that it is always best to pursue a liberal policy quite so you have no doubt of obtaining the farm not the slightest but suppose the present owner meets the mortgage he cant he is a poor man and he has no moneyed friends i confess i was a little afraid that a nephew of his just returned from montana might be able to help him but i learn that he has only brought home five hundred dollars while the mortgage including interest calls for thirteen hundred then you appear to be safe when did you say the matter would be settled this afternoon at two oclock you had better stay over and take supper with me i shall be prepared to talk with you at that time very well from a window of the farmhouse cyrus hooper saw squire sheldon and his guest walking by the farm and noticed the interest which they seemed to feel in it but for the assurance which he had received of help to pay the mortgage he would have felt despondent for he guessed the subject of their conversation as it was he felt an excusable satisfaction in the certain defeat of the squires hopes of gain it seems that the more a man has the more he wants jefferson he said to his nephew the squire is a rich man the richest man in burton but he wants to take from me the little property that i have its the way of the world uncle cyrus in this case the squire is safe to be disappointed thanks to my young friend rodney its lucky for me jefferson that you came home just the time you did if you had come a week later it would have been too late then you dont think the squire would have relented i know he wouldnt i went over a short time since and had a talk with him on the subject i found he was sot on gettin the farm into his own hands if he were willing to pay a fair value it wouldnt be so bad he wasnt he wanted to get it as cheap as he could i wonder said jefferson pettigrew reflectively whether i shall be as hard and selfish if ever i get rich i dont believe you will jefferson i dont believe you will it doesnt run in the blood i hope not uncle cyrus how long have you known the squire forty years jefferson he is about ten years younger than i am i was a young man when he was a boy and you attend the same church yes and still he is willing to take advantage of you and reduce you to poverty i dont see much religion in that when a mans interest is concerned religion has to stand to one side with some people it was in a pleasant frame of mind that squire sheldon left his house and walked over to the farmhouse which he hoped to own he had decided to offer eighteen hundred dollars for the farm which would be five hundred over and above the face of the mortgage with the interest added this of itelf would give him an excellent profit but he expected also as we know to drive a stiff bargain with the new railroad company for such land as they would require to use stay here till i come back mr caldwell he said i apprehend it wont take me long to get through my business squire sheldon knocked at the door of the farmhouse which was opened to him by nancy hooper walk in squire she said is your husband at home mrs hooper yes he is waiting for you mrs hooper led the way into the sitting room where her husband was sitting in a rocking chair good afternoon mr hooper said the squire i hope i see you well as well as i expect to be im gettin to be an old man we must all grow old said the squire vaguely and sometimes a mans latter years are his most sorrowful years that means that he cant pay the mortgage thought squire sheldon well ahem yes it does sometimes happen so he said aloud still if a mans friends stand by him that brings him some comfort i suppose you know what ive come about mr hooper said the squire anxious to bring his business to a conclusion i suppose its about the mortgage yes its about the mortgage will you be willing to extend it another year i thought said the squire frowning i had given you to understand that i cannot do this you owe me a large sum in accrued interest but if i make shift to pay this i should say the same it may as well come first as last you cant hold the place and there is no chance of your being better off by waiting i understand that the new railroad might go through my farm that would put me on my feet there is no certainty that the road will ever be built even if it were it would not be likely to cross your farm i see squire sheldon you are bound to have the place there is no need to put it that way mr hooper i lent you money on mortgage you cant pay the mortgage and of course i foreclose however i will buy the farm and allow you eighteen hundred dollars for it that will give you five hundred dollars over and above the money you owe me the farm is worth three thousand dollars nonsense mr hooper still if you get an offer of that sum today i will advise you to sell i certainly wont take eighteen hundred you wont then i shall foreclose and you may have to take less then there is only one thing to do as you say there is only one thing to do and that is to pay off the mortgage and clear the farm you cant do it exclaimed the squire uneasily cyrus hoopers only answer was to call jefferson jefferson pettigrew entered the room followed by rodney what does this mean asked the squire it means squire sheldon said mr pettigrew that you wont turn my uncle out of his farm this time my young friend rodney ropes has advanced uncle cyrus money enough to pay off the mortgage i wont take a check said the squire hastily you would have to if we insisted upon it but i have the money here in bills give me a release and surrender the mortgage and you shall have your money it was with a crestfallen look that squire sheldon left the farmhouse though his pockets were full of money its all up he said to his friend caldwell in a hollow voice they have paid the mortgage after all the railway did cross the farm and uncle cyrus was paid two thousand dollars for the right of way much to the disappointment of his disinterested friend lemuel sheldon who felt that this sum ought to have gone into his own pocket chapter xxviii a ministers good fortune i have another call to make rodney said mr pettigrew as they were on their way back to the hotel and i want you to go with me i shall be glad to accompany you anywhere mr pettigrew you remember i told you of the old minister whose church i attended as a boy he has never received but four hundred dollars a year yet he has managed to rear a family but has been obliged to use the strictest economy yes i remember i am going to call on him and i shall take the opportunity to make him a handsome present it will surprise him and i think it will be the first present of any size that he has received in his pastorate of over forty years there he lives continued jefferson pointing out a very modest cottage on the left hand side of the road it needed painting badly but it looked quite as well as the minister who came to the door in a ragged dressing gown he was venerable looking for his hair was quite white though he was only sixty five years old but worldly cares which had come upon him from the difficulty of getting along on his scanty salary had whitened his hair and deepened the wrinkles on his kindly face i am glad to see you jefferson he said his face lighting up with pleasure i heard you were in town and i hoped you wouldnt fail to call upon me i was sure to call for you were always a good friend to me as well as many others i always looked upon you as one of my boys jefferson i hear that you have been doing well yes mr canfield i have done better than i have let people know have you been to see your uncle poor man he is in trouble he is no longer in trouble the mortgage is paid off and as far as squire sheldon is concerned he is independent indeed that is good news said the old minister with beaming face you must surely have done well if you could furnish money enough to clear the farm it was over a thousand dollars wasnt it yes thirteen hundred my young friend rodney ropes and myself managed it between us i am glad to see you mr ropes come in both of you mrs canfield will be glad to welcome you they followed him into the sitting room the floor of which was covered by an old and faded carpet the furniture was of the plainest description but it looked pleasant and homelike and the papers and books that were scattered about made it more attractive to a visitor than many showy city drawing rooms and how are all your children mr canfield asked jefferson maria is married to a worthy young man in the next town benjamin is employed in a book store and austin wants to go to college but i dont see any way to send him poor boy and the minister sighed softly does it cost much to keep a boy in college not so much as might be supposed there are beneficiary funds for deserving students and then there is teaching to eke out a poor young mans income so that i dont think it would cost over a hundred and fifty dollars a year that isnt a large sum not in itelf but you know jefferson my salary is only four hundred dollars a year it would take nearly half my income so i think austin will have to give up his hopes of going to college and follow in his brothers steps how old is austin now he is eighteen is he ready for college yes he could enter at the next commencement but for the financial problem i never had any taste for college or study as you know mr canfield it is different with my friend rodney who is a latin and greek scholar the minister regarded rodney with new interest do you think of going to college mr ropes he asked not at present i am going back to montana with mr pettigrew perhaps he and i will both go to college next year excuse me said jefferson pettigrew latin and greek aint in my line i should make a good deal better miner than minister it is not desirable that all should become ministers or go to college said mr canfield i suspect from what i know of you jefferson that you judge yourself correctly how long shall you stay in burton i expect to go away tomorrow your visit is a brief one yes i intended to stay longer but i begin to be homesick after the west do you expect to make your permanent home there i cant tell as to that for the present i can do better there than here the conversation lasted for some time then jefferson pettigrew rose to go wont you call again jefferson asked the minister hospitably i shall not have time but before i go i want to make you a small present and he put into the hands of the astonished minister four fifty dollar bills two hundred dollars ejaculated the minister why i heard you only brought home a few hundred i prefer to leave that impression to you i will say that i am worth a great deal more than that but you mustnt give me so much i am sure you are too generous for your own interest why its munificent princely dont be troubled about me i can spare it send your boy to college and next year i will send you another sum equally large how can i thank you jefferson said mr canfield the tears coming into his eyes never in forty years have i had such a gift not even from squire sheldon the squire is not in the habit of bestowing gifts but he pays a large parish tax may i am i at liberty to say from whom i received this liberal donation please dont you can say that you have had a gift from a friend you have made me very happy jefferson your own conscience will reward you jefferson pettigrew changed the subject for it embarrassed him to be thanked that pays me for hard work and privation he said to rodney as they walked back to the tavern after all there is a great pleasure in making others happy squire sheldon hadnt found that out and he never will on the way they met the gentleman of whom they had been speaking he bowed stiffly for he could not feel cordial to those whom had snatched from him the house for which he had been scheming so long squire sheldon said jefferson you were kind enough to invite rodney and myself to supper some evening i am sorry to say that we must decline as we leave burton tomorrow use your own pleasure mr pettigrew said the squire coldly it doesnt seem to disappoint the squire very much remarked jefferson laughing when the great man of the village had passed on it certainly is no disappointment to me nor to me the little time i have left i can use more pleasantly than in going to see the squire i have promised to supper at my uncles tonight that is i have promised for both of us returning to new york jefferson and rodney set about getting ready for their western journey rodney gave some of his wardrobe to mike flynn and bought some plain suits suitable for his new home while walking on broadway the day before the one fixed for his departure he fell in with jasper redwood have you got a place yet ropes asked jasper i am not looking for any how is that asked jasper in some surprise i am going to leave the city that is a good idea all cannot succeed in the city you may find a chance to work on a farm in the country i didnt say i was going to the country where are you going then to montana isnt that a good way off yes what are you going to do there i may go to mining but how can you afford to go so far really jasper you show considerable curiosity about my affairs i have money enough to buy my ticket and i think i can find work when i get out there it seems to me a crazy idea it might be for you and why for me asked jasper suspiciously because you might not be willing to rough it as i am prepared to do i guess you are right i have always been used to living like a gentleman i hope you will always be able to do so now i must bid you good by as i am busy getting ready for my journey jasper looked after rodney not without perplexity i cant make out that boy he said so he is going to be a common miner well that may suit him but it wouldnt suit me there is no chance now of his interfering with me so i am glad he is going to leave the city chapter xxix a mining town in montana the scene changes three weeks later among the miners who were sitting on the narrow veranda of the miners rest in oreville in montana we recognize two familiar faces and figures those of jefferson pettigrew and rodney ropes both were roughly clad and if jasper could have seen rodney he would have turned up his nose in scorn for rodney had all the look of a common miner it was in oreville that mr pettigrew had a valuable mining property on which he employed quite a number of men who preferred certain wages to a compensation depending on the fluctuations of fortune rodney was among those employed but although he was well paid he could not get to like the work of this however he said nothing to mr pettigrew whose company he enjoyed and whom he held in high esteem on the evening in question jefferson rose from his seat and signed to rodney to follow him well rodney how do you like montana he asked well enough to be glad i came here answered rodney still you are not partial to the work of a miner i can think of other things i would prefer to do how would you like keeping a hotel is there any hotel in search of a manager asked rodney smiling i will explain yesterday i bought the miners rest what the hotel where we board exactly i found that mr bailey who has made a comfortable sum of money wants to leave montana and go east and i bought the hotel so that hereafter i shall board with you not exactly i propose to put you in charge and pay you a salary i can oversee and give you instructions how will that suit you so you think i am competent mr pettigrew yes i think so there is a good man cook and two waiters the cook will also order supplies and act as steward under you what then will be my duties you will act as clerk and cashier and pay the bills you will have to look after all the details of management if there is anything you dont understand you will have me to back you up and advise you what do you say that i shall like it much better than mining my only doubt is as to whether i shall suit you it is true that it takes a smart man to run a hotel but i think we can do it between us now what will you consider a fair salary i leave that to you mr pettigrew then we will call it a hundred and fifty dollars a month and board but mr pettigrew said rodney in surprise how can i possibly earn that much you know we charge big prices and have about fifty steady boarders i expect to make considerable money after deducting all the expenses of management my friend jasper would be very much surprised if he could know the salary i am to receive in the store i was only paid seven dollars a week the duties were different almost any boy could discharge the duties of an entry clerk while it takes peculiar qualities to run a hotel i was certainly very fortunate to fall in with you mr pettigrew i expect it will turn out fortunate for me too rodney when do you want me to start in next monday morning it is now thursday evening mr bailey will turn over the hotel to me on saturday night you neednt go to the mines tomorrow but may remain in the hotel and he will instruct you in the details of management that will be quite a help to me and i am at present quite ignorant on the subject rodney looked forward with pleasure to his new employment he had good executive talent though thus far he had had no occasion to exercise it it was with unusual interest that he set about qualifying himself for his new position young man said the veteran landlord i think youll do i thought at first that jefferson was foolish to put a young boy in my place but youve got a head on your shoulders you have i guess youll fill the bill i hope to do so mr bailey jefferson tells me that you understand latin and greek i know something of them thats what prejudiced me against you i hired a college boy once as a clerk and he was the worst failure i ever came across he seemed to have all kinds of sense except common sense i reckon he was a smart scholar and he could have made out the bills for the boarders in latin or greek if it had been necessary but he was that soft that any one could cheat him things got so mixed up in the department that i had to turn him adrift in a couple of weeks i surmised you might be the same sort of a chap if you were it would be a bad lookout for jefferson in oreville mr pettigrew was so well known that nearly everyone called him by his first name mr pettigrew did not care about this as he had no false pride or artificial dignity do you consider this hotel a good property mr bailey ill tell you this much i started here four years ago and ive made fifty thousand dollars which i shall take back with me to new hampshire that certainly is satisfactory i shouldnt wonder if you could improve upon it how does it happen that you sell out such a valuable property mr bailey are you tired of making money no but i must tell you that theres a girl waiting for me at home an old schoolmate who will become mrs bailey as soon as possible after i get back if she would come out here i wouldnt sell but she has a mother that she wouldnt leave and so i must go to her that is a good reason mr bailey besides with fifty thousand dollars i can live as well as i want to in new hampshire and hold up my head with the best you will follow my example some day it will be a long day first mr bailey for i am only sixteen on monday morning the old landlord started for his eastern home and rodney took his place it took him some little time to become familiar with all the details of hotel management but he spared no pains to insure success he had some trouble at first with the cook who presumed upon his position and rodneys supposed ignorance to run things as he chose rodney complained to mr pettigrew i think i can fix things rodney he said theres a man working for me who used to be cook in a restaurant in new york i found out about him quietly for i wanted to be prepared for emergencies the next time gordon act contrary and threatens to leave tell him he can do as he pleases then report to me the next day there came another conflict of authority if you dont like the way i manage you can get somebody else said the cook triumphantly perhaps youd like to cook the dinner yourself youre nothing but a boy and i dont see what jefferson was thinking of to put you in charge that is his business mr gordon i advise you not to interfere with me for i wont stand it why didnt you talk in this way to mr bailey thats neither here nor there he wasnt a boy for one thing then you propose to have your own way mr gordon yes i do very well then you can leave me at the end of this week what exclaimed the cook in profound astonishment are you going crazy no i know what i am about perhaps you intend to cook yourself no i dont that would close up the hotel look here young feller youre gettin too independent ive a great mind to leave you tonight you can do so if you want to said rodney indifferently then i will retorted gordon angrily bringing down his fist upon the table in vigorous emphasis oreville was fifty miles from helena and that was the nearest point as he supposed where a new cook could be obtained after supper rodney told jefferson pettigrew what had happened have i done right he asked yes we cant have any insubordination here there cant be two heads of one establishment send gordon to me the cook with a defiant look answered the summons i understand you want to leave gordon said jefferson pettigrew that depends i aint goin to have no boy dictatin to me then you insist upon having your own way without interference yes i do very well i accept your resignation do you wish to wait till the end of the week or to leave tonight i want to give it up tonight very well go to rodney and he will pay you what is due you are you goin to get along without a cook inquired gordon in surprise no what are you going to do then i shall employ parker in your place what does he know about cookin he ran a restaurant in new york for five years the first part of the time having charge of the cooking we shant suffer even if you do leave us i think i will stay said gordon in a submissive tone it is too late you have discharged yourself you cant stay here on any terms gordon left oreville the next day a sorely disappointed man for he had received more liberal pay than he was likely to command elsewhere the young landlord had triumphed chapter xxx the mysterious robbery at the end of a month jefferson pettigrew said ive been looking over the books rodney and i find the business is better than i expected how much did i agree to pay you a hundred and fifty dollars a month but if you think that it is too much too much why i am going to advance you to two hundred and fifty you cant be in earnest mr pettigrew i am entirely so that is at the rate of three thousand dollars a year yes but you are earning it you know i am only a boy that doesnt make any difference as long as you understand your business i am very grateful to you mr pettigrew my i can save two hundred dollars a month do so and i will find you a paying investment for the money what would jasper say to my luck thought rodney three months passed without any incident worth recording one afternoon a tall man wearing a high hat and a prince albert coat with a paste diamond of large size in his shirt bosom entered the public room of the miners rest and walking up to the bar prepared to register his name as he stood with his pen in his hand rodney recognized him not without amazement it was louis wheeler the railroad thief whom he had last seen in new york as for wheeler he had not taken any notice of the young clerk not suspecting that it was an old acquaintance who was familiar with his real character have you just arrived in montana mr wheeler asked rodney quietly as rodney had not had an opportunity to examine his signature in the register wheeler looked up in quiet surprise do you know me he asked yes dont you know me ill be blowed if it isnt the kid ejaculated wheeler as i run this hotel i dont care to be called a kid all right mr ropes mr ropes you are the most extraordinary boy i ever met am i who would have thought of your turning up as a montana landlord i wouldnt have thought of it myself four months ago but what brings you out here business answered wheeler in an important tone are you going to become a miner i may buy a mine if i find one to suit me i am glad you seem to be prospering can you give me a good room yes but i must ask a weeks advance payment how much twenty five dollars all right heres the money louis wheeler pulled out a well filled wallet and handed over two ten dollar bills and a five is that satisfactory he asked quite so you seem better provided with money than when i saw you last true i was then in temporary difficulty but i made a good turn in stocks and i am on my feet again rodney did not believe a word of this but as long as wheeler was able to pay his board he had no good excuse for refusing him accommodation that rascal here exclaimed jefferson when rodney informed him of wheelers arrival well thats beat all what has brought him out here business he says it may be the same kind of business that he had with me he will bear watching i agree with you mr pettigrew louis wheeler laid himself out to be social and agreeable and made himself quite popular with the other boarders at the hotel as jefferson and rodney said nothing about him he was taken at his own valuation and it was reported that he was a heavy capitalist from chicago who had come to montana to buy a mine this theory received confirmation both from his speech and actions on the following day he went about in oreville and examined the mines he expressed his opinion freely in regard to what he saw and priced one that was for sale at fifty thousand dollars i like this mine he said but i dont know enough about it to make an offer if it comes up to my expectations i will try it he must have been robbing a bank observed jefferson pettigrew nothing could exceed the cool assurance with which wheeler greeted jefferson and recalled their meeting in new york you misjudged me then mr pettigrew he said i believe upon my soul you looked upon me as an adventurer a confidence man you are not far from the truth mr wheeler answered jefferson bluntly well i forgive you our acquaintance was brief and you judged from superficial impressions perhaps so mr wheeler have you ever been west before no when you came to oreville had you any idea that i was here no if i had probably i should not have struck the town as i knew that you didnt have a favorable opinion of me i cant make out much of that fellow rodney said jefferson i cant understand his object in coming here he says he wants to buy a mine thats all a pretext he hasnt money enough to buy a mine or a tenth part of it he seems to have money yes he may have a few hundred dollars but mark my words he hasnt the slightest intention of buying a mine he has some object in view no doubt what it is is what i want to find out there was another way in which louis wheeler made himself popular among the miners of oreville he had a violin with him and in the evening he seated himself on the veranda and played popular tunes he had only a smattering in the way of musical training but the airs he played took better than classical music would have done even jefferson pettigrew enjoyed listening to home sweet home and the last rose of summer while the miners were captivated by merry dance tunes which served to enliven them after a long days work at the mines one day there was a sensation a man named john odonnell came down stairs from his room looking pale and agitated boys he said i have been robbed instantly all eyes were turned upon him of what have you been robbed odonnell asked jefferson of two hundred dollars in gold i was going to send it home to my wife in connecticut next week when did you miss it just now where did you keep it in a box under my bed when do you think it was taken last night what makes you think so i am a sound sleeper and last night you know was very dark i awoke with a start and seemed to hear footsteps i looked towards the door and saw a form gliding from the room why didnt you jump out of bed and seize the intruder whoever he was because i was not sure but it was all a dream i think now it was some thief who had just robbed me i think so too could you make out anything of his appearance i could only see the outlines of his figure he was a tall man he must have taken the money from under my bed did any one know that you had money concealed there i dont think i ever mentioned it it seems we have a thief among us said jefferson and almost unconsciously his glance rested on louis wheeler who was seated near john odonnell what do you think mr wheeler i think you are right mr pettigrew have you any suggestion to make asked jefferson have you by chance lost anything not that i am aware of is there any one else here who has been robbed no one spoke you asked me if i had any suggestions to make mr pettigrew said louis wheeler after a pause i have our worthy friend mr odonnell has met with a serious loss i move that we who are his friends make it up to him here is my contribution and he laid a five dollar bill on the table it was a happy suggestion and proved popular every one present came forward and tendered his contributions including jefferson who put down twenty five dollars mr wheeler gathered up the notes and gold and sweeping them to his hat went forward and tendered them to john odonnell take this money mr odonnell he said it is the free will offering of your friends i am sure i may say for them as for myself that it gives us all pleasure to help a comrade in trouble louis wheeler could have done nothing that would have so lifted him in the estimation of the miners and now he said as our friend is out of his trouble i will play you a few tunes on my violin and will end the day happily i cant make out that fellow rodney said jefferson when they were alone i believe he is the thief but he has an immense amount of nerve chapter xxxi mr wheeler explains probably there was no one at the hotel who suspected louis wheeler of being a thief except rodney and mr pettigrew his action in starting a contribution for john odonnell helped to make him popular he was establishing a reputation quite new to him and it was this fact probably that made him less prudent than he would otherwise have been as the loss had been made up the boarders at the miners rest ceased to talk of it but jefferson and his young assistant did not forget it i am sure wheeler is the thief but i dont know how to bring it home to him said jefferson one day when alone with rodney you might search him yes but what good would that do it might be found that he had money but one gold coin is like another and it would be impossible to identify it as the stolen property if odonnell had lost anything else except money it would be different i wish he would come to my chamber perhaps he would if he thought you were a sound sleeper that is an idea i think i can make use of it that evening when wheeler was present mr pettigrew managed to turn the conversation to the subject of sleeping i am a very sound sleeper he said i remember when i was at home sleeping many a time through a severe thunder storm dont you sometimes wake up in the middle of the night asked rodney very seldom if i am in good health its different with me said another of the company a step on the floor or the opening of the door will wake me up at any time i am glad i am not so easily roused if i had a fish horn said rodney laughing i should be tempted to come up in the night and give it a blast before your door that might wake me up said mr pettigrew i wouldnt advise you to try it or the other boarders might get up an indignation meeting the same evening jefferson pettigrew took out a bag of gold and carelessly displayed it are you not afraid of being robbed mr pettigrew asked rodney oh no i never was robbed in my life how much money have you there i dont know exactly perhaps six hundred dollars said pettigrew in an indifferent tone among those who listened to this conversation with interest was louis wheeler rodney did not fail to see the covetous gleam of his eyes when the gold was displayed the fact was that wheeler was getting short of cash and at the time he took john odonnells money for he was the thief he had but about twenty dollars left and of this he contributed five to the relief of the man he had robbed his theft realized him two hundred dollars but this would not last him long as the expenses of living at the miners rest were considerable he was getting tired of oreville but wanted to secure some additional money before he left it the problem was whom to make his second victim it would not have occurred to him to rob jefferson pettigrew of whom he stood in wholesome fear but for the admission that he was an unusually sound sleeper even then he would have felt uncertain whether it would pay but the display of the bag of money and the statement that it contained six hundred dollars in gold proved a tempting bait if i can capture that bag of gold thought wheeler i shall have enough money to set me up in some new place there wont be much risk about it for pettigrew sleeps like a top i will venture it jefferson pettigrews chamber was on the same floor as his own it was the third room from no which mr wheeler occupied as a general thing the occupants of the miners rest went to bed early mining is a fatiguing business and those who follow it have little difficulty in dropping off to sleep the only persons who were not engaged in this business were louis wheeler and rodney ropes as a rule the hotel was closed at half past ten and before this all were in bed and sleeping soundly when wheeler went to bed he said to himself this will probably be my last night in this tavern i will go from here to helena and if things turn out right i may be able to make my stay there profitable i shant dare to stay here long after relieving pettigrew of his bag of gold unlike jefferson pettigrew wheeler was a light sleeper he had done nothing to induce fatigue and had no difficulty in keeping awake till half past eleven then lighting a candle he examined his watch and ascertained the time it will be safe enough now he said to himself he rose from his bed and drew on his trousers then in his stocking feet he walked along the corridor till he stood in front of jefferson pettigrews door he was in doubt as to whether he would not be obliged to pick the lock but on trying the door he found that it was not fastened he opened it and stood within the chamber cautiously he glanced at the bed mr pettigrew appeared to be sleeping soundly its all right thought louis wheeler now where is the bag of gold it was not in open view but a little search showed that the owner had put it under the bed he isnt very sharp thought wheeler he is playing right into my hands door unlocked and bag of gold under the bed he certainly is a very unsuspicious man however that is all the better for me really there isnt much credit in stealing where all is made easy for you there seemed to be nothing to do but to take the gold from its place of deposit and carry it back to his own room while there were a good many lodgers in the hotel there seemed to be little risk about this as every one was asleep of course should the bag be found in his room that would betray him but mr wheeler proposed to empty the gold coins into his gripsack and throw the bag out of the window into the back yard well here goes said wheeler cheerfully as he lifted the bag and prepared to leave the chamber but at this critical moment an unexpected sound struck terror into his soul it was the sound of a key being turned in the lock nervously wheeler hastened to the door and tried it it would not open evidently it had been locked from the outside what could it mean at the same time there was a series of knocks on the outside of the door it was the signal that had been agreed upon between mr pettigrew and rodney jefferson had given his key to rodney who had remained up and on the watch for mr wheelers expected visit he too was in his stocking feet as soon as he saw wheeler enter his friends chamber he stole up and locked the door on the outide then when he heard the thief trying to open the door he rained a shower of knocks on the panel instantly jefferson pettigrew sprang out of bed and proceeded to act what are you doing here he demanded seizing wheeler in his powerful grasp where am i asked wheeler in a tone of apparent bewilderment oh its you mr wheeler said jefferson dont you know where you are oh it is my friend mr pettigrew is it possible i am in your room it is very possible now tell me why you are here i am really ashamed to find myself in this strange position it is not the first time that i have got into trouble from walking in my sleep oh you were walking in your sleep yes friend petttigrew it has been a habit of mine since i was a boy but it seems very strange that i should have been led to your room how could i get in wasnt the door locked it is locked now it is strange i dont understand it said wheeler passing his hand over his forehead perhaps you understand why you have that bag of gold in your hand can it be possible ejaculated wheeler in well counterfeited surprise i dont know how to account for it i think i can rodney unlock the door and come in the key was turned in the lock and rodney entered with a lighted candle in his hand you see rodney that i have a late visitor you will notice also that my bag of gold seems to have had an attraction for him i am ashamed i dont really know how to explain it except in this way when you displayed the gold last night it drew my attention and i must have dreamed of it it was this which drew me unconsciously to your door it is certainly an interesting fact in mental science it would have been a still more interesting fact if you had carried off the gold i might even have done that in my unconsciousness but of course i should have discovered it tomorrow morning and would have returned it to you i dont feel by any means sure of that look here mr wheeler if that is your name you cant pull the wool over my eyes you are a thief neither more nor less how can you misjudge me so mr pettigrew because i know something of your past history it is clear to me now that you were the person that stole john odonnells money indeed mr pettigrew it is useless to protest how much of it have you left louis wheeler was compelled to acknowledge the theft and returned one hundred dollars to jefferson pettigrew now said jefferson i advise you to leave the hotel at once if the boys find out that you are a thief you will stand a chance of being lynched get out the next morning jefferson pettigrew told the other boarders that louis wheeler had had a sudden call east and it was not for a week that he revealed to them the real reason of wheelers departure chapter xxxii rodney falls into a trap rodney had reason to be satisfied with his position as landlord of the miners rest his pay was large and enabled him to put away a good sum every month but his hours were long and he was too closely confined for a boy of his age at the end of three months he showed this in his appearance his good friend pettigrew saw it and said one day rodney you are looking fagged out you need a change does that mean that you are going to discharge me asked rodney with a smile it means that i am going to give you a vacation but what can i do if i take a vacation i should not like lounging around oreville with nothing to do such a vacation would do you no good ill tell you the plan i have for you i own a small mine in babcock about fifty miles north of oreville i will send you up to examine it and make a report to me can you ride on horseback yes that is well for you will have to make your trip in that way there are no railroads in that direction nor any other way of travel except on foot or on horseback a long ride like that with hours daily in the open air will do you good what do you say to it i should like nothing better replied rodney with his eyes sparkling only how will you get along without me i have a man in my employ at the mines who will do part of your work and i will have a general oversight of things so you need not borrow any trouble on that account do you think you can find your way give me the general direction and i will guarantee to do so when shall i start day after tomorrow that will give me one day for making arrangements at nine the appointed morning mr pettigrews own horse stood saddled at the door and rodney in traveling costume with a small satchel in his hand mounted and rode away waving a smiling farewell to his friend and employer rodney did not hurry and so consumed two days and a half in reaching babcock here he was cordially received by the superintendent whom jefferson pettigrew had placed in charge of the mine every facility was afforded him to examine into the management of things and he found all satisfactory this part of his journey therefore may be passed over but his return trip was destined to be more exciting riding at an easy jog rodney had got within fifteen miles of oreville when there was an unexpected interruption two men started out from the roadside or rather from one side of the bridle path for there was no road and advanced to meet him with drawn revolvers halt there one of them exclaimed in a commanding tone rodney drew bridle and gazed at the two men in surprise what do you want of me he asked dismount instantly why should i what right have you to interfere with my journey might gives right said one of the men sententiously it will be best for you to do as we bid you without too much back talk what are you highwaymen asked rodney youd better not talk too much get off that horse rodney saw that remonstrance was useless and obeyed the order one of the men seized the horse by the bridle and led him walk in front he said where are you going to take me asked rodney you will know in due time i hope you will let me go urged rodney beginning to be uneasy i am expected home this evening or at all event i want to get there no doubt you do but the miners rest will have to get along without you for a while do you know me then yes you are the boy clerk at the miners rest you both put up there about two weeks since said rodney examining closely the faces of the two men right you are kid what can you possibly want of me dont be too curious you will know in good time rodney remembered that the two men had remained at the hotel for a day and night they spent the day in wandering around oreville he had supposed when they came that they were in search of employment but they had not applied for work and only seemed actuated by curiosity what could be their object in stopping him now he could not understand it would have been natural to suppose they wanted money but they had not asked for any as yet he had about fifty dollars in his pocketbook and he would gladly have given them this if it would have insured his release but not a word had been said about money they kept on their journey montana is a mountainous state and they were now in the hilly regions they kept on for perhaps half an hour gradually getting upon higher ground until they reached a precipitous hill composed largely of rock here the two men stopped as if they had reached their journeys end one of them advanced to the side of the hill and unlocked a thick wooden door which at first had failed to attract rodneys attention the door swung open revealing a dark passage cut partly through stone and partly through earth inside on the floor was a bell of good size one of the men lifted the bell and rang it loudly what does that mean thought rodney who felt more curious than apprehensive he soon learned a curious looking negro stunted in growth for he was no taller than a boy of ten came out from the interior and stood at the entrance of the cave if such it was his face was large and hideous there was a hump on his back and his legs were not a match one being shorter than the other so that as he walked his motion was a curious one he bent a scrutinizing glance on rodney well caesar is dinner ready asked one of the men no massa not yet let it be ready then as soon as possible but first lead the way we are coming in he started ahead leading the horse for the entrance was high enough to admit the passage of the animal push on said the other signing to rodney to precede him rodney did so knowing remonstrance to be useless his curiosity was excited he wondered how long the passage was and whither it led the way was dark but here and there in niches was a kerosene lamp that faintly relieved the otherwise intense blackness i have read about such places thought rodney but i never expected to get into one the wonder is that they should bring me here i cant understand their object rodney followed his guide for perhaps two hundred and fifty feet when they emerged into a large chamber of irregular shape lighted by four large lamps set on a square wooden table there were two rude cots in one corner and it was here apparently that his guides made their home there was a large cooking stove in one part of the room and an appetizing odor showed that caesar had the dinner under way rodney looked about him in curiosity he could not decide whether the cave was natural or artificial probably it was a natural cave which had been enlarged by the hand of man now hurry up the dinner caesar said one of the guides we are all hungry yes massa responded the obedient black rodney felt hungry also and hoped that he would have a share of the dinner later he trusted to find out the object of his new acquaintances in kidnaping him dinner was soon ready it was simple but rodney thoroughly enjoyed it during the meal silence prevailed after it his new acquaintances produced pipes and began to smoke they offered rodney a cigarette but he declined it i dont smoke he said are you a sunday school kid asked one in a sneering tone well perhaps so how long have you lived at oreville about four months who is the head of the settlement there jefferson pettigrew he is the moneyed man is he yes is he a friend of yours he is my best friend answered rodney warmly he thinks a good deal of you then i think he does where have you been on a journey yes to the town of babcock did he send you yes what interest has he there he is chief owner of a mine there humph i suppose you would like to know why we brought you here i would very much we propose to hold you for ransom but why should you i am only a poor boy you are the friend of jefferson pettigrew he is a rich man if he wants you back he must pay a round sum it was all out now these men were emulating a class of outlaws to be found in large numbers in italy and sicily and were trading upon human sympathy and levying a tax upon human friendship chapter xxxiii underground rodney realized his position the alternative was not a pleasant one either he must remain in the power of these men or cost his friend mr pettigrew a large sum as ransom there was little hope of changing the determination of his captors but he resolved to try what he could do mr pettigrew is under no obligations to pay money out for me he said i am not related to him and have not yet known him six months that makes no difference you are his friend and he likes you that is the very reason why i should not wish him to lose money on my account oh very well it will be bad for you is he doesnt come to your help why what do you propose to do to me asked rodney boldly better not ask was the significant reply but i want to know i want to realize my position the least that will happen to you is imprisonment in this cave for a term of years i dont think i should like it but you would get tired of standing guard over me we might and in that case there is the other thing what other thing if we get tired of keeping you here we shall make short work with you would you murder me asked rodney horror struck as he might well be for death seems terrible to a boy just on the threshold of life we might be obliged to do so rodney looked in the faces of his captors and he saw nothing to encourage him they looked like desperate men who would stick at nothing to carry out their designs i dont see why you should get hold of me he said if you had captured mr pettigrew himself you would stand a better chance of making it pay there is no chance of capturing pettigrew if there were we would prefer him to you a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush how much ransom do you propose to ask this rodney said thinking that if it were a thousand dollars he might be able to make it good to his friend jefferson but he was destined to be disappointed five thousand dollars answered the chief speaker five thousand dollars ejaculated rodney in dismay five thousand dollars for a boy like me that is the sum we want if it were one thousand i think you might get it one thousand repeated the other scornfully that wouldnt half pay us then suppose you call it two thousand it wont do then i suppose i must make up my mind to remain a prisoner five thousand dollars wouldnt be much to a rich man like pettigrew we have inquired and found out that he is worth at least a hundred thousand dollars five thousand is only a twentieth part of this sum you can do as you please but you had better ask a reasonable amount if you expect to get it we dont want advice we shall manage things in our own way convinced that further discussion would be unavailing rodney relapsed into silence but now his captors proceeded to unfold their plans one of them procured a bottle of ink some paper and a pen and set them on the table come up here boy and write to mr pettigrew he said in a tone of authority what shall i write tell him that you are a prisoner and that you will not be released unless he pays five thousand dollars i dont want to write that it will be the same as asking him to pay it for me that is what we mean him to understand i wont write it rodney knew his danger but he looked resolutely into the eyes of the men who held his life in their hands his voice did not waver for he was a manly and courageous boy the boys got grit said one of the men to the other yes but it wont save him boy are you going to write what i told you no are you not afraid that we will kill you you have power to do it dont you want to live yes life is sweet to a boy of sixteen then why dont you write because i think it would be taking a mean advantage of mr pettigrew you are a fool roderick what shall we do with him tell him simply to write that he is in our hands well thought of boy will you do that yes rodney gave his consent for he was anxious that mr pettigrew should know what had prevented him from coming home when he was expected very well write you will know what to say rodney drew the paper to him and wrote as follows dear mr pettigrew on my way home i was stopped by two men who have confined me in a cave and wont let me go unless a sum of money is paid for my ransom i dont know what to do you will know better than i rodney ropes his chief captor took the note and read it aloud that will do he said now he will believe us when we say that you are in our hands he signed to rodney to rise from the table and took his place drawing a pile of paper to him he penned the following note rodney ropes is in our hands he wants his liberty and we want money send us five thousand dollars or arrange a meeting at which it can be delivered to us and he shall go free otherwise his death be on your hands his captors rodney noticed that this missive was written in a handsome business hand you write a handsome hand he said i ought to was the reply i was once bookkeeper in a large business house and what here rodney hesitated what made me an outlaw you mean to ask yes my nature i suppose i wasnt cut out for sober humdrum life dont you think you would have been happier no preaching kid i had enough of that when i used to go to church in my old home in missouri here caesar yes massa you know oreville yes massa go over there and take this letter with you ask for jefferson pettigrew and mind you dont tell him where we live only if he asks about me and my pal say we are desperate men have each killed a round dozen of fellows that stood in our way and will stick at nothing all right massa said caesar with an appreciative grin how shall i go massa you can take the kids horse ride to within a mile of oreville then tether the horse where he wont easily be found and walk over to the mines do you understand yes massa he wont probably give you any money but he may give you a letter bring it safely to me caesar nodded and vanished for an hour the two men smoked their pipes and chatted then they rose and the elder said we are going out kid for a couple of hours are you afraid to stay alone why should i be thats the way to talk i wont caution you not to escape for it would take a smarter lad then you to do it if you are tired you can lie down on the bed and rest all right i am sorry we havent got the morning paper for you to look over said his captor with a smile the carrier didnt leave it this morning i can get along without it i dont feel much like reading you neednt feel worried youll be out of this tomorrow if jefferson pettigrew is as much your friend as you think he is the only thing that troubles me is the big price you charge at your hotel good the kid has a good wit of his own after all we wouldnt mind keeping you with us it might pay you better than working for pettigrew i hope youll excuse my saying it but i dont like the business you may change your mind at your age we wouldnt either of us like the sort of life we are leading come john the two men went out but did not allow rodney to accompany them to the place of exit left to himself rodney could think soberly of his plight he could not foresee whether his captivity would be brief or prolonged after a time the spirit of curiosity seized him he felt tempted to explore the cavern in which he was confined he took a lamp and followed in a direction opposite to that taken by his captors the cave he found was divided into several irregularly shaped chambers he walked slowly holding up the lamp to examine the walls of the cavern in one passage he stopped short for something attracted his attention something the sight of which made his heart beat quicker and filled him with excitement chapter xxxiv rodneys discovery there was a good reason for rodneys excitement the walls of the subterranean passage revealed distinct and rich indications of gold there was a time and that not long before when they would have revealed nothing to rodney but since his residence at oreville he had more than once visited the mines and made himself familiar with surface indications of mineral deposit he stopped short and scanned attentively the walls of the passage if i am not mistaken he said to himself this will make one of the richest mines in montana but after all what good will it do me here am i a prisoner unable to leave the cave or communicate with my friends if mr pettigrew knew what i do he would feel justified in paying the ransom these men want rodney wondered how these rich deposits had failed to attract the attention of his captors but he soon settled upon the conclusion that they had no knowledge of mines or mining and were ignorant of the riches that were almost in their grasp shall i enlighten them he asked himself it was a question which he could not immediately answer he resolved to be guided by circumstances in order not to excite suspicion he retraced his steps to the apartment used by his captors as a common sitting room carefully fixing in his mind the location of the gold ore we must now follow the messenger who had gone to oreville with a letter from rodneys captors as instructed he left his horse or rather rodneys tethered at some distance from the settlement and proceeded on foot to the miners rest his strange appearance excited attention and curiosity both these feelings would have been magnified had it been known on what errand he came where can i find mr jefferson pettigrew he asked of a man whom he saw on the veranda at the griffin mine answered the other removing the pipe from his mouth where is that over yonder are you a miner no i know nothing about mines then why do you want to see jefferson i thought you might want a chance to work in the mine no i have other business with him business of importance added the black dwarf emphatically if that is the case ill take you to him i am always glad to be of service to jefferson thank you he will thank you too the man walked along with a long swinging gait which made it difficult for caesar to keep up with him so you have business with jefferson said the man with the pipe whose curiosity had been excited yes of what sort i will tell him answered caesar shortly so its private is it yes if he wants to tell you he will thats fair well come along am i walking too fast for you your legs are much longer than mine thats so you are a little shrimp i declare a walk of twenty minutes brought them to the griffin mine jefferson pettigrew was standing near giving directions to a party of miners jefferson said the man with the pipe heres a chap that wants to see you on business of importance that is he says it is jefferson pettigrew wheeled round and looked at caesar well he said what is it i have a letter for you massa give it to me jefferson took the letter and cast his eye over it as he read it his countenance changed and became stern and severe do you know what is in this letter he asked yes come with me he led caesar to a place out of earshot what fiends game is this he demanded sternly i cant tell you massa im not in it who are those men that have written to me i dont know their right names i calls em massa john and massa dick it seems they have trapped a boy friend of mine rodney ropes did you see him yes i gave him a good dinner that is well if they should harm a hair of his head i wouldnt rest till i had called them to account where have they got the boy concealed i couldnt tell you massa you mean you wont tell me yes it would be as much as my life is worth humph well i suppose you must be faithful to your employer do you know that these men want me to pay five thousand dollars for the return of the boy yes i heard them talking about it that is a new kind of rascality do they expect you to bring back an answer yes massa i must think what will they do to the boy if i dont give them the money they might kill him if they do but i must have time to think the matter over are you expected to go back this afternoon yes can you get back it must be a good distance i can get back stay here i will consult some of my friends and see if i can raise the money very well massa one of those whom jefferson called into consultation was the person who had guided caesar to the griffin mine quickly the proprietor of the miners rest unfolded the situation now he said i want two of you to follow this misshapen dwarf and find out where he comes from i want to get hold of the scoundrels who sent him to me i will be one said the man with the pipe very well fred and i will go with fred said a long limbed fellow who had been a kansas cowboy i accept you otto go armed and dont lose sight of him shall you send the money not i i will send a letter that will encourage them to hope for it i want to gain time any instructions jefferson only this if you see these men capture or kill them all right chapter xxxv a bloody conflict this was the letter that was handed to caesar i have received your note i must have time to think and time perhaps to get hold of the gold dont harm a hair of the boys head if so i will hunt you to death jefferson pettigrew ps meet me tomorrow morning at the rocky gorge at the foot of black mountain ten oclock caesar took the letter and bent his steps in the direction of the place where he had tethered his horse he did not observe that he was followed by two men who carefully kept him in sight without attracting attention to themselves when caesar reached the place where he had tethered the horse he was grievously disappointed at not finding him one of the miners in roaming about had come upon the animal and knowing him to be jefferson pettigrews property untied him and rode him back to oreville the dwarf threw up his hands in dismay the horse is gone he said in his deep bass voice and now i must walk back ten long miles and get a flogging at the end for losing time its hard luck he groaned the loss was fortunate for fred and otto who would otherwise have found it hard to keep up with the dwarf caesar breathed a deep sigh and then started on his wearisome journey had the ground been even it would have troubled him less but there was a steep upward grade and his short legs were soon weary not so with his pursuers both of whom were long limbed and athletic we will go back now to the cave and the captors of rodney they waited long and impatiently for the return of their messenger having no knowledge of the loss of the horse they could not understand what detained caesar do you think the rascal has played us false said roderick he would be afraid to this man pettigrew might try to bribe him it would be cheaper than to pay five thousand dollars he wouldnt dare he knows what would happen to him said john grimly then why should he be so long that i cant tell suppose we go out to meet him i begin to feel anxious lest we have trusted him too far i am with you the two outlaws took the path which led to oreville and walked two miles before they discovered caesar coming towards them at a slow and melancholy gait there he is and on foot what does it mean he will tell us here now you black imp where is the horse demanded roderick i done lost him massa lost him youll get a flogging for this unless you bring good news did you see jefferson pettigrew yes massa did he give you any money no he gave me this letter roderick snatched it from his hand and showed it to john it seems satisfactory he said now how did you lose the horse caesar told him you didnt fasten him tight beg your pardon massa but i took good care of that well hes gone was probably stolen that is unfortunate however you may not have been to blame luckily for caesar the letter which he brought was considered satisfactory and this palliated his fault in losing the horse the country was so uneven that the two outlaws did not observe that they were followed until they came to the entrance of the cave then before opening the door john looked round and caught sight of fred and otto eying them from a little distance he instantly took alarm look he said we are followed look behind you his brother turned and came to the same conclusion caesar said roderick did you ever see those men before no massa they must have followed you from oreville hello you two he added striding towards the miners what do you want here fred and otto had accomplished their object in ascertaining the place where rodney was confined and no longer cared for concealment none of your business retorted fred independently the place is as free to us as to you are you spies i dont intend to answer any of your questions clear out of here commanded roderick in a tone of authority suppose we dont roderick was a man of quick temper and had never been in the habit of curbing it he was provoked by the independent tone of the speaker and without pausing to think of the imprudence of his actions he raised his rifle and pointing at fred shot him in the left arm the two miners were both armed and were not slow in accepting the challenge simultaneously they raised their rifles and fired at the two men the result was that both fell seriously wounded and caesar set up a howl of dismay not so much for his masters as from alarm for himself fred and otto came forward and stood looking down upon the outlaws who were in the agonies of death it was our lives or theirs said fred coolly for he had been long enough in montana to become used to scenes of bloodshed yes answered otto i think these two men are the notorious dixon brothers who are credited with a large number of murders the country will be well rid of them roderick turned his glazing eyes upon the tall miner i wish i had killed you he muttered no doubt you do it wouldnt have been your first murder dont kill me massa pleaded caesar in tones of piteous entreaty i dont know answered fred that depends on yourself if you obey us strictly we will spare you try me massa you black hound said roderick hoarsely if i were not disabled id kill you myself here was a new danger for poor caesar for he knew rodericks fierce temper dont let him kill me he exclaimed affrighted he shall do you no harm will you obey me tell me what you want massa is the boy these men captured inside yes massa open the cave then we want him dont do it said roderick but caesar saw at a glance that his old master of whom he stood in wholesome fear was unable to harm him and he proceeded to unlock the door go and call the boy said fred caesar disappeared within the cavern and soon emerged with rodney following him are you unhurt asked fred anxiously yes and overjoyed to see you how came you here we followed the nigger from oreville what happened afterwards rodney did not need to inquire for the two outstretched figures stiffening in death revealed it to him they are the dixon brothers are they not asked fred turning to caesar yes massa then we are entitled to a thousand dollars each for their capture i have never before shed blood but i dont regret ending the career of these scoundrels half an hour later the two outlaws were dead and rodney and his friends were on their way back to oreville chapter xxxvi the rodney mine rodney was received by jefferson pettigrew with open arms welcome home boy he said i was very much worried about you i was rather uneasy about myself returned rodney well its all over and alls well that ends well you are free and there has been no money paid out fred and otto have done a good thing in ridding the world of the notorious dixon brothers they will be well paid for i understand there is a standing reward of one thousand dollars for each of them dead or alive i dont know but you ought to have a share of this for it was through you that the outlaws were trapped no mr pettigrew they are welcome to the reward if i am not mistaken i shall make a good deal more out of it than they what do you mean upon this rodney told the story of what he had seen in the cavern when i said i i meant we mr pettigrew i think if the gold there is as plentiful as i think it is we shall do well to commence working it it is yours rodney by right of first discovery i prefer that you should share it with me we will go over tomorrow and make an examination was there any one else who seemed to have a claim to the cave except the dixons no the negro caesar will still be there perhaps we can easily get rid of him the next day the two friends went over to the cavern caesar was still there but he had an unsettled restless look and seemed undecided what to do what are you going to do caesar asked pettigrew are you going to stay here i dont know massa i dont want to lib here im afraid ill see the ghostes of my old massas but i havent got no money if you had money where would you go id go to chicago i used to be a whitewasher and i reckon id get work at my old trade thats where you are sensible caesar this is no place for you now ill tell you what ill do ill give you a hundred dollars and you can go where you like but i shall want you to go away at once ill go right off massa said caesar overjoyed i dont want to come here no more have you got anything belonging to you in the cave no massa only a little kit of clothes take them and go in fifteen minutes caesar had bidden farewell to his home and rodney and jefferson were left in sole possession of the cavern now mr pettigrew come and let me show you what i saw i hope i have made no mistake rodney led the way to the narrow passage already described by the light of a lantern mr pettigrew examined the walls for five minutes not a word was said well what do you think of it asked rodney anxiously only this that you have hit upon the richest gold deposits in montana here is a mining prospect that will make us both rich i am glad i was not mistaken said rodney simply your capture by the dixon brothers will prove to have been the luckiest event in your life i shall lose no time in taking possession in our joint name there was great excitement when the discovery of the gold deposit was made known in connection with the killing of the outlaws it was noised far and wide the consequence was that there was an influx of mining men and within a week rodney and jefferson were offered a hundred thousand dollars for a half interest in the mine by a chicago syndicate say a hundred and fifty thousand and we accept the offer said jefferson pettigrew after a little haggling this offer was accepted and rodney found himself the possessor of seventy five thousand dollars in cash it was fortunate for me when i fell in with you mr pettigrew he said and no less fortunate for me rodney this mine will bring us in a rich sum for our share besides the cash we already have in hand if you dont object mr pettigrew i should like to go to new york and continue my education you can look after my interest here and i shall be willing to pay you anything you like for doing so there wont be any trouble about that rodney i dont blame you for wanting to obtain an education it isnt in my line you can come out once a year and see what progress we are making the mine will be called the rodney mine after you the miners rest was sold to the steward as mr pettigrew was too busy to attend to it and in a week rodney was on his way to new york chapter xxxvii conclusion otis goodnow arrived at his place of business a little earlier than usual and set himself to looking over his mail among other letters was one written on paper bearing the name of the fifth avenue hotel he came to this after a time and read it it ran thus dear sir i was once in your employ though you may not remember my name i was in the department of mr redwood and there i became acquainted with jasper redwood his nephew i was discharged it is needless to recall why i had saved nothing and of course i was greatly embarrassed i could not readily obtain another place and in order to secure money to pay living expenses i entered into an arrangement with jasper redwood to sell me articles putting in more than i paid for these i was enabled to sell at a profit to smaller stores this was not as profitable as it might have been to me as i was obliged to pay jasper a commission for his agency well after a time it was ascertained that articles were missing and search was made for the thief through a cunningly devised scheme of jaspers the theft was ascribed to rodney ropes a younger clerk and he was discharged ropes was a fine young fellow and i have always been sorry that he got into trouble through our agency but there seemed no help for it it must rest on him or us he protested his innocence but was not believed i wish to say now that he was absolutely innocent and only jasper and myself were to blame if you doubt my statement i will call today and you may confront me with jasper i desire that justice should be done philip carton call mr redwood said the merchant summoning a boy in five minutes mr redwood entered the office of his employer you sent for me sir yes mr redwood cast your eye over this letter james redwood read the letter and his face showed the agitation he felt i dont know anything about this mr goodnow he said at last it ought to be inquired into i agree with you if my nephew is guilty i want to know it we will wait till the writer of this letter calls do you remember him yes sir he was discharged for intemperance at twelve oclock philip carton made his appearance and asked to be conducted to mr goodnows private office you are the writer of this letter asked the merchant yes sir and you stand by the statement it contains yes sir why at this late day have you made a confession because i wish to do justice to rodney ropes who has been unjustly accused and also because i have been meanly treated by jasper redwood who has thrown me over now that he has no further use for me are you willing to repeat your statement before him i wish to do so call jasper redwood sherman said the merchant addressing himself to sherman white a boy recently taken into his employ jasper entered the office rather surprised at the summons when he saw his accomplice he changed color and looked confused jasper said the merchant read this letter and tell me what you have to say in reply jasper ran his eye over the letter while his color came and went well its a lie said jasper hoarsely do you still insist that the articles taken from my stock were taken by rodney ropes yes sir what do you say mr carton not one was taken by rodney ropes jasper and i are responsible for them all what proof can you bring mr james redwood will recall the purchase i made at the time of the thefts he will recall that i always purchased of jasper that is true said mr redwood in a troubled voice do you confess jasper redwood no sir if you will tell the truth i will see that no harm comes to you i want to clear this matter up jasper thought the matter over he saw that the game was up and decided rapidly that confession was the best policy very well sir if i must i will do so but that man put me up to it you did not need any putting up to it i wish young ropes were here that i might clear him as if in answer to the wish a bronzed and manly figure appeared at the office door it was rodney but taller and more robust than when he left the store nearly a year before rodney ropes ejaculated jasper in great surprise yes jasper i came here to see you and beg you to free me from the false charge which was brought against me when i was discharged from this store i didnt find you in your usual places and was directed here ropes said mr goodnow your innocence has been established this man indicating philip carton has confessed that it was he and jasper who stole the missing articles i am thankful that my character has been cleared i am ready to take you back into my employ thank you sir but i have now no need of a position i shall be glad if you will retain jasper you are very generous to one who has done so much to injure you indirectly he put me in the way of making a fortune if you will retain him mr goodnow i will guarantee to make up any losses you may incur from him how is this are you able to make this guarantee i am worth seventy five thousand dollars in money besides being owner of a large mining property in montana this is truly wonderful and you have accumulated all this since you left my store yes sir rodney said jasper going up to his old rival and offering his hand i am sorry i tried to injure you it was to save myself but i see now how meanly i acted that speech has saved you said the merchant go back to your work i will give you another chance will you take me back also mr goodnow asked philip carton the merchant hesitated no mr carton said rodney i will look out for you i will send you to montana with a letter to my partner you can do better there than here tears came into the eyes of the exclerk thank you he said gratefully i should prefer it i will promise to turn over a new leaf and justify your recommendation come to see me this evening at the fifth avenue hotel and i will arrange matters shall you stay in the city long ropes asked the merchant about a week come and dine with me on tuesday evening thank you sir later in the day rodney sought out his old room mate mike flynn he found mike in a bad case he had a bad cold but did not dare to give up work because he wouldnt be able to meet his bills he was still in the employ of the district telegraph company give the company notice mike said rodney henceforth i will take care of you you can look upon me as your rich uncle he added with a smile i will be your servant rodney not a bit of it you will be my friend but you must obey me implicitly i am going to send you to school and give you a chance to learn something next week i shall return to dr sampsons boarding school and you will go with me as my friend and room mate but rodney you will be ashamed of me i am awfully shabby you wont be long you shall be as well dressed as i am a week later the two boys reached the school it would have been hard for any of mikes old friends to recognize him in the handsomely dressed boy who accompanied rodney really mike you are quite good looking now that you are well dressed said rodney oh go away with you rodney its fooling me you are not a bit of it now i want you to improve your time and learn as fast as you can i will rodney a year later rodney left school but he kept mike there two years longer there had been a great change in the telegraph boy who was quick to learn he expects when he leaves school to join rodney in montana i will not attempt to estimate rodneys present wealth but he is already prominent in financial circles in his adopted state philip carton is prospering and is respected by his new friends who know nothing of his earlier life as i write rodney has received a letter from his old guardian benjamin fielding the letter came from montreal my dear rodney he wrote i have worked hard to redeem the past and restore to you your fortune i have just succeeded and send you the amount with interest it leaves me little or nothing but my mind is relieved i hope you have not had to suffer severely from my criminal carelessness and that you will live long to enjoy what rightfully belongs to you in reply rodney wrote please draw on me for fifty thousand dollars i do not need it and you do five years from now if you can spare the money you may send it to me till then use it without interest i am worth much more than the sum my father intrusted to you for me this offer was gratefully accepted and mr fielding is now in new york where he is likely to experience a return of his former prosperity as for rodney his trials are over they made a man of him and proved a blessing in disguise
