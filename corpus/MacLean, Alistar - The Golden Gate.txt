military precision marked with a meticulousness that matched in degree if not in scope the allied landings in wartime europe it was the preparations had to be made in total stealth and secrecy they were a splitsecond coordination had to be achieved it was ail the men had to be rehearsed and trained over and over again until they played their parts perfectly and automatically they were so trained every eventuality every possible departure from the planned campaign had to be catered for it was and their confidence in their ability to carry out their plan irrespective of reversals and departures from the norm had to be total it was confidence was a quality exuded by their leader peter branson branson was thirtyeight years old just under six feet tall strongly built with black hair pleasant features lips that were curved in an almost perpetual smile and light blue eyes that had forgotten how to smile many years ago he was dressed in a policemans uniform but he was not a policeman neither was any of the eleven men with them in that disused truckers garage not far from the banks of lake merced halfway between daly city to the south and san francisco to the north although three were attired in the same uniform as branson the single vehicle there looked sadly out of place in what was in effect nothing more than an openended shed it was a bus but barely by normal standards qualified for the term it was an opulently gleaming monster which above shoulder level was composed except for the stainless steel crossover struts entirely of slightly tinted glass there was no regular seating as such there were about thirty swivel chairs anchored to the floor but scattered seemingly at random with deep armrests and aircrafttype swingout diningtables housed in each armrest towards the rear there was a cloakroom and a remarkably wellstocked bar beyond that there was a rear observation deck the floor of which had for the moment been removed to reveal the cavernous baggage department this was filled to near capacity but not with baggage this enormous storagespace seven and a half feet wide by the same in length held among other things two petroldriven electric generators two twentyinch searchlights a variety of smaller ones two very peculiarlooking missilelike weapons with mounting tripods machinepistols a large crated unmarked wooden box and four smaller boxes wooden but greased and a variety of other items of material conspicuous among which were large coils of rope bransons men were still loading the coach one of six ever made had cost branson ninety thousand dollars for the purposes for which he intended to use it he considered this figure a trifling investment he was buying the coach he had told the detroit firm as an agent for a publicityshy millionaire who was also an eccentric who wanted it painted yellow and yellow it had been when it was delivered it was now a gleaming translucent white two of the remaining five coaches had been bought by genuine and extrovert millionaires both of whom intended them for luxurious personal vacation travel both buses had rear ramps to accommodate their minicars both presumably would rest for about fifty weeks a year in their speciallybuilt garages the other three buses had been bought by the government the dawn was not yet in the sky the other three white buses were in a garage in downtown san francisco the big sliding doors were closed and bolted in a canvas chair in a corner a man in plain clothes a sawnoff riot gun held on his lap by flaccid hands slept peacefully he had been dozing when the two intruders arrived and was now blissfully unaware that he had sunk into an even deeper sleep because hed inhaled the singlesecond squirt from the gas gun without being aware of the fact he would wake up within the hour almost equally unaware of what had happened and would be extremely unlikely to admit to his superiors that his vigilance had been a degree less than eternal the three buses looked indistinguishable from bransons at least externally although the centre one was markedly different in two respects one visible the other not it weighed two tons more than its companions for bulletproof glass is a great deal heavier than ordinary plate glass and those panoramic buses had an enormous glass area and the interior of the coach was nothing less than a sybarites dream which was no less than what one would expect for the private transportation of the countrys chief executive the presidential coach had two huge facing sofas so deep so soft and so comfortable that the overweight man possessed of prudent foresight would have thought twice about ensconcing himself in either of them for regaining the vertical would have called for an apoplectic amount of willpower or the use of a crane there were four armchairs constructed along the same treacherously voluptuous lines and that in the way of seating accommodation was that there were cunningly concealed spigots for icewater scattered copper coffee tables and gleaming goldplated vases awaiting their daily consignment of fresh flowers behind this section were the washroom and the bar a bar whose capacious refrigerators in this particular and unusual instance were stocked largely with fruit juices and soft drinks in deference to the customs of the presidents guests of honour who were arabs and muslims beyond this again in a glassedin compartment that extended the full width of the bus was the communications centre a maze of miniaturised electronic systems which was constantly manned whenever the president was aboard it was said that this installation had cost considerably more than the coach itself besides incorporating a radio telephone system that could reach any place in the world it had a small row of differently coloured buttons in a glass case which could be removed only with the aid of a special key there were five such buttons to press the first brought instant contact with the white house in washington the second was for the pentagon the third was for the airborne strategic air command the fourth was for moscow and the fifth for london apart from the necessity of being in touch with his armed forces all the time the president was an acute sufferer from telephonitis even to the extent of an internal phone connecting him with his habitual seat on the bus and the communications compartment at the rear but it was not in this coach that the intruders were interested but in the one standing to its left they entered by the front door and immediately removed a metal plate by the drivers seat one of the men shone a torch downwards appeared to locate what he wanted almost immediately reached up and took from his companion something that looked like a polythene hag of putty to which there was attached a metal cylinder not more than three inches long and one in diameter this he securely bound to a metal strut with adhesive tape he seemed to know what he was doingwhich he did for the lean and cadaverous reston was an explosives expert of some note they moved to the rear and went behind the bar reston climbed on to a stool slid back an overhead cupboard door and looked at the liquor contents whatever the campfollowers in the presidential motorcade were going to suffer from it clearly wasnt going to be thirst there were two rows of vertically stacked bottles the first ten to the left five in each row being bourbon and scotch reston stooped and examined the upside down optics beneath the cupboard and saw that the bottles that interested him in the cupboard were duplicated in the ones below and that those were all full it seemed unlikely that anyone was going to be interested in the contents of the cupboard for some little time to come reston removed the ten bottles from their circular retaining holes in the cupboard and handed them down to his companion who stacked five of them on the counter and placed the other five in a canvas bag which had evidently been brought along for this purpose then handed reston a rather awkward piece of equipment which consisted of three parts a small cylinder similar to the one that had been fitted forwards a beehiveshaped device no more than two inches high and the same in diameter and a device which looked very like a car fire extinguisher with the notable exception that it had a plastic head both this and the beehive were attached to the cylinder by wires the beehive had a rubber sucker at its base but reston did not seem to have any great faith in suckers for he produced a tube of quickacting glue with which he liberally besmeared the base of the beehive this done he pressed it firmly against the forward facing side of the cupboard taped it securely to the large and small cylinders and then taped the three to the inner row of circular holes which retained the bottles he replaced the five bottles in front the device was completely hidden he slid shut the door replaced the stool and left the bus with his companion the guard still slept peacefully the two men left by the side door by which they had entered and locked it behind them reston produced a walkietalkie he said pi the amplified voice came through clearly on the fasciamounted speaker in the bus in the garage north of daly city branson made a switch yes okay good there was no elation in bransons voice and no reason why there should have been with six weeks of solid preparation behind him he would have been astonished if anything should have gone wrong you and mack get back to the apartment wait johnson and bradley were curiously alike goodlooking in their early thirties almost identical in build and both with blond hair they also bore a striking resemblance both in build and coloration to the two men newly wakened from sleep who were propped up in the two beds in the hotel room gazing at them with an understandable mixture of astonishment and outrage one of them said who the hell are you and what the hell do you think youre doing here kindly modulate your voice and mind your language johnson said it ill becomes a naval air officer who we are doesnt matter were here because we require a change of clothes he looked at the beretta he was holding and touched the silencer with his left forefinger i dont have to tell you what those things are he didnt have to tell them what those things were there was a cold calm professionalism a chilling surety about johnson and bradley that discouraged freedom of speech and inhibited even the very thought of action while johnson stood there gun dangling in apparent negligence by his side bradley opened the valise they had brought with them produced a length of thin rope and trussed up the two men with a speed and efficiency that indicated a long or intensive experience of such matters when he had finished johnson opened a cupboard produced two suits handed one to bradley and said try them for size not only were the suits an almost perfect fit but so also were the hats johnson would have been surprised if they had been otherwise branson that most meticulous of planners almost never missed a trick bradley surveyed himself in a fulllength mirror he said sadly i should have stayed on the other side of the law the uniform of a lieutenant in the us naval air arm suits me very well indeed not that you look too bad yourself one of the bound men said why do you want those uniforms i thought naval helicopter pilots were intelligent the man stared at him jesus you dont mean to stand there and tell us yes and weve both probably flown sikorskys a damned sight more man either of you but uniforms why steal our uniforms theres no trick in getting those made why do you were parsimonious sure we could get them made but what we cant get made are all the documentation you carry about with you identifications licences the lot he patted the pockets of his uniform theyre not there where the other bound man said go to hell he looked as if he meant it too johnson was mild this is offseason for heroes where the other man said not here the navy regard those as classified documents they have to be deposited in the managers safe johnson sighed oh dear why make it difficult we had a young lady stakeout in an armchair by the receptionists last evening redhead beautiful you may recall the two bound men exchanged the briefest of glances it was quite clear that they did recall shed go on oath in a witness stand that neither of you deposited anything he smiled in a wintry fashion a witness stand in court may be the last place on earth shed want to go near but if she says its no deposit its no deposit lets not be silly three things you can do tell us have your mouths taped and after a little persuasion tell us or if those dont work we just search you watch if youre conscious that is you going to kill us what on earth for bradleys surprise was genuine we can identify you youll never see us again we can identify the girl not when she removes her red wig you cant he dug into the valise and came up with a pair of pliers he had about him an air of gentle resignation times awasting tape them up both bound men looked at each other one shook his head the other sighed one smiled almost ruefully it does seem a gesture of useless defiance and i dont want my good looks spoilt under the mattresses at the foot under the mattresses they were johnson and bradley flicked over the leaves of the two wallets looked at each other nodded extracted the not inconsiderable dollar billfolds in each wallet and placed those by the bedside tables one man said couple of crazy crooks you are johnson said maybe youll be needing that more than us pretty soon he extracted money from his newly discarded suit and placed it in his uniform while bradley did the same our suits you can have unthinkable for us officers to be running around the city in their striped underpants and now im afraid we have to tape you he reached into the valise one man a quick mixture of suspicion and apprehension in his eyes tried vainly to sit up in bed i thought you said look if we wanted to kill you the noise from those silenced guns wouldnt even be heard in the corridor outside think we want you to start hollering the place down the moment we step outside that door besides it would upset the neighbours after they were taped johnson said and of course we dont want to have you jumping and wriggling around and making banging noises on the floor or walls im afraid we cant have any bangs in the next couple of hours or so sorry he stooped retrieved what looked like an aerosol can from the valise and squirted it briefly in the faces of both bound men they left hanging up the no disturb notice outside johnson doublelocked the door produced his pliers leaned on the key and snapped it leaving the head jammed in the lock downstairs they approached the clerk at reception a cheerful youngster who gave a cheerful good morning johnson said you werent on last night no sir the management wouldnt believe it but even a desk clerk requires a little sleep now and again he looked at them with interest no offence but arent you the two gentlemen whore going to ride herd on the president this morning johnson smiled im not sure if the president would care to have you put it quite that way but yes its no secret we phoned for an alarm call last night ashbridge and martinez was it recorded yes sir the clerk put his pen through the names now weve left one or two ah naval things in our room that we really shouldnt have done will you make certain that no one goes near our room until we return three hours about you can depend on me sir the clerk made a note the no disturb sign weve already done that they left and stopped at the first pay telephone on the street johnson went inside with the valise fished inside and brought out a walkietalkie he was immediately through to branson waiting patiently in the dilapidated garage north of daly city he said pi yes okay good get down there the sun was coming up as the six men filed out of their cabin in the hills above sausalito in marin county north across the bay from san francisco they made up a nondescript and not particularly attractive group four of them in overalls and two in faded raincoats that might have been lifted from some unsuspecting scarecrow they all piled into a rather battered chevrolet station wagon and headed down to the town before them stretched a stunning vista to the south the golden gate and the staggering if rather manhattanized skyline of san francisco to the southeast lent a slightly spurious glamour by the early rays of the sun alcatraz island of unhappy history lay to the north of the fishermans wharf in line of sight of treasure island the bay bridge and oakland on the far side of the bay to the east lay angel island the largest in the bay while to the northeast lay belvedere island tiburon and beyond that again the wide reaches of san pablo bay vanishing into nothingness there can be few more beautiful and spectacular vistas in the world if such there so be than that from sausalito on the basis that not to be moved by it would require a heart of stone the six men hi the station wagon had between them it was clear the makings of a fairsized quarry they reached the main street travelled along past the immaculate rows of sailing craft and the far from immaculate hodgepodge of boathouses until eventually the driver pulled off into a sidestreet parked and stopped the engine he and the man beside him got out and divested themselves of their coats revealing themselves as clad in the uniforms of california state patrolmen the driver a sergeant by the name of giscard was at least six feet three in height burly red faced tight mouthed and even to the cold insolent eyes was the conceptualized epitome of the dyedinthewool tough cop policemen admittedly were part and parcel of giscards life but his frequent acquaintanceships with them he had kept to as limited a nature as possible on the numerous occasions when hitherto without success they had attempted to put him behind bars the other parker was tall lean and of a nasty appearance and the best that could be said for him was that he might have passed for a cop if one were myopic or he were viewed at a considerable distance his habitually wary bitter expression was probably attributable to the fact that he had experienced considerably less success than the sergeant in evading the long arm of the law they turned a corner and entered a local police precinct station two policemen were behind the counter one very young the other old enough to be his father they looked rather tired and unenthusiastic as was natural for two men who were looking forward to some sleep but they were polite courteous good morning good morning giscard could be very brisk indeed as only befitted a man who had shown a clean pair of heels to half the police forces on the coast sergeant giscard patrolman parker he pulled from his pocket a paper with a long list of names you must be mahoney and nimitz indeed we are mahoney a guileless youth would have found some difficulty in concealing his hibernian ancestry and how do you know because i can read the niceties of salon conversation were not for giscard from this t take it that your station boss didnt advise you we were coming well its this damned motorcade this morning and from what ive found out this morning maybe im not wasting all that much of my time in making this final checkup youd be surprised at the number of policemen in this state who are either illiterate or stone deaf nimitz was polite if we were to know what we have done wrong sergeant you havent done anything wrong he consulted his sheet just four things when do the day shift come on how many where are the patrol cars and the cells thats all ail two minutes and hurry ive got to check every place from here across the bridge to richmond eight oclock eight mentwice the usual the cars let me see them nimitz lifted a key from a board and led the two men round the corner of the block he opened double doors the two police cars as was only proper on this auspicious occasion when a president a king and a prince were travelling through their precinct had the impossible glitter of showroom models ignition keys in the ignition back in the station giscard nodded to the entrance door keys i beg your pardon giscard was heavily patient i know its normally never locked but you might all have to leave in a tearing hurry this morning you want to leave the shop unattended i see nimitz indicated the keys on the board the cells nimitz led the way taking keys with him they were only a few feet away but round a corner out of sight of the more sensitive citizens who had reluctant occasion to enter the front office nimitz entered and giscard unholstered his pistol and stuck it against his back a dead policeman giscard observed is no good to anyone parker joined them in ten seconds pushing a furious and flabbergasted mahoney in front of him both captives were gagged and left sitting on the floor backs to the bars arms thrust uncomfortably through them and wrists handcuffed from the baleful expressions on their faces it was as well that they were so securely gagged giscard put the keys in his pocket picked up two other sets from the board ushered parker out before him locked the entrance door pocketed that key too then went round and opened up the garage he and parker backed the cars out and while giscard locked the doorsand inevitably pocketed the keys parker went to fetch die other four men from the station wagon when they appeared they were not surprisingly any longer overalled working men but gleaming advertisements for the california state patrol they drove north on the us took the cutoff west to state i passed by muir woods and its prechristian stands of two hundred and fifty feet high redwoods and finally stopped in the mount tamalpais state park giscard brought out the walkietalkie that went so well with his uniform and said pi branson was still patiently waiting in the bus in the abandoned garage yes okay good stay the forecourt and street outside the luxurious caravanserai atop nob hill were understandably at that hour of the morning practically deserted there were in fact only seven people in sight six of those stood on tie steps of the hotel which was that night housing more dollars on the hoof than it ever had remotely had in its long and illustrious career the seventh of those a tall handsome man aquilinefaced youthfullooking despite his grey hair and clad in immaculate houndstooth was pacing slowly up and down on the roadway from the looks exchanged among the six men two doorkeepers two policemen and two men in plain clothes whose coats fitted awkwardly under their left armpitshis presence appeared to be giving rise to an increasing degree of vexation finally after a lowmurmured conversation among them one of the uniformed men came down the steps and approached him he said morning sir no offence sk but do you mind moving on we have a job to do how do you know i have not sir please you must understand we have some very important people in there dont i know it dont i just know it the man sighed reached inside his coat produced and opened a wallet the policeman looked at it stiffened unmistakably swallowed and deepened his complexion by two shades im very sorry sir mr jensen sir tin sorry too sorry for all of us they can keep their damned oil as far as im concerned dear lord what a circus he talked until the officer relaxed then carried on his toandfro strolling the policeman returned to the steps one of the plainclothes men looked at him without a great deal of enthusiasm he said a great crowd moveron you are like to try if i must give you a demonstration he said wearily he walked down three steps paused looked back up he flashed a card at you didnt he sort of the policeman was enjoying himself who dont you recognize your own deputy director when you see him jesus the fbi mans miraculous return to the top step could have been attributed to nothing other than sheer levitation are you not the policeman asked innocently going to move him on the plainclothes man scowled then smiled from now on i think ill leave those menial tasks to the uniformed branch a bellboy of great age appeared on the top step hesitated then went down to the street as jensen gave him an encouraging wave as he approached his wizened face was further creased in worry he said arent you taking a helluva chance sir fbi man up there no chance jensen was unperturbed ties california fbi im washington chalk and cheese i doubt if hed know the directorgeneral if ne came and sat on his lap whats the word willie theyre all having breakfast in their rooms no sleepersin all on schedule let me know every tea minutes yes sir gee mr jensen arent you taking one godawful chance the place is swarming with fuzz and not only just inside those windows across there theres a rifle behind a dozen of them and a man behind each rifle i know willie im the man in the eye of the storm dead safe if youre caught i wont be even if i were youre clear clear everybody sees me talking to you why because im fbi i told you that youve no reason to doubt it there are six men on the top of the steps who believe the same thing anyway willie you can always plead the fifth amendment willie departed in full view of the six watchers jensen pulled out his walkietalkie pi yes branson was as calm as ever on schedule fine pis moving now every ten minutes right of course hows my twin branson looked towards the rear of the coach the bound and gagged man between the aisles bore an uncanny resemblance to jensen hell live two van effen eased the big coach on to the and headed her northeast up the southern freeway van effen was a short stocky man with closecropped blond hair and a head that was almost a perfect cube his ears were so close to his head that they appeared to have been pasted there his nose had clearly been at odds with some heavy object in the past he tended to wear a vacuous smile as if hed decided it was the safest expression to cope with the numerous uncertain things that were going on in the uncertain world around him and the dreamy light blue eyes which would never be accused of being possessed of any powers of penetration served only to reinforce the overall impression of one overwhelmed by the insoluble complexities of life van effen was a very very intelligent person whose knifelike intelligence could cope with an extremely wide variety of the worlds problems and although they had known each other for only two years he had indisputably become peter bransons indispensable lieutenant both men sat together in the front of the coach both for the nonce dressed hi long white coats which lent them as drivers a very professional appearance indeed the state department frowned on presidential motorcade drivers who opted for lumber jackets or rolled up sleeves branson himself generally drove and was good at it but apart from the fact that he was not a san franciscan and van effen had been born there he wished that morning to concentrate his exclusive attention on his side of the coachs fascia which looked like a cross between the miniaturized flight instrumentation of a boeing and those of a hammond organ as a communications system it could not compare to those aboard the presidential coach but everything was there that branson wanted moreover it had one or two refinements that the presidential coach lacked the president would not have considered them refinements branson turned to the man in the seat behind him yonnie a dark swarthy and incredibly hirsute person who on the rare occasions he could be persuaded to remove his shirt and approach a shower looked more like a bear than a human being had about him the general appearance it was impossible to particularize of an expugilist who had taken not one but several hundred punches too many unlike many of bransons associates yonnie who had been with branson since hed embarked upon his particular mode of life all of thirteen years ago could not be classed among the intellectually gifted but his patience invariable good humour and total loyalty to branson were beyond dispute branson said got the plates yonnie the plates yonnie wrinkled the negligible clearance between hairline and eyebrows his customary indication of immense concentration then smiled happily yeah yeah i got them he reached under his seat and brought up a pair of springclipped number plates bransons coach was externally exactly the same as the three in the presidential motorcade except for the fact that those were washington dc plates while his were californian the plates that yonnie held in his hand were washington dc and even better exactly duplicated the numbers of one of the three waiting coaches in the garage branson said dont forget when i jump out the front door you jump out the back and fix the back one first leave it to me chief yonnie exuded confidence a buzzer on the fascia rang briefly branson made a switch it was jensen the nob hill stakeout pi yes on schedule forty minutes thanks branson closed the switch and flipped another p p move in giscard started up the stolen police car and moved up the panoramic highway followed by the second car they didnt drive sufficiently quickly to attract attention but they didnt linger either and had reached the mount tamalpais radar stations in a matter of minutes those stations dominated the mountainous countryside for miles around and looked like nothing in the world as much as a couple of gigantic white golf balls giscard and his men had the entire layout committed to heart and memory and no trouble was envisaged giscard said therell be no need to lean were cops arent we the guardians of the people you dont attack your guardians no shooting the boss says one of them said what if i have to shoot youll lose half your cut no shooting branson flipped another switch p p was the code of the two men who had recently boobytrapped one of the motorcade buses p anything two drivers is all guards okay no suspicions wait branson flipped a switch as another buzzer rang p the speaker said on schedule thirty minutes thank you branson made another switch p the code for johnson and bradley yes you can go now we go now the voice was johnsons he and bradley immaculate in their naval air uniforms were sauntering casually along in the direction of the us naval air station alameda both men were carrying smooth shiny flight bags into which they had transferred the contents of the valise as they approached the entrance they increased their pace by the time they reached the two guards at the entrance they were giving the impression of two men who were in a considerable hurry they showed their cards to one of the guards lieutenant ashbridge lieutenant martinez of course youre very late sir i know well go straight to he choppers im afraid you cant do that sir commander eysenck wants you to report to his office at once the sailor lowered his voice confidentially the commander doesnt sound very happy to me sir damn johnson said and meant it wheres his office second door on the left sir johnson and bradley hurried there knocked and entered a young petty officer seated behind his desk pursed his lips and nodded silently towards the door to his right his demeanour indicated that he had no desire whatsoever to participate in the painful scene that was about to follow johnson knocked and entered head down and apparently searching for something in his flight bag the precaution was needless in the wellknown demoralization ploy of senior officers deepening their intimidation of apprehensive junior officers eysenck kept on making notes on a pad before him bradley closed the door johnson placed the flight bag on the edge of the desk his right hand was concealed behind it so was the aerosol gas can so kind of you to turn up eysenck spoke in a flat drawling accent annapolis had clearly failed to have any effect on his boston upbringing you had your strict orders he raised his head in what would normally have been a slow and effective gesture your explanations he broke off eyes widening but still not suspecting anything untoward youre not ashbridge and martinez no were not are we it was clear that eysenck had become suddenly aware that there was something very very far untoward his hand stretched out for a desk button but johnson already had his thumb on his eysenck slumped forward against his desk johnson nodded to bradley who opened the door to die outer office and as he closed it behind him it could be seen that his hand was fumbling in the depths of his bag johnson moved behind the desk studied the buttons below the phone pressed one as he lifted the phone tower sir immediate clearance lieutenants ashbridge and martinez it was a very creditable imitation of eysencks boston accent branson again called p the two watchers by the garage and now filling up the three buses inside the garage were indeed filing up two of them indeed had their complements of passengers and were ready to go the coach that had been boobytrapped was given over mainly to newspapermen wire service men and cameramen among them four women three of indeterminate age the other young on a platform at the rear of the bus were three mounted cine cameras for this was the coach that led the motorcade and the cameras would at all times have an excellent view of the presidential coach which was to follow immediately behind among the passengers in this coach were three men who wouldnt have recognized a typewriter or a camera if it had dropped on their toes but who would have had no difficulty whatsoever in differentiating between a walther colt beretta smith wesson and other such paraphernalia generally regarded as superfluous to the needs of the communications media this was known as the lead coach but there was one passenger in this coach who would have recognized a camera if he had seen it he was in fact carrying a highly complicated apparatus but who would also have had no difficulty at all in differentiating between a walther colt beirut and smith wesson any of which he was legally entitled to carry and not infrequently did on this occasion however he was unarmedhe considered it unnecessary between them his colleagues constituted a veritable travelling arsenalbut he did carry a most unusual item of equipment a beautifully miniaturized and transistorized transceiver radio concealed in the false bottom of his camera his name was revson and as he had repeatedly proved in the past in the service of his country although his country knew nothing of thisa man of quite remarkable accomplishments the rear coach was also well occupied again by newspaper men and men with no interest in newspapers although in this case the ratio was inversed the greatly outnumbered journalists although they realized that the presidential coach would soon in terms of the realizable assets of its passengers be nothing less than a rolling fort knox wondered if it were necessary to have quite so many fbi agents around there were only three people aboard the presidential coach all crew members the whitecoated driver his receive switch depressed was waiting for instructions to come through the fascia speaker behind the bar an extraordinarily pretty brunette who looked like an amalgam of all those fly me airline advertisements was trying to look demure and inconspicuous and failing miserably at the rear the radio operator was already seated in front of his communications console a buzzer rang in bransons coach p the speaker said on schedule twenty minutes a second buzzer rang p the speaker said all okay excellent for once branson permitted himself a slight feeling of relief the takeover of the tamalpais radar stations had been essential to his plans scanners manned affirmative a third buzzer rang pi johnsons voice was hurried p can we go now no trouble some johnson seated at the helicopter controls engines still not started watched a man emerge from eysencks office and break into a run rounding the corner of the building that could only mean johnson realized that he was going to look through eysencks office window and that could only mean that he had failed to open the door which he and bradley had locked behind them the key was at that moment in johnsons pocket not that looking through eysencks window was going to help him much because he and bradley had dragged the unconscious eysenck and petty officer into the windowless washroom leading off the commanders office the key of the washroom door was also in his pocket the man came into sight round the corner of the building he wasnt running now in fact he stopped and looked around it wasnt too hard to read what was going on in his mind eysenck and the petty officer might well be going about their lawful occasions and he was going to look pretty sick if he started to cry wolf on the other hand if something had happened and he didnt report his suspicions he was going to make himself highly unpopular with his superiors he turned and headed in the direction of the station commanders office obviously with the intent of asking a few discreet questions halfway towards the office it became clear that his questions werent going to be all that discreet he had broken into a run johnson spoke into the walkietalkie bad trouble hold on as long as possible leave in emergency rendezvous remains in coach pi van effen looked at branson something wrong yes johnson and bradley are in trouble want to take off imagine whats going to happen if they do if they have to cruise around ten minutes waiting for us a couple of hijacked helicopters with the president and half the oil in the middle east in the city everybodys going to be as jittery as hell theyll take no chances panicstricken theyll stop at nothing the choppers will be shot out of the sky they have phantoms in a state of instant readiness on that base well now van effen eased the coach to a stop at the back of the garage which held the motorcade bad but maybe not as bad as all that if they have to take off before schedule you could always instruct them to fly over the motorcade it would take a pretty crazy air commander to instruct his pilots to fire machineguns or rockets at a chopper hovering above the presidential coach bingono president no arabian oil kings and sheikhs no chief of staff no mayor morrison chopper might even crash down on to the top of the presidential coach not nice to be a sacked rear admiral without a pension if that is to say he survives the courtmartial i hadnt thought of it that way branson sounded half convinced no more youre assuming our air commander is as sane as you are that he would react along your line of thinking how are we to know that he is not certifiable extremely unlikely i admit but i have no option other than to accept your suggestion and weve no option other than to go ahead the buzzer rang branson made the appropriate switch pi yes p it was reston from the garage lead coach has just moved out let me know when the presidential coach moves branson gestured to van effen who started up the engine and moved slowly round the side of the garage the buzzer rang again p on schedule ten minutes fine get down to the garage again the buzzer rang it was reston he said presidential coach is just moving out fine branson made another switch rear coach yeah hold it for a couple of minutes weve a traffic jam here some nut case just slewed his articulated truck across the street pure accident id say but no chances no panic no need for anyone to leave their seats were coming back to the garage for a couple of minutes till they decide on a new route okay okay van effen drove slowly round to the front of the garage nosed it past the front door until the first third of the coach was visible to the occupants of the rear coach inside still parked where it had been branson and van effen descended unhurriedly from the opposite front seats walked into the garage yonnie unobserved by those inside exited via the back door and began to clamp the new number plate on top of the old the occupants of the rear coach watched the approach of the two whitecoated figures curiously but without suspicion for endless frustrating delays were partand parcel of their lives branson walked around to the front door opposite the drivers side while van effen wandered aimlessly as it seemed towards the rear had there been any cause for concern on the part of the occupants it would nave been allayed by the sight of two blueoveralled figures busily doing nothing by the main doors they were not to know hey were reston and his friend branson opened the front lefthand door and climbed up two steps he said to the driver sony about this it happens theyre picking out a new route a safe route for us to go up to nob hill the driver looked puzzled no more he said wheres ernie ernie lead coach driver ah thats his name taken sick im afraid taken sick suspicion flared only two minutes ago the driver twisted round in his seat as two minor explosions occurred in the rear of the coach less explosions than soft plops of sound to the accompanying sounds of breaking glass and a hiss as of air escaping under pressure the rear of the coach was already enveloped in a dense billowing and rapidly mushrooming cloud of grey smoke so dense that it was impossible to see the now closed rear door and the figure of van effen leaning against it and making sure it stayed that way every man in the busor those who were still visiblehad swung round in his seat reaching for a gun in an automatic but useless reaction for there was nothing to be seen to fire at branson held his breath threw two of the grenadeshaped gas bombs in rapid succession one in the front aisle one at the drivers feetjumped to the garage floor slammed the door and held the handle a somewhat pointless precaution as he knew for the first inhalation of that gas produced immediate unconsciousness after ten seconds he left walked round the front of the bus where he was joined by van effen reston and his companion had already closed and bolted the main entrance now they were stripping off their overalls to reveal the conservative and well cut suits beneath reston said over so soon just like that branson nodded but if one whiff of that can knock a man out surely its going to kill themif they keep on sitting there i mean inhaling the stuff all the time they left via the side door not too hurriedly locking it behind them branson said contact with oxygen neutralizes the gas inside fifteen seconds you could walk inside that bus now and be entirely unaffected but it will be at least an hour before anyone in that bus comes to harriman stepped out of a taxi as they came round to the garage front they boarded the coachnow the new rear coach of the motorcadeand van effen headed for nob hill branson made a switch in the fascia p yes how are things quiet too damned quiet i dont like it what do you think is happening i dont know i can just see someone on the phone asking for permission to launch a couple of guided missiles at us permission from whom the highest military authority in the country could take time to contact washington take damnall time to contact nob hill oh my god momentarily even bransons habitual massive calm was disturbed the highest military authority in the country was indeed in the next suite to the president in the mark hopkins hotel general cartland chief of staff and adviser extraordinary to the president was indeed participating in that days motorcade you know what happens if they do contact him yes theyll cancel he motorcade chief of the armed forces though the president might be he could be overruled in matters of security by his chief of staff hold it a minute there was a pause then johnson said one of the guards at the gate is on the telephone this could mean anything or nothing branson was conscious of a slight dampness in the region of his neck collar although he had given up the habit of prayer even before hed left his mothers knee he prayed it was nothing perhaps the call to the guard was perfectly innocuous perhaps the outcome of the call might be innocuous if it were not the many months and the quarter million dollars hed spent in preparation for this coup was so much irrecoverable water under the bridge pi yes branson was dimly aware that his teeth were damped tightly together youre not going to believe this but tower has just given us permission to lift off branson remained silent for a few moments while someone lifted the golden gate bridge off his back he was not one much given to browmopping but this if ever seemed a warranted occasion he refrained he said never look a gift horse in the mouth how do you account for this the guards must have said that theyd checked our identity papers and that they were in order start up will you id like to find out if i can hear you over the racket of the rotors twin lines of security men back to back at a distance of about six feet and facing outwards formed a protective lane for the short distance between the hotel and the waiting presidential coach which seemed rather superfluous as the streets had been barricaded off from the public for a hundred yards all around the visiting dignitaries from the persian gulf seemed to be in no way put out by this nor to be suffering from any claustrophobic sense of imprisonment in their own homelands where the fine art of assassination had reached peaks as yet undreamed of in the united states this was part and parcel of their everyday lives not only would they have felt naked without this overt show of protection they would have been offended if not humiliated by the very concept that they were sufficiently unimportant not to merit the massive security precaution the president led the way looking almost wistfully from side to side as if disappointed that there was no one there for him to wave at he was a tall rather portly figure immaculately attired in a tan gabardine suit with a patrician face vaguely reminiscent of one of the betterfed roman emperors and a splendid head of the purest silver hair which was widely supposed to be his especial pride and joy one had but to look at him to appreciate that he bad been doomed from the cradle to end up in the oval office that anyone else should aspire to beor bethe chief executive was quite unthinkable better brains there might be on capitol hill but that magnificent presence was unique as far as politicians went he was a man of the utmost probitythe fact that he was a multimillionaire may have helped him in thisintelligent humorous and was loved liked admired or held in genuine affection to an extent that had been achieved by no other president in the previous half century a remarkable but far from impossible achievement as always he carried a stout cane a relic from that occasion when he had required it for almost two days after tripping over the leash of his labrador that he had no need of the cane was quite indisputable perhaps he thought it rounded off his image or lent him a slightly rooseveltian aura whatever the reason he was never seen in public or private without it he reached the coach halfturned smiled and bowed slightly as he ushered the first of his guests aboard precedence and pride of place went inevitably to the king his vast kingdom held as much oil as the rest of the world put together he was a tall imposing figure a king from the floorsweeping skirts of his dazzling white robes to the top of the equally dazzling burnous he had an aquiline dark face with a splendidly trimmed white beard and the hooded eyes of a brooding eagle supposedly the wealthiest man in all history he could easily have been a tyrant and despot but was neither against that his autocratic rule was absolute and the only laws he obeyed were those he made himself the prince came next his small sheikhdom had never rated and never had had a king while his territorial holdings came to less than five per cent of the kings his influence was almost as great his sheikhdom an arid and barren expanse of some of the worlds most inhospitable sands was literally afloat on a sea of oil an extrovert and flamboyant personality who owned a cadillac for every four miles of his principalitys hundred miles of road it was said with some authority that if one of his cars had the slightest mechanical trouble it was regarded as obsolete and never used again a fact which must have given some small satisfaction to general motors he was an excellent pilot a remarkably gifted racecar driver and an assiduous patron of many of the most exclusive nightclubs in the world he went to considerable lengths to cultivate his reputation as an international playboy an exercise which deceived nobody behind the facade lay the computerized mind of an outstanding businessman he was of medium height well built and wouldnt have been seen dead in the traditional arab clothes he was savile rows best customer dapper was the only word to describe him from the pointed crocodile shoes to the almost invisible hairline moustache they were followed by sheikh iman and sheikh kharan the oil ministers respectively of the king and the prince they looked remarkably alike and were rumoured to have the same grandfather which was not at all impossible both wore western clothes both were plump smiling almost to the point of beaming and extremely shrewd indeed the only way to tell them apart was while iman sported a tiny black goatee beard kharan was cleanshaven the next to board was general cartland although wearing civilian clothesan inconspicuous blue pinstripehe was unmistakably what he was if he had been wearing only a bath towel he would still have been immediately recognizable as a general the erect bearing the precise movements the clipped speech the cool blue eyes that never asked a question twice everything marked him out for the man he was even his grey hair was shorn although cartland had more than a peripheral interest in oilhe did after all require some form of fuel for his ships tanks and planes he was not along because of any special expertise in the oil business he was along primarily because the president refused to cross the street without him the president and he made no bones about it was heavily dependent on cartland for his advice farranging width of experience and solid common sense a fact which had given and still gave rise to considerable if wholly misplaced jealousy in washington cooler judgements in that city regarded him as being virtually irreplaceable as presidential adviser and although this duty left him with less and less time to run his army navy and air force cartland seemed to cope with both tasks effortlessly he would have made an excellent politician or statesman but had unfortunately been cursed from birth with an unshakable incorruptibility and moral integrity the next man to board was hansen the presidents energy czar he was the latest appointee to the post and as yet a largely unknown quantity his qualifications for the post were impeccable but his experience so far slight energy was one thing he appeared to possess in abundance he was a darting nervous volatile individual painfully thin whose hands and dark eyes were never still he was reputed to have a firstclass brain this was his biggest indeed almost his onlyconfrontation with great oil barons and his awareness of being on trial was painful muir went next he was a very rubicund man almost bald and the number of his chins varied from two to four according to the angle of his neck unlike most fat men he had a permanently doleful expression he had a positively bucolic appearance about him an unsuccessful farmer who concentrated less on the production than the consumption of what he grew on his farm this proposed deal with the arab nations could raise as many political as physical problems which was why undersecretary of state muir was along although it was almost impossible to believe he was unquestionably the countrys leading expert on the middle east the president waved the last man aboard but john morrison waving his hand in turn declined the president acknowledged the gesture smiled and preceded him up the steps morrison a burly genial man of unquestionably italian ancestry was not along for his energy expertise energy concerned him but not to the extent of causing turn sleepless nights he was along partly as a guide partly because he conceived it to be his duty to accept the presidential invitation although the president was the official host to his guests this was morrisons parish and here he was both host and king he was the mayor of san francisco in the rear coach some fifty yards away branson saw the presidential coach door close he made a switch p yesjohnson we go now now it is the motorcade moved off led by a police car and motorcycle outriders they were followed by the lead coach the presidential coach the rear coach a second police car and two more outriders there was no attempt to make any scenic tour of the town that had been attended to the previous afternoon soon after air force one had landed at the international airport this was strictly a business trip the motorcade went along california right down van ness left along lombard angled right up richardson avenue and so into the presidio from this point onwards the roads had been closed that morning to all normal traffic they took the viaduct approach curving right and to the north until at last dead ahead loomed the immensity of the golden gate bridge three the golden gate bridge is unquestionably one of the engineering wonders of the world to san franciscans inevitably it is the engineering wonder of the world and as bridges gc it must be at once the most spectacular and graceful in existence to see the two great brickredor orange or ochre according to the quality of the lighttowers emerging from the dense banks of fog that so frequently billow in from the pacific is to experience a profound sense of unreality and when the fog disperses completely the feeling changes to one of disbelief and a benuuthment of the senses that men had not only the audacity to conceive of this epic poem in mechanical grandeur but also the technical expertise to bring it into being even while the evidence of the eyes is irrefutable it still remains difficult for the mind to accept that it actually is there that it is there at all is not in fact due to man but to one man a certain joseph b strauss who in the pigheaded fashion of considerable americans despite seemingly unsurmountable and political difficulties and the assurances of his architectural colleagues that his dream was a technical impossibility just went ahead and built it anyway the bridge was opened in may until the construction of the varrazanonarrows bridge in it was the longest singlespan suspension bridge in the world even now it is only about twenty yards shorter the two massive towers that support the bridge soar seven hundred and fifty feet above the waters of the golden gate the bridges total length is just under one and threequarter miles the cost of construction was to replace it today something in the region of would be needed the one sombre aspect about the bridge is that for americans who find the burdens of life intolerable to bear this is unquestionably the most favoured point of departure there have been at least five hundred known suicides probably as many again have gone undetected there have been eight known survivors among the rest the possibility of survival seems extremely remote if any did indeed survive the shattering impact of the two hundred foot drop to the water the surging tides and vicious currents of the golden gate would swiftly have completed what the jump itself failed to do those dangerous tides and currents make their effect felt for some distance on either side of the bridge three miles to the east lies what used to be the forbidding prisonfortress of alcatraz island no precise figures of those who attempted escape by swimming are available but it is believed that only three of those who tried it ever survived it is idle to speculate upon the choice of the bridge as a springboard to eternity psychiatrists would have it that it is a spectacular and attentionriveting finale to a drab and unspectacular life dragged out in a grey anonymity but it would seem mat there is nothing either eyecatching or spectacular in jumping into the darkness in the middle of the night the procession made its stately way under the first of the giant towers in the upholstered luxury of the presidential coach the king prince and their two oil ministers gazed around them with a carefully controlled degree of regal and viceregal appreciation for although there was a marked absence of golden gate bridges in their dusty homelands and indeed no need for themit would not have done to admit that there were some things better done in the west than in the middle east nor did they enthuse overmuch about the scenery for although a million square miles of drifting sands might not be without its attractions for a homesick bedouin it could hardly be said to compare with the lush and fertile greenery of the farm land and forest land mat stretched ahead of them across the golden gate indeed the whole of the bay area could not have looked better than it did on that splendid june morning with the sun already climbing high to their right in a cloudless sky and sparkling iridescently off the bluegreen waters below it was the perfect storybook setting for a day which the president and hansen his energy czar devoutly hoped would have a storybook ending the prince looked around the coach this time in open admiration for he was very much a man of his own generation and possessed of a passion for all things mechanical and said in his clipped oxford accent my word mr president you do know how to travel in style i wish i had one of those and so you shall the president said indulgently my country would be honoured to present you with one such as soon as possible after your return to your homeland equipped to your own specifications of course the king said drily the prince is accustomed to ordering his vehicles by the round dozen no doubt acclaimed you would like a couple of those to go with it he pointed upwards to where two naval helicopters were hovering overhead you do take good care of us mr president the president smiled noncommittally how could one comment upon the obvious general cartland said for decorative purposes only your highness apart from your own security men waiting on the other side and an occasional police car you will see nothing between here and san rafael but the security is there all the same between here and san rafael the motorcade will be under heavily armed surveillance literally every yard of the way there are crackpots everywhere even in the united states especially in the united states the president said darkly in mock seriousness the king said so we are safe the president regained his smiling composure as in the vaults of fort knox it was at this point just after the lead coach had passed the halfway mark across the bridge that five things happened in almost bewilderingly rapid succession in the rear coach branson pressed a button on the console in front of him two seconds later a small explosion occurred in the front of the lead coach almost beneath the drivers feet although unhurt the driver was momentarily shocked then swore recovered quickly and jammed his foot on the brake pedal nothing happened sweet jesus it took him all of another second to realize that his hydraulic lines were gone he jammed his handbrake into the locked position and changed down into first gear the coach began to slow branson abruptly lifted his right arm as abruptly lowered it again to reinforce the left in bracing himself against the fascia behind him his men did the same outstretched arms slightly bent at the elbows as they had learnt in frequent practices braced against the backs of the seats in front nobody sat in the front seats van effen slipped the gear into neutral and kicked down on the brake pedal as if he were trying to thrust it through the floor the fact that van effen had recently and with malice aforethought seen fit to deactivate his rear brake lights did little to help the plight of the hapless driver of the police car behind the motorcade was travelling slowly about twentyfive miles an hour and the rear police car was trailing the coach by about the same number of feet the driver had no reason to suspect that anything might be amiss for the bridge was closed to all traffic except the motorcade there was no earthly reason to expect anything should interfere with the smooth and even tempo of their progress he may even have spared a momentary side glance to admire the view however it was when he first realized that all was not what it should have been the distance between them had halved an incredulous doubletake cost him another few feet and skilled police driver though he was his reactions were no faster than those of the next man and by the time his foot had hit the brake the gap between himself and the now stationary coach had lessened to not more than five feet the effect of a cars striking a solid and immovable object at twenty miles an hour has a less than humorous effect on the occupants of that car the four officers in the car were no exception at the moment of impact branson touched a second button on the fascia the lead coach slowing only by its handbrake was now doing no more than ten miles an hour when another small explosion occurred in the drinks cabinet at the rear an explosion followed immediately by a pronounced hissing as if caused by compressed air escaping under very high pressure within seconds the entire compartment was filled with a dense grey obnoxious and noxious gas the coach almost immediately out of control as the driver slumped forward over the wheel slewed slowly to the right and came to a rest less than two feet from the side of the road not that it would have mattered particularly if it had struck the safety barriers on the side of the bridge which were of a nature to withstand the assaults of anything less than a chieftain tank the presidential coach came to no harm the driver had seen the lead coachs brake warning lights come on braked pulled left to avoid the slewing coach ahead and came to a rest beside it the expressions of the twelve occupants of the coach expressed varying degrees of unhappiness but not as yet of alarm the police car and two motorcycle outriders leading the motorcade had been curiously slow to observe the confusion behind them only now had they spotted the slewed coach and were beginning to turn in the rear coach everything was taking place with the clockwork precision that stemmed from a score of practice runs that had covered all conceivable potentialities van effen jumped down from the lefthand door running from the right just as the two motorcycle outriders pulled up almost alongside van effen said you better get in there fast looks like we got a stiff on our hands the two patrolmen propped their machines and jumped aboard the coach they could now no longer be seen by the returning lead police car and outriders so it was safe to take swift and efficient action against them which was done with considerable ease not least because their attention had immediately been caught up by the sight of the bound figure lying sprawled on the floor in the rear aisle seven men emerged swiftly from the doors of the coach five of those joined van effen and yonnie and ran towards the other coaches two more ran back towards the crashed police car two others inside the coach swung wide the rear door and mounted what appeared to be a relatively harmless length of steel tubing on a tripod stand branson and jensen remained where they were the bound man on the floor whose identity jensen had taken over regarded them all severally with a baleful expression but beyond that the options open to him were rather limited the two men who had run back towards the crashed police car were called kowalski and peters they didnt look like criminals unless a couple of prosperous young commuters from the stockbroker belt could be called criminals yonnie apart none of bransons associates bore any resemblance whatever to the popular concept of those who habitually stepped outside the law both men in fact had killed a number of times but then only legally as far as the term legal could be interpreted as members of a highly specialized marine commando unit in vietnam disillusioned with civilian life theyd found their next best panacea with branson who had a splendid eye for the recruitment of such men they had not killed since branson approved of violence if and when necessary killing was not permitted except as a last resort in his thirteen years of upsetting law officers in the united states canada and mexico branson had not yet had to have recourse to the last resort whether this was due to moral scruples or not was unclear what was clear was that branson regarded it as bad business the degree of intensity of police efforts to catch robbers as opposed to murderers differed quite appreciably the windows of both front doors of the car were wound down obviously they had been so at the moment of the crash the four uniformed men seated inside had not been seriously injured but clearly had been badly shaken and had suffered minor damage the worst of which appeared to be a broken nose sustained by he man in the front seat next to the driver for the most part they were just dazed too dazed in any effect to offer any resistance to the removal of their weapons working in smooth unison kowalski and peters wound up the front windows peters closed his door while kowalski threw in a gas bomb and closed his in turn none of any of this action had been witnessed by the returning police cars crew or the motorcycle outriders the policemen left their cars and machines and were cautiously approaching the lead coach when yonnie and van effen with the five others came running up all had guns of one kind or another in their hands quickly van effen shouted take cover there are a couple of crazy bastards back in that coach there one with a bazooka the other with a schmeisser get behind the bus given time to consider the matter the policemen might have queried van effens statements but they werent given the time and the instinct for immediate if irrational selfpreservation remains always paramount van effen checked quickly to see if they were hidden from the view of the presidential coach they were not that he feared anything from that source he just wanted to be spared the chore of blasting open the lock of the door that would be surely locked against them if their actions were observed he nodded to yonnie and walked away with another man towards the rear of the bus whatever might be said and had unkindly been said about yoanies cerebral limitations this was the situation he had been born for a basically elemental one in which action took precedence over thoughts long training had even given the vocabulary appropriate to the occasion he said lets kinda put our hands up huh the six men turned round their expressions ran through the gamut of astonishment anger and then resignation resignation was all that was left them they had with reason enough not yet thought it time to produce their own weapons and when the wise man is confronted at pointblank range with a pair of submachinepistols he does what he is told and just kinda puts his hands up yonnie kept them covered while another man relieved them of their pistols the remaining two men began to run back towards the rear coach as soon as they saw van effen and another climb aboard the presidential coach the reaction of those aboard this coach had so far amounted to no more than an amalgam of perplexity and annoyance and even that was slight enough one or two were making the customary laborious effort to rise when van effen mounted the steps please relax gentlemen he said just a slight delay such is the authority of even a white coatin a street accident a crowd will make way for a man in a butchers apronthat everybody subsided van effen produced an unpleasantlooking weapon a doublebarrelled bore shotgun with most of the barrel and stock removed to make for easier transport if not accuracy i am afraid this is what you might call a holdup or hijack or kidnap i dont suppose it matters very much what you call it just please remain where you are good god in heaven the president stared at van effens moonface as if he were a creature from outer space his eyes as if drawn magnetically went to the king and the prince then he returned his incredulous outraged gaze to van effen are you insane dont you know whom i am dont you know youre pointing a gun at the president of the united states i know you cant help being what you are any more than i can help being what i am as for pointing guns at presidents its a long if not very honourable tradition in our country please do not give any trouble van effen looked directly at general cartland hed had him under indirect observation from the moment he had entered the coach general it is known that you always carry a gun please let me have it please do not be clever your can be nasty enough if it is accurate enough this whippet will blast a hole the size of your hand through your chest you are not the man i know to confuse courage with suicide cartland smiled faintly nodded produced a small black narrow automatic and handed it across van effen said thank you im afraid you will have to remain seated for the moment at least you have only my word for it but if you offer no violence you will receive none a profound silence descended the king eyes closed and hands folded across his chest appeared to be communing either with himself or with the allpowerful suddenly he opened his eyes looked at the president and said just how safe are the vaults in fort knox youd better believe me hendrix branson said he was talking into a handheld microphone we have the president the king and the prince if you will wait a minute or two ill have the president himself confirm that to you meantime please dont attempt anything so stupid or rash as to try to approach us let me give you a demonstration i assume you have some patrol cars near the south entrance and that you are in radio contact with them hendrix didnt look like anyones conception of a chief of police he looked like a professorial refugee from the campus of the nearby university he was tall slender dark slightly stooped and invariably immaculately groomed and conservatively dressed a great number of people temporarily or permanently deprived of their freedom would have freely if blasphemously attested to the fact that he was very very intelligent indeed there was no more brilliant or brilliantly effective policeman in the country at that moment however that fine intelligence was in temporary abeyance he felt stunned and had about him the look of a man who has just seen all his nightmares come true he said i am very well wait branson turned and made a signal to the two men at the rear of the coach there was a sudden explosive whoosh from the recoilless missile weapon mounted at the rear three seconds later a cloud of dense grey smoke erupted between the pillars of the south tower branson spoke into the microphone well some kind of explosion hendrix said his voice was remarkably steady lots of smoke if it is smoke a nerve gas not permanently damaging but incapacitating takes about ten minutes time before it oxidizes if we have to use it and a breeze comes up from the northwest north or northeastwell it will be your responsibility you understand i understand conventional gasmasks are useless against it do you understand that also i understand we have a similar weapon covering the northern end of the bridge you will inform police squads and units of the armed forces of the inadvisability of attempting to move out on to the bridge you understand that too yes you will have been informed of the presence of two naval helicopters hovering over the bridge yes the rather hunted look had left hendrixs face and his mind was clearly back into top gear i find it rather puzzling i must say it neednt be they are in our hands have an immediate alarm put through to all local army and naval air commanders tell them if any attempt is made to dispatch fighters to shoot down those helicopters they will have very unpleasant effects on the president and his friends tell them that we shall know immediately whenever any such plane does lift off the mount tamalpais radar stations are in our hands good god hendrix was back to square one he wont help they are manned by competent radar operators no attempt will be made to retake those stations whether by land or airborne assault if such an assault is made we are aware that we have no means of preventing it however i do not think that the president king or prince would look kindly upon any individual who was responsible for depriving them of say their right ears please do not think that i am not serious we shall deliver them by hand in a sealed plastic bag no such attempt will be made captain campbell a burly sandyhaired redfaced and normally jovial character whom hendrix regarded as his righthand man regarded hendrix with some surprise not because of what he had just said but because it was the first time he had ever seen hendrix with beads of sweat on his brow in an unconscious gesture campbell reached up and touched his own forehead then looked with a feeling of grave disquiet at the dampened back of his hand branson said i hope you mean what you say i will contact you shortly it will be in order if i come down to the bridge it would appear that i have to set up some kind of communications headquarters and that seems the most logical place for it to be that will be in order but do not move out on to the bridge and please prevent any private cars from entering the presidio violence is the very last thing we want but if some arises i do not wish innocent people to suffer you are very considerate hendrix sounded perhaps justifiably more than a little bitter branson smiled and replaced the microphone the gas inside the lead coach had vanished but the effect it had had on the occupants had not all were still profoundly unconscious some two or three had fallen into the aisle without apparently having sustained any injuries in the process for the most part however they just remained slumped in their seats or had fallen forward against the backs of the seats in front of them yonnie and bartlett moved among them but not in the capacity of ministering angels bartlett at twentysix was the youngest of bransons men and looked every inch a freshfaced college boy which he every inch was not they were searching every person in the coach and searching them very thoroughly indeed those who were being subjected to this indignity being in no position to object the lady journalists were spared this but their handbags were meticulously examined it said much for the standards that branson imposed that none of the several thousand dollars that passed through the hands of yonnie and bartlett found its way into either of their pockets robbery on a grand scale was big business robbery on a small scale was petty larceny and not to be tolerated in any event they werent looking for money they were looking for guns branson had reasoned and correctly as it turned out that there would be several special agents in the journalists coach whose assignment would be not the direct protection of the president and his guests but the surveillance of the journalists themselves because of the worldwide interest aroused by the visit of the arabian oil princes to the united states at least ten of those journalists aboard were from abroad four from europe the same from the gulf states and one each from nigeria and venezuela countries which might well be regarded as having a pressing interest in any transactions between the major oil states and the united states they found three such guns and pocketed them the three owners of the guns were handcuffed and left where they were yonnie and bartlett descended and joined the man who was guarding the six still largely uncomprehending policemen who were handcuffed together in single file another man was seated behind one of the bazookalike missile firers that was guarding the north tower here as at the southern end everything was completely under control everything had gone precisely as branson had meticulously and with much labour planned over the preceding months branson had every reason to be feeling agreeably pleased with himself branson as he stepped down from the rear coach looked neither pleased nor displeased things had gone as he had expected them to and that was that his followers had often remarked although never in his hearing on bransons almost staggering selfconfidence on the other hand they had to admit that he had never as yet failed to justify his utter trust in himself of bransons permanent nucleus of eighteen men nine of them had spent various times in various penitentiaries up and down the country reflecting upon the vagaries of fortune but that was before they had been recruited by branson since then not one of the eighteen had even got as far as a courtroom far less the prison walls when it was taken into account that those included such semipermanent guests of the united states government as parker this record could be regarded as an achievement of no little note branson walked forward to the presidential coach van effen was standing in the doorway branson said im moving the lead coach ahead a bit tell your driver to follow me he moved into the lead coach and with yonnies help dragged clear the slumped driver behind the wheel he slid into the vacant seat started the engine engaged gear straightened out the coach and eased it forward for a distance of about fifty yards bringing k to a halt with the use of the handbrake the presidential coach followed pulling up only feet behind them branson descended and walked back in the direction of the south tower when he came to the precise middle of the bridgethe point at which the enormous suspension cables were at their lowest he looked behind him and again in front of him the fifty yards of the most central section of the bridge the sections where the helicopter rotors would be most unlikely to be fouled by the cables even if subjected to the unseen and unforeseen vagaries of wind was clear branson walked clear of the area and waved to the two machines shattering overhead johnson and bradley brought their naval helicopters down easily and with the minimum of fuss for the first time in its long and august history the golden gate bridge was in use as a helipad branson boarded the presidential coach everyone there was instinctively aware that he was the leader of their kidnappers the man behind their present troubles and their reception of him did not even begin to border on the cordial the four oil men and cartland looked at him impassively hansen understandably was more jittery and nervous than ever his hands and eyes for ever on the rapid andalmost furtive move muir was his usual somnolent self his eyes halfclosed as if he were on the verge of dropping off to sleep mayor morrison who had won so many medals in the second world war that he could scarcely have found room for them even on his massive chest was just plain furious and so indisputably was the president that expression of kindly tolerance and compassionate wisdom which had endeared him to the hearts of millions had for the moment been tucked away in the deep freeze branson said without preamble but pleasantly enough my name is branson morning mr president your highnesses i would like you would like the president was icily angry but he had the expression on his face and the tone in his voice under control you dont have two hundred million people call you president and behave like an unhinged rock star i suggest we dispense with the charade with the hypocrisy of empty politeness who are you sir i told you branson and i see no reason why the normal courtesies of life should not be observed it would be pleasant if we were to begin our relationship an enforced introduction on your side i agree on a calmer and more reasonable basis it would make things so much more pleasant if we behaved in a more civilized fashion civilized the president stared at him in a genuine astonishment that swiftly regressed to his former fury you a person like you a thug a crook a hoodlum a common criminal and you dare suggest we behave in a more civilized fashion a thug no a crook yes a hoodlum no a common criminal no im a most uncommon criminal however im not sorry you adopt this attitude having you express yourself with such hostility to me doesnt mean that it eases my conscience in what i may have to do to you i dont have any conscience but it makes life that much simpler for me not having to hold your handi dont speak literally you understand makes it all that much easier for me to achieve my ends i dont think youll be called upon to hold any hands branson cartlands voice was very dry how are we to regard ourselves as kidnapees as ransom for some lost cause you hold dear the only lost cause i hold dear is standing before you then hostages to fortune thats nearer it hostages to a very large fortune i trust he looked again at the president i genuinely do apologize for any affront or inconvenience caused by me to your foreign guests inconvenience the presidents shoulders sagged as he invoked his tragic muse you don t know what irreparable damage you have done this day branson i wasnt aware that i had done any yet or are you referring to their highnesses here i dont see what damage i can have caused there or are you referring to your little trip to san rafael todayim afraid well have to postpone that for a bit to inspect the site of what will be the biggest oil refinery in the world he smiled and nodded towards the oil princes they really have you and hansen over a barrel there dont they mr president an oil barrel first they rob you blind over oil sales accumulate so much loot that they cant find homes for all of it conceive the bright idea of investing it in the land of the robbed come up with the concept of building this refinery and petrochemical complex on the west coast and running it themselves with your technical help of courseon their own oil which would cost them nothing the foreseeable profits are staggering a large portion of which would be passed on to you in the form of vastly reduced oil prices bonanzas all round im afraid international finance is beyond my scope prefer to make my money in a more direct fashion if you think your deal is going to slip through because of the offence now being given to those arabian gentlemen you must be an awful lot more naive than a president of the united states has any right to be those are not gentlemen to be swayed by personal considerations they have tungsten steel where their hearts should be and ibm computers for brains he paused im not being very polite to your guests am i neither the king nor prince achmed were quite so impassive now their eyes as they looked at branson were expressive of a distinct yearning cartland said you seem to be in no great hurry to get on with whatever you intend to get on with how right you are the need for speed has now gone time is no longer of the essence except that the longer i spend here the more profitable it is going to be for me that i shall explain later in the meantime the longer you remain here the more time it will give both you and your peoples both here and in the gulf states to appreciate just what a pretty pickle you find yourselves in and believe me you are in a pickle think about it branson walked to the rear of the coach and spoke to the blond young soldier who was manning the massive communication complex whats your name the soldier who had heard all that had gone on and obviously didnt like any of it hesitated then said grudgingly boyann branson handed him a piece of paper get this number please its just local get it yourself i did say please go to hell branson shrugged and turned van effen yes bring chrysler here he turned to boyann chrysler has forgotten a great deal more about telecommunications than youve learnt so far you think i hadnt anticipated meeting up with young heroes he spoke again to van effen and when you bring him take boyann here out and have him thrown over the side of the bridge into the golden gate right away stop the president was shocked and showed it you would never dare give me sufficient provocation and ill have you thrown over the side too i know it seems hard but youve got to find out some way some time that i mean what i say muir stirred and spoke for the first time he sounded tired i think i detect a note of sincerity in this fellows voice he may mark you be a convincing bluffer i for one wouldnt care to be the person responsible for taking the chance the president bent an inimical eye on the undersecretary but muir seemed to have gone to sleep cartland said in a quiet voice boyann do what you are told yes sir boyann seemed more than happy to have had the decision taken out of his hands he took the paper from branson who said you can put it through to the phone by that chair opposite the presidents boyann nodded and patch it in to the presidents boyann nodded again branson left and took his seat in the vacant armchair boyann got through immediately clearly the call had been awaited hendrix the voice said branson here yes branson peter branson god i might have guessed there was a silence then hendrix said quietly ive always wanted to meet you branson and so you shall my dear fellow and much sooner than you think id like to speak to you later meantime i wouldnt be surprised if the president didnt want to have a word with you branson stood up not without difficulty and offered both the telephone and seat to morrison who in turn struggled to his feet and accepted the offer with alacrity the president ran true to the form of any president who might have been so unfortunate as to find himself in his position he ran through the whole gamut of incredulity outrage disbelief and horror that not only the chief executive but even more important foreign potentates should find themselves in a situation so preposterous as to be in his opinion without parallel in history he laid the blame predictably entirely at hendrixs door security cover as the president knew all too well was arranged by washington and the local police forces did precisely what they were told to do but the presidents memory logic and sense of justice had gone into a state of shockand ended up by demanding that hendrixs duty was to clear up the whole damnable mess and that he should do something about it immediately hendrix who had a great deal longer time to consider me situation remained admirably calm he said what do you suggest i do about it sir the incoherent splutterings that followed were indication enough that constructive suggestions were at that moment some light years away from the presidents mind morrison took advantage of the momentary hiatus bernard john here morrison smiled without meaning to the voters arent going to like this bernard all one hundred and fifty million of them again the same smile if we must think nationally yes im afraid this is going to turn into a national problem john in fact you know damn well it already is and on the political side its too big for either of us you cheer me greatly bernard i wish someone would cheer me do you think our friend would let me speak to the general tb ask he asked and branson nodded amiably enough the other occupants of the coach eyed one another with a mounting degree of suspicion and apprehension both directed against branson the man was too utterly sure of himself and as matters stood at that moment there seemed to be little reason why he shouldnt be he just didnt hold all the aces in the pack he held a pack full of aces hendrix said general cartland hendrix the way i sec it sir this is going to be as much a military operation as a police one much more so if im any judge i should call in the senior military officers on the coast higher than that the pentagon at once local action damn all wait until the situation stabilizes itself and we find out what this madman wants branson smiled politely but as usual the smile never touched his eyes according to what he says himselfif you can believe a word he saystime is not of the essence i think he wants to talk to you branson took the phone from cartland and eased himself comfortably into the armchair one or two questions and requests hendrix i think i am in the position to expect answers and compliance with whatever i want wouldnt you agree im listening has the news been broken yet what the hell do you mean broken half of san francisco can see you stuck out on that damned bridge thats no way to speak of my favourite bridge nationwide is what i mean itll get around fast enough see that it gets around now the communication media as those people term themselves nowadays are going to be interested i am prepared to allow no thats wrong i insist that you put a helicopter no two helicopters at the disposal of some of the hundreds of news cameramen who will wish to record this historic event the bay area is thick with suitable machines both military and civilian there was a silence then hendrix said what the devil do you want those for obviously surely publicity the maximum exposure i want every person in america and indeed every person in the world who is within reach of a television set to see just what a predicament the president and his arabian friends are in and they are in a predicament wouldnt you say another silence this publicity of course you will use as a lever to get public opinion on your side to help you obtain what you want whatever that might be what else hendrix said heavily you wouldnt like me to send a coachload of reporters on to the bridge would you branson smiled into the telephone a coachload of reporters i wouldnt mind but i dont much fancy a coachload of fbi men armed to the teeth and disguised as reporters no i think well pass that one up besides reporters we have our own coachload whats to prevent me from loading those helicopters up with troops maybe paratroopers branson sighed only your own common sense weve got hostages or had you forgotten a bullet can reach the president far more quickly than a paratrooper ever could branson glanced at the president whose expression indicated that he clearly didnt care to be used as a bargaining counter you wouldnt dare youd defeat your own ends youd have nothing left to blackmail us with id still have a king and a prince try me and see youre whistling in the dark and you know it or do you want to go down in history as the man responsible for the deaths of a president a king and a prince hendrix made no reply it was clearly not a role he envisaged for himself however it hasnt escaped me that there might be some deathorglory hotheads who would stop at nothing in taking blind gambles so ive got my second request to make now this area is crammed with military stationsthe presidio itself fort baker treasure island forts funston miley and mason fort barry cronkiteyou name them theyre around and all within easy reach of here by road id be very surprised if between them they cant rustle up the two mobile selfpropelled rapidfire antiaircraft guns which i want on the bridge within the hour plenty of ammunition of courseand the army will test them out first you know how some of that hardware gets afflicted with all kinds of jinxes youre quite mad a divine sort of madness instructions now i refuse you refuse general cartland cartland heaved himself upright and walked heavily down the coach he took the phone and said quietly do what the madman asks dont you recognize megalomania when you hear it that was very unkind general branson smiled and retrieved the phone you have the message hendrix i have the message hendrix sounded as if he were being strangled my third request call up a couple of squads of army engineers i want two sets of steel barriers built on the bridge one under either tower they are to be strong enough to stop a tank and high enough barbed at the top of courseto prevent anyone from climbing over the north barrier is to be unbroken the south with a hinged central section wide enough to permit the passage of a jeep and capable of being opened from the insideour sideonly the barriers will be anchored to the sides of the bridge by bolting or welding and secured to the roadway by pneumatically driven spikes but the army will know a great deal more about such things than i do i shall supervise the operations personally hendrix seemed to be having some difficulty with his breathing finally he said why its those nasty fogs that come rolling in from the pacific all the time more often than not they cover the bridgein fact i can see one coming in right now branson sounded almost apologetic it would be too easy to rush us under fog cover and why the hinged section in the south barrier i thought i told you to permit the passage of a jeep for such things as negotiating committees a doctor if need be and she transport of the best food and drink in town jesus you have your nerve branson nerve branson was hurt this humanitarian consideration of the wellbeing of my fellow man you call that nerve kings and presidents are not accustomed to going hungry among other things you dont want to go down in history as hendrix includes im sure being the man responsible for starving kings and presidents to death think of the verdict of history hendrix was silent he may or may not have been thinking about the verdict of history branson went on and we must not forget the delicate sensibilities of royalty before the barriers are in place wed like to have a couple of mobile latrine vans in position equipped of course to the very highest standards and that does not include being loaded to the gunwales with fbi agents you have all that hendrix its been recorded then set the wheels in motion or must i call in general cartland again it will be done now now branson cradled the phone on his knee and looked at it wonderingly and he didnt even tell me i couldnt get off with it he lifted the phone again last request hendrix but the most important one the president is temporarily incapacitated how can one talk to the leader of a leaderless nation the vicepresident is already in chicago hes on his way to ohare airfield now splendid splendid cooperation without even asking for it but im afraid ill also have to ask for the cooperation of one or two other senior ministers of the government i know its asking for a lot but i feel spare me your schoolboy humour branson there was an edge to hendrixs voice now but it was a tired edge i suppose you have some people in mind just a couple thats all branson had a gift for sounding eminently reasonable when making the most unreasonable demands and if you get them and the vicepresident together here i suppose youll make all three of them hostages too no youve only got my word for it of course but no youre losing whatever grip you had hendrix you dont kidnap negotiators if you did youd have to negotiate with someone else and so on down the line until we came to someone like you branson awaited for comment but hendrix appeared to be beyond comment i want the secretary of state hes on his way a mindreader no less from where los angeles how very convenient how come he was there an imf meeting imf then that means branson replaced the receiver well well well little peter branson visavis the secretary of the treasury what a teteatete this should be i thought the day would never come yes hendrix said wearily the secretary of fee treasury was there hes flying up with him four paid revson surfaced slowly almost reluctantly to a state of consciousness his eyelids felt leaden his head fuzzy and he thought that he had gone slightly deaf otherwise he felt no aftereffects from having been gassedhe knew he must have been gassed but everything had happened so quickly after the explosion under the drivers feet that he had no clear recollection of what had happened as his eyesight cleared he looked around him by his side a girl with a mop of blonde hair was huddled forward against the back of the seat before her her neck twisted at an uncomfortable angle some people he saw were lying in the aisle apparently asleep a score of others were still in their seats all resting at the moat uncomfortable angles some of them like himself were just beginning to stir he peered through the coach window blinked unbelievingly then stared again as a born and bred san franciscan it took him nothing flat to realize that their coach was baked almost squarely in the middle of the golden gate bridge it was a circumstance he felt which called for some explanation he turned his immediate attention to the girl at his side she was worth anyones attention she was possessed of a slight figure hardly strong enough one would have thought to lug around the heavy cine camera which shoulderslung accompanied her everywhere he blonde hair was so bleachednaturally revson thoughtthat it almost qualified for the description of platinum and she was quite beautiful with a very pale skin that the sun never appeared to touch she was she had given him to understand a fashion photographer for one of the major tv companies and as the official party of this presidential trip was exclusively male it was rather difficult to understand just why she was there it didnt make sense but men again neither did most presidential trips her name was equally preposterous april wednesday she called herself and her press card bore this out revson could only assume that she had been born of singularly unimaginative parents who as christening day approached had seized upon the birth date as the easy way out he put his hands on her shoulders and gently pulled her upright the blonde head lolled against his shoulder he had no idea how to revive people who had suffered from some form of gas poisoning should he shake her slap her cheek gently or just let her sleep it off he was spared the resolution of this problem when she stirred shivered for some reason or other although she was clad in only thin and markedly abbreviated green silk dress the temperature in the bus must have been in the eightiesthen opened her eyes and gazed unblinkingly at revsons in a face not noticeably lacking other commendable features those eyes were by far the most remarkable feature they were huge clear of a startling deep seagreen and were possessed of an odd quality of purity and innocence revson wondered idly just how devious she was any young woman who toted a camera for a tv company must have lost her innocence quite some time ago assuming she was possessed of any in the first place she said not taking her eyes from his what happened at a guess some joker must have let off a gas bomb the instant effect variety how do you feel punchdrunk hungover you know what i mean he nodded why would anyone want to do a thing like that why a lot of things he looked at his watch why after an hour and ten minutes are we still stranded in the middle of the golden gate bridge what look around you she looked around her slowly acknowledging the reality of the surroundings suddenly she stiffened and caught hold of be hand that was still around her shoulders those two men across the aisle her voice had dropped to a whisper theyre wearing handcuffs revson bent forward and looked the two large and still sleeping men were undoubtedly wearing handcuffs why again the whisper how should i know why ive just come to myself well then why arent we wearing them how shouldwe are among the blessed he looked over his shoulder and saw the presidential coach parked just behind them excuse me as a good journalist i think the odd probing question is in order im coming with you sure she stepped into the aisle and he followed instead of moving directly after her he lifted the coat lapel of the nearest of the sleeping men an empty shoulder holster was much in evidence he followed the girl at the front door he noticed that the driver still sound asleep was propped against the rightband front door quite some distance from his seat obviously he hadnt made it there under his own steam he joined me girl on the bridge a very large and extremely ugly policeman yonnie bad the kind of face that would have given any force a bad namewas pointing a machinepistol at them that a policeman should be pointing a gun at them was peculiar enough that a policeman should be armed with a machinegun was even more peculiar most peculiar of all however was the spectacle of six scowling and clearly unhappy policemen standing in a line each attached to the other by a pair of handcuffs april wednesday stared at them in astonishment then looked at revson he said i agree this would seem to call for some kind of explanation youll have it branson walking easily talking easily had just appeared round the front of the presidential bus whats your name revson sorry about this you too young lady helicopters she said yes they are arent they explanations will be forthcoming but not severally when your friends have all come to then well have a little talk branson walked away towards the rear coach his step was almost jaunty and he did not seem too displeased with life he looked at the bank of cloud moving in slowly very slowly from the west if it troubled him he did not show it he reached the crashed police car and spoke to the man standing guard have our four friends recovered chrysler yes sir i wouldnt say theyre in very high spirits though chrysler was a lean dark intelligentlooking young man and it only required the addition of a brief case to see him as an upandcoming attorney he was indeed as branson had told boyann a telecommunications expert he was also very good with combination locks and frightening people with guns i dare say let them stay in the car easier than getting them out and handcuffing them when the four fbi menat least from the fact that they were armed t assume they were fbi men in the lead coach have come to take a couple of the boys and escort them along with the six cops up front t e four here and the two inside our coach halfway towards the south tower sixteen in all and any one a potential menace if we keep them here halfway there take off whatever handcuffs there arevery useful things handcuffs you never know when we may need them again then let them walk off the bridge under their own steam okay its done he pointed to the west to the slowly advancing bank of cloud do you like that mr branson could have done without it well cope when it comes looks as if it may well pass under the bridge anyway mr branson it was jensen beckoning urgently from toe front door of the rear coach mount tamalpais urgent branson ran into the coach seated himself in front of the console and lifted the microphone branson giscard weve picked up a blip coming from the south well a bit east of south light plane looks like maybe eight miles out thank you branson made another switch south and a little east that could only be san francisco international airport chief of police hendrix at once hendrix was on the phone in seconds what now i told you to keep a clear airspace our radars picked up a blip airport direction hendrix interrupted his voice was sour you wanted to see messrs milton and quarry didnt you milton was the secretary for state quarry the secretary of the treasury they came in from los angeles fifteen minutes ago and are flying up direct by helicopter where are they landing in the military reservation in the presidio two three minutes by car thanks branson made the switch to mount tamalpais giscard acknowledged branson said no sweat friends but watch that scanner the next one may not be a friend will do mr branson branson rose made to leave the coach then stopped and looked at the bound man in he rear of the aisle he said to jensen who had taken the place of the bound man you can get back to calling yourself harriman again untie jensen here sending him off the bridge for once branson hesitated and didnt eke the feeling at all hesitation was not in his nature whether he arrived at decisions intellectually or instinctively he almost invariably did so immediately the few mistakes hed made in his life had invariably been associated with hesitation he made up his mind well keep him he might come in useful i dont know how yet but he just might and he is deputy director of the fbi hes no minnow to have in our net tell him the score but keep him here until i give the word he left and walked towards the lead coach at least a score of people were lined up outside the coach under the watchful eyes and guns of yonnie and his two colleagues they had understandably a general air of bafflement about them branson saw that included among them were four handcuffed men he looked inside the coach saw that it was empty and turned to peters take those four gentlemen with the handcuffs and the six policemen down to chrysler hell know what to do with them he turned to look at the oncoming fog closeup it was coming in a deal faster than it had seemed at a distance but it was a low bank with luck it would pass under the bridge even if it didnt he imagined that they could cope by using suitable threats against the president and his friends but he wouldnt feel really happy about those intermittent fogs until the steel barriers were in position at either end of the bridge he turned and looked at the correspondents there were four women among them but only one of them the greeneyed blonde with revson could truthfully have claimed to have been a postwar babyworld war two that was you can all relax branson said no harm is going to come to any of you in fact when i have finished youll be given a free choiceto walk off the bridge in safety or stay aboard the bridge equally in safety he smiled his generous empty smile i somehow fancy that most of you will elect to stay when i have finished you will realize i hope that a story like this does not fall into your laps every week when he had finished not one of those frantically scribbling and furiously cameraclicking journalists and photographers was under any doubt whatsoever a story like this fell into their laps once in a lifetime if they had the luck to have a very long life that was physical violence would have been required to remove any of them from the golden gate bridge they were slap bang in the middle of an unprecedented episode in criminal history and one that bade fair to become part of the more general history of their tunes the fog had reached the bridge ow but not enveloped it thin wisps of it drifted over the top but the main body of the fog rolled by twenty feet below the bridge the effect was to produce an odd feeling of weightlessness of suspension in space as if the bridge was afloat on the insubstantial bedrock of water vapour branson said you have elected to remain so you must accept some guide rules in the rear coach there are three telephone lines to town those are for my own personal and emergency use but you will be allowed to use them onceto contact your photographic services newspapers wire services or whatever to arrange for a representative to be stationed at the southern end of the bridge to pick up your dispatches and photographs this can be done three times a day at times yet to be arranged markers will be arranged in an oblong around the presidential coach and no one will cross thosewithout permission no one will interview any person inside the presidential coach without my permission or the consent of the party concerned it would be more satisfactory all round and fairer to all concerned if say the president were to hold a press conference out here but that i cannot and will not force anyone to do the helicopters will be similarly cordoned off and that will also be forbidden territory twenty yards south of my coach and twenty yards north of yours white lines will be painted across the bridge those will be your demarcation limits five yards beyond those lines will be a guard with a machinepistol and his orders will be not to warn but to shoot anyone who steps over those lines finally you will be confined to your coach during the hours of darkness this rule will only be relaxed if some particularly newsworthy happening occurs i will be the judge of what is newsworthy anyone unwilling to abide by those ground rules may leave now nobody left any questions branson watched the fog roll eastwards obscuring alcatraz island as the newsmen conferred among themselves two men took a step forward both were middleaged dressed in wellcut conservative suits one almost completely bald the other with grizzled hair and beard both inordinately bushy the bald man said we have your names im grafton ap this is dougan reuters branson regarded them with an interest that was pointless to conceal those two could reach more newspapers worldwide than all the rest put together and the question we would be right in saying mr branson that you didnt exactly get up this morning and say this would be a fine day for kidnapping the president of the united states you would dougan said this operation bears all the hallmarks of long and meticulous planning without condoning your actions one has to admit that you appear to have left nothing to chance and have foreseen every eventuality how long did the planning take three months thats not possible the details of this itinerary were released only four days ago the details were known in washington three months ago grafton said on the evidence before us we have to believe you why do you think this was kept under wraps so long in order to obviate the possibility of people like me doing exactly what i have done how did you get the advance information i bought it how where in washington as in many other places thirty thousand dollars buys a lot of information dougan said would you care to name names thats a stupid question any others a darksuited lady of indeterminate years said yes here we have all the signs of a highly experienced professionalism we can assume that this is not your first foray outside the law branson smiled you may assume what you like whats past is prologue she persisted do you have a criminal record mr branson i have never been in court in my life anything else of course it was dougan the thing that we all want to know why that you will find out in the course of a press conference i shall be holding within two hours at the conference will be a tv camera and crew representing the three main companies also present will be the secretary of state and the secretary of the treasury vicepresident richards we expect later but not in time for the conference experienced newsmen and newswomen though they were they appeared to be at a temporary loss for words finally dougan said carefully would it be true to say of you that you subscribe to the belief that if a thing is worth doing its worth doing well a pragmatic philosophy but h works you may now use the telephones in my coach three at a time branson turned away and took a step towards the presidential coach when yonnies voice stopped him jesus yonnie mouth inelegantly agape was staring out to the west you see what i see mr branson branson saw what he saw not much more than half a mile away the fogbank came to an abrupt end as if it had been sliced off by a cleaver less than a mile beyond that again could be seen the superstructure of a very large vessel indeed although the hull of the vessel was still hidden by the fogbank there was from what could be seen of it very little doubt as to its identity branson stood still for a second or two ran for the presidential coach entered hurried down the aisle oblivious to curious stares of the seated men and said quickly to boyann hendrix hurry he indicated a phone in a recess beside the console that one hendrix was on the line immediately when branson spoke his voice was cold almost savage a marked departure from the norm even branson had defences that could be breached hendrix want i should send the presidents ears now what the hell do you mean what do you mean or is that little paddleboat just out there by happenstance call it off gods sake call what off branson spoke his words clearly and spaced them distinctly there is a very large battleship approaching the golden gate bridge i dont want it to approach i dont know what you have in mind but i dont think i would like it call it off i just dont know what youre talking about hold on while the line was silent branson beckoned to van effen who approached down the aisle branson said quickly theres a battleship approaching the bridge trouble i dont know what i do know is i want everybody under cover at once the press in their own coach our men in ours doors to be closed then come back at once van effen nodded to where a redhaired young man was standing by the drivers seat his hand resting on a pistol that was stuck in his belt think bradford can manage branson pulled out his own pistol and laid it in the telephone recess im here too hurry he was vaguely disappointed in van effen bradford could have carried out his warder duties just as effectively by going outside and standing near the door but for the creation of the properly threatening climate of menace and intimidation it was better that he remain in the full view of the captives then hendrix was on the phone again that is the battleship uss new jersey san francisco is her home base for several months of the year this is one of her regular fuel and food reprovisioning returns to base shes coming at this particular time because she can only get under the bridge at low tide that much branson knew was true the tide he had observed was out and it seemed highly unlikely that the authorities could whistle up a battleship at such short notice less than two hours and k was difficult to see what use could be made of it certainly they were unlikely to blow up the bridge with the president on it but branson had a profound distrust of his fellow man which was one of the reasons he had survived so long he said stop it its not to come under the bridge want i should throw one of your oil boys on to its bridge as it passes beneath for gods sake are you a nut a complete madman branson smiled to himself the sharp edge of anxiety in hendrixs voice was unmistakable were trying to raise him correspondents and guards alike were crowding the western side of the bridge fascinated by the approach of the giant battleship although reason said that there was no danger in the battleships passing under the bridge there was a growing degree of tension among the spectators the superstructure towered so high that it seemed certain that some sections of it must inevitably strike the bridge and this feeling existed in spite of the elementary reasoning which would have reassured them that the ship must have made the same passage many times in the past and the navy was not in the habit of putting at risk some hundred million dollar battleship in a letstryitandsee effort one person showed no apparent interest in the approach of the new jersey revson alone in the front coach was intent on securing a considerable length of green cord so slender as to be hardly more than the thickness of a stout thread to a black cylinder about eight inches in length and one in diameter he thrust both cylinder and cord into the capacious pocket of his bush jacket left the bus took a bearing on the approaching superstructure of the battleship and wandered casually round to the righthand side of the coach as he did so he could see van effen hurrying across to the far side of the bridge where the spectators were grouped what van effens purpose was he couldnt be sure but there was an urgency behind his halftrot mat told revson hat the time at his own disposal might be very short he forced himself not to hurry but sauntered towards the east side of the bridge no one took any notice of him because there was no one there to do so he leant casually against the side and as casually withdrew cylinder and cord from his pocket he glanced seemingly aimlessly around him but if he were arousing cause for suspicion no one was giving any indication of this swiftly without moving either hands or elbows he let some hundred feet slide through his fingers then secured the cord to a strut he trusted his estimate of length was reasonably accurate then dismissed the thought what was done was done he returned leisurely to the coach took his seat and transferred what was left of the green cord to the bottom of april wednesdays carryall if his dangling cord were discovered and a search of their personal belongings carried out he would rather that the cord be discovered elsewhere than in his possession even if it were found in her bag he doubted whether she would come to any harm shed been on the other side of the bridge since the new jersey had first appeared behind the bank of cloud and there would be sufficient witnesses to attest to that april wednesday was the sort of person whose absence would not go lightly unremarked even if she were to find herself in trouble that he could bear with fortitude he didnt care who came under suspicion as long as it was not himself you have to believe me branson hendrixs voice could hardly have been said to carry a note of pleading an alien exercise to a man of his nature but there was no questioning the earnestness the total sincerity in the tone the new jerseys captain has heard no news of what happened and he thinks it all an elaborate joke at his expense you cant blame him he sees the damned bridge standing safe and sound as its stood for forty years why should anything be wrong keep trying van effen entered and closed the door of the presidential coach securely behind him he approached branson all safely corralled why i wish i knew almost certainly hendrix is right and this is just sheer coincidence but on the one chance in a hundred that it isnt what would they use not shells no kind of high explosive gas shells no such things wrong there are they wouldnt mind temporarily knocking out the president and a few oil sheikhs if they could saturate the centre of the bridge with some knockout gas and lay us all low then the troops and police like enough with gasmasks could come and take us at their leisure but the insulation is tight in those airconditioned coaches its pretty farfetched and what we are doing is not wait hendrix was on the phone again weve tried branson and at last he agrees with us but he refuses to do anything says he has too much way on and to try to take turning or reversing action at this stage would endanger both the battleship and the bridge and he says his money would be on the new jersey if it hit a tower a fortyfivethousandton battering ram takes a lot of stopping youd better pray hendrix branson hung up and moved towards the centre of the coach van effen behind him and peered through the righthand windows waiting for the battleships superstructure to reappear from under the bridge the presidents voice was nothing if not testy just what is happening branson you know the uss new jersey k passing beneath us so doubtless going about its lawful occasions youd better hope so youd better hope the captain doesnt start throwing things at us at us the president paused and pondered the possibility of an awful lesemajesty at me we all know youre the commanderinchief of the armed forces at the moment however youre a bit isolated from the lower echelons what happens if the captain considers it his duty to act upon his own initiative anyway well soon find out here he comes now the superstructure of the new jersey had moved into view all nine of the seated captives struggled to their feet and crowded close to the righthand windows one of them crowded very closely indeed on branson who suddenly became aware of something obviously metallic jabbing painfully into his left kidney initiative you said mr branson it was sheikh iman the one with the beard and he was still beaming your own gun tell your men to drop theirs good man there was triumph in the presidents voice and an element of vindictiveness that the voters wouldnt have liked at all branson said patiently put that gun away dont you know when youre dealing with professionals he turned around slowly and iman proved bransons implied point that he was not a professional by letting branson hold his gaze for all of a second a gun boomed iman shrieked in pain dropped his gun and clutched a shattered shoulder sheikh kharan stooped swiftly to retrieve the gun from the floor and cried out in agony as bransons heel crushed his hand against the metal a peculiar crackling splintering sound left no doubt that several of kharans fingers had been broken branson picked up his gun van effen was apologetic but not unduly so had to im afraid mr branson if id warned him well i didnt want any gunfight in the ok corral with all those nasty ricochets from the bulletproof glass he might have done himself an injury quite right branson looked through the window again the new jersey was now almost a half mile away and its captain was obviously not in a belligerent mood branson turned away and spoke to bradford go to our coach and fetch the firstaid box bring peters peters mr branson used to be field corpsman take your seats gentlemen unhappily they took their seats the president in particular looked especially deflated branson wondered briefly just how hollow a man he might be then dismissed the line of thought as unprofitable i dont think i have to warn you not to try anything so silly again he went to the communications console and picked up the phone hendrix here satisfied now yes warn the harbourmaster or whoever the responsible official is that there is to be no more traffic under the bridge either way no more traffic youll bring the entire port to a standstill and the fishing fleet the fishing fleet can go fish in the bay send an ambulance and a doctor and do it quickly a couple of men here have gotten themselves hurt one badly who how the oil ministers iman and kharan selfinflicted injuries you might say as he spoke branson watched peters hurry into me coach approach iman and start scissoring away the sleeve of his coat there will be a tv van coming to the bridge soon let it through i also want some chairs brought on to the bridge forty should do chairs you dont have to buy them branson said patiently confiscate them from the nearest restaurant forty chairs things you afc on im going to hold a news conference in an hour or so you dont stand around at news conferences you sit around hendrix said carefully youre going to hold a news conference and youre going to televise it live thats it nationwide youre out of your mind my mental health is my concern milton and quarry there yet you mean the secretary and the secretary of the treasury i mean milton and quarry theyve just arrived and are with me now hendrix looked at the two men who were with him then inside the big mobile communications van milton the secretary of state was a tall thin dyspeptic character with no hair rimless steellegged glasses and an enviable reputation in foreign offices around the world quarry whitehaired plump and cheerful had a kindly avuncular air about him which many men even some very highly intelligent ones had taken to be a reflection of the true personality of the man his reputation as a banker and economist stood as high as that of milton in his field milton said it would be easy to say hes quite crazy of course is he hendrix spread his hands you know what they say crazy like a fox and violent it would seem no violence he uses only as a last resort and even then only when pushed into a corner imasi and kharan must have made the mistake of pushing him into a corner quarry said you would seem to know a fair bit about him hendrix sighed every senior police officer in the states knows about him and in canada mexico and god knows how many south american countries hendrix sounded bitter so far he has spared europe his attentions its only a matter of time im sure whats his speciality robbery he robs trains planes armoured cars banks and jewellers robbery wherever possible as i say without violence quarry was dry i gather he is quite successful quite successful to the best of our knowledge he has been operating for at least a dozen years and the lowest estimate of his takings in that time is twenty million dollars twenty million for the first time there was a note of respect in quarrys voice the banker and economist in him surfacing if hes got all that money why does he want more why do niarchos and getty and hughes want more after all hey too are comfortably off maybe hes just a businessman in the way that they are businessmen and hes hooked on his job maybe he finds it a stimulating intellectual exercise maybe its sheer greed maybe anything milton said has he ever been convicted hendrix looked pained hes never even been arrested and that has something to do with the fact that neither of us has ever heard of him hendrix gazed through the van window at the magnificent sweep of he golden gate bridge there was a faroff look of yearning in his eyes he said let us say sir that we do not care to advertise our failures mitton smiled at him john and ihe nodded at the secretary of the treasury frequently suffer from the same bashfulness and for the same reasons infallibility is not the lot of mankind anything known about this man apart from what is known about his criminal activities hendrix said sourly it wouldnt be hard to know more about him than we do about his life of crime pretty well documented background really a wasp from out east comes from what they call a good family father a banker and when i say banker i mean he owned still does i believe his own bank branson the treasury secretary said of course know him not personally though and something else that will interest you sir professionally branson took a degree in economics and went to work in his fathers bank while he was there he took a phd and no coffeegrinder diploma school either genuine ivy league then for his postgraduate course he took up the subject of crime something to do with having worked in his old mans bank maybe hendrix looked gloomy i suppose we could say that he has graduated in that subject now too summa cum laude milton said you seem to have almost a degree of admiration for this person hendrix id give my pension to see him behind bars both as a man and a policeman he outrages whatever passes for my sensibilities but one cant help respecting sheer professionalism no matter how misused my sentiments too im afraid milton said hes not a particularly retiring person this branson of yours i wish he were mine if you mean does he suffer from our bouts of bashfulness no sir he does not arrogant to the point perhaps of megalomania at least thats what general cartland says and i wouldnt care to dispute what the general says few would milton spoke with some feeling speaking of selfopinionated characters where art thou at this hour my lames sir what other selfopinionated character is there i refer to mr hagenbach the selfopinionated head of our fbi i would have thought he would have been the first man hotfoot to the scene washington says they dont know where he is theyre trying every place they can think of im afraid hes a very elusive man sir mans got a mania for secrecy milton brightened well if hes watching his tv in an hour or so he should be considerably enlightened what a perfectly splendid thought the head of our fbi the last man in america to know about this he thought for a moment bransons insistence on maximum publicity tv radio ill be bound newsmen photographers has he ever declared himself publicly like this before i mean before or during any of his criminal activities never the man must be terribly sure of himself in his place so would i quarry appeared distracted what can we do to the man as i see it hes in an impregnable quite unassailable position i wouldnt give up hope sir we have one or two experts looking for an answer admiral newson and general carter are in our hq now working on this newson carter our twin geniuses of finesse quarry seemed more discouraged than ever never use one hydrogen bomb where two will suffice someone should send our arabian oil friends word that theyre about to become involved in a nuclear holocaust he gestured through his window towards the bridge just took at it just think of it a totally impossible situation if it werent for the fact that we can see now that its all too possible total absolute isolation completely cut off from the world and in the full view of everybody in san francisco everybody in the world for that matter as soon as those tv cameras start turning a figurative stones throw awayacid they might as well be on the moon he sighed heavily one must confess to a feeling of utter helplessness come come john milton was severe is this the spirit that won the west the hell with the west im thinking about me i dont have to be very clever to know beyond any doubt that i am going to be the man in the middle hendrix said sir why else do you think this ruffian had summoned the secretary of the treasury to his royal presence hands in pockets as if deep in thought revson wandered along the east side of the bridge stopping frequently to gaze at and presumably admire the panorama stretched out before himto his left the tip of belvedere beyond fort baker titouron and angel island the largest in the bay to his right the city itself and straight ahead alcatraz island and beyond it treasure island between the two the rapidly diminishing shape of the new jersey was heading for its berth at akuneda he made frequent stops as if peering over the side on one of those occasions he reached casually for the green cord hed attached to the strut and hefted it it was weightless what are you doing he turned unhurriedly april wednesdays big green eyes if not exactly alive with curiosity held a certain puzzlement you do have flannel feet i thought i was the only person within miles well yards what are you doing when i look at this marvellous view here and then at you i really dont know which i prefer i think you have any people ever told you that youre really rather beautiful lots she caught the green cord between finger and thumb and started to lift it then made a muffled sound of pain as his hand closed none too gently over hers leave that alone she rubbed her hand looked around her and said well im fishing not for compliments thats for sure she massaged her knuckles tenderly then looked at him with some uncertainty fishermen tell tall tales dont they ive done it myself tell me one are you as trustworthy as youre beautiful am i beautiful and im not fishing honest you are then im trustworthy too they smiled at each other and he took her arm a really tall one yes please why ever not they walked slowly away together hendrix replaced the receiver in its cradle he looked at milton and quarry you are ready gentlemen act one scene one and all the worlds a stage thats wrong somehow milton rose and looked critically at quarry the shirts wrong too john white shows up badly on tv should be bluelike meor the president blue shirts are all he has you never know when a tv camera is lurking round the next corner oh shut up quarry turned morosely towards the rear door of the van then stopped as a motorcycle policeman drew up with a suitably dramatic screeching of tyre and smell of burning rubber dismounted propped his machine and hurried to the rear steps of the van he held up his hand to hendrix for you air hendrix took the eightinchlong narrow cylinder its got my name on it all right where did you get it from the pilot boat brought in from the new jersey the captain of the new jersey that is thought it might be very urgent five the centre section of the golden gate bridge was fast assuming the appearance of an embryonic town sprawling inchoate and wholly disorganized as those burgeoning settlements tend to be but none the less possessed of a vitality a feverish restlessness that augured well for its expansive future the fact that all the buildings were on wheels and that all the village elders seated in solemn conclave were immaculately dressed and had clearly never done a single days physical toil in their collective lives did little to detract from the curious impression that here were the pioneers pushing forwards the limits of the wild frontier there were three coaches and three police carsthe third had just brought hendrix milton and quarry there were two large glazewindowed vehicles which bore the euphemistic legend rest room painted in becoming red and yellow stripes they had been borrowed from an itinerant circus currently stoppedover in the city there was an ambulance which branson had commandeered for purposes best known to himself a large sidecounter wagonette which had provided hot meals a very large tv camera truck with its generator placed at a discreet hundred yards distance and finally a van that was unloading blankets rugs and pillows to help ease the new settlers through the rigours of their first night there were of course the discordant even jarring items the helicopters the tracked antiaircraft guns the patrolling aimed men the army engineers at a distance on either side busily erecting steel barricadesthose did tend to project a disturbing hint of violence to come and yet they were not entirely alien there so bizarre were the circumstances that the normal would have tended to look sadly out of place the unreality of it all when matched up against the outside world had its own strange reality in this particular point in time and place and for those participating in the scene the reality of their situation was all too selfevident no one smiled the cameras were in position so were the hostages the three newly arrived men and behind them in the second row sat the journalists the photographers had taken up positions best suited to themselves none of them more than a few feet distant from an armed guard facing them in solitary splendour sat branson close by him on the ground lay a peculiar object a length of heavy canvas with coneshaped objects embedded in it beside it lay a heavy metal box its lid closed i will not detain you unnecessarily gentlemen branson said whether or not he was enjoying his moment of glory the knowledge that he held some of the most powerful men in the world at his complete mercy the consciousness that a hundred million people were looking at and listening to him was quite impossible to say he was calm relaxed unnervingly confident of and in himself but displaying no other visible emotion you will have guessed why we all find ourselves here and why i am here the reason why im here i take it quarry said exactly you will bear in mind that unlike you i am not a law unto myself the final decision is not mine appreciated branson could have been conducting some urbane seminar in an ivy college that comes later first things first dont you think mr quarry money money how much quarrys reputation for disconcerting bluntness bad been easily earned one moment mr secretary the president had his weaknesses no less than the two hundred million people for whom he was the elected head of state and high on the list was an almost pathological dislike of being upstaged what do you want this money for branson whats that got to do with it supposing its any of your business it is my business i must state categorically if you want it for any subversive activities for any evil practices whatsoever and especially for any antiamerican activities well i tell you here and now that you can have my body first who am i compared to america branson nodded approval stoutly spoken mr president especially considering the fact that you have left your speech writers behind i hear the voice of our founding fathers the clarion call of the conscience that lies at the grassroots of america the grand old party are going to love you for that it should be worth another two million votes come november however quite apart from the fact that you dont mean a word you say i have to reassure you that this money is required for purely apolitical purposes its for a private trust in fact branson enterprises inc me the president wasnt a man to be easily knocked off stride if he were he wouldnt have been president you have just mentioned the word conscience you have none i dont honestly know branson said frankly where money is concerned none most of the really wealthy men in the world are moral cripples basically criminallyminded types who maintain a facade of spurious legality by hiring lawyers as morally crippled as they are themselves branson appeared to muse multimillionaires politicians lawyerswhich of them lies furthest beyond the moral pale but dont answer thati may unintentionally be putting you in an invidious position were all rogues whether under the hypocritical cover of legalism or out in the noonday sun like me i just want some fast money fast and i reckon this is as good a way as any of getting it quarry said we accept that you are an honest thief let us come to cases my reasonable demands the point mr branson branson surveyed the arabian oil baronsnow without iman who was in hospitaland the president for this lot on the hoof in prime condition and no haggling about pennies three hundred million dollars thats a three followed by eight nothings to the many million viewers throughout america it was immediately obvious that there had been a sound transmission breakdown the silence however was more than compensated for by the wide and interesting variety of expressions registered on the faces of those on the screen which ranged from total outrage through total incomprehension through total incredulity to total shock indeed in those few imperishable moments sound would have been an unforgiveable intrusion predictably in view of the fact that he was accustomed to dealing with figures which contained large numbers of zeros secretary of the treasury quarry was the first to recover you did say what i thought i heard you say three zero zero comma zero zero zero comma zero zero zero period if you give me a blackboard and some chalk ill write it out for you preposterous lunatic the mans mad mad mad the president whose now puce colour showed up rather well on colour television clenched his fist and looked round in vain for a table to bang it on you know the penalty for this branson kidnapping blackmail extortion under threats n a scale a scale quite unprecedented in the annals of crime yes on a scale quiteshut up the death penalty can be invoked for treasonand this is high treasonand if its the last thing i do that might be any moment rest assured mr president that you wont be around to pull the switch you better believe me he produced his pistol as a token of my intent how would you like a hundred million viewers to see you being shot through the kneecapthen you really would need that cane of yours its a matter of indifference to me and in his voice there was a chilling indifference that carried far more conviction than the words themselves the president unclenched his fist and seemed not so much to sink into his chair as to deflate into it the puce was assuming a greyish hue you people have to learn to think big branson went on this is the united states of america the richest country in the world not a banana republic whats three hundred million dollars a couple of polaris submarines a tiny fraction of what it cost to send a man to the moon a fraction of one per cent of the gross national product if i take one drop from the american bucket whos going to miss it but if im not allowed to take it then a lot of people are going to miss you mr president and your arabian friends and to think what you are going to lose you and america ten times that a hundred times that to start with the san rafael refinery deal will fall through your hopes of becoming a most favoured nation receiving oil at rockbottom prices are gone for ever in fact if their highnesses fail to return to their homeland it is certain that a total oil embargo would be placed on the states which would send the country into a bottomless recession which would make look like a sunday afternoon picnic he looked at hansen the energy czar you would agree mr hansen clearly the last thing that hansen wanted to do was to agree with anyone his nervous tics were rapidly assuming the proportions of a st vituss dance head darting he looked around for succour in his hour of need he swallowed he coughed into his hands he looked imploringly at the president and seemed almost on the point of breaking down when the secretary of the treasury came to his rescue quarry said i would read the future the same way thank you the king raised his hand a word if you will the king was a man of a very different calibre to the president as one who had to remove permanently more often than not quite a number of his closest relatives in order to get his crown the rough and tumble of life was hardly a new experience for him he had lived with violence all his life and would very probably die with or because of it of course only the blind have their eyes closed to reality i am not blind the president will pay the president had no comment to make on this generous offer he was staring down at the roadway like a fortune teller peering into his crystal ball and not wanting to tell his client what he sees there thank you your highness you will of course be hunted down and killed afterwards no matter where you may seek to bide in the world even if you were to kill me now your death is already as certain as tomorrows sun branson was unconcerned as long as i have you your highness i have no worries on that score i should imagine that any of your subjects who as much as endangered your life far less being responsible for your losing it would find himself rather precipitately in paradiseif regicides go to paradise which i dont think should be allowed and i hardly think youre the type of man to run to the side of the bridge now and jump over in order to incite the faithful to come after me with their long knives indeed the hooded eyes were unblinking and what if i were not the sort of person you think i am if you were to jumpor try to again the chilling indifference why do you think i have a doctor and ambulance here van effen if anyone is as misguided as to make a break for it what are your instructions van effen matched the indifference chop his foot off with my machinepistol the doctor will fix him up we might even eventually provide you with an artificial foot youre worth nothing to me dead your highness the hooded eyes had closed well the ransom figure agreed no objectors splendid well thats for starters starters it was general cartland speaking and one could almost see the firing squad mirrored in his eyes to begin with that means theres more two hundred million dollars more thats what i want for the golden gate bridge this time the state of traumatic shock did not last quite so long there is a limit to how much the human mind can take the president raised his eyes from the depths of the bottomless pit he was scanning and said dully two hundred million dollars for the golden gate bridge its a bargain at the price practically a giveaway true it cost only forty million to build and the asking price of two hundred million just exactly represents the fivefold inflation over the past forty years but money apart think of the fearful cost of replacing it think of the noise the dust the pollution the disruption to all the city traffic as all those thousands of tons of steel have to be brought in of the tourists who will cripple the citys economy by staying away in their tens of thousands beautiful though san francisco is without the golden gate it would be like mona lisa without her smile think and this is for a period of at least one year perhaps twoof all those marin county motorists who couldnt get to the cityits a long long way round by the san rafael bridgeor come to that the city motorists who couldnt get to marin county the hardship would be intolerable for everyoneexcept for the owners of the ferryboat companies who would become millionaires and who am i to grudge the entrepreneur the making of an honest dollar two hundred million dollars philanthropy thats what it is quarry the man accustomed to thinking in rows of noughts said if we do not accede to this monstrous request what do you intend to do with the bridge take it away and pawn it somewhere im going to blow it up a twohundredfoot dropit should be the most almighty splash the west coast has ever seen blow it up blow up the golden gate bridge mayor morrison whose normal boiling point was just above freezing was on his feet his face suffused with ungovernable anger and had launched himself at branson before anyone realized what was happening certainly before branson had realized in tens of millions of american homes they saw branson being knocked backwards off his seat his head striking heavily against the roadway as morrison all two hundred and twenty pounds of him followed him down and struck at his face with berserker fury van effen stepped forward and brought the butt of his machinepistol down on morrisons neck he immediately swung round to cover the seated men with his gun but the precaution was superfluous no one was showing any inclination to follow morrisons example it was a full twenty seconds before branson could sit up and then only groggily he accepted a pad of medical gauze and dabbed at a smashed lip and a very bloody nose he looked at morrison then at the doctor how is he the doctor carried out a brief examination hell be all right hes not even concussed the doctor glanced at van effen without enthusiasm your friend seems to be able to judge those things to a nicety practice branson explained thickly he accepted another gauze pad in place of the already bloodsaturated one and rose unsteadily to his feet mayor morrison doesnt knew his own strength van effen said what shall i do with him leave mm be its his sky its his bridge my faulti just trod on a mans dreams he looked at morrison consideringly on second thoughts youd better handcuff himbehind the back next time he might knock my head off my shoulders general cartland came to his feet and walked towards branson van effen levelled his gun menacingly but cartland ignored him he said to branson you fit to talk im fit to listen anyway he didnt get round to my ears i may be chief of staff but to trade im an army engineer that means i know explosives you cant blow up the bridge and you should know it youd require a wagonload of explosives to bring down those towers i dont see any wagonload of explosives we dont need them he pointed to the thick canvas strap with the conical mounds embedded in it youre the expert cartland looked at the strap then at branson then at the seated watchers then back at the strap again branson said suppose you tell them my mouth hurts i cant imagine why cartland took a long look at the massive towers and the cables suspended from them he said to branson you have experimented branson nodded successfully or you wouldnt be here branson nodded again reluctantly almost cartland turned to the seated hostages and journalists i was wrong im afraid branson can indeed bring the bridge down those cones you see embedded in the canvas strap contain some conventional explosives tnt amatol anyway something of the requisite power those cones are called beehives and because of their concave bases are designed to direct at least eighty per cent of their explosive value inwards the idea i should imagine is to wrap one of those canvas straps with its hundredweight or whatever of high explosive round one of the suspension cables probably high up near the top of a tower he looked at branson again i should imagine you have four of those branson nodded and designed to fire simultaneously he turned back to the others im afraid that would be it down it all comes there was a brief silence which must have been very nailbiting for tv watchers a silence caused by the fact mat branson understandably didnt feel very much like speaking and the others couldnt think of very much to say cartland said eventually how can you be sure they all go off together simple radio wave that activates an electric cell that burns the wire in a mercury fulminate detonator up goes the primer and up goes the beehive ones enough the others go up by sympathetic detonation quarry said heavily i suppose that ends your demands for the day not quite branson turned a palm up in an apologetic gesture but its only a trifle one wonders what you might consider a trifle a quarter of a million dollars astonishing by your standards a grain of sand and what might that be for my expenses your expenses quarry breathed deeply twice my god branson you are the piker to end all pikers im used to people calling me names he shrugged i dont hurt so easily any more and one learns to take the rough with the smooth now as to payment you are going to pay me arent you no one said whether they were going to pay him or not i have to make arrangements with a friend in new york who has friends in certain european banks he looked at his watch its noon now so its either eight or nine oclock in central europe and all good central european bankers knock off at six precisely so id be greatly obliged if youd let me have your decision by seven oclock in the morning quarry said cautiously what decision as to the availability of the funds and the form that they will take not that i care very much what they are anything from eurodollars to stock in suitably selected offshore funds you of all people should find little problem in handling such things with a certain amount of discretion witness for instance the hundreds of millions of dollars youve funded such organizations as the cia for subversive activities overseas without the poor taxpayer being any the wiser a childishly simple routine for your treasury not that i care whether those funds are traceable or not just as long as they are convertible when my new york friend has informed us that those funds have all arrived at their several destinations and that shouldnt take more than another twentyfour hours say until noon the same daywe shall take our farewells of you our hostages will of course accompany us and where are you taking us cartland demanded you im not taking anywhere the armed services may regard you as invaluable but your value to me as a bargaining counter is zero besides youre the only man here who could conceivably cause me trouble not only are you a man of action but youre far too leanlet me have men about me that are fat and all that bit the president and his three remaining oil friends theres no harm in telling you that t have a friend in the caribbean who is the president of an island that doesnt and never will have an extradition treaty with the united states hes willing to put us up bed and breakfast for a million dollars a night no one had anything to say to this in terms of the sums of money that branson had so recently been bandying about it seemed a reasonable enough charge one point branson said i did not mention that as from noon the following dayday after tomorrow that isthere will be a penalty clause an escalation charge you might call it for every hours delay in the reported lodgment of the funds two million dollars an hour you do place a certain value on your time dont you mr branson quarry said if i dont who will would there be any more questions yes cartland said how do you propose to get to this island paradise of yours fly there how else a tenminute flight in our helicopters to the international airport and we board our plane there you have all this arranged you have a plane standing by well it doesnt know its standing by but it will soon enough what plane air force i believe you call it even cartland was shaken out of his habitual reserve you mean youre going to hijack the presidential boeing be reasonable general you surely cant expect your president to judder his way down to the caribbean in a clappedout dcs its the logical the only way of transporting world leaders who are accustomed to the ultimate in luxury travel well show them the latest films brief though their incarceration may be well make it as comfortable as possible for them we might even get some more new films when we fly them back to the states again we cartland said carefully my friends and i i feel it only rightno more than that our bounded duty that we should see them safely back again how any man of any sensitivity can bear to live in that monstrosity they call the white house i dont know but after all theres no place like home milton was equally careful you mean youre going to set foot on american soil again my own my native land why ever not you disappoint me mr milton i do you do apart from the supreme court and the attorney general i would have thought that the secretary of state would know as much about our law and constitution as any other man in the land there was silence branson looked around but here was still silence so he addressed himself to the secretary again or dont you know that bit where it says that no man who has been granted a full and free pardon by the state for any crime actual or alleged can ever again be arraigned on that same charge it took at least ten seconds for the full implications to dawn and it was then mat the potomac in the person of the chief executive burst its banks it was also then that the president lost twice the number of the putative votes he might have gained from his earlier statement that he would sacrifice himself for america he could hardly be blamed devious some politicians may be and others are armoured in pachydermal hides but never had the president encountered such machiavellian effrontery even presidents may be forgiven the odd earthy turn of phrase within the privacy of their own four walls but they customarily abjure such phraseology when addressing the electorate but momentarily the president had totally forgotten the fact that he was in effect addressing the electorate he was appealing to a mindless heaven for justice and it was in that direction that his anguished face was lifted as he stood there arms rigidly outstretched and fists clenched his face assuming a peculiarly purplish hue half a deleted billion dollars and a deleted full and free pardon i god aldeletedmighty he lowered his gaze from the cloudless sky and turned the full fury of his wrath on branson who disappointingly had not been struck down by a bolt from heaven branson murmured to the doctor you have your cardiac arrest unit handy this is not funny the president warmed to his theme you evil twisted deluded bastard if you imagine cartland belatedly readied his side touched his arm and whispered urgently youre on television sir the president cut off in midexpletive looked at him screwed his eyes shut in sudden comprehension opened them again looked the camera squarely in the eye and addressed it in measured tones i as the elected representative and chief executive of the american people will not stand for this vile blackmail the machinations of this evil and amoral man the american people will not stand for it democracy will not stand for it come what may we shall fight this cancer in our midst how branson asked how the president tried manfully to control his blood pressure at the thought of this but full rationality had not yet returned to him the entire resources of every investigative agency in those united states of ours the entire weight of the armed forces the full majesty of law and order will be brought to bear youre not up for reelection for six months yet how when i have consulted with the senior members of my cabinet youre through with consulting anyone except on my sayso a full and free pardon if not your stay on this tropical island may be indefinitely extended most of the island as i say is pretty close to paradise but theres a small stockaded section in one corner of the island thats been modelled rather closely on the devils island that used to be the generalissimo has to have some place for his political dissidents and as he doesnt care for them overly much the majority of them never emerge again its a combination of hard labour fever and starvation i somehow dont see the king here with a pickaxe in his hand nor yourself for that matter and instead of waffling on about the nations moral rectitude you might give thought to another possible predicament of your guests here it is no secret that both the king and prince have trusted government ministers and relatives who are just yearning to try their thrones for size if your friends stay in the caribbean were to be unduly prolonged one rather suspects that they would have neither kingdom nor sheikhdom to return to you appreciate of course that american opinion would never let you deal with their usurpers especially as you would be the one held to blame for it bang goes november bang goes san rafael here comes either redoubled oil prices or a total embargo and in either case a disastrous recession you wont even rate a footnote in history at best if they ever get round to compiling a list of historys most stupid and disastrous national leaders then you have a fair chance of making the guinness book of records but history itself no you have quite finished the presidents anger had seemingly evaporated and he had attained a curious sort of resigned dignity for the moment branson motioned to the tv cameramen that the performance was over may i have a word with the king prince my governmental colleagues and the chief of police why not especially if it helps you to arrive at your decision more quickly in privacy certainly your coach in the strictest privacy the guard will remain outside as you know the coach is soundproof the strictest privacy i promise you they moved away leaving branson alone he beckoned chrysler his telecommunications expert is the bug in the presidential coach activated permanently our friends are having a toplevel secret discussion in there wouldnt you care to have a rest in our coach you must be tired very tired mr branson chrysler made his way to the rear coach and sat by the drivers seat in front of the console he made a switch and lifted a single earphone apparently satisfied with what he heard he replaced the earphone and made another switch a tape recorder started humming april wednesday said to revson well what did you make of that id love to see the nielsen ratings when they rerun that later in the day they were walking to and fro along the western or deserted side of the bridge what a cast rehearsals would have ruined it you know i dont mean that i know hes quite a boy our peter branson highly intelligent but we know that alreadyall the angles figured every eventuality taken care of far in advance hed have made an excellent general you could at least i could almost like and admire the guy except for the fact that the odd half billion apart he plainly does this for kicks hes a moral vacuum and the ordinary standards of right and wrong just do not hold good for him they simply dont exist theres something strangely empty about him his bank book isnt going to be but i didnt mean that either i know that too in answer to your unspoken question yes he has us helpless do you intend to do anything about it intentions are one thing achievements another well you just cant walk up and down there doing nothing after what you told me this morning i know what i told you this morning a little respectful silence if you please cant you see im thinking after some little time he said ive thought i cant wait have you ever been sick she lifted her brows which had the effect of making the huge green eyes larger than ever with those eyes revson reflected she could wreck a cardinals council in nothing flat to keep his mind on the work on hand he looked away she said of course ive been sick everybodys been sick some time i mean really sick hospital like that no not ever youre going to be very soon la hospital sick if youre still prepared to help that is ive told you that already asperity ill becomes a lovely lady theres quite an element of risk if youre caught branson would make you talk half a billion dollars is a lot of money to have at stake youd talk very quickly even more quickly than that im not one of your wartime resistance heroines and i dont like pain caught at what delivering a letter for me leave me alone for a few minutes will you revson unshipped his camera and took some still shots of the coaches helicopters antiaircraft guns and guards trying as much as possible to keep the southern tower and the san franciscan skyline in the background clearly a dedicated craftsman at work he then turned his attention and lens towards the ambulance and the whitejacketed doctor leaning against it the doctor said instant fame for me is it what else everyone wants to be immortalized not this doctor and an ambulance you can film anywhere you need psychiatric help revson lowered his camera dont you know that its positively antisocial in this country not to want to hog the camera lens my names revson ohare ohare was youthful cheerful redhaired and his irish ancestry lay no more than a generation behind him and what do you think of this lovely little setup for quotation im a cameraman aw hell quote me if you want id just love to belt smartypantss ears off it figures what the red hair id feel the same if i were black blond or bald as a coot arrogant smoothies do something to me and i dont like the way he needles the president and publicly humiliates him youre a president man then hell hes a californian im a californian i voted for him last time and ill do so next time okay so hes stuffy and overdoes the kindly uncle bit but hes the best we have not that that says a great dealbut well hes really a decent old stick decent old stick dont blame me i was educated in england would you like to help him ohare looked at revson thoughtfully funny question sure i would would you help me to help him how can you help him ill try and ill tell you howif you say yes that is and what makes you think you can help more than anyone else special qualifications im a government employee so whats with the camera then and i always thought it took a fair amount of intelligence to qualify as a doctor what do you expect me to be carryinga footwide plaque on my chest saying i am an fbi agent ohare smiled but only faintly well no but the story is that all the fbi men were left asleep in a downtown garage except for a few on the press coach who were rousted out and marched off the bridge we dont put all our eggs in one basket and agents dont usually disclose their identity either not this agent id disclose my identity to anyone if i were in trouble and im in trouble now as long as its not unethical i wouldnt bring a blush to the hippocratic cheek that guaranteed would you consider it unethical to help put branson behind bars is that guaranteed too no count on me what do you want done we have a lady photographer with us who is young rather beautiful by the unlikely name of april wednesday ha ohare brightened considerably the greeneyed blonde indeed i want her to take a message ashore if thats the word for me and bring me back an answer within a couple of hours i propose to code this message film it and give you the spool its about half the size of a cigarette and im sure you can easily conceal it in one of the many tubes and cartons you must carry about with you anyway no one questions a doctors integrity dont they now ohare spoke with some feeling theres no hurry ill have to wait till messrs milton quarry and hendrix have been escorted off the bridge by which time too i expect that the trusty mr hagenbach will have arrived from wherever he has been lurking hagenbach you mean this old twister you are referring to my respected employer now this is just an ambulance apart from your usual medical kit heart unit oxygen kit to stitch together the misguided who step out of line i dont suppose you carry anything much more sophisticated ohare shook his head so you dont have any radiological gear or clinical investigative equipment and most certainly not operational facilities even if you did have an anaesthetist which you havent i suggest then that when miss wednesday takes most painfully ill in about an hour or so you diagnose something that may demand or may not demanddoctors cant take chances immediate hospital diagnosis and possible surgery something like a grumbling appendix or suspected peritonitis or suchlike dont ask me i wouldnt ohare looked at revson with some disfavour you seem to be unaware that even the rawest intern no matter how damp behind the ears can diagnose appendicitis with his hands figuratively in his pockets i am aware but im damned if i could do it and im pretty certain that no one else on this bridge could do it either you have a point right but youll have to give me fifteen to twenty minutes noticebefore i call in branson or whoever the odd job or two to induce the proper symptoms no danger miss wednesday has just informed me that she is allergic to pain she wont feel a thing ohare said in his best dentists voice besides its for the homeland he looked at revson consideringly i believe you gentlemen of the press are handing your stuff over at the south barrier in two hours time couldnt it wait till then and get my answer back by carrier pigeon next week i want it this afternoon you are in a hurry during the war world war two that is winston churchill used to annotate all instructions to his military and governmental staff with just three scribbled words action this day i am a great admirer of sir winston he left the slightly bemused ohare and returned to april wednesday he told her that ohare had okayed his request and her first question was want i should bring back a miniaturized transceiver radio he gave her a kind look thoughtful but no electronic surveillance of all kinds can hardly be your province such a transceiver i have screwed into the base of my camera but that little revolving disc above the villains coach means only one thing they have an automatic radiowave scanner theyd pick me up in five seconds now listen carefully and ill tell you exactly what i want you to do and how i want you to behave when he had finished she said understand but i dont much care for the thought of the kindly healer there running amok with his hypodermic you wont feel a thing revson said soothingly besides its for the fatherland he left her and walked casually across to the press coach the imperial conference in the presidential coach was still in full plenary session and though the speech inside was wholly inaudible from where revson stood it was clear from the gestures and expressions of those inside that all they had succeeded in reaching so far was a marked degree of difference in opinion their problem revson reflected was hardly one susceptible to the ready formation of a consensus of opinion branson and chrysler were up front in the rear coach apparently dozing which they probably werent though it wouldnt have mattered very much if they were for alert guards were very much in evidence patrolling between the freshlypainted boundary lines on the bridge members of the various news media stood around in groups wearing an air of almost hushed anticipation as if expecting the next momentous occasion to happen along any second now which seemed as likely as not revson entered the press coach it was deserted he made his way to his own seat unshipped his camera produced a pad and felt pen and began quickly and without hesitation to write what was apparently pure gibberish there were those who were lost without their codebooks but revson was not one of them six hagenbach the chief of the fbi was a burly and formidable character in his middle sixties with shortcropped grey hair shortcropped grey moustache slightly hooded light blue eyes which never appeared to blink and a face possessed of a total nonexpression which it had taken him years of hard work to acquire it was said that among the upper echelons of his fbi there was a sweepstake as to the day and date when hagenbach would first be seen to smile the sweepstake had been running for five years hagenbach was a very able man and looked it he had no friends and he looked that too men with a consuming passion seldom do and hagenbach was a man with a consuming passion as was said of one of his illustrious predecessors he was alleged to have a file on every senator and congressman in washington not to mention the entire staff of the white house he could have made a fortune in blackmail but hagenbach was not interested in money nor was he interested in power as such hagenbachs total dedication lay in the extirpation of corruption whenever and wherever he might encounter it he looked at admiral newson and general carter the former plump and rubicund the latter tall and lean and looking disconcertingly like his superior general cartland both men he had known and well for almost twenty years and had not once called either by his first name that anyone should address hagenbach by his christian name was unthinkable it would also have been extremely difficult as no one seemed to know it he was the type of man who didnt need a first name hagenbach said so those are the only tentative proposals for action you have come up with so far the situation is unprecedented newson said carter and i are fundamentally men of direct action to date direct action seems out of the question lets hear your ideas ive only just arrived have you any immediate proposals for the moment yes await the arrival of the vicepresident the vicepresident is a nincompoop you know that i know that we all know that be that as it may hes the only man in the united states who can approve and authorize any course of action we may eventually decide to make also i think we had first better wait and consult mr milton mr quarry and chief hendrix when theyre released if theyre released hendrix is certain they will be and hendrix knows far more about branson than we do besides he has to negotiate with somebody he picked up the message that had arrived from revson via the new jersey how much reliance do you place on this hagenbach took the note and read it aloud please wait no precipitate action no violenceespecially no violence let me evaluate the situation cannot use transceiverthe bandits have an automatic radiowave scanner in constant use will communicate with you this afternoon hagenbach laid down the paper quite a bit actually carter said whats he like this revson of yours ruthless arrogant independent dislikes authority a loner who consults superior officers only under duress and even then goes his own way newson said that doesnt sound very encouraging whats a hothead like that doing along on a trip like this hes no hothead his mind is as near icecold as any mans can be i also forgot to say that hes highly intelligent very ingenious and extremely resourceful then hes a handpicked man newson said hagenbach nodded you handpicked him again the nod so hes the best in the business i cant say you know the size of our organization i cant possibly know all the field agents hes just the best i happen to know is he good enough to cope with branson i dont know because i dont know branson whats for sure for once revson is going to depend heavily on outside help there was a degree of satisfaction in hagenbachs voice carter said and how in hell is he going to communicate with us this afternoon i have no idea hagenbach nodded to revsons note he got that through didnt he there was a brief pause as the admiral and general respectfully contemplated the note would either of you gentlemen have thought of that they shook their heads me neither resourceful is what i said branson walked up and down the bridge between the rear and presidential coaches no nervous pacing no signs of strain or tension he could have been taking a pleasant saunter in the afternoon sun and indeed the afternoon was extremely pleasant the skies were cloudless the view all around came straight from the pages of a fairytale book and the waters of the golden gate and the bay sparkled in the warm sun having had his fill of the view branson consulted his watch strolled unhurriedly towards the presidential coach knocked on the door opened it and stepped inside he surveyed the occupants and the sound of voices stilled branson said pleasantly you have arrived at a decision gentlemen there was no reply am i to take it then that you have arrived at an impasse the president lowered the very large gin and martini with which he had been sustaining himself we require more time for our deliberations youve had all the time youre going to have you could sit here all day and get no further if all your minds werent so devious and at the same time so closed to the facts of life youd recognize this for the painfully simple issue it is pay up or else and dont forget the escalation penalty clause the president said i have a proposal to make lets hear it permit the king prince and sheikh kharan to go i shall remain as hostage the situation would remain the same you would still have the president of the united states for that matter i cant see why you dont let all the hostages in this coach go branson was admiring my heavens what a perfectly splendid gesture noble i should say why do that and the electorate would demand that they realter the constitution and let their hero run for another three terms instead of one he smiled and went on without a change in tone no way mr president apart from the fact that i shudder at the very thought of you being in the white house for the next thirteen years ive always dreamt of holding a hand of cards with four aces in it here ive got four one is not enough and has it ever occurred to you that if you were to be the only hostage left on the golden gate bridge the government in the person of your vicepresident who would just love to sit behind that table in the oval office might be sorely tempted to achieve some sort of immortality by wiping out this monstrous band of criminals who have kidnapped you and your arabian friends nothing drastic of course nobody who destroyed this bridge could ever hope to be president a single supersonic fighterbomber from alameda would do the job nicely and if one of his rockets went off course slightly well thats just bad luck an act of god and pilots error the president spilt a considerable amount of his gin and martini on the carpet branson looked at quarry milton and hendrix in turn said gentlemen and left the coach the three men followed the president carefully didnt watch them go he appeared to have found something of profound interest in the depths of what remained of his drink outside branson spoke to van effen get that tv van and crew back here again make sure the tv companies are notified van effen nodded it would be wrong of you to let the nation suffer this agonizing suspense where are you going to the south end with those three gentlemen as guaranteed escort for their safety cant they take the word of a gentleman not that i just want to inspect the progress being made on the barrier saves the walk thats all the four men climbed into the police car and drove off still alone in the press coach revson watched them go then returned his attention to the three small sheets of notepaper on his knees each was smaller than the average postcard and all three were covered with small neat and incomprehensible writing he focused his camera and photographed each three timesrevson always covered his bets he then took each paper in turn set fire to it and crushed the blackened remains in his ash tray it was a very curious paper for it gave off no smoke he then wound off the camera spool sealed it and wrapped it in a very thin lead foil as he had promised ohare the completed result was no larger than half a cigarette he reloaded his camera and went outside the atmosphere of suspense and excitement had markedly heightened he spoke to a nearby newspaperman understandably he knew none of them by name something new afoot bransons just sent for the television van again do you know why no idea nothing very important probably maybe hes always had a yen to appear on tv maybe hes just wanting to keep the pressure on the nation and the government and the arabian governments too for this time the big three companies will be geared for action the satellites will be ready and waiting and so will be all the persian gulf the executives of the big companies will be hard put to it to shed crocodile tears for the plight of their beloved president and at the same time refrain from jumping for joy the biggest show on earth and all for free whats the odds branson wont be putting on a late show about two in the morning revson shot about a dozen other pictures the chances of its being discovered that he had taken no pictures at all were remote in the extreme but then again revson always covered his bets he drifted casually across to where ohare was leaning against his ambulance and shook a cigarette from its pack light doctor sure ohare produced a lighter and lit it revson cupped the flame in his hands to shield it from the very slight breeze and as he did so he slid the spool into ohares palm thanks doc he looked idly around there was no one within earshot how long to hide one minute i have the place for it two minutes and youll have your patient ohare went into the ambulance while revson sauntered halfway across the bridge where april wednesday was prudently standing alone a circumstance normally very difficult for her to achieve she looked at him wet her lips and tried to smile at him it wasnt a very successful effort revson said whos that solid dependablelooking character standing by the engine of the ambulance grafton united press a nice man go and collapse gracefully against him discretion is of the essence we dont want any undue fuss but first let me get to the other side of the bridge i want to he at a safe distance when you re taken ill when revson reached the far side of the bridge he turned and looked hack april had already begun to head in the direction of the ambulance her gait seemed a little unsteady but not markedly so she may he scared he thoughtand she unquestionably was but she can act she was about fifteen feet distant from grafton when he first saw her or more precisely when she first attracted his attention he regarded her slightly wavering approach with curiosity a curiosity which quickly turned to concern he took two quick steps forward and caught her by the shoulders she leaned gratefully against him lips and eyes compressed as in pain april wednesday he said whats the matter girl ive a terrible pain it just hit me now her voice was husky and she was holding herself with both hands it it feels like a heart attack how would you know grafton said reasonably his tone reassuring and wherever your heart is its not on the righthand side of your tummy dont misinterpret me but some people have all the luck he took her firmly by the arm theres a doctor only five yards from here from the far side of the bridge revson watched them vanish round to the rear of the ambulance as far as he could reasonably tell he had been the only person to observe the brief byplay branson walked unhurriedly away from the halfcompleted southern barrier apparently well satisfied with the progress of the work in hand he reached the rear coach and swung up to sit beside chrysler any more sensational revelations no mr branson its all become a bit repetitive and boring you can have a playback or transcript if you like but its not worth it im sure its not tell me can i switch off mr branson theyre really not worth listening to they never were well same old story about the payment still arguing but theyre going to pay no question its whether to pay now or stall latest opinion poll has four for two undecided two against the king the prince and kharan are all for the money being handed over nowtreasury money of course mayor morrison is of the same mind thats understandable hed pay a billion dollars within the hour to ensure the safety of his beloved bridge cartland and muir have no preference either way the only difference being that general cartland is willing to fight us to the death the president and hansen are very much against immediate payment again understandable hansens never made a decision in his life and the president would stall for ever hoping for a miracle to happen hoping to save the nation the loss of a half billion for which rightly or wrongly he would probably be blamed hoping to save face and his presidential image let them stew in their own juice he turned as peters appeared in the doorway something wrong nothing that affects us sir seems dr ohare has some medical problem on his hands hed like to see you as soon as possible when branson entered the ambulance he found april lying on the hinged side bed a discreet six inches of her midriff showing her face chalkwhite branson did not much care for finding himself in the presence of sick people and this was obviously a sick person he looked enquiringly at ohare ohare said ive a very sick young lady on my hands here mr branson i want her removed to hospital immediately whats wrong look at her face it was indeed ashen an effect easily achieved by the application of an odourless talcum and at her eyes they were opaque with enormously dilated pupils the effect of the first of the two jabs that ohare had given her not that the eyes hadnt been big enough to begin with feel her pulse reluctantly branson lifted the slender wrist and dropped it almost immediately its racing he said and indeed it was ohare had probably been a little too thorough there the rate of the pulse when she had entered the ambulance had already been so high as to render the second injection unnecessary would you care to feel the distension on the righthand side of the abdomen no i would not branson was emphatic it could be a grumbling appendix it could be a threatened peritonitis the signs are there but i have no proper diagnostic equipment no xray facilities no way of carrying out abdominal surgery and of course no anaesthetist hospital and pretty damn quick no april had sat up in bed fear in her face no not hospital theyll cut me up i surgery ive never even been in a hospital in my life ohare put his hands on her shoulders firmly and not bothering to be gentle and pressed her back down again and if im not that sick if its only a tummyache or something mr branson wouldnt let me back the only scoop of my life and im scared ohare said its more than a tummyache lassie you can come back branson said but only if you do what the doctor and i say he nodded towards the door and stepped down what do you think really is the matter with her a doctor doesnt have to discuss a patient with a layman ohare was showing every symptom of losing his patience and i can tell you this branson make off with half a billion dollars and youll probably end up as some kind of folk hero its happened often before although not admittedly on this scale but let this girl die because you denied her access to medical care and youll become the most hated man in america theyll never stop till they get you to start with the cia will find you wherever you are in the world and they wont bother to bring you to trial branson showed no signs of losing his patience he said mildly you dont have to threaten me doctor shell get her medical care im just asking as a favour in confidence branson nodded you dont have to be a doctor to see that shes a pretty sick kid but there are more than one way of being sick is she threatened with appendicitis or peritonitis i dont think so shes an excitable intense highlystrung kid who lives on her nerves under pressure as of now those could produce an emotional trauma or psychosomatic disorders which are capable of causing the symptoms weve just seen its rare but it exists in medicine theres a condition called the malthusian syndrome where a person can actually will himself into producing faking if you want to call it that symptoms of a nonexistent disease not in this case if it is what t think it is its involuntary but you see my positioni cant take chances she may require intensive medical diagnosis or psychiatric evaluation the first i can do myself but i need hospital equipment the second i cant im not a psychiatrist either way i must get to hospital were wasting time i wont keep you long do you mind if we search your ambulance ohare stared at him what the hell for what do you think im carrying bodies narcotics well quite a lot really what do you think i would be taking off this bridge that i didnt bring on to it im a doctor not an fbi agent well forget it another question do you mind if we send a guard along for observation purposes send half a dozen theyll get damned little observation done whats that supposed to mean it means that harden hes chief of surgerycherishes his unit like a newborn baby he wouldnt give a damn about you and your bridge if any of your men tried to force their way into emergency reception of the emergency theatre hed have a dozen sharpshooters there in ten minutes im not joking ive seen him do it well forget that too its unimportant one thing that is important will you phone ask them to have the emergency operating theatre ready and dr huron standing by dr huron senior psychiatrist right branson smiled faintly do you know that a presidential route is always laid out so that its never more than a few minutes from the nearest hospital just in case convenient isnt it very ohare turned to the driver start the siren as the ambulance moved towards the south tower they were passed by a tv van and generator truck coming the other way immediately cameramen photographers and reporters began moving into what they assumed would be the same tv arena as before some cameramen were so overcome by the occasion that they began wasting film on the forthcoming truck as if this were an unprecedented spectacle in itself revson was not one of those who joined in the surge forward he moved in the opposite direction and regained his seat in the deserted press coach he undipped the base of his camera removed the miniaturized transceiver slipped it into a side pocket reached into his carrier bag and fed spare film into the base of his camera he was just reclipping the base of hiscamera when he became aware of being watched he looked up blue eyes under blond hair a head the approximate shape of a sugar cube and a vacuous smile revson believed in that vacuous smile the way he believed in santa claus branson would have settled for nothing less than ao exceptional man when picking his lieutenant revson isnt it yes van effen i believe yes why arent you out there with the others recording this historical moment for posterity first what is there to record yet second the big eye of tv can do a damned sight better job of posterityrecording than i can do third if youll excuse the hackneyed phrase what im after is the human interest angle fourthly i prefer to load in the shadow that looks a most exceptional camera it is revson permitted himself a small proprietary smile that almost bordered on a smirk handmade and assembled swedish a rare species the only camera in the world that can take colour stills black and white stills and is a cine camera at the same time may i have a look im a bit of a camera buff myself certainly the batterypowered airconditioning in the coach revson thought was falling down on the job van effen examined the camera with the eye of a connoisseur inadvertently as it seemed his hand touched the spring clip at the base a dozen cassettes and spools tumbled on to the seat beside revson i am sorry it would seem that im not all that much of a camera buff he inverted the camera and looked with admiration at the recessed base very very ingenious while revson sat acutely conscious of the slight bulge caused by the transceiver in his side pocket van effen meticulously replaced cassettes and spools in the base closed the flap and handed the camera back to revson excuse my curiosity well you went to the right finishing school anyway it always shows van effen gave him his vacuous smile and left revson did not mop his brow for it was a gesture alien to his nature had he been a browmopper he would have done so he wondered if van effen had noticed the two tiny spring clips in the base he probably had had he realized their significance equally probably not they could have been the retaining clips for any number of esoteric attachments revson turned in his seat the hostages were descending from their coach the president manfully substituting for his black scowl a calm resolute and statesmanlike expression even van effen revson saw had his eyes on them revson left the coach by the door opposite the drivers so that he was on the blind side of all the spectators and participants he leaned his elbows in brief contemplation on the outer rail then opened his right hand the one that held the transceiver he had read somewhere that it took a solid object accelerating at thirtytwo feet per second only three seconds to fall from the bridge to the golden gate and he gravely doubted whether the man responsible for those figures could count nobody had noticed anything amiss revson had covered his bets again he made his unhurried and silent entry into the coach again closed the door quietly behind him and emerged much less quietly from the opposite door van effen turned smiled vaguely then turned back his attention to the circus on hand as before branson had everything stagemanaged to perfection hostages and newsmen seated in their proper places cine and still cameramen strategically positioned although this time there was one minor but significant difference from the previous occasion this time branson had two tv cameras instead of one without further ado branson calm relaxed and as assured as ever reembarked upon his psychological warfare apart from being a born general and a born stage manager he could also have been a born anchorman on tv he divided his attention fairly evenly between the tv lens and those seated beside him after a wholly unnecessary introduction of himself the president the king and the prince his first reference not unsurprisingly was to cameras we have this afternoon two television cameras with us one for the illustrious company you are now viewing the other facing the other way towards the south or san franciscan shore the second one is a tracking camera with a telephoto zoom lens that up to half a mile can give the clarity of resolution that one would expect at the distance of ten feet as there is no trace of fog this afternoon it should be able to perform its function admirably its function is as follows branson lifted the canvas cover from a large rectangular box then microphone in hand went and sat in a specially reserved vacant chair by the president he gestured towards the object he had just unveiled a courtesy gesture towards our assembled guests a rather splendid colour tv set no better obtainable anywhere american of course the president had to make himself heard after all most of the socalled civilized eyes in the world were upon him he said with heavy sarcasm and a cold distaste ill wager you havent paid for your tv set branson thats hardly relevant the point is that i dont want to make you and your guests feel like secondclass and deprived citizens all the world will be able to see in close detail how we are going to attach the first of our explosive charges to one of the cables by the south tower and i feel it would be unjust to deprive you of the same privilege after all at a distance of over two thousand feet and an elevation of over five hundred feet it would be difficult for even the keenesteyed to appreciate the finer points of this operation but the box here will show you everything you want branson smiled or dont want now please direct your attention to the vehicle descending the ramp from the rear coach they so directed their attention what they saw could also b seen on the tv set before them the vehicle looked like a strippeddown miniaturized golfcart it was selfpropelled but silent clearly electrically powered the driver peters stood on a tiny platform at the rear immediately over the batteries on the flat steel platform before him was a large coil of very thin rope and at the very front a small doubledrummed winch at the foot of the ramp peters stopped the vehicle four men appeared from the rear of the coach the first two were carrying an obviously very heavy canvas strap of explosives similar to the one that branson had earlier demonstrated on tv this they deposited very carefully indeed on the vehicles platform beside the rope the other two men carried objects about eight feet in length one was a boathook the other an hsectioned steel beam with butterfly screw clamps at one end and a builtin pulley at the other the tools of our trade branson said you should be able to guess what theyre all for but in any event this will be explained to you when they are put to use two things are of particular interest the explosives and the rope that strap of explosives is ten feet long and contains thirty beehives of high explosive each five pounds in weight the rope which is a quarter of a mile long looks and is thinner than the average clothesline but as it is made of steelcored nylon has a breaking strain of eight hundred pounds which is exactly five times as much as will be required of it he gestured to peters who nodded eased open the circular control wheel and trundled off in the direction of the south tower branson looked directly at the tv lens he said for those of you who dont know and apart from the citizens of san francisco there will be many who will not know those towers are something less than solid structures on the tv set before him and on countless millions of sets throughout the world the south tower came into sharp close focus these towers consist of steel framework boxes called cells each is about the size of a phone booth but twice as high riveted together and connected by manholes each tower consists of over five thousand such cells they contain elevators and laddersa rather staggering twentythree miles of them he reached under his seat and brought up a manual as you will appreciate it would be very easy for the inexperienced to get lost inside this labyrinth once when they were building this bridge two men spent the entire night inside the north tower trying to find their way out and indeed joseph strauss the designer and builder of this bridge was capable of getting completely lost inside the tower it was with this in mind that strauss produced this twentysixpage manual well not this one this is a facsimile i was fortunate enough to come byinstructing inspectors how to find their way about inside the towers at this moment two of my men each with a copy of this manual although they hardly need them theyre using the elevator are at or nearing the top of the east tower there the one facing towards the bay they are carrying with them nothing except a fifteenpound weight the purpose of which you will shortly discover may we observe the progress of our electric truck please the telephoto tv camera obligingly descended and closed on peters travelling along the wrong side of the bridge even as they watched it slowed and came to a halt almost directly under the lowest of the four massive crossstruts of the south tower branson said elevation please again the telephoto camera focused on the saddlethe curved steel housing over which the cable passedon the bayside tower almost immediately two men came into sight by the saddle tiny figures for those directly observing from the middle of the bridge closeup for those looking at the tv screens on cue on time branson said with some satisfaction in those matters coordination is of the essence i dare say that not one in ten thousand of you would care to be where those two men are now quite frankly neither would i one misstep and its over seven hundred and fifty feet down to the golden gate only a sevensecond fall but at a hundred and seventy miles an hour hitting water is no different from hitting solid concrete but those two are as safe as you would be in a church pew spidermen theyre calledthe workers you can see standing on girders a thousand feet above the streets of new york or chicago when theyre building a new skyscraper the camera closed on peters again he produced a pistol unusual as to both length of barrel and width of muzzle took brief aim upwards and fired neither camera could track nor eye see the nature of the missile ejected what the camera did show four seconds after firing was that bartlett one of the men by the saddle had a green cord safely in his hands he reeled this in swiftly at the end of the cord was a leatherhung pulley which in turn was attached to one end of the rope two and a half minutes elapsed before the rope was in bartletts hands he held this securely while his partner boyard undid both cord and pulley bartlett reeled in about another dozen feet cut this section off with a knife and handed it to boyard who secured one end to a strut and another to the strap of the pulley the rope was then passed through the pulley through a hole at its top to a pearshaped lead weight which the men had brought up with them both weight and rope were then released and sank swiftly down to bridge level again peters caught the weight undid the knot that secured the rope but did not withdraw the rope instead he passed it through the pulley in the steel beam and a ring at the end of the boathook and secured all three together he took a few turns of the other end of the rope round one of the drums of the winch and started up the electric motor the winch though small was powerful and fast from bridge to saddle took less than a minute and a half there was a gentle breeze blowing from the north apparently freshening as the altitude increased and the rope and its burden swayed quite noticeably striking each of the crossstruts at times quite forcibly on the way up peters seemed unconcerned his gaze fixed on bartlett as the rope and its cargo neared the top bartlett made a horizontal waving motion of his arm peters eased the winch drum to a crawl bartlett made a slow upwards beckoning motion with his arm then stretched it out horizontally peters unwound the rope after stopping the winch leaving only one turn on the drum bartlett and boyard pulled in the beam and boathook detached them along with the lead weight passed the rope through the pulley and resecured the lead weight they then eased out the hbeam for a distance of about six feet then clamped the inner end to a strut tightening the butterfly nuts to their maximum bartlett signalled peters who took the last turn off the drum weight and rope sank rapidly downwards two minutes later the rope was on its way up again this time with the canvas strap of explosives which dangled at its full length fastened to the rope by two heavy metal buckles at one end of the strap unlike the previous occasion peters now moved with great caution the drum moving very slowly and occasionally stopping altogether general cartland commented on this to branson your winchman is trying to eliminate all sway yes we dont want that strap of explosives to bang against one of the crossstruts of course id forgotten how sensitive fulminate of mercury detonators are the detonators are in bartletts pocket but the primers can be temperamental too thats why we have that extended beam up topto give clearance also its asking a bit much for even two strong men to haul a hundred and sixty pounds not a hundredweight as you estimated generalover five hundred feet vertically upwards they watched the explosive safely negotiate the second top crossstrut cartland said so its one strap there one on the opposite cable and the other two at the north tower no weve changed our minds on that we suspect that the suspension cablesand dont forget that there are over twentyseven thousand spun wires inside that steel sheath may be considerably stronger than the mockup we used for the test so were going to use all four explosive straps at the south tower a pair on each cable that will leave no margin for doubt and if the south end of the bridge falls into the golden gate it seems reasonable to expect that the north end will follow suit whether the north towerdont forget it will then be bearing most of the weight of the fourthousandtwohundredfeet spanwill be pulled down too we havent been able to determine but it seems pretty close to a certainty van effen took two quick steps forwards and clicked off the safety catch on his machinepistol mayor morrison half out of his seat slowly subsided back into it but his fists were still tightly clenched his eyes still mad by now bartlett and boyard had the boathook round the rope and were steadily cautiously and without too much trouble overhanding the explosives in towards themselves soon it disappeared out of the range of the telephoto tv camera so immediately afterwards did all of bartlett except for head and shoulders inserting the detonators cartland asked branson nodded and cartland gestured to the section of the cable nearest them at that point in the centre of the bridge the cable dipped until it was almost within arms length why go to all that immense labour wouldnt it have been easier just to fix the charges here easier yes but theres no guarantee that severing the cables in midbridge would bring the bridge down theres no way of knowing whats for sure is that no one has ever carried out a control test or experiment on this sort of thing suspension bridges come expensive if the cables were severed here the towers as far as weight is concerned would still be in a fair state of equilibrium bridge might sag a little or a lot it might break but it wouldnt drop the whole span clear into the water my way success is guaranteed you wouldnt expect me to charge two hundred million for a botchedup job would you general cartland didnt say whether he would or he wouldnt besides if things go wrong that is if you turn out to be stingy with the money i intend to trigger off the explosives immediately we take off i dont want to be within half a mile of six hundred pounds of high explosives when it goes up the president said carefully you mean the triggering device is aboard one of those helicopters branson gave a patient sigh ive always maintained that all presidential candidates should undergo an iq test of course it is in the nearest one what did you expect me to do press a button inside a coach and then go down with the coach and bridge to the bottom of the golden gate branson removed his disbelieving gaze from the president and returned it to the tv screen before him bartlett with boyard steadying him had the canvas strip wrapped round the cable hard up against the saddle and was buckling tight the second of the two straps that held the strap securely in position that done he moved back along with boyard to admire their handiwork the camera then left them and zeroed in on the section of cable wrapped in the lethal embrace of the high explosive branson smiled broadly well now isnt that a perfectly splendid sight cartland remained pokerfaced it all depends upon your point of view seven vicepresident richards switched off the tv set he looked thoughtful shocked and concerned all at one and the same time when he spoke those emotions were reflected in his voice that was a remarkably effective performance one has to confess that our villainous friend appears to know exactly what he is about and has the total ability to carry out his numerous threats at least that is how i see it but im just a newcomer to the scene do you gentlemen see it any differently the vicepresident was a tall genial loquacious southerner much given to slappingone could not call it clapping the unwary rather painfully on the back and was an internationallyknown gourmet a fact amply testified to by his ample figure he was far from being the nincompoop hagenbach had alleged hagenbachs opinion stemmed from the fact that theirs were two totally differing personalities he was forceful shrewd intelligent and was remarkably well informed on a very wide range of topics if he had one fault it was that he had unlike hagenbach a consuming desire for power branson had hardly been exaggerating when he had suggested that a yearning look came into richardss eyes whenever he entered the oval office in the white house richards looked without much hope around the company assembled in the office of the hospital supervisor hagenbach hendrix and the two secretaries sat around a small table newson and carter as if to demonstrate the exclusivity of the highest echelons of the military sat at a second and smaller table ohare arms folded and leaning against a radiator wore the wry slightly amused slightly condescending expression that most doctors reserve for all those who are not also doctors april wednesday sat quietly and alone in a corner chair from the silence that followed it was clear that none of the gentlemen present saw it any differently richardss geniality yielded to a certain amount of testiness you hagenbach what do you propose to do hagenbach restrained himself even though he was the head of the fbi he had to pay his due respect albeit lipservice respect to the vicepresident i suggest we await the transcription of revsons message sir transcription transcription i was it necessary for this man of yours to complicate things by sending in code on the face of it no revson has a nearmania for secrecy that must be admitted and is extraordinarily securityconscious the same might be said about myself agreed the message came through with safety and ease on the other hand as miss wednesday here has testified branson did contemplate searching the ambulance with the proverbial toothcomb he might have come up with something but not with this microfilm he looked up as a young man dressed in the immaculate conservative grey of a wall street broker came through the doorway and banded him two typed sheets of paper sorry it took so long sir it was a bit difficult so is revson hagenbach read quickly through the papers totally oblivious of the impatience of the others he looked up at the young man you like and you value your position in our organization jacobs you dont have to say that sir hagenbach tried to smile but as ever failed to crack the ice barrier i apologize it was a measure of hagenbachs concern over the matter in hand that he had never previously been heard to say sorry to anyone you dont have to say that either sir jacobs left the room hagenbach said this is what revson says to give you the maximum time to obtain what i require for my immediate needs i will state those first of all admiral newson coughed do your subordinates usually address you in such a peremptory tone not usually he goes on i want four hundred yards of blue or green thin cord cylindrical waterfront containers for written messages and a variably hooded morseflashlight then i would like an aerosol two pensone white one redand a cap air pistol please order those immediately without them i cannot hope to operate general carter said goobledgook what are those terms supposed to mean hagenbach said i am not sure if i should tell you that does not refer to you personally general senior officers cabinet ministers and of course senior police officers are entitled to be privy to such information but there areahcivilians present ohare said mildly doctors dont talk whats more they dont leak secret information to the press either hagenbach favoured him with a very oldfashioned look then said to april and you miss wednesday she said id talk my head off if you as much as showed me a pair of thumb screws you wouldnt have to put them on showing would be quite enough otherwise no hagenbach said to hendrix hows branson with thumbscrews and young ladies no way master criminal though he is he has a remarkable reputation for gallantry towards women he has never carried out a robbery where a woman might be involved far less hurt but mr revson told me i rather fancy hagenbach said that revson wanted you to act scared so he threw a scare into you april wednesday was indignant has he no scruples in private life a model of integrity on businesswell if he has scruples he has so far hidden the fact very well as to those objects he asked for the aerosol contains exactly the same knockout nerve gas that branson used with such effect on the bridge no permanent damage whatsoever the presence of miss wednesday testifies to that the pens they look like ordinary felt pensfire tiny tipped needles that also knock out people admiral newson said why two colours the red knocks you out a bit more permanently one assumes that a bit more permanently means permanently could happen the air pistol well it has the advantage of almost complete silence and the cap bit hagenbachs hesitation betrayed a degree of reluctance it means the bullets are tipped tipped with what hagenbachs reluctance turned into something close to embarrassment cyanide after a brief and understandable silence richards said heavily this revson of yours is he a direct descendant of attila the hun he is an extremely effective operative sir loaded down with a lethal armoury like that i dont for a moment doubt it he has killed so have thousands of police officers and whats his score to date i really couldnt say sir in his reports revson lists only the essentials only the essentials richardss echo had a hollow ring to it he shook his head and said no more if you will excuse me for a moment hagenbach wrote quickly on a notepad opened the door and handed the note to a man outside have those items here within the hour he returned and picked up the transcript again to continue in what little time ive had ive tried to make an assessment of bransons character in original concept planning organization and execution the man is quite brilliant he would have made an excellent general for his appreciation of both strategy and tactics is masterly but nobody can be that good he has his failings which i hope can be used to bring him down he has a divine belief in his own infallibility this belief carries with it the seeds of his own destruction no one is infallible second he is possessed of a colossal vanity he could just as easily have held those tv interviews ive only seen one of bransons love affairs with the public but there are bound to be moreat say the south tower but no he had to have it smack in the middle surrounded by his own private press corps in his place i would have had the whole press corps off the bridge in five minutes it seems it just has not occurred to him that the ranks of the press corps may have been infiltrated third he should have searched the doctor and miss wednesday and then the ambulance if necessary throwing every single item of medical equipment into the golden gate before allowing it to leave the bridge in other words he is not securityconscious enough how to deal with them i have no idea yet i would like some guidance i have suggestions but i dont think any of them is practical no one can cope with seventeen heavily armed men but of those seventeen only two matter some of the other fifteen are bright but only branson and van effen are natural leaders those two i could kill kill april wednesdays shocked green eyes stared out of her pale face the mans a monster hagenbach was dry at least hes a realistic monster he read on its feasible but unwise the others would then almost certainly overreact and i wouldnt care to be responsible for the health of the president and his friends this is a second last resort would it be possible to have a submarine standing by under the bridge during the hours of darkness with only the top of the conning tower showing i could certainly pass messages and pick up anything i wanted that way what else i dont know i cant for instance visualize the president descending two hundred feet of rope ladder hed fall off after ten feet when bransons men are fixing the charges would it be possible to send a two thousand volt jolt through the cables i know this would electrify the entire bridge but those standing on the roadway or inside the coaches should be safe enough richards said why two thousand volts hagenbach sounded almost apologetic electric chair voltage i owe an apology to the shade of attila yes one drawback to this is that someone say the president might be leaning his elbows on the side of the bridge or sitting on a crash barrier that would mean a new presidential election i need expert advice or could we aim a laser beam at the charges when in position the beam would certainly cut through the canvas if the charge were to fall on to the bridge it would certainly detonate on impact but as most of the explosive force would be dissipated in thin air damage to the roadway would not be severe it is sure that it wouldnt bring the bridge down trouble is the laser beam might detonate the charge instead please advise under suitable cover would it be possible to introduce men into the tower natural fog would be fine phoney oil fire depending on the direction of the wind i dont know but the thing is to get men to the top return the lift and then cut off the power to the elevators any person who gets to the top after five hundred odd feet of ladders isnt going to be in much shape to do anything is it possible to introduce some form of knockout drugs in the food something that would lay them out for half an hour maybe an hour and not too fastacting if anyone were to keel over with the first bite you can imagine bransons reaction the individual food trays would have to be marked so that seventeen of them would go to the seventeen for whom they were intended hagenbach looked at ohare there are such drugs im sure of it the concoction of mickey finns is not my speciality but or isaacshes the chief of the drugs and narcotic section knows as much about those brews as anyone in the country catherine de medici could never have coped with him thats useful hagenbach returned his attention to the final brief section of the transcript please let me have your suggestions all i myself can really do at the moment is to try to deactivate the radio trigger that sets off the charges without leaving any signs that it has been tampered with that in itself should be simple its getting at the damned thing thats difficult it has of course to be in one of the helicopters and those are bathed in light both night and day and are heavily guarded ill try thats all newson said you mentioned a second last resort whats the last resort your guess is as good as mine if he has a last resort hes keeping it to himself now sooner than pass those notes around ill have them xeroxed minutes only and youll each have a copy he left the room approached jacobs the man who had handed him the typescript and said quietly have this xeroxed ten copies he pointed to the last paragraph blank this off and for gods sake make sure that this original gets back to me and not anyone else jacobs was back in the promised few moments he distributed six and handed the remaining copies and the original to hagenbach who folded the original and stuck it in an inside pocket then all seven carefully studied the report and again and again general carter said almost complainingly revson certainly doesnt leave me very much for my imagination to work on candidly he doesnt leave anything maybe its just not one of my days then its not one of mine either newson said your man seems to have covered the ground pretty comprehensively hagenbach sounds like a very useful man to have oh our side he is but even revson requires room to manoeuvre he has none quarry said tentatively i know this is not my field but it occurs to me that the key lies in the helicopters we have the means to destroy those carter said thats no problem planes guns rockets wireguided antitank missiles why thats the only way branson and his men can leave and as long as he remains on the bridge he cant detonate his charges so what happens then carter looked at the secretary of the treasury without admiration i can think of three things first branson would call for a mobile crane have it dump the choppers into the golden gate and demand two replacements within the hour or hed send us a neat little parcel containing the presidents ears second whether its a shell rocket or missile its impossible to localize or contain the blast effect and some innocent bystanders might end up in the same condition as the choppers third has it occurred to you that though the blast might well destroy the radioactivating device for the explosive charge it might equally well trigger it off even with only one end of one cable gone that bridge is going to sag and assume a crazy angle in nothing flat and nothing that is not nailed down would have a hope of remaining on that bridge if that were to happen mr secretary and the president and his guests knew you were the man responsible i dont think that their last thoughts of you as they sat there in their coach at the bottom of the golden gate would be very charitable ones quarry sighed id better stick to counting my pennies i told you this wasnt my field richards said i suggest we all have twenty minutes silent meditation and see what we come up with they did just that and when the twenty minutes were up hagenbach said well all apparently was not well the silence was profound in that case i suggest we start considering which are the less awful of revsons options the return of the ambulance to the centre of the bridge at about six oclock in the evening was greeted with warmth and interest even being in the spotlight of the eyes of the world loses its dramatic effect if one has nothing to do bransons tv broadcasts apart the middle of the bridge offered little in the way of entertainment when april palefaced and still apparently shaken stepped from the ambulance branson was the first to greet her how do you feel i feel such a fool she rolled up a sleeve to exhibit the punctures ohare had inflicted upon her earlier in the day two little pricks and im as right as rain she walked away and sat down rather heavily on one of the many chairs scattered around her her colleagues gathered round branson said to ohare she doesnt look as right as rain to me if you mean shes still not back to normal i agree same appearance different causes last time you saw her she was on a high now its a low my guess was right it seemsjust an emotional trauma shes been sound asleep for the past two hours under heavy sedation dopey thats all dr huron the psychiatrist didnt want her to return but she made such a damned noise about not getting back and this being her last chance or whatever that he decided that it might be better for her to return no worry ive brought back enough of the same sedative to last us for a week out here for the sake of all of us lets hope you wont need a quarter of it revson waited until the last of aprils welcomers had left her for the tv a show of peculiar interest to all as the programme was devoted exclusively to a rerun of bransons early afternoon broadcast nobody revson was unsurprised to observe was more interested than branson himself but then branson had no more to occupy his time than anyone else the only person who seemed remotely active was chrysler who visited the rear coach at regular intervals he wondered why revson sat beside the girl she looked at him coldly he said whats the matter with you she remained silent dont tell me somebodys been turning you against me yes you i dont like killers especially i dont like killers who plan their next murders coldbloodedly in advance come come thats putting it a bit strongly is it cyanide guns lethal pens shot through the back i should imagine my my we are bitter three things first those weapons are used only in acute emergency and then only to save lives to stop bad people killing good people although perhaps you would rather have it the other way round second it doesnt matter to a dead man where he has been shot third you have been eavesdropping i was invited to listen people make mistakes clearly they invited the wrong person i could be flippant and say i owe a duty to the taxpayer but im not in the mood april looked at the hard face listened to the voice from which all trace of the normal bantering warmth had vanished and realized with apprehension that indeed he was not in the mood i have a job to do you dont know what youre talking about so well dispense with your moral strictures i assume you brought the equipment i asked for where is it i dont know dr ohare does for some reason he didnt want me to know in case we were questioned and the ambulance searched for some reason for an obvious and excellent reason ohare is no fool a flush touched the pale cheeks but he ignored it all of it so i believe she tried to speak stiffly never mind your wounded pride and dont forget youre in this up to your lovely neck hagenbach have any instructions for me yes but he didnt tell me he told dr ohare her voice was acid or bitter or both i suppose that makes mr hagenbach no fool either dont take those things so much to heart he patted her hand and smiled warmly youve done an excellent job thank you she tried a tentative smile maybe you are a little bit human after all mr revson paul one never knows he smiled again rose and left at least he thought he was semihuman enough not to inflict further damage upon her amour propre by telling her that the last little bit of byplay had been purely for the benefit of branson who had momentarily lost interest in the screenhe was not then on cameraand was casting a speculative look at them not that that necessarily meant anything suspicious or sinister branson was much given to casting speculative looks at everybody april was beautiful and he may well have thought that she was wasting this beauty on the wrong company revson sat on a seat not far from branson and watched the last twenty minutes of the broadcast the intercutting between the presidential group and the top of the south tower had been most skilfully done and the overall impact was all that branson could ever have wished branson watched it intently his face betrayed no particular sign of satisfaction but then bransons face registered precisely what he wanted it to and was no mirror of his inner thoughts and feelings when the broadcast finished branson rose and stopped briefly by revsons chair revson isnt it revson nodded and how does all this strike you just the same as it strikes a million other people i guess this was it revson thought this is one part of his achilles heel branson knew he was a genius but he had no objection to people saying so a feeling of total unreality this just cant be happening but it is isnt it a very satisfactory beginning dont you think i can quote certainly call it an exclusive if you want how do you see the scenario developing just as you have programmed it i cant see anything to stop you you have them most unfortunately at your total mercy most unfortunately what else i dont want to overdo the american citizen bit and although you may be a master criminal a genius in your own immoral fashion to me youre still a crook a crook so bent as to make a spiral staircase look like a firemans ladder i rather like that i may quote you in turn branson seemed genuinely gratified one could hardly have called him thinskinned theres no verbal copyright alas universal disapproval not to say disapprobation would seem to be my lot branson didnt sound too unhappy about it thats a most unusual camera you have there almost but not quite unique may i have a look at it if you wish but if you want to examine it for the reasons i imagine you want to examine it then youre about four hours too late what is that supposed to mean it means that your very able lieutenant van effen has the same nasty suspicious mind as you have he has already taken my camera apart no radios no offensive weapons look for yourself that wont be necessary now a question i dont want to inflate your already superexpanded ego dont you think you might be taking chances revson no you have the reputation of being a nonviolent criminal revson waved his arm why all this you could have made a fortune in any business you cared to enter branson sighed i tried it business is so dull dont you think this at least gives me the opportunity to exercise most of my capacities he paused youre a bit odd yourself a cameraman you dont look act or speak like one hows a cameraman supposed to look act and speak you look in the mirror when you shave do you see a criminal i see a wall street vicepresident touche whats your paper or magazine freelance but im accredited to the london times but youre american news has no boundaries not any longer i prefer to work the foreign beat where the action is revson smiled faintly at least until today that used to mean southeast asia not any more europe and the middle east so what are you doing here pure happenstance just passing through you might say from new york to a special assignment in china when are you due to leave for there tomorrow tomorrow youll want to get off the bridge tonight as ive said members of the media are free to leave whenever they choose you branson must be out of your mind china can wait china can wait unless of course youre planning to kidnap chairman mao branson smiled the smile that never touched his eyes and walked away revson camera poised stood outside the open front right door of the rear coach he said do you mind chrysler turned round he looked at revson in some surprise then smiled why me for this honour because my camera is tired of taking photographs of branson and the assorted bigwigs mind im now compiling a rogues gallery of bransons henchmen revson smiled to remove offence youre chrysler arent you the telecommunications expert if thats what they call me yes revson took two or three shots thanked chrysler and moved away for good measure and local colour he took some more pictures of bransons men they all seemed to have been infected by bransons massive selfconfidence an cheerfully in some cases almost eagerly acceded to revsons requests after the last of those shots he crossed to the west side of the bridge sat on the crash barrier and lit a ruminative cigarette after a few minutes ohare hands thrust deep in his white coat came strolling by hundreds of pictures and thousands of words of reports had already been dispatched by the south tower and there were at least twenty of the media men and womenwho now had nothing better to do who were strolling aimlessly up and down the centre of the bridge revson took a couple of routine shots of ohare who came and sat beside him he said i saw you talking to miss wednesday suffering from a degree of pique is she our april could be happier you have it all both weapons and instructions everything i asked for is camouflaged i would say so the two pens are clipped to my medical clipboard there for anyone to see we doctors are models of efficiency the gun with the tipped bullets is in the cardiac arrest unit this is waxsealed and the seal has to be broken before the unit can be opened the unit is sealed not that it would matter very much if it were opened the gun lies in a false bottom and you have to know how to open it i mean it cant be done by accident you have to know i know you seem to be positively enjoying yourself doctor well yes it makes a change from treating ingrowing toenails i hope youll enjoy coming under the heading of classified for the rest of your life how come you carry those peculiar units in your hospital we dont but your director appears to be on very close terms with his counterpart in the cia i tell you we were completely taken over by experts that means youre double classified for life my cord and containers ohare seemed a mile away my cord and containers ohare returned to the world modesty compels me to admit that i came up with this one four containers empty lab samples printed on the outside whos going to question that the cord is wrapped round a square wooden framework with two hooks and two lures attached to one end youre going fishing over the side of the bridge im going fishing it can get quite boring out here you know something tells me its not going to be that way long i suppose its unnecessary to ask you about the nerve gas ohare smiled broadly id rather you did actually must you speak english english i told you london educated its an aerosol can clamped just above my notedesk anyone can see it product ostensibly of a nationallyknown aerosol company people called prestige fragrance of new york rather charming really the colour i mean forest brown i believe a scaleddown version of their sevenounce can freon pressure three times normal effective range ten feet do the prestige people know about this heavens no the cia are not overly concerned with patent rights ohare smiled almost dreamily on the back of the can it says fragrant and piquant and keep away from children on the front it says sandalwood cant you just see branson or any of his minions who dont know what sandalwood smells like giving themselves an exploratory whiff no i cant ill pick up the pens later tonight now what were hagenbachs instructions hagenbach and company a committee meeting and an agreed decision the vicepresident was there along with admiral newson general carter hendrix quarry and milton and yourself and april wednesday we plebs know our place total silence on our part first off theres no possibility of electrifying the bridge nothing to do with the possibility of a president or king sitting where we are now and having their pants roasted the voltage could be produced but not the wattage not for umpteen thousand tons of steel besides the potential victims would have to be earthed a bird can perch in perfect safety on a hightension wire second piece of expert advice was about laser beams you wondered if they would slice through the canvas wrapping of the explosive belts certainly say the boys in berkeley but the tremendous heat generated when a laser beam strikes a solid object would turn the bridge wirei think thats what they called it in the detonator whitehot immediately poof as you so rightly observe poof four things they did agree on however a submarine they can provide apparently it will call for some critical underwater navigation to get there and a fair bit of fancy juggling to keep the boat in position once it gets there apart from the tides there are lots of very nasty currents in the golden gate but the admiral reckons he has just the man for the job and in the absence of any instructions to the contrary they propose to park this boat under the front coach your press coach that is my omission theyre right of course revson glanced idly round but no one was paying any undue attention to them except general cartland a physical fitness fanatic who was countermarching briskly to and fro along the central section of the bridge he gave them a keen glance in passing but that signified nothing general cartland invariably gave everyone a keen glance in passing hansen the energy czar with the excess nervous energy to burn was also engaged in the same exercise but his attention was devoted exclusively to the toes of his shoes he did not walk with cartland there was no antipathy betweenthe two men they simply had nothing in common ohare continued they agreed with your suggestion that the south tower be occupied as you didnt specify whether it was the east or west section which should be occupied theyre a bit in the dark the meteorological forecast is rather good heavy fog is expected before dawn and to remain until about ten in the morning theyd better be right the wind tomorrow will be westerly so that any cover from the smoke of burning oil will be out of the question but they still dont know which section of the tower to occupy one item i forgot to ask you about it was about this hooded flashlight with the variable shutter that i have it if branson and company come across it medical requisite my dear fellow eye examination dilation of pupils and so forth you know morse revson was patient i just want to read books at night in the coach sorry one of my offmoments from the east side of the bridge aim approximately fortyfive degrees right theyll have two men on watch in relays all night they cant signal you back of course so for message acknowledged and understood theyll send up a firework rocket from chinatown followed by lots of others so as not to arouse any suspicions the setting off of fireworks bangers crackers or whatever you call them is illegal in this city but in chinatown the police bend a tolerant and indulgent eye towards it chinese national pastime you know you should see the chinese new year shortly after i arrivedjust a few months ago revson was even more patient i am a san franciscan ah well but you still dont know which section ot the south tower ill find out you seem very sure of yourself not at all but im sure of our april wednesday branson has given her more than a passing glance i shall have her employ her feminine wiles to discover which cable is next for the explosive treatment and when youre still very sure of yourself now your suggestion about drugged food unanimous approval this evening meal dr isaacshes our narcotics wizard in the hospitalhas been busy stirring up his witchs cauldron seventeen unpleasant surprises very quick work revson was uneasy how are the surprises to be identified no problem the usual airline plastic food in the usual airline plastic trays those trays have carrying lugs the bad trays if i may put it that way will have indentations on the underside of the lugs tiny but enough to be detected by normally sensitive fingertips well doctor you havent been wasting your time that i have to say obviously well have to be very careful if anything can go wrong it will go wrongone of parkinsons laws or something like that i shall appoint myself head waiterwith bransons prior approval second you will have april wednesday in for a routine check as the meal wagon arrives and will remain there until the meals have been distributed in the ambulance i mean why parkinsons law if something goes wrong you two would be the first under suspicion youve left the bridge and returned third i can get word to the presidential coach how ill figure a way and the press coach no guarantee im no mastermind if one or two of them get the wrong trayswell i can take care of the one or two villains who get the right trays ohare looked at revson with a certain lack of admiration you dont care how you use people do you i have things to do and i do what i can i weigh the odds but i dont know what the odds are revson paused tin fighting in the dark im a blind man if you like and my hands are tied behind me perhaps youd care to think again about your last remark ohare thought i apologize your pens and the flashlight will be waiting whenever you care to step by and one last thing they approve your intention to neutralize the triggering device i appreciate that you dont have any magic potion that will make me invisible alas no ohare turned and walked away revson lit and smoked another cigarette tossed the butt over the side rose and sauntered across to the rows of chairs april was still sitting where he had left her he took the seat beside her he said when the evening meal wagon comes i want you to go to the ambulance for a checkup she didnt look at him yes sir whatever you say sir revson breathed deeply i shall try to conceal my slow burn what the victorians would call my mounting exasperation i thought we had parted friends i dont much care for being a mindless puppet were all puppets i too do what im told i dont always like it but i have a job to do please dont make my job more difficult than it already is the doctor will tell you why youre there hell also tell you when to leave yes mr revson as a forcibly coopted member of your secret service i do what im told revson decided against any more deep breathing before that id like you to have a word with our mr branson i fancy he has one if not two of his cold codfish eyes upon you she turned her head slowly and gave him the full treatment of her luminous green eyes and you of course dont revson held her gaze for some seconds then considered the tarmac of the golden gate bridge i try to look the other way besides my eyes are not those of a cod find out from him on which cable he intends to affix his next explosive charge and when wait a few moments after ive left and then make a casual encounter he looked at her again the eyes were bigger and greener than ever and held an almost mischievous glint she was smiling it wasnt much of a smile but it was there she said youll end up by making me as devious and cunning as yourself heaven forbid revson rose and made his way back to his previous seat on the crash barrier which was less than twenty yards from the demarcation painted line where a man in the middle of the bridge with a schmeisser machinepistol kept constant vigil general cartland military stride in excelsis was approaching revson stood lifted his camera and snapped off three quick shots he said may i have a word with you sir cartland stopped you may not no interview exclusive or otherwise i may be a spectator in this damned circus but im no performer he walked on revson was deliberately brusque youd better speak to me general cartland stopped again his glacial stare drilled through revsons eyes into the wide blue yonder what did you say each word was spaced out slowly and carefully revson was on the parade ground a court martialed officer about to be stripped of insignia and buttons and have his sword broken over a knee dont ignore me sir deference now replaced brusqueness hageabach wouldnt like it hagenbach cartland and hagenbach men possessed of almost identical casts of mind were as intimate as two loners could ever be whats hagenbach to you i suggest you come and sit beside me general please relax and act casual it was entirely alien to cartlands nature to relax and act casual but he did his best he sat and said i repeat whats hagenbach to you mr hagenbach is very important to me he pays my salary when he remembers cartland looked at him for a long moment then as if to demonstrate that he was not totally like hagenbach he smiled his smile was nowhere near as frosty as his face well well a friend in need is a friend indeed your name paul revson revson revson james has talked to me about you and not only once sir you must be the only person in the united states who knows his first name cartland nodded his agreement there arent many around you know he has you slated for the hot seat in five years time i should live that long well well cartland seemed to be very fond of well well a very neat job of infiltration if i may say so the chiefs idea not mine revson stood up and snapped off some more photographs he said apologetically local colour you will please not tell any of your colleagues on the presidential coach colleagues clowns you will please not tell any of the clowns that you have met me i retract my remark the president is a personal friend that is known sir the president and the clowns i would not include the mayor among the latter if you want to talk to them privately take a walk your coach is bugged if you say so revson i know so sir theres a tape recorder whirling away busily in the rear coach you heard it i didnt i heard it ive never heard of you general cartland you should join our organization you think i retract in turn a chief of staff can go nowhere except down cartland smiled again to mint a new phrase tell me all revson stood walked away some paces took more pictures returned sat down and told all when he had finished general cartland said what do you want me to do i dont want one does not give instructions to the chief of staff the chief of staff became the chief of staff the point revson take your sedentary friends for a walk tell them about the coach being bugged tell them how to identify their own safe food trays no problem that all one last thing general cartland im a bit hesitant about this but as you would say to the point it is known at least i know that you habitually carry a gun past tense i have been relieved of it you still have your holster i have ill give you a replacement that will fit very snugly into your you do your homework revson it will be a pleasure the bullets are cyanidetipped sir cartland didnt hesitate still a pleasure eight the evening meal wagon arrived at seventhirty the occupants of the presidential coach were close to the north painted barrier huddled in what appeared to be deep conversation april wednesday under the watchful eye of a guard made her quiet way towards the ambulance revson sat apparently halfdozing in a chair he started as a hand touched his shoulder food my chinabound friend branson with his smile revson sat upright wine one trusts the best vintages that money can buy whose money irrelevancies bore me branson was regarding him with an appraising eye revson stood and looked around him your honoured guests along there they are being informed you might have at least given them time to have their predinner cocktail well not the presidents arab friends time for that the food is in hot cupboards branson did some more appraisal you know revson you interest me you might even say you intrigue me theres a certain what shall i call it intransigence about you i still dont see you as a man behind a camera and i dont see you as the man behind the most massive holdup of all time too late for you to go back to wall street branson clapped revson on the shoulder on behalf of the president lets go and sample some of the superior vintages explain yourself who knows what our medical friends in the presidio might be up to i hadnt thought of that you trust nobody no me a guineapig yes you and cartland make me uneasy a weakness you should never confess to them lead on macduff arrived at the meal wagon branson said to the white and blue striped attendant your name the attendant gave an odd sort of sketchy salute tony mr branson what wines do you have three reds three white mr branson array them before us tony mr revson here is an internationallyknown sommelier a judge of wine in other words sir six bottles and six glasses appeared on the counter revson said just a quarter in each glass i dont want to fall off the bridge during the night have you bread and salt yes mr revson tony clearly regarded himself as being in the presence of lunatics interspersed with the bread and salt revson sampled all six vintages at the end he said all uniformly excellent i must tell the french vintners about this the best californian matches up with the best french branson said it would appear that i owe you an apology revson no way lets do it again or will you join me in one of the ah approved wines it would seem safe to do so tony clearly considered himself in the presence of a couple of head cases i suggest one of your own a camay beaujolais from your almaden vineyards ah branson ponderedtony mr revson has excellent taste sir they consumed their wines in a leisurely fashion branson said i agree with both of your assessments you are ready to serve dinner tony yes sir he smiled i have already served one about twenty minutes ago id say mr hansen he snatched a plate and said that as the energy czar he needed energy it figures branson turned a lazy head in the coach i presume no sir he took his tray across to the east crash barrier there he followed his pointing finger then softly said jesus jesus what look they looked hansen slowly toppling off the barrier fell to the roadway and lay there his body jerking branson and revson crossed the six road lanes and reached him in as many seconds hansen was vomiting violently they spoke to him but he seemed incapable of answering his body went into strange and frightening convulsions revson said stay here ill get ohare ohare and april were together in the ambulance when he arrived understandably enough he was welcomed with lifted eyebrows revson said quickly i think that mr hansenhungry it seemspicked up the wrong dinner tray he looks in pretty bad shape to me ohare was on his feet revson barred his way i think your dr isaacs has stirred up a more powerful brew than he imagined if this is the effect it haswell i want you to go across there and diagnose some form of food poisoning call in some chemical analyst or whatever you call them nobody but nobody must touch that food again i dont want wholesale murder on my hands i understand ohare picked up his emergency bag and left at speed april said whats gone wrong paul i dont know some foulup maybe im to blame stay here when he arrived across the bridge branson was standing upright and ohare slowly straightening revson looked at them both then addressed himself to ohare well ohare let go the limp wrist he was holding im afraid that mr hansen is dead dead for once branson was clearly shocked how can he be dead please for the moment im in charge this plastic centre plate is almost empty i assume that hansen ate it all ohare bent over the dead man and breathed deeply his nose wrinkled very slowly he straightened again cant be salmonella that takes time not even botulinus its quick but not this quick ohare looked at branson i want to talk to the hospital i dont understand perhaps youd like to talk to me first ohare sounded weary i suppose the smellit comes from the pancreasis unmistakable some form of food poisoning i dont know doctors have their specialities and this is not one of mine the hospital please you dont mind if i listen in listen in all you want ohare was on the phone in the rear end of the presidential coach branson held the presidents sidephone revson sat in the next deeply upholstered chair ohare said how long will it take you to contact hansens private physician were in contact now ill wait they all waited they all looked at one another while carefully not looking at one another the phone became activated again ohare sir hansen iswas just recovering from his secondand almost fatal heart attack thank you sir that explains everything not quite branson was his old balanced self again i want two analytical chemists out here to determine the source of this infection if thats what you would call it the food tray i mean separate examinations if they disagree one of them is going to go over the side ohare sounded even more weary such specialists we have in san francisco i know two of the top people the only thing they have in common is their total disagreement with each other in which case they will both be thrown over the side you will accompany them make contact now ohare made contact revson said to branson only an american would have this gift for making friends and influencing people ill talk to you later ohare theyll come only if you promise immunity damn it all and to hell branson why should their lives be put at risk branson considered their lives will not be put at risk leave that phone i want it he made a signal through the window after a few seconds van effen entered he was carrying his schmeisser in a rather unsympathetic manner branson moved to the rear he said let me talk to hendrix not more than two seconds elapsed before hendrix was on the phone hendrix branson was his usual unemotional self i have promised immunity to the doctors coming out here i want you and the vicepresident to accompany them there was a brief delay then hendrix came through again on the intercom mr richards agrees but you are not to hold the vicepresident as a hostage i agree in turn your word for what its worth you have to believe me dont you youre in no position to bargain no position i have a dream branson i know but i think handcuffs are so inelegant i will see you in a very few minutes send out the tv truck alert the networks again i think it very important that the nation should be made aware of the establishments modus operand branson rested the phone in the communications wagon just off the presidio hendrix in turn rested his phone and looked at the six men clustered around him he addressed himself to hagenbach well you have it hansen dead nobodys fault really how was anybody to know that he had a critical heart condition and howand whydid nobody know about it hagenbach said heavily i knew like nearly all senior government officials hansen was intensely secretive about his physical health he was in bethscda twice in the last nine months and the second time was touch and go it was reported that he was receiving treatment for overwork exhaustion so i think if anyone is to blame its me quarry said youre talking nonsense and you know it who could possibly have foreseen this its not your fault and its certainly not dr isaacss fault he told us the drug was perfectly safe for any normal healthy adult you cannot question the judgement of a man of his reputation he wasnt to know that hansen wasnt a normal healthy adult far less anticipating that hansen would misguidedly pick up the wrong plate and whats going to happen now hendrix said its obvious whats going to happen now we seven are going to be publicly indicted as murderers the tv crew had arrived on the centre of the bridge but were momentarily inactive the two specialist doctors were analysing the food and despite ohares predictions for once seemed to be agreeing with each other the president was talking quietly to the vicepresident from the expressions on their faces it seemed they didnt have very much to talk about branson was alone with hendrix in the presidential coach branson said do you honestly expect me to believe that you and hagenbach know nothing about this hendrix said wearily nothing theres been a botulinus outbreak downtown in the past few days he pointed towards the tv set in the middle of the roadway if you watch that at all you must have heard of it he pointed again towards the evening meal wagon where the two doctors were busily at work they were convinced before arrival what the trouble was he refrained from adding that hed told the doctors to find not more than a dozen cases of poisoning you have lives on your hands branson dont we all get on that phone hendrix some more hot meals the first three taken by random sample will be eaten by the president the king and the prince you do understand dont you revson was in the ambulance with ohare and april wednesday she was lying blanketcovered on the hinged down bed she said drowsily did you have to do this to me yes you dont like thumb screws no maybe youre not the monster i thought you were but dr ohare dr ohare as he would say in his own native tongue is a different kettle of fish what did branson say she said sleepily same cable bayside her eyelids closed ohare took revson by the arm his voice was quiet enough how long two hours not less the pens ohare withdrew the pens from his clipboard you do know what youre doing i hope he thought briefly then said youre going to be questioned i know you want your torch later kylenski was the senior of the two doctors examining the food trays he said to branson my colleague and i have found twelve infected food trays branson looked at van effen then back at kylenski that all twelve not seventeen kylenski had a grey beard grey moustache and aquiline aristocratic stare twelve spoiled meat some form of botulinus you dont even have to taste it you can smell it well i can apparently hansen didnt lethal in this concentration normally no this infected food didnt kill hansen well not directly but it was almost certainly responsible for reactivating this longstanding and severe heart ailment which did kill him what would the effect of this be on the average healthy adult incapacitating violent vomiting possibility of stomach haemorrhaging unconsciousness or something pretty close to it so a man would be pretty helpless hed be incapable of action most likely of thought too what a perfectly splendid prospect for some branson looked again at van effen what do you think i think i want to know what you want to know van effen turned to kylenski this poison or whatever it iscould it have been deliberately introduced who on earth would want to do a thing like that branson said answer the question any doctor specializing in this field any research fellow even a reasonably competent laboratory assistant could produce the necessary toxin culture but he would have to be a doctor or in some way associated with the medical profession i mean this would call for trained knowledge and laboratory facilities normally yes branson said to the meal wagon attendant come out from behind that counter tony tony came his apprehension was unmistakable branson said its not all that hot tony its turning quite cool in fact why are you sweating i dont like all this violence and guns no one has offered you any violence or even pointed a gun at you although im not saying that both of them arent going to happen to you in the very near future i suggest tony that you are suffering from a guilty conscience me conscience tony actually mopped his brow if his conscience wasnt troubling him something else clearly was gods sake mr branson fairy stories are fairy stories but they dont run to a dozen coincidences at a time only a fool would accept that but there had to be some way of identifying the poisoned plates what way tony why dont you leave him alone branson vicepresident richardss voice was at once harsh and contemptuous hes only a van driver branson ignored him how were the plates to be identified i dont know i dont i dont even know what you are talking about i branson turned to kowalski and peters throw him into the golden gate his voice was as level and conversational as ever tony made an animallike noise but offered no resistance as kowalski and peters took an arm apiece and began to march him away his face was ashen and rivulets of sweat were now pouring down his face when he did speak his voice was a harsh unbelieving croak throw me off the bridge thats murder murder in the name of god i dont know branson said youll be telling me next that you have a wife and three kids ive got nobody his eyes turned up in his head and his legs sagged under him until he had to be dragged across the roadway both the vicepresident and hendrix moved in to intercept the trio they stopped as van effen lifted his schmeisser van effen said to branson if there was a way of identifying those plates that would be important and dangerous information would you entrust tony with anything like that not for a second enough hell tell anything he knows i suspect it wont be much he raised his voice bring him back tony was brought back and released he sagged wearily to the roadway struggled with difficulty to his feet and clung tremblingly to the luncheon wagonette his voice shook as much as his frame i know nothing about the plates i swear it tell us what you do know i thought something was far wrong when they loaded the food into my van at the hospital the hospital i dont work at the hospital i work for selzaick i know them the caterers for openair functions well i was told the food was ready when i got there im usually loaded and away in five minutes this time it took threequarters of an hour did you see anybody from the hospital when you were waiting at selznicks nobody youll live a little longer tony provided you dont eat that damned food of yours he turned to ohare well that leaves only you and the fragile miss wednesday you insinuating that either of us might have been carrying secret instructions from your alleged poisoners there was more contempt than incredulity in ohares tone yes lets have miss wednesday here ohare said leave her alone you saidwho do you think is in charge here where a patient of mine is concerned i am if you want her here youll have to carry her shes asleep in the ambulance under heavy sedation cant you take my word no kowalski go check you know a couple of stiff fingers in the abdomen kowalski returned within ten seconds out like a light branson looked at ohare how very convenient maybe you didnt want her subjected to interrogation youre a lousy psychologist branson miss wednesday is not as you know cast in the heroic mould can you imagine anyone entrusting her with any vital information branson made no reply apart from that the only good thing thats ever been said about you is that you never molest women how do you know that chief of police hendrix told me he seems to know a lot about you you confirm that hendrix hendrix was curt why shouldnt i branson said so that leaves only you doctor as a prime suspect youre losing your grip he nodded at hansens sheetcovered form on a stretcher i dont want to sound sanctimonious but as a doctor my job is to save lives not take them away i have no wish to be struck off the medical register besides i havent left the ambulance since before the food wagon arrived i couldnt very well be there identifying your damned food trays and be in the ambulance at the same time branson said kowalski i can vouch for that mr branson but you were talking to people after you returned and before the food wagon arrived kowalski said he did to quite a few people so did miss wednesday we can forget her the good doctor here a fair number of people anyone in particular i mean long earnest chats that sort of thing yes kowalski appeared to be extremely observant or have an uncomfortably good memory or both three two with miss wednesday forget the lady shed plenty of time to talk to him in the ambulance to and from hospital who else revson a long talk overhear anything no thirty yards away and downwind anything pass between them no kowalski was definite branson said to ohare what did you talk about medical privilege you mean mind my own damned business ohare said nothing branson looked at revson no medical privileges revson said cabbages and kings ive talked to at least thirty people including your own men since we arrived why single this out as a special case i was hoping you could tell me theres nothing to tell youre pretty cool arent you a clear conscience you should try it some time and mr branson kowalski again revson also had a long talk with general cartland oh more cabbages and kings general no we were discussing the possibilities of ridding this bridge of some of its more undesirable elements coming from you i can well believe it a fruitful talk cartland looked at him in icy silence branson looked thoughtfully at van effen i have a feeling just a feeling mind you that we have an infiltrator in our midst van effen gazed at him with his impassive moonface and said nothing branson went on i think that would rule out the doctor apart from the fact that weve checked out on his credentials i have the odd instinct that there is a trained agent loose on this bridge that again would rule out ohare whos just here by happenstance anyway you share my instinct yes who van effen didnt hesitate revson branson beckoned chrysler revson here claims to be an accredited correspondent of the times of london how long would it take you to check that out using the presidential telecommunications yes minutes revson said i suppose im supposed to show a degree of high indignation but i wont bother why me why assume its any of the news media members why not one of your own men because i handpicked them personally just the same way that napoleon did his marshals and look how many of them turned against him in the end how you can expect devoted loyalty from a bunch of cutthroats like this however handpicked is beyond me youll do for the moment van effen said comfortably he touched bransons arm and pointed to the west we may not have all that much time youre right dark heavy ominous clouds were rolling in from the pacific although still some miles distant the audiences wouldnt like it at all if they were to see their president and vicepresident not to mention their oil friends sitting here getting soaked in a thunderstorm ask johnson to organize the cameras and the seating he waited thoughtfully until van effen had done this then took him across to where revson was standing alone he said to van effen revson tells me that you have already searched his camera yes but i didnt take it to pieces maybe we should and maybe you shouldnt for once revson let anger show do you know that it takes a man five years training to learn just how to assemble one of those cameras id rather you kept the damned thing for the duration of our stay here than have it ruined call his bluff and have it stripped branson said i agree van effen said to revson almost soothingly well have chrysler do it hes as close to a mechanical genius as anyone i know it will be intact to branson he said ive also searched his carryall the upholstery of his seat below the seat and the rack above clean search him search me more than a trace of truculence remained in revsons face ive already been searched for weapons only if there had been a grain of rice on revsons person including inside the coat lining van effen wouldnt have missed it apart from keys coins and an inoffensive little knife all he came up with were papers the usual van effen said driving licence social security credit cards press cards press cards branson said any of them identify him with the london times theres this van effen handed the card across to branson looks pretty kosher to me if he is who or what we think he might be he wouldnt be likely to hire the worst forger in town he handed the card back a slight frown on his face anything else yes van effen opened a long envelope airline ticket for hong kong it wouldnt be dated for tomorrow it is how did you know he told me so himself what do you think i dont know for a moment as van effen idly fingered revsons felt pens both he and branson were only a hearts beat from death but van effen his mind on something else reclipped them and opened revsons passport he flipped rapidly through the pages certainly gets around lots of southeast asia passports last about two years ago near east immigration stamps galore not many european or london stamps but that signifies nothing they are an idle bunch across there and british and most europeanwestern european passport officers only stamp your passports if they feel in need of the exercise how does it all sound to you ties in with his own claims what he told me himself you if hes a bad one i would call this an excessive coverup why not milwaukee or even san francisco branson said you a san franciscan by adoption van effen said whod spend a dozen years travelling the world just to establish a background an alibi like this chrysler came up branson looked at him in slight surprise through already the president has a hot line to london i hope you dont mind revsons clean hes a fully accredited correspondent of the london times revson said to chrysler branson wants you to take my camera to pieces theres a timebomb or a radio inside it watch you dont blow yourself up after that youd better make damn sure you put it all together again chrysler received bransons nod smiled took the camera and left revson said will that be all or do you want to unscrew my false heels branson wasnt amused im still not satisfied how am i to know that kylenski here is not in cahoots with the poisoners how am i to know that he was not instructed to find only a dozen poisoned plates so as to kill our suspicions there should have been seventeen tampered trays there shouldthere must be someone on the bridge capable of identifying them i want you revson to sample one of the trays that kylenski has declared safe you want me you want to kill me off with botulinus on the offchance that kylenski has made a mistake im damned if i will im no human guineapig then well try some of them out on the president and his oil friends here royal guineapigs if you will this should make medical history if they resist well forcefeed them revson was about to make the obvious point that they could forcefeed him equally well but immediately changed his mind cartland had not yet had the opportunity to inform those in the presidential coach as to how the infected trays could be identified ohare apart he was the only one who could revson turned his palms upwards god knows what youre after but i trust the two doctors here if they say there are so many uncontaminated trays then i believe them so you can have your plebeian guineapig branson looked at him closely why have you changed your mind revson said conversationally you know branson youre endlessly oversuspicious from the expression of your lieutenant van effen there i would say that he agrees with me no harm could come revson thought from sowing the odd seed of dissention some people might even interpret it as a sign of weakness of uncertainty im agreeing because i dont care so much for you a chink in everybodys armour im beginning to believe that your belief in your own infallibility may rest on rather shaky ground besides plebs are expendable presidents and kings are not branson smiled his confident smile and turned to tony lay out ten of the uncontaminated plates on the counter tony did so now revson which one would you care to sample youre slipping branson youve still the lingering suspicion that i might be able to identify the poisoned trays suppose you choose for me branson nodded and pointed at one of the trays revson moved forward lifted the indicated tray and sniffed it slowly and cautiously the surreptitious movements of his fingertips found no traces of tiny indentations on the underside of the plastic lugs this tray was clean he took a spoon dug into the centre of what looked like a brownedover cottage pie and sampled the meat he grimaced chewed swallowed then repeated the process he laid down the tray in disgust branson said not to your liking if i were in a restaurant id send this back to the kitchen better id take it there and empty it over the chefs headnot that the person who made this could ever be called a chef contaminated youd think no just plain bloody lousy perhaps youd care to sample another one no i would not besides you said just one sample branson said persuasively come on be cooperative revson scowled but cooperated this tray too was clean he went through the same performance and had no sooner done so when branson handed him a third tray this one had indentations on the underside of the lugs revson broke the skin sniffed suspiciously tasted a little and at once spat it out i dont know whether this is contaminated or not but it tastes and smells even lousier than the other two if thats possible he pushed the tray under kylenskis hose who sniffed it and passed it across to his colleague branson said well kylenski was hesitant could be a marginal a borderline case it would require lab testing he looked thoughtfully at revson do you smoke no drink birthdays and funerals only kylenski said that could account for it some nonsmokers and non drinkers can have an extraordinarily acute sense of taste and smell revson is obviously one of those without consulting anyone revson examined another six trays he pushed them all away and turned to branson my opinion for what its worth branson nodded mostnot all but mostof those trays are off with some youve almost got to imagine it others stink i think the whole damn lot is contaminated in varying degrees branson looked at kylenski possible kylenski looked uncomfortable it happens botulinus can vary widely in its degree of concentration only last year there was a double family outing in new england ten in all among other things they had sandwiches again the botulinus bug five died two were slightly ill three unaffected but the sandwiches were all spread with the same meat paste branson and van effen walked apart van effen said enough you mean you see no point in going ahead with this you stand to lose credibility mr branson i agree im not happy about it but i agree trouble is weve really basically only got revsons word for it but hes identified twentyin all contaminated trays r three more than was necessary who says so revson after all the proofs you still dont trust him hes too cool too relaxed hes obviously highly trained highly competent and im damned sure that its net in photography he could be in that too i wouldnt doubt it so youre still going to treat this as a case of deliberate poisoning where our vast viewing public is concerned whos to gainsay me theres only one mike and its in my hand van effen looked towards the south tower food wagon number two on its way branson had the tv cameras the honoured guests the newspapermen and still cameramen in position in very short order indeed the black thunderous clouds from the west were steadily marching in on them among those seated the only difference in composition was that hansens seat had been taken over by the vicepresident the cameras were turning and branson seated next to the president was talking into the microphone he said i am calling upon all viewers in america and throughout the world to be witnesses to a particularly heinous crime that has been committed upon this bridge just over an hour ago a crime that i trust will persuade you that not all criminals are those who stand without the law i would ask you to look at this food wagon which as you can see has its counter covered with food trays harmless if not particularly appetizing food trays you would think such as any major airline would serve up to its passengers but are they really harmless he turned to the man on his ether side and the camera was now back on them this is dr kylenski a leading forensic expert on the west coast a specialist in poisons are those trays really harmless dr kylenski no youll have to speak up doctor no they are not harmless some are contaminated how many half maybe more i have no laboratory resources to hand contaminated that means infected what are they infected with doctor a virus botulinus a major source of severe food poisoning how severe caa it be deadly yes frequently yes normally it occurs naturallyspoiled food things like that yes but a culture of it can be manufactured synthetically or artificially in a laboratory thats putting it very loosely were talking primarily to laymen yes and it could be injected synthetically into already prepared but otherwise harmless food i suppose so yes or no yes thank you dr kylenski that will be all revson still without his camera was standing by the ambulance with ohare for a person whos never been inside a courtroom branson seems to have mastered the prosecuting counsel bit pretty well its all this tv branson said i put it to all of you who are watching that the authorities military police fbi government or whoeverhave made a deliberate attempt to murder or at least incapacitate those of us who have taken over the presidential entourage and this bridge there must be someone on this bridge who knew how to identify poisoned trays and see that they fell into the right hands that is the hands of my colleagues and myself the attempt fortunately failed but there has been one casualty whom i shall mention later meantime i would draw your attention to the fact that a second food wagon has arrived a camera obligingly drew the viewers attention to this fact it seems incredible that the authorities would be so obtuse as to try the same gambit again but on the other hand they have already shown that they are incredibly obtuse so we are going to select three trays at random and offer them to the president king and prince if they survive we may reasonably assume that the food is uncontaminated if on the other hand they become seriously illor worsethe world will know that the guilt cannot be laid at our door we are in permanent radiotelephone contact with the police and military authorities ashore they have one minute to tell us whether this food is contaminated or not mayor morrison was on his feet van effen lifted his schmeisser fractionally but morrison ignored him he said to branson apart from the personal indignity and affront you are heaping on the president and his royal guests couldnt you pick someone a bit lower down the scale for your experiment such as yourself such as myself my dear mayor your personal courage is beyond dispute that is well known your intelligence however isnt if anyone is to be put to the test it will be the three men who are probably the most important in the united states today their untimely disappearance from the scene would have the maximum inhibiting effect on wouldbe poisoners in the olden days the serfs tasted the food of their rulers i find it rather amusing that the roles should be reversed please sit megalomaniac bastard revson said ohare nodded hes all of that but a lot more he knows damn well there isnt a chance in the world of the food being spiked but hes going through the charade all the same hes not only enjoying his own showmanship hes getting a positively sadistic kick out of it all particularly in humiliating the president you think hes sick in the head certifiably i mean im no psychiatrist he could get all he wants without those histrionics and tv spectaculars whats for sure hes got a grudge against society in general and the president in particular certainly hes in it for the money but hes in it for something else as if he wanted to become a nationallyor internationally recognized figure in that case hes made a fair start in fact hes gone as far as he can go now it seems as if hes overcompensating for something lord knows what they watched three trays of food being brought towards the rows of chairs ohare said reckon theyll sample that stuff theyll eat it in the first place they couldnt bear the indignity of being forcefed in front of hundreds of millions of viewers the presidents courage is known well enough you will remember his record during world war two in the pacific again as president he has to give a lead to the nationif he refused to eat while his oil friends did hed be a dead duck at the next election conversely his oil friends would lose face if the president ate and they didnt they ate after chrysler had given a negative signal from the presidential coach branson nodded towards the trays the president inevitably he was not a man to be upstaged by any onewas the first to get busy with knife and fork it could hardly be said that he ate with unrestrained gusto but he plodded along stolidly enough and had finished more than half his meal before he laid down his eating tools branson said well i wouldnt offer it to my guests in the white house but its palatable enough in spite of the deep humiliation he must have been experiencing the president was maintaining a remarkable degree of sangfroid a little wine would have helped though you shall have as much as you want in a few moments i imagine a great number of people are also going to feel like a restorative pretty soon too incidentally if you people are still interestedwe shall be fixing our second strap of explosives at nine oclock tomorrow morning our time of course and now could we have the cameras on that stretcher there two men stood at the head of the canvasshrouded stretcher at a word from branson they pulled back the top section of the canvas the cameras zoomed in on the pallid haggard face of the dead man held it for all of ten interminable and hushed seconds then returned to branson he said john hansen your energy czar death certified as due to botulinus poisoning for what may be the first time in history a wanted criminal accuses the legal authorities of murder second degree murder it may be but i nevertheless indict them on a charge of murder hagenbach was in full vitriolic flow some phrases like evil twisted macabre vicious bastard were just identifiable but the rest was wholly unprintable newson carter milton and quarry were momentarily silent but their faces showed clearly enough that they totally identified themselves with hagenbachs expressed convictions hagenbach being only human finally ran out of breath hes made us look very very bad indeed in the circumstances miltons restraint was remarkable bad quarry looked around for another word then gave up if he pulls another one like this if we pull another one like thisbranson will have half the nation on his side whats to do next hagenbach said wait till we hear from revson revson admiral newson seemed unenthusiastic hes hardly distinguished himself so far a hundred to one it wasnt revsons fault hagenbach said and dont forget the final decision was ours we bear a collective responsibility gentlemen they sat around the table bearing this intolerable responsibility each one an atlas bearing his own private world on his shoulders nine on the golden gate bridge that evening events happened in fairly quick but ordered fashion a special ambulance appeared and took away the stretcher bearing the remains of hansen an autopsy was to be performed which seemed to be a singular waste of time but was apparently mandatory under state law when a person had died under unusual circumstances dr kylenski and his colleague with a marked absence of reluctance accompanied the ambulance newsmen captives and captors had their evening meal the first two with a notable but understandable lack of appetite but with a thirst equally notable and understandable so marked that further liquid supplies had to be commandeered the two tv trucks left and shortly afterwards the two food wagons last to go were vicepresident richards and hendrix the vicepresident had spent a long time in a long and earnest private discussion with the president just as had general cartland with hendrix both branson had watched with a certain amused tolerance but had paid little attention from their grim and depressed expressions it was clear that their discussions had been totally fruitless no other result could have been expected it may well have been that branson was suffering from a certain degree of euphoria after the dramatic effect of his last broadcast from his expression it was impossible to tell branson approached kowalski just as richards and hendrix turned towards their waiting police car well my life on it mr branson i had my eye on hendrix and the vicepresident every second at no time did revson approach within twenty yards of either man branson was aware that kowalski a very bright youngster indeed was looking at him with an expression of barely restrained curiosity branson gave his usual faint and empty smile you wondering whats bugging me about revson not wondering sir interested ive known you for three years now sir i shouldnt imagine you see many fairies at the bottom of your garden dont you now branson turned and called to richards wait to kowalski whats that supposed to mean well revson hes been searched to pieces hes passed every test maybe if the boys and i knew what you are every test with flying colours perhaps his flag flies too high would you have sampled those charming botulinus dinners my oath and i wouldnt he hesitated well if it was a direct order from you and with a gun in your back kowalski said nothing branson said revson doesnt take orders from me and he had no gun in his back maybe he takes orders from someone else maybe he does at that just a very close eye kowalski if i have to stay awake all night you know i think id rather appreciate that branson walked away towards the police car kowalski looked after him very thoughtfully indeed the vicepresident and hendrix were standing impatiently by the opened doors of the police car branson came up and said you will not have forgotten the deadline gentlemen deadline branson smiled do not be so deliberately obtuse mr vicepresident the transfer of certain monies to europe half a billion dollars plus of course my quarter million expenses noon tomorrow richardss chilling glare should have petrified branson on the spot branson remained unaffected and dont forget the escalation clause two million dollars for every hours delay and of course the free pardon i expect that will take some time i suppose your congress will be a little stuffy about that but weyour friends and i can rest comfortably in the caribbean until that comes through i bid you good evening gentlemen he walked away and stopped at the opened door of the rear coach revson was there slinging over his shoulder the strap of the camera which chrysler had just handed back to him chrysler smiled at branson clean as a whistle mr branson my word i wish i had one of those you can have a dozen very soon you had another camera revson yes revson sighed do you want me to fetch it for you id rather not will you get it chrysler five back inside seat revson said helpfully its on the seat chrysler returned with the camera showed it to branson a asahipentax i have one myself those things are so jammed with miniaturized electronic equipment that you couldnt hide a pea inside it assuming of course that it is not just an empty shell ah chrysler looked at revson loaded revson shook his head chrysler opened the back just as van effen joined them and displayed the rear of the camera the genuine article he snapped the back closed revson took his camera back he spoke to branson his tone as cold as his face maybe youd like to look at my watch could be a transistorized twoway radio all the best investigators in the comic strips wear one branson said nothing chrysler took revsons wrist pressed a knob on either side of the watch illuminated red figures appeared one set giving the date the other the time chrysler dropped the wrist pulsar digital you couldnt hide a grain of sand inside one of those things revson turned with deliberate contempt on his heel and walked away chrysler went inside the coach van effen said still bugged mr branson so hes annoyed wouldnt you be if youd been put through the hoop the way youve put him through the hoop besides if hed anything to hide he wouldnt let his animosity show so plain hed keep a very low profile indeed maybe thats the way he expects us to react or maybe hes dear branson looked thoughtful almost to the extent of being worried but i cant shake off the feeling that theres something wrong and its a feeling thats never let me down before im convinced dont ask me how that someone on the bridge has some means of communicating with someone on land i want every inch of every personand that includes our illustrious guests searched and to hell with the ladies feelings every inch of their personal belongings every inch of every coach immediately mr branson there was acquiescence in the tone but no great enthusiasm and the rest rooms those too and the ambulance yes i think ill attend to that myself ohare looked up in mild surprise as branson entered the ambulance dont tell me that the botulinus has struck again no im here to search this ambulance ohare rose from his stool his face tight i dont allow civilians to touch my medical supplies youre going to allow this one if necessary ill call one of my men and have you held either at pistolpoint or tied up while i conduct my search and just what in the hell do you think youre looking for thats my concern so i cant stop you i just warn you that we carry quite a lot of dangerous drugs and surgical equipment here if you poison yourself or slice an artery heres one doctor whos not going to help you branson nodded to april wednesday who was sleeping peacefully on the side bunk lift her off lift her what do you think do it immediately or i call a guard ohare lifted the slight form in his arms branson pummelled every inch of the thin mattress lifted it looked under it and said put her back branson carried out a thorough search of all the medical equipment in the ambulance he knew exactly what he was looking for and nothing he examined looked even remotely like what he hoped to find he looked around picked up a torch suspended from one side of the ambulance switched it on and twisted the top opening and then narrowing the hooded shutter a peculiar flashlight ohare ohare said wearily its an ophthalmic torch every physician carries one you can diagnose a dozen different diseases by the dilation of the pupils of the eyes this can be useful come with me he went down the rear steps of the ambulance went round to the front and jerked open the drivers door the driver peering at a lurid magazine in the now fading light looked round in surprise branson said out the man descended and branson offering no explanation searched him comprehensively from head to foot he then climbed inside the driving compartment examined the upholstery opened various lockers and shone the torch inside he descended and said to the driver open the engine hood this was done again with the aid of the torch he carried out a thorough inspection of the compartment and found nothing worthy of his attention he went round to the rear of the ambulance and reentered ohare followed politely removed the torch from bransons hand and replaced it branson indicated a metal canister held in place by a spring dip he said whats that ohare gave a creditable impression of a man whose patience was wearing very very thin an aerosol airfreshener it was the fake prestige can that contained the knockout gas branson freed the can sandalwood he said you have an exotic taste in perfumes he shook the can listened to the gurgling inside then replaced the canister in its clip ohare hoped that the dampness on his brow didnt show branson finally directed his attention to die big oiledwood box on the floor and whats this ohare didnt answer branson looked at him ohare was leaning with a negligent elbow on top of a locker his expression a mixture of barely concealed impatience and bored indifference branson said sharply you heard me i heard you ive had just about enough of you branson if you expect me to show any obedience or respect for you then youre way out of your mind im beginning to think you are illiterate cant you see those big red letters they spell out cardiac arrest unit emergency equipment for patients who have or may shortly be expected to have a heart attack why the big red seal in front theres more to it than just that red seal the whole unit is hermetically sealed the entire interior of that box and all the equipment it contains is completely sterilized before the box is sealed one does not inject an unsterilized needle in or near the heart of a cardiac patient what would happen if i broke that seal to you nothing youd just be committing the most cardinal sin in any hospital youd render the contents useless and the way youre carrying on the president is a prime candidate for a heart attack at any moment ohare was acutely conscious that the aerosol can was only inches from his hand if branson broke the seal and started delving deeper he intended to use the aerosol without a second thought branson could hardly be expected to be the person who would fail to recognize a cyanide air pistol when he saw it bransons face was without expression the president id sooner turn in my licence than insure the president for anything i am a doctor twice your needling and public humiliation have driven him into a state of nearapoplexy you never know third time you may be lucky go on and break the bloody seal whats another death on your conscience ive never been responsible for anybodys death in my life without as much as looking at ohare branson abruptly left the ambulance ohare went to the rear door and looked after him thoughtfully revson was ambling across the roadway and branson spared him neither a word nor a glance behaviour uncharacteristic of branson who was much given to directing penetrating glances at everyone usually for no reason whatsoever revson looked after him in some puzzlement then strolled off towards the ambulance revson said you just been put through the grinder too that you can say again ohare spoke with some feeling you too not me ive been searched so often that nobody would bother everybody else was though it must have been pretty thorough i heard more than one ladylike scream of protest he looked after the departing branson our mastermind seems unusually preoccupied he was acting a bit oddly when he left he drew a blank obviously yes didnt even investigate your one sealed containerthe cardiac unit thats when he started behaving oddly im pretty sure that he was about to break the seal when i pointed out that that would desterilize the equipment and render it useless i also pointed out that i considered the president a prime candidate for a heart attack and that i regarded him as being the prime cause for this that was when he backed off understandable i would have thought he doesnt want to lose his principal hostage that wasnt the impression he gave me he also said another funny thing when he left that hed never been responsible for anyones death in his life to the best of my knowledge thats true maybe he just didnt want to spoil his good record could have been could have been but the puzzled expression was still on ohares face van effen regarded branson with a curiosity that his face didnt register branson he thought was a shade less than his old ebullient self van effen said well how did you find the ambulance and the good doctor clean the ambulance is god damn it all i quite forgot to go over ohare van effen smiled one tends to pillars of moral rectitude ill go look at him how did it go with you there were ten of us and we were pretty thoroughand pretty thoroughly unpopular if there was a silver dollar on the golden gate bridge wed have found it we didnt find any silver dollars but then branson and his men had been searching the wrong places and the wrong people they should have searched chief of police hendrix before hed been allowed to leave the bridge hagenbach milton quarry newson and carter were seated round the long oblong table in the communications wagon there were bottles of liquor on a wallmounted sideboard and judging from the levels of the liquids in the bottles and the glasses in front of the five men they werent there for purely decorative purposes the five appeared to be concentrating on two things only not speaking to one another and not looking at one another the bottoms of their glasses appeared to hold a singular fascination for them comparatively the average funeral parlour could have qualified as an amusement arcade a bell rang softly at the inner end of the wagon a shirtsleeved policeman seated before a battery of telephones lifted one and spoke softly into it he turned and said mr quarry sir washington quarry rose to his feet with the alacrity of a french aristocrat going to the guillotine and made his way to the communications desk his end of the conversation appeared to consist of a series of dispirited grunts finally he said yes as planned returned to the table and slumped into his chair the money has been arranged just in case its needed milton said heavily can you see it not being needed the treasury also agrees that we should stall them for up to twentyfour hours from noon tomorrow miltons lugubriousness didnt alter by bransons escalation demands that means close on another fifty million dollars peanuts to what hes asking milton made a stillborn attempt to smile might give one of our brilliant minds time to come up with a brilliant idea he relapsed into a silence which no one seemed inclined to break hagenbach reached for a bottle of scotch helped himself and passed the bottle around they resumed their mournful inspection of the depth of their glasses the bottle was not long left undisturbed richards and hendrix entered and without speaking sat down heavily in two vacant chairs the vicepresidents hand reached the bottle just fractionally before that of hendrix richards said how did we look on tv tonight goddamned awful but no more awful than the seven of us sitting around here without a single idea in our heads milton sighed seven of the allegedly best governmental and law enforcement minds in the business the best we can do is drink scotch not a single idea among us hendrix said i think perhaps revson has he fished a piece of paper from the inside of a sock and handed it to hagenbach for you hagenbach unfolded the note cursed and shouted to the operator my decoder quick hagenbach was back in business and predictably he turned to hendrix he wouldnt have asked richards for the time of day how are things out there anything we dont know how come hansen died to put it brutally hunger greed seemingly he snitched one of the food trays before he could be warned which were the dangerous ones and how they could be identified milton sighed he always was a voracious eater compulsive you might say something wrong with his metabolic system i suppose speak no ill of the dead but i often told him that he was digging his grave with his own teeth looks like thats what happened no fault of revsons none in the world but theres worse your man revson is under heavy suspicion branson as we all have cause to know is a very very clever man and hes convinced theres an infiltrator in their midst hes also almost equally convinced that its revson i think the man is working on sheer instinct he cant pin a thing on revson whos also a very very clever man hagenbach paused then looked sharply at hendrix if branson is so suspicious of revson would he let him get within a mile of you knowing that you were going ashore revson didnt come anywhere near me general cartland gave me the message revson gave the message to cartland so cartland is in on this he knows as much about it as we do revson is going to give him the cyanide pistol never thought our chief of staff was so positively bloodthirsty he seems actually to be looking forward to using it carter said you know cartlands reputation as a tank commander in the second world war after all the comparatively decent italians and germans he disposed of then do you think hes going to worry about doing away with a few really bad hats you should know anyway i went into one of their awful rest rooms and shoved the note down my sock i suspected that the vicepresident here and i might be searched before we left the bridge we werent your revson is right branson is horn overconfident and underconscious of security precautions revson and ohare watched van men walk away revson himself walked away a few steps indicating that ohare should follow him revson said well that was a pretty thorough goingover our friend gave you i dont think he much appreciated your remark about your hoping that he would he a patient of yours some day ohare looked up at the darkly threatening sky now almost directly overhead the wind was freshening and two hundred feet below the white horses were showing in the golden gate ohare said looks like a rough night coming up wed be more comfortable inside the ambulance i think and ive some excellent whisky and brandy in there used you understand solely for the resuscitation of the sick and ailing youre going to go far in your profession sick and ailing describes my symptoms precisely but id rather be succoured out here whatever for revson gave him a pitying look if it werent for your good fortune in having me here youd very probably be the main object of bransons suspicions has it not occurred to you that during his intensive search of your ambulance he might have planted a tiny electronic bug which you wouldnt discover in a week of searching it occurs to me now theres a dearth of devious minds in the medical profession do you have any gin its odd you should ask that i do thats for me i told branson that i didnt drink and thats why i have a nose like a bloodhound i shouldnt care for him to see me with a glass of something amber in my hand devious devious minds ohare disappeared inside the ambulance and reappeared shortly with two glasses the clear one for revson health indeed i shouldnt wonder if thats going to be in short supply inside the next twentyfour hours cryptic arent we psychic revson looked speculatively at the nearest helicopter i wonder if the pilot johnson i think intends to sleep in his machine tonight ohare gave a mock shiver you ever been in a helicopter oddly perhaps no i have several times strictly i assure you in the line of medical duty these army jobs are fitted with steelframed canvas chairs if thats the word for them for me it would be a tossup between that and a bed of nails so much i suspected so hell probably bed down with his fellowvillains in the rear coach the chopper appears to interest you strangely revson glanced casually around there was no one within possible earshot the detonating mechanism for the explosives is inside there i intend note that i only say intend to deactivate it tonight ohare was silent for a long moment then said kindly i think i should give you a medical for that space between the ears therell be at least one armed guard on all night patrol you know the bridge is a blaze of light all night long so you just dematerialize yourself the sentry i can take care of the lights will be switched off when i want them abracadabra ive already sent a message ashore i didnt know that secret agents doubled as magicians you produce a carrier pigeon from your hat hendrix took it ashore for me ohare stared at him then said another drink no befuddled wits tonight thank you then ill have one he took both glasses and reappeared with his own look that guy kowalski has the general appearance and the eyes of a hawk im not exactly shortsighted myself he never took his eyes off you all the time the vicepresident and hendrix were out here bransons orders im certain me too who else i never went near hendrix i gave the message to cartland who passed it on to hendrix kowalski was too busy watching me to bother about cartland and hendrix what time will the lights go off i dont know yet ill send a signal this means cartland is in on this what else by the way i promised the general the cyanide gun can you get it to him one way or another no way i suppose of replacing that seal on the cardiac unit once it has been broken you mean in case our suspicious mr branson visits the ambulance again no he smiled it just so happens that i am carrying two spare seals inside the box revson smiled in turn just goes to show a man cant think of everything still on the side of law and order still like to see branson wearing a nice shiny pair of bracelets its becoming a distinct yearning it might involve bending your code of ethics a little the hell with the medical ethics hagenbach positively snatched the sheet of typewritten paper from his decoder he glanced rapidly through it his brow corrugating by the second he said to hendrix revson appeared to be perfectly normal when you left him who can tell what revson appears to be true i dont seem to be able to make head or tail of this richards said acidly you might share your little secrets with us hagenbach he says it looks as if its going to be a lousy night which should help i want two fake oil fires set now or a mixture of oil and rubber tyres one to my southwest say lincoln park the other to the east say fort mason a much bigger fire there ignite the lincoln park one at twentytwo hundred hours at twotwoohthree infrared sights if necessary use a laser beam to destroy the radio scanner on top of the rear coach wait my flashlight signal sos then ignite the other after fifteen minutes blacken out bridge and northern part of san francisco it would help if you could at same time arrange a massive fireworks display in chinatownas if a firework factory had gone up submarine at midnight please provide transistorized transceiver small enough to fit base camera preset your frequency and mine and have submarine patch in on same frequency there was a lengthy silence during which hagenbach perhaps very understandably again reached for the scotch the bottle was rapidly emptied richards finally passed his judgement the mans mad of course quite quite mad nobody for some time appeared inclined to disagree with him richards pro tern the chief executive of the nation was the man to make the decision but apart from his observations on mental instability he was clearly in no mood to make any kind of decision hagenbach took the decision out of his hands revson is probably a good deal saner than any of us here hes brilliant weve had proof of that almost certainly he lacked the time to go into detail finally anyone here got any better idealet me amend that anybody here got any idea if anyone had he was keeping it to himself hendrix get hold of the deputy mayor and the fire chief have those fires set how about the fireworks hendrix smiled fireworks are illegal in san francisco nineteen hundred and six and all that it so happens we know an illegal underground factory in chinatown the owner will be anxious to cooperate richards shook his head mad he said quite quite mad ten from far out at sea came the first faint flickers of lightning and the distant rumble of approaching thunder a nowrecovered if somewhat wan april wednesday standing with revson by the centre of the bridge looked up at the indigo sky and said it looks like being quite a night ive a feeling that way myself he took her arm are you afraid of thunderstorms as you appear to be of everything else i dont much fancy being stuck out on this bridge in the middle of one its been here for almost forty years its not likely to fall down tonight he looked upwards as the first drops of rain began to fall but getting wet i object to come on they took their seats inside the lead coach she by the window he by the aisle within minutes the coach was full and within half an hour most of the occupants were dozing if not asleep each seat had its own individual reading light but without exception those were either dimmed or completely out there was nothing to see nothing to do it had been a long tiring exciting and in many ways a nerveracking day sleep was not only the sensible but inevitable recourse and the sound of drumming rain whether on canvas or on a metal roof has a peculiarly soporific effect and that the rain was now drumming was beyond dispute it had been increasing steadily ever since the passengers had entered the coach and could now fairly be described as torrential the approaching thunderstorm though still some miles distant was steadily increasing in violence but neither rain thunder nor lightning were any deterrent to the prowling kowalski he had promised branson that he would keep his eye on revson all night long if he had to and that he clearly intended to do regularly every fifteen minutes he entered the coach peered pointedly at revson spoke a few brief words to bartlett who sat sideways on guard in the seat next the drivers then left bartlett revson apart was the only alert person in the coach and this revson suspected was due more to kowalskis recurrent visits than to anything else on one occasion revson had overheard bartlett ask when he was to be relieved and been curtly told that he would have to remain where he was until one oclock which suited revson well enough at nine oclock when the rain was at its heaviest kowalski made another of his routine checks revson took out and armed his white pen kowalski turned to go his heel was just descending the riser of the first step when he appeared to stumble then he fell heavily facefirst out of the coach on to the roadway bartlett was the first to reach him revson the second revson said what the hell happened to him lost his footing far as i could see coach door has been open all evening and the steps are slippery as all hell both men stooped to examine the unconscious kowalski he was bleeding quite heavily from the forehead which had obviously taken the main brunt of his fall revson felt his head gently with his fingers the needle protruded almost a quarter of an inch behind kowalskis left ear revson removed and palmed it revson said shall i fetch the doctor yes sure looks as if he needs one revson ran to the ambulance as he approached the light came on inside the ambulance revson took the aerosol can from ohare and thrust it into his pocket the two men ohare carrying his medical bag ran back to the lead coach by this time quite a number of curious journalists from the coach activated almost certainly by the inbuilt curiosity that motivates all good journalists were crowded round the unconscious kowalski stand back ohare ordered the journalists made way respectfully but didnt stand all that far back ohare opened his bag and began to wipe kowalskis forehead with a piece of gauze his opened bag was quite some distance from him and in the dim light the driving rain and aided by the total concentration of all on the injured man it was no great feat for revson to extract an oilskinned packet from the bag and send it spinning under the coach he but only he heard the gentle thump as it struck the kerb on the far side he then pressed in among the curious onlookers ohare straightened a couple of volunteers to help me move him across to the ambulance there was no lack of volunteers they were about to lift him when branson came running up your mans had a pretty nasty fall i want him in the ambulance for a proper examination did he fall or was he pushed how the hell should i know youre wasting what could be valuable time branson bartlett said he fell all right mr branson he slipped on the top step and hadnt a chance to save himself certain of course im bloody certain bartlett was justifiably indignant he spoke again but a crashing peal of thunder drowned out his next words he repeated himself i was within two feet of him at the timeand i hadnt a chance to save him ohare paid no more attention to him with the help of two others he carried kowalski across to the ambulance branson looked at the group of journalists still there caught sight of revson where was revson at the time revson was nowhere near him he was in his seat five back there everyone was in their seats christ mr branson im telling you it was a pure bloody accident must have been clad only in already totally sodden shirtsleeves and trousers branson shivered jesus what a night he hurried across to the ambulance and as he arrived the two men who had helped ohare to carry kowalski came down the ambulance steps branson went inside ohare had already had kowalskis leather jacket removed and his right sleeve rolled beyond the elbow and was preparing a hypodermic injection branson said whats that for ohare turned in irritation what the hell are you doing here this is doctors work get out the invitation passed unheeded branson picked up the tube from which ohare had filled his hypodermic antitetanus the mans got a head wound ohare withdrew the needle covered the pinprick with antiseptic gauze i thought even the most ignorant layman knew that when a man has been injured in the open the first thing he gets is an antitetanus injection youveobviously never seen tetanus he sounded kowalski with his stethoscope took his pulse and then his temperature get an ambulance from the hospital ohare pushed kowalskis sleeve further up and started to wind the bloodpressureband round it branson said no ohare didnt answer until after hed taken the pressure he then repeated get the ambulance i dont trust you and your damned ambulances ohare didnt answer he jumped down the steps and strode off through rain that was now rebounding six inches high off the roadway he was back shortly with the two men who had helped him carry kowalski across ohare said mr grafton mr ferrers two highly respected even eminent journalists their words carry a great deal of weight so will their word whats mat meant to mean for the first time since his arrival on the bridge branson wore just the slightest trace of apprehension ohare ignored him addressed himself to the two journalists kowalski here has severe concussion possibly even a skull fracture the latter is impossible to tell without an xray he also has shallow rapid breathing a weak and feathery pulse a temperature and abnormally low blood pressure this could indicate a few things one of them cerebral haemorrhaging i want you gentlemen to bear witness to the fact that branson refuses to allow an ambulance to come for him i want you to bear witness to the fact that if kowalski dies branson and branson alone will be wholly responsible for his death i want you to bear witness to the fact that branson is fully aware that if kowalski dies he will be guilty of the same charge as he recently levelled against persons unknown murder only in his case i think it would have to be an indictment of the first degree grafton said i shall so solemnly bear witness ferrers said and i ohare looked at branson with contempt and you were the person who said to me that youd never in your life been responsible for the death of a single person branson said how am i to know that once they get him ashore they wont keep him there youre losing your grip branson the contempt was still in ohares voice he and revson had deliberated long enough on how best to wear down branson psychologically as long as you have a president a king and a prince who the hell is going to hold a common criminal like this as a counterransom branson made up his mind it was difficult to tell whether he was motivated by threats or a genuine concern for kowalskis life one of those two will have to go tell chrysler to call the ambulance im not keeping my eyes off you until i see kowalski safely transferred to the other ambulance suit yourself ohare said indifferently gentlemen it will be a pleasure the two journalists left ohare began to cover kowalski hi blankets branson said with suspicion what are you doing that for heaven preserve me from ignorant laymen your friend here is in a state of shock rule number one for shock victims keep them warm just as he finished speaking there was a massive thunder clap directly above so close so loud that it was positively hurtful to the eardrums the reverberations took many long seconds to die away ohare looked speculatively at branson then said know something branson that sounded to me just like the crack of doom he poured some whisky into a glass and added a little distilled water branson said ill have some of that help yourself ohare said agreeably from the comparative comfort of the lead coachcomparative for his clothes were as soaked as if he had fallen into the golden gaterevson watched another ambulance bear away kowalskis stretchered form for the moment revson felt as reasonably content as was possible for a man in his slowly chilling condition the main object of the exercise had been to get his hands on the cord canister torch and aerosol all of those he had achieved the first three were still under the bus by the kerbside the fourth nestled snugly in his pocket that all this should have been done at the expense of kowalski the most relentlessly vigilant of all bransons guards and by a long way the most suspicious was just an added bonus he bethought himself of the aerosol he gave april wednesday a gentle nudge and because people were still talking in varying degrees of animation about the latest incident he did not find it necessary to keep his voice especially low listen carefully and dont repeat my words no matter how stupid my question may appear tell me would a young lady of ah delicate sensibilities carry a miniature aerosol airfreshener around with her beyond a blink of the green eyes she showed no reaction in certain circumstances i suppose so yes he placed the can between them then please put this in your carryall sandal wood but i wouldnt try sniffing it i know very well whats in it the can disappeared i suppose it doesnt matter very much if im caught with it if they bring out those old thumbscrews they wont they already searched your carryall and the person who made the search almost certainly wouldnt remember the contents of one of a dozen bags hes searched no ones keeping an eye on you im way out on my own as suspect number one by ten oclock silence and sleep had returned to the coach the rain had eased until it could be called no more than heavy but still the lightning crackled and the thunder boomed with unabated enthusiasm revson glanced over his shoulder to the southwest there were no signs of any unusual activities in the direction of lincoln park he wondered if those ashore had misinterpreted his message or deliberately ignored it both possibilities he thought unlikely more likely because of the heavy rain they were having difficulty in igniting a fire at seven minutes past ten a red glow appeared to the southwest revson was almost certainly the first person on the bridge to notice it but he thought it impolitic to draw attention to the fact within half a minute the dark oily flames were at least fifty feet high it was bartlett who first called attention to this phenomenon and he did so in a very emphatic fashion he stood in the open doorway behind the drivers seat and shouted jesus would you look at that almost everyone immediately started awake and looked they couldnt see much rain still lashed the outside of the windows and the insides were pretty well steamed up like a bunch of lemmings hellbent on a watery suicide they poured out through the door the view was certainly very much better from there and well worth the seeing the flames already a hundred feet high and topped by billowing clouds of oily smoke were increasing by the second still of the same lemminglike mind and totally oblivious of the rain they began to run across the bridge to obtain a better view the occupants of the presidential and rear coaches were doing exactly the same nothing attracts people more than the prospects of a goodgoing disaster revson though among the first out of the lead coach made no attempt to join them he walked unhurriedly round the front of the coach walked back a few feet stooped and recovered the oilskin package no one paid any attention to him even had he been visible beyond the bulk of the coach because they were all running in and looking towards the opposite direction he removed the torch from the package angled it fortyfive degrees to his right and made his sos signal just once he then pocketed the torch and made his more leisurely way across to the other side of the bridge glancing occasionally over his left shoulder halfway across he saw a rocket a not very spectacular one curving up to the southeast he reached the far crash barrier and joined ohare who was standing some little way apart from the others ohare said youd make quite an arsonist thats just by the way of introduction wait until you see the next one not to mention the fireworks sheer pyromania thats what it is lets look at the front end of the rear coach they looked a full minute passed and nothing happened ohare saidhm worrisome no just running a little bit behind schedule i should think dont even blink ohare didnt and so he saw ita tiny intense spark of bluishwhite that could have lasted only milliseconds ohare said you saw it too yes far less than i thought it would be end of radiowave scanner no question would anyone inside the coach have heard it thats academic theres no one inside the rear coach theyre all across here but there is some sign of activity at the rear of the presidential coach a dollar gets a cent that bransons asking some questions branson was indeed asking some questions chrysler by his side he was talking forcefully into a telephone then find out and find out now im trying to it was hendrix and he sounded weary i can be held responsible for a lot of things but i cant be held responsible for the forces of nature dont you realize this is the worst lightning storm the city has had in years there are dozens of outbreaks of small fires and the firemaster tells me his force is fully extended im waiting hendrix so am i and god only knows how you imagine this fire in lincoln park can affect you sure its giving off clouds of oil smoke but the winds from the west and the smoke wont come anywhere near you youre jumping at shadows branson wait a report there was a brief silence then hendrix went on three parked road oil tankers one had its loading hose partly on the ground so it was earthed witnesses saw this tanker being struck by lightning two fire engines are there and the fire is under control satisfied branson hung up without replying the fire was indeed under control firemen taking their convincing time were now smothering the barrels of blazing oil with foam extinguishers fifteen minutes after the fire had first begunor been noticedit was extinguished reluctantly almostthey were now so wet that they couldnt possibly get any wetterthe watchers by the west barrier turned and made their way back to the coaches but their evenings entertainment had only just begun another fire bloomed to the north it spread and grew with even greater rapidity than the previous one becoming so bright and intense that even the lights in the concrete towers of downtown san francisco seemed pale by comparison branson who had made his way back to his own coach now ran hack to the presidential coach a bell was ringing in the communications section in the rear branson snatched the phone it was hendrix hendrix said nice to forestall you for once no we are not responsible for this one either why in the hell should we set off a fire where all the smoke is being carried away from you east over the bay the meteorological officer says that theres a lightning strike once every three or four seconds and its not cloud to cloud stuff its mainly cloud to earth on the law of averages he says something combustible has to go in one in twenty ill keep you posted for the first time hendrix hung the phone up on him branson slowly replaced his own for the first time lines of strain were beginning to etch themselves round the corners of his mouth the blueveined flames were towering now to a height of six or seven hundred feet as high as the highest building in the city the smoke given off was dense and bitingly acrid which is generally the case when several hundred used tyres are added to an oilbased fire but half a dozen giant fire engines and as many again mobile foam wagons were in very close attendance indeed on the bridge the more nervous of the newspapermen and cameramen were speculating as to whether the fire would spread to the city itself a rather profitless speculation as the wind was entirely in the wrong direction mayor morrison stood by the eastern crash barrier fists clenched tears streaming down his face cursing with a nonstop fluid monotony ohare said to revson i wonder if the king and the prince see the irony in all this after all its probably their own oil that theyre seeing going up revson made no reply and ohare touched his arm sure you havent overdone things a bit this time old boy in moments of stress his english education background tended to show through i wasnt the one with the matches revson smiled no worry they know what theyre about what i am looking forward to seeing now is the firework display in the presidential communications centre the phone rang again branson had it in a second hendrix its an oil storage tank in fort mason there was no oil storage tank in fort mason but branson was not a californian far less a san franciscan and it was highly unlikely that he was aware of that ive just been on the radio to the fire commissioner he says its bark k worse than its bite and that theres no danger and what the hell is that then bransons voice was a shout his normal monolithic cairn in at least temporary abeyance whats what hendrixs calm served only to deepen bransons apprehension fireworks dozens of them fireworks cant you see them not from where i sit i cant wait hendrix went to the rear door of the communications wagon branson hadnt been exaggerating the sky was indeed full of fireworks of every conceivable colour and design at least half of them exploding in glittering falling stars if branson had been his usual calm and observant self hendrix reflected he might have noticed that the fireworks nearly all of a medium trajectory were firing to the northeast which was the shortest distance between where they were coming from and the nearest stretch of water all of them without exception would fizzle out in the waters of san francisco bay hendrix returned to the phone they appear to be coming from the chinatown area and sure as hell they arent celebrating the chinese new year ill call back revson said to ohare take your white coat off its too conspicuous or will be when it gets dark he gave ohare his white felt pen you know how to use this depress the clip and press the button on top yes if anyone comes too near well aim for the face youll have to extract the needle me and my medical ethics branson picked up the phone yes it was chinatown a firework factory there was struck that damned thunder and lightning doesnt just seem to want to go away god knows how many more outbreaks of fire well have tonight branson left the coach and joined van effen by the east barrier van effen turned not often you see a sight like this mr branson im afraid im not in the mood to enjoy it ive a feeling that this is being staged for our benefit how could this possibly affect us nothings changed as far as were concerned dont lets forget our presidential and royal hostages even so even so your antennae are tingling tingling theyre jumping i dont know whats going to happen next but ive the feeling that im not going to enjoy it it was at that moment that the bridge and the whole of northern san francisco blacked out for some few seconds the silence on the bridge was total the darkness wasnt total but it came fairly close to being that way the only illumination came from the faint lighting from the coachesto conserve the batteries most of the individual reading lights were out the others dimmedand the orangered glow from the distant oil fire van effen said softly your antennae mr branson you know you could make a fortune hiring them out start up the generator well have the searchlights on the north and south towers see that the selfpropelled guns are ready loaded crews standing by three men with submachineguns to be by each gun ill go south you north and alert them after that youre in charge of both ill try to find out from that bastard hendrix what this is all about you dont seriously expect a frontal assault mr branson i frankly dont know what the hell to expect what i do know is that we take no chances hurry branson ran south as he passed the rear coach he shouted chrysler the generator quick for gods sake the generator was running before either branson or van effen reached the respective defensive positions the powerful searchlights came on illuminating both towers the reverse effect was to plunge the central portion of the bridge into even deeper gloom than before the guns were readied machinegunners in close attendance van effen stayed where he was branson ran back towards the central coach but both branson and van effen were concentrating their efforts on the wrong things and in the wrong directions they should have been where revson was revson was crouched in the nose section of the leading helicopter the variably shuttered flashlight in his hand reduced to scarcely more than a pinhole of light he had had no trouble in locating the triggering device it was between the pilots seat and the one opposite to it with the screwdriver blade of his knife revson had already removed the four screws that secured the topplate and the topplate itself it was a simple enough device on the outside of the device was a vertical lever padlocked in position in its top position when this was depressed it brought a copper arm down between two springloaded interior copper arms so completing the circuit twin pieces of flex led from those last two to two crocodile springloaded clamps each secured to the terminals of two nickelcadmium nife cells connected up in series that would produce a total of only three volts little enough one would have thought to activate the radio trigger but that branson would have it all expertly calculated out in advance revson did not for a moment doubt he didnt bother to sever or disconnect anything he merely removed the crocodile clips from the terminals lifted the nife cells free broke the connection between them and stuffed one in each jacket pocket had he disconnected or severed anything branson could have carried out some sort of jury rig but revson would have wagered heavily that branson carried no spare nife cells there was no earthly reason why he should have done he began to replace the coverplate hendrix sounded angry a man near the breaking point of exasperation what do you think i am branson a bloody magician i just sit here and snap my fingers and presto all the lights in the north half of the city go out ive told you and i tell you again that two of the main transformers have gone out how i dont know yet but you dont have to be a genius to know that our old friend from the skies above has been at work again what did you expect us to do throw in a tank regiment against you we knew you had those heavy guns and searchlights and your priceless hostages think were morons im beginning to think that youre the moron im beginning to think that youre losing your grip ill call back hendrix hung up branson did the same almost smashing the rest in the process it was the second occasion in a very brief space of time that it had been suggested to him that he was losing his grip his lips were compressed it was a suggestion he didnt much care for far less care to contemplate he remained seated where he was revson closed the helicopter door softly and dropped lightly to the ground a few paces away he could see ohare silhouetted against the still towering but slowly diminishing flames he called his name softly and ohare approached lets walk to the west side revson said no shooting practice nobody as much as looked at the place far less came near it even if they had looked i doubt whether they would have seen anything after staring so long at that fire and the fireworks looking back to the centre of the bridge would have been like looking into total darkness you know no night sight he handed revson the white pen have your little toy back i remain ethically unbent and you can have your flashlight back revson handed it over suggest you return it to your ambulance at the same time t suggest we might retrieve that pistol and give it to general cartland i also suggest you give it to him i dont want to be seen being too chummy with the general tell him not to use it ill he gets the word ever seen one of those before he took a nife cell from his pocket and handed it to ohare who peered at it in the near darkness some sort of battery yes there were two of them and i have the other they were to be used to power the explosives triggering device and you left no trace of your coming and going none so we walk towards the side of the bridge they lobbed the cells into the golden gate and walked to the ambulance ohare ushered revson in first then followed closing the door he said i think we should use the torch the sudden appearance of bright lights in the windows might attract suspicious attention after all were supposed to be out there enjoying the sights it took ohare less than two minutes to break the cardiac arrest unit seal lift out some equipment open up after a series of intricate operations a secret compartment in the bottom of the box retrieve the cyanide gun replace the equipment close and reseal the lid ohare placed the gun in an inside coat pocket and said complainingly im beginning to become ethical ail over again hendrix said over the phone it wasnt the transformers after all there have been so many breaks and shorts in the citys electrical equipment tonight that the generators overload coils just packed up how long branson asked a few minutes no more as was his habit general cartland was standing alone by the east barrier he turned and saw ohare who said quietly a word sir if you please the lights of san francisco and the golden gate bridge came on five minutes later branson left the presidential coach and went to meet van effen he said still think i could make a fortune hiring out my antennae he was smiling van effen wasnt he said do me a favour just hang on to them a little while yet dont tell me your antennae are at work too if theyre not they sure have good standins the last of the fireworks fizzled to extinction the oil fire in fort mason sank down into a sullen deepred glow the lightning and thunder eased although not markedly so but the rain showed no sign of abating had fire broken out in san francisco that night it would surely have been rained to extinction now that the nights entertainment was patently over everyone became very conscious that the rain had become very chilly indeed there was an almost concerted movement back to the coaches revson was in the window seat by the time april wednesday came in she hesitated then sat down beside him she said and why do you want my seat i thought it was customary for the lady to be offered the inside seat to keep her from falling into the aisle during the night dont you know this is the golden age of womens lib however thats not my real reason is it possible for me to reach the aisle without disturbing you in the process thats a silly question is it i mean possible you can see it isnt would you be prepared to swearshort of thumbscrews that is that i never once disturbed you in the course of the night you propose to disturb me then yes will you she smiled i think ive shown that i can lie with the best of them youre not only beautiful but youre good thank you where were you thinking of going do you really want to know i think youd better not think of the thumbscrews the rack being broken on the wheel but chief of police hendrix said that branson never offered violence to women that was the branson of yore but hes become jittery now more than a little rattled he might find himself driven to a point where hes compelled to abandon his scruples it wasnt the completely sodden thin silk dress she was wearing that made her shiver i think id rather not know when are you just before midnight then i shant sleep a wink before then excellent give me a shake at five minutes to revson closed his eyes and appeared to relax comfortably in his seat by five minutes to midnight everyone in the coach appeared to be asleep despite their cold and discomfort nearly all had been asleep for over an hour even april wednesday was asleep her head on revsons shoulder huddling close to him for warmth she was quite unaware of this even the guard bartlett almost certainly because kowalskis prowling figure was no longer there to keep him on the qui vive was much nearer sleep than wakefulness his head nodding on his chest only occasionally and with longer intervals in between jerking his head upright only revson his eyes closed was as awake and alert as a cat on a midnight prowl he nudged april and whispered in her ear she started awake and looked at him her eyes uncomprehending time to go he said softly it was almost dark inside the coach the only illumination coming from the dimmed light over the drivers seat and from the lights of the bridge itself give me the aerosol the what suddenly she was wide awake the white of the smudged eyesthe pupils could have been any colourhuge in the gloom of course she reached under her seat and brought up the aerosol can revson tucked it in his inside left coat pocket she said how long will you be with luck twenty minutes perhaps half an hour ill be back she kissed him lightly on the cheek please take care revson had no comment on this highly unnecessary advice move into the aisle quietly as you can he passed by her and moved silently forwards his white pen in his hand bartletts head was on his chest revson pressed the button at a distance of less than a foot and the needle lodged behind bartletts left ear revson eased him back until his head dangled over the back of his seat the drug apart from inducing unconsciousness had a temporarily paralysing effect so there seemed little enough likelihood that bartlett would slip off his seat april watched all this without any expression the only indication of her feelings was the tip of a tongue that sought to moisten dry lips there had to be a patrolling guard revson knew he had in fact seen him several times and he had to be taken care of he peered cautiously through the open drivers doorway a guard was indeed approaching coming up from the south walking a few feet wide of the coaches and carrying a shoulderslung machinecarbine revson thought he recognized him as johnson one of the helicopter pilots but couldnt be sure revson switched off bartletts dimmed light and remained where he was he had the aerosol can in his hand but at the last moment changed his mind and brought out the pen instead a person recovering from the effects of the knockout needles invariably awoke none the worse for his experience and usually assumed that he had just dropped off to sleep but as revson could tell from his own experience of that morning a person awakening from a gas knockout felt nauseated and thoroughly hungover and under no illusion at all that he had been anaesthetized in one way or another it didnt seem a good idea to have johnson report this to branson revson pressed the button and jumped down at the same instant to catch johnson before he keeled over on to the roadway less for humanitarian reasons than to prevent the metallic sound of the carbine striking the roadway he removed the needle from johnsons forehead hauled him as silently as possible inside the coach and jammed him in a very uncomfortable position in front of the drivers seat johnson was in no position to feel any discomfort and revson didnt want to risk the possibility of any passenger awakeninghighly unlikely though it seemed and finding an unconscious stranger lying in the aisle april wednesday had gone back to her liplicking revson emerged by the nearside front door in the bright lights of the bridge he might almost as well have stepped out into daylight he had no doubt that his activities were being carefully watched from both north and south shores through powerful night glasses but that was of no concern what mattered was that he was effectively shielded from the other two coaches though he seriously doubted whether there was anyone keeping watch in either or indeed whether anybody at all was awake in point of fact both van effen and chrysler were talking quietly to each other in the rear coach but it was impossible for them to see revson revson crossed the crash barrier pulled himself to the rail and peered down below all was total blackness the submarine could or could not have been there he just had to hope it was he descended and pulled die oilskin container from under the coach inside was the fishing line and a weighted lab sample canister weighted because the wind was still gusting and he had to be sure that the line descended reasonably vertically he cut off hooks and lures at the end of the fishing line and attached the canister to the line he eased the canister over the side and started unwinding the line from its square wooden framework after about thirty seconds of this he stopped held the line delicately between forefinger and thumb and waited for some sort of acknowledging tug there was none he lowered it another ten feet still no answering tug perhaps the submarine wasnt there perhaps the captain was finding it impossible to maintain position because of the tides and strong currents but then admiral newson had said that he knew just the very man who could do just that and k was unlikely that a man of newsons reputation would make any mistake revson lowered the line another ten feet then sighed aloud with relief when he felt two sharp tugs on the line twenty seconds later there came another two sharp tugs revson overhanded the line in with all possible speed when he estimated there were only a few feet of line left he leaned far out and pulled in at a much slower speed he had no wish to bang the radio however gently against the steelwork of the bridge finally he had it in his hand a waterproof bag with the line securely fixed round its neck he descended to the side of the bus to examine his catch he cut the securing line with his knife and peered inside there it was a tiny gleaming transistorized transceiver strange hour to go fishing revson van effen said behind him for a second no more revson remained immobilized he was holding the bag at chest level and his hand slid stealthily into his left inner pocket id like to see just what kind of fish one catches at night in the golden date turn round revson slow and easy im a nervous character and you know what that can do to trigger fingers revson turned round slow and easy in the manner of a man who knows all about nervous trigger fingers he already had the aerosol inside the bag he said resignedly well i suppose it was too good to last so branson was right all along van effen moonshaped face as expressionless as ever was between five and six feet away he had his machinepistol in both hands held loosely but with his forefinger indubitably on the trigger revson would have been a dead man before hed covered half the distance between them but van effen was clearly expecting no resistance lets see what you have there slow and easy now slow and easy slowly easily revson withdrew the aerosol it was so small that it was almost hidden in his hand he knew that the can was pressurized to three times the normal and that its effective range was ten feet or so ohare had told him and revson had a great deal of faith in ohare van effen shifted the gun under his right arm and pointed the barrel straight at revson let me see that slow and easy slow and easy revson stretched his arm out unhurriedly van effens face was no more than three feet away when he pressed the button he dropped the aerosol and snatched van effens machinepistol again he wished to obviate any metallic sounds he looked down at the crumpled figure at his feet he had come to form a certain regard for van effen both as a man and a professional but regrets were not in revsons line of business he retrieved the aerosol took the transceiver and pressed a switch revson here hagenbach revson lowered the volume this is a closed vhf line no possibility of interception none thank you for the radio i have a problem here one of disposal van effen caught me but i caught him gas he recognized me of course and cant remain on the bridge i could throw him into the golden gate but i dont want to hes done nothing to deserve anything like that he might even turn state evidence may i speak to the submarine captain please a new voice came through captain here commander pearson my congratulations captain and thank you for the radio you heard what i said to mr hagenbach yes would you be prepared to accept another passenger even although he is unconscious we aim to please would you have a line or rope aboard easy enough for me to haul up but strong enough to take a mans weight id need about five hundred feet goodness no wait ill i check there was a brief silence then pearsons voice came through again we have three thirtyfathom coils joined together that should be more than enough splendid ill send my cord down again moment please ill have to get a weight for it first he straphung the radio round his neck to leave his hands free and his eye lighted almost immediately on van effens machinepistol he secured the cord to the trigger guard and immediately began to lower away he spoke into the radio the lines on the way down its weighted with van effens machinepistol and the cord is tied to the triggerguard i mean i wouldnt like anyone to shoot themselves by accident the navy is accustomed to the handling of offensive weapons mr revson no offence captain when i get the rope up ill pass it over a rail and secure it to van effen double bowline round the thighs a turn round his waist and his hands tied behind his back so that the rope cant slip over his shoulders we have openings in the service for resourceful young men like you im afraid the age qualification cutoff lies far behind me when i have him ready can you have two or three of your men lower him down over the rail damned if im going to try myself as i said its my age you wouldnt believe how modernized todays navy is well use a winch revson said apologetically im just a landlubber we have your cord and gun and nobodys shot down anybody there was a brief pause haul away revson brought in the rope it looked hardly thicker than a clothesline but revson didnt doubt that pearson knew what he was about he trussed van effen in the manner hed described then dragged him to the edge he said into the radio ready to take the strain ready revson eased him over the edge for a moment van effen dangled there then disappeared downwards into the darkness the rope over the rail went slack and pearsons voice came over the radio we have him intact intact all for tonightf yes thank you for your cooperation revson wondered briefly what van effens reaction would be when he found himself in a submarine then spoke again into the radio mr hagenbach here you heard it all yes not a bad job hagenbach was not much given to showering fulsome congratulations on his subordinates ive been lucky the triggering mechanism for the explosives has been deactivated permanently good very good this from hagenbach was the equivalent to the roman tribute offered a highly successful general after hed conquered his second or third country in succession mayor morrison will be pleased to know this when he knows it i suggest that in a couple of hours time you douse the bridge lights again and effect entry into the east side south tower you have the men sir hand picked dont forget to tell them to remove the detonators on the explosives just precautionary you know ha hagenbachs deflation was like a snowflake in the river of course and another thought before you cut the lights you might use the laser on their southfacing searchlight we will my boy we will please dont contact me at any time i might be carrying the radio on me and might be in a very awkward position such as talking to branson when the callup buzzer goes off well keep a permanent listening watch for you hagenbach looked round his colleagues his face almost broke into a smile but he just managed to keep his record intact he looked at each one in turn trying to conceal his complacency but not trying too hard then finally directed his attention towards the vicepresident mad was the word you used sir quite mad richards took it very well well perhaps a divine sort of madness deactivating that triggering device is a major step forward in itself if only as you say morrison knew there do appear to be no limits to his resourcefulness quarry said the right man in the right place at the right time if ever there was but it still doesnt solve the central problem of the plight of our hostages i wouldnt worry hagenbach leaned back comfortably in his chair revson will think of something eleven the only thing revson was thinking about was how very pleasant it would be to have a few hours blissful sleep hed dragged an already stirring johnson from his cramped position in front of the drivers seat and propped him on the second step of the coach entrance head and shoulders resting more or less comfortably against the handrail a minute or two revson thought and he would come to even bartlett was beginning to stir restlessly in his drugged sleep different people reacted widely in the length of time it took them to recover from the effect of the knockout needles johnson and bartlett appeared to have very similar reaction times revson moved silently down the aisle april wednesday was wide awake she swung out to let him pass to the inside seat then sat again before removing his soaking coat and dumping it on the floor he passed her the aerosol she stooped and thrust it in the bottom of her carryall she whispered i didnt think id see you again how did it go well enough what happened you want to know really she thought and shook her head there were still visions of thumbscrews in her head instead she said softly whats that round your neck good god from sleepiness revson was jerked into immediate wideawakeness the little transceiver still dangled from his neck what a sight for a roving branson he lifted the transceiver from his neck undipped the straps picked up his camera and inserted the radio in its base she said whats that just a teenyweeny hand camera its not its a radio call it what you like where did you get it from i mean this coach everything has been searched from top to bottom from a passing friend i have friends everywhere you may well have saved my life there i could kiss you for it well when it came to kissing she was nowhere near as fragile as she looked revson said that was the nicest part of the whole evening of the whole day of a whole lot of days some day some time when we get off this damned bridge we must try that again why not now youre a brazen he caught her arm and nodded somewhere up front someone was stirring it was johnson he rose to his feet with surprising quickness and looked up and down the bridge revson could just picture what was going on in his mind his last recollection would have been of seeing the steps of the lead coach and his natural assumption would be that he had just sat down for a moment to rest one thing was for sure he would never admit to branson that hed slept for even a second he stepped into the bus and prodded bartlett with the muzzle of his machinegun bartlett started awake and stared at him you asleep johnson demanded me asleep bartlett was amazed indignant cant a man rest his eyes for a moment without having accusations like that thrown at him just see that you dont rest them for too long johnsons voice was coldly selfrighteous he descended the steps and walked away revson murmured to april i was sleepy but im not now but i not only want to appear to be asleep i want to be asleep if any turmoil breaks out in the very near future which i strongly suspect might happen dont happen to have any sleeping tablets on you do you why on earth should i this was supposed to be a day trip remember i remember he sighed well theres nothing else for it give me the aerosol can why because i want to take just the tiniest whiff of it then take the can from my hand and tuck it away again she hesitated remember this dinner those lots of dinnersim going to take you to just as soon as we get ashore i dont remember anything of the kind well remember it now but i cant very well take you if im at the bottom of the golden gate can i she shuddered and reached reluctantly into her carryall in the rear coach chrysler put his hand on bransons shoulder and shook him gently branson despite what must have been his exhaustion was immediately awake immediately alert trouble i dont know im worried mr branson van effen left here just he said to make a normal check on things he hasnt come back how long ago was that half an hour sir god chrysler why didnt you wake me before now two things i knew you needed sleep and we all depend on you and if ever i knew a man who could take care of himself its van effen he was carrying his machinepistol have you ever seen him without it since we came on this bridge branson rose from his seat picked up his own gun and said come with me did you see which way he went north they walked to the presidential coach peters the guard was sitting sideways in the drivers seat smoking he turned quickly as a gentle tap came on the door removed a key from an inner pocket and turned it in the lock branson opened the door from the outside and said quietly have you seen any signs of van effen he could in fact have raised his voice a couple of dozen decibels and it would have made no difference when it comes to the terms of stertorous snoring presidents royalty generals mayors and assorted government ministers are no different from the common run of mankind yes mr branson must have been about half an hour ago i saw him walk towards the nearest rest room there did you see him come out again no quite frankly i wasnt looking outside i dont bother much my job is to see that none of those gentlemen makes for the communications desk or rushes me and takes away my gun and key i dont much fancy having my own gun pointed at my own head i keep my eyes for what goes on inside this coach not what goes on outside it and right you are no reflections on you peters branson closed the door and heard the key turn in the lock they made for the nearest rest room a very brief search indicated that it was empty so was the other rest room they made their way to the ambulance branson opened the rear door used a small torch to locate a switch and flooded the ambulance with light a shirtsleeved ohare covered with a single blanket was sound asleep on the sidehinged cot branson shook him awake it took some shaking ohare opened the rather bleary eyes winced at the bright overhead light looked at the two men then at his watch quarter to one i what the hell do you want at this time of the morning van effens missing have you seen him no i havent seen him ohare showed a faint stirring of what could have been professional interest was he sick or something no then why bother me perhaps ohare said hopefully hes fallen over the side branson studied the doctor briefly ohares eyes were slightly puffy but branson was experienced enough to realize that it was the puffiness of sleepiness not of sleeplessness he gestured chrysler to leave followed switched out the light and closed the door behind him johnson machinegun slung was walking towards them he came up to them stopped and said evening mr branson morning rather have you seen van effen van effen when inside the past half hour johnson shook his head positively definitely not but he was out on the bridge you were on the bridge if he was here then you must have sorry no its possible he was and possible that i didnt see him i walk to and fro all the timeits the best way of keeping awake i dont keep glancing over my shoulder all the time johnson thought or appeared to think he may have been on the bridge but he may have left it by that i mean he may for reasons best known to himself have chosen to walk on the other side of the buses why should he do that how should i know maybe he wanted to keep in concealment maybe anything how should i know what goes on in van effens mind true branson had no particular wish to antagonize johnson who apart from being an exnaval officer was a highly experienced helicopter pilot and an essential part of his escape plans he said mildly i just suggest that you stand in the middle here and look around from time to time youre hardly likely to go to sleep on your feetyoure due for relief in fifteen minutes he and chrysler made their way towards the lead coach there was a halfdimmed light up front and they could see the glow of bartletts cigar branson said well at least all the guards seem to be on the alertwhich makes it all the more difficult to understand van effens disappearance bartlett said briskly morning mr branson making your rounds alls well here have you seen van effen in the past half hour no you cant find him lets say hes missing bartlett thought i wont ask stupid questions like how can he be missing who saw him last peters not that that helps anybody left this coach in the past half hour nobodys left this coach since we came in after the fire branson walked back to revsons seat april wednesday was wide awake revson eyes closed was breathing deeply heavily branson shone the torch in his eyes there was no reaction branson lifted an eyelid there was no involuntary twitching or muscular resistance in the eyelid which is invariable when the eyelid of a conscious person is raised branson concentrated his beam on one eye a rather glazed eye looked out unseeingly unblinkingly branson dropped the eyelid branson said out like a light thats for sure if there was disappointment in his voice he concealed it well how long have you been awake miss wednesday i havent been to sleep maybe i shouldnt have come back to the bridge she smiled tremulously im just a cowardlycustard mr branson i hate thunderstorms im not going to hurt you miss wednesday he reached out a hand and ran a finger gently across her lips while she looked at him in perplexity her lips were as dry as dust branson remembered ohares summing up of her emotional and nervous stability or lack of it you we scared he smiled and patted her shoulder not to worry the storms almost passed away he left she was scared hut not for the reasons given shed been terrified that branson would try to shake or even slap revson awake and find it impossible to arouse him twenty minutes later branson and chrysler stood by the doorway of the rear coach chrysler said theres no way he can be on the bridge mr branson i agree let me hear you think aloud chrysler chrysler made a deprecating gesture im a follower not a leader nevertheless ill try i can speak freely branson nodded first van effen didnt jump not only is he the last person id ever associate with suicide but he was also only days away from a sevenfigure fortune he didnt defect you said i could speak freely again he stood to lose a fortune he was totally loyal and to defect hed have had to walk two thousand feet towards either tower and johnson couldnt have missed that so hes met with an accident youre sure it couldnt have been the doctor positive and it wasnt revson the only other person i could think of is general cartland he could be dangerous but peters chrysler broke off and thought you know mr branson i dont think this would have happened if kowalski had been on the prowl tonight he paused im beginning to wonder if kowalskis accident really was an accident i have wondered your conclusions chrysler somewhere in this barrel theres another rotten apple it could be one of us a disquieting thought but one that has to be considered although why anyone should throw away a fortune maybe the government some way some how has promised someone to double their cut if this is just idle speculation bransons creased brow gave the lie to his words suspecting everyone in sight only leads to hysteria and hysterics is one thing we cant afford and your final conclusion on van effen the same as yours hes at the bottom of the golden gate van effen was in fact seated in the communications wagon ashore hageabach and hendrix were seated across the table from him two policemen with drawn guns stood by the doorway van effen wasnt quite his usual expressionless self he looked slightly dazed whether from the shock of finding himself in the predicament he was in or because he was still suffering from the aftereffects of the gassing was difficult to say van effen said so i underestimated revson when you get up to san quentin youll find quite a few others who will endorse your views hagenbach looked at van effen speaking of san quentin you appreciate you cant hope for less than ten years with no hope of remission theres an occupational hazard in every job there doesnt have to be i dont understand you we can do a deal no deal youve nothing to lose and a great deal to gain ten years of your life to be precise no deal hagenbach sighed i rather thought that might be your attitude admirable but misguided he looked at hendrix you would agree hendrix said to the policemen handcuff him and take him to the maximum security wing of the military hospital tell the doctors that mr hagenbach will be along in a few minutes make sure the recorders are working van effen said hospital recorders you mean drugs if you wont cooperate with us well just have to settle for your unwilling cooperation unconscious cooperation if you wish van effen cracked his moon face in an almost contemptuous smile you know that no court will accept a confession made under duress we dont need any confession from you we already have enough on you to put you away for as long as we wish we just want a little helpful information from you a judicious mixture of sodium pentothal and a few other choice herbs will make you sing like a lark thats as maybe the contempt was still in van effens face even you have to obey the law of the land lawmen who extract information by illegal means are subject to automatic prosecution and automatic imprisonment hagenbach was almost genial dear me dear me i thought even you van effen would have heard of a presidential pardon or have you forgotten that you kidnapped a president at ten minutes to three that morning an air force lieutenant on the south shore twirled two knobs on a highly sophisticated piece of equipment until the crosshairs on his ultraviolet telescopic sights were lined up dead centre on the centre of bransons southernfacing searchlight he jabbed a button just once at five minutes to three three men climbed into a strangelyshaped lowslung vehicle which was concealed from the bridge by the communications truck a rather nondescript individual in a grey coat climbed behind the wheel while the other two sat in the back seat they were clad in grey overalls and looked curiously alike their names were carmody and rogers they were both in their midthirties and looked tough and competent in a rather gentlemanly way whether they were gentlemen or not was not known whether they were tough and competent was beyond dispute they didnt look like explosives experts but they were that too both carried pistols and both carried silencers for those pistols carmody carried a canvas bag containing a toolkit two aerosol gas cans a ball of heavy cord adhesive tape and a torch rogers had a similar bag with a walkietalkie thermos and sandwiches they were obviously wellequipped for whatever task they had in mind and prepared for a stay of some duration at three oclock all the lights on the golden gate bridge and the adjacent parts of the city blacked out the man in the grey coat started up his flat truck and the electric vehicle whirred almost silently towards the south tower the duty policeman picked up the phone in the communications wagon it was branson and he wasnt in a jovial mood hendrix the chief is not here then get him if you could tell me what the matter the bridge lights have gone again get him the policeman laid down his phone and walked to the rear of the wagon hendrix sat on a stool by the open door a walkietalkie in his hand a cup of coffee in the other the walkietalkie crackled carmody here chief were inside the tower and hopkins is halfway back with the electric cart already thank you hendrix put down the walkietalkie branson a mite anxious hendrix finished off his coffee in a leisurely fashion crossed the wagon picked up the phone and yawned i was asleep dont tell me the lights are out again weve been having blackouts all over the city tonight hold on in the presidential coach branson held on chrysler came running down the aisle the president looked at him wearily the oil barons snored steadily on branson phone still in hand looked round chrysler said quickly south searchlight is out of action its not possible bransons face was beginning to show deeper lines of strain whats wrong god knows its black out there generator seems fine then run for the north one and turn it round no wait hendrix was on the phone one minute you say he turned to chrysler forget it the lights are coming on again branson spoke into the phone again dont forget i want quarry on this phone at seven sharp branson replaced the phone and walked up the aisle the president stopped him when is this nightmare going to stop thats up to your government ive no doubt the government will accede to your requests you interest me branson you interest all of us here why this bitter grudge against society branson smiled his empty smile society i can take or leave then why the grudge against me why the public humiliation youve been invariably polite to everyone else isnt it enough to hold the nation to ransom without making a fool of me at the same time branson made no answer you dont like my politics perhaps politics bore me i was speaking to hendrix today he tells me your father is an extremely wealthy banker back east a multimillionaire you envy a man whos made it to the very top you couldnt wait to inherit his bank and his millions so you took the only other course open to you crime and you havent made it and you havent had recognitionexcept that of a few top policemen so youre a failure so you bear a grudge so you take it out symbolically on americas leading citizen branson said wearily you mr president are a lousy diagnostician and an even lousier psychiatrist okay okay insults again but this is private you may fear no more the lash of my tongue but to think that your decisions can affect over two hundred million americans what do you mean its how wrong you can get branson senior that model of integrity and propriety is a doubledyed bastard he was also and still isa doubledyed crook a renowned investment banker you understand but it didnt do his investors much good they were mainly people of modest means i at least rob wealthy institutions i found this out when i worked in his bank i wouldnt have taken a lousy dollar from him i didnt even give him the pleasure of disinheriting me i just told him what i thought of him and his lousy bank and walked out as for recognition who wants it you certainly achieved more in the past eighteen hours than your father did in a lifetime the president was understandably sour thats notoriety who wants that either and for money already am a multimillionaire and still you want more my motives are my business sorry to have interrupted your sleep sir branson left muir in the next armchair said now that was rather peculiar so you werent asleep one hates to interrupt the branson in the still watches of the night is not the branson of the daylight hours forthcoming one might almost say polite almost as if he was seeking for some kind of selfjustification but obviously bitter as hell about something if he doesnt want recognition and doesnt need the money then what the hell are we doing stuck out on this damned bridge ssh mayor morrison might hear you i dont know with your permission mr president im going back to sleep when carmody and rogers reached the top of the south tower and stepped outside the lift carmody reached an arm in pressed a button and withdrew his arm as the door began to close both men stepped outside and gazed down silently at the darkened and barely visible bridge some five hundred feet below them after a minute carmody withdrew the walkietalkie from his canvas bag extended the aerial and said you can cut the power now the lifts been down for thirty seconds he replaced the walkietalkie and removed his overalls over his purposelychosen dark shirt he wore a leather harness with a heavy steel buckle at the back a nylon rope spliced to the buckle was wound several times round his waist he was in the process of unwinding this when the bridge lights and the aircraft warning lights on top of the towers came on again carmody said a chance of our being spotted you think thinking of the aircraft lights carmody nodded no chance not from their angle and i understand their south searchlight isnt working too well carmody unwound the rest of the rope and passed the end to rogers a couple of turns if you would charles then hang on real good depend on it if you take a dive that means ill have to disarm the damned thing myselfwith no one to hold me we should get danger money for this youre a disgrace to the army bomb disposal squad carmody sighed moved out on to the giant cable and began to remove the detonators from the explosives it was sixthirty in the morning when revson stirred and woke he looked at april and saw that her green eyes were on his there were heavy shadows under her eyes and her normally pale skin was now even more unnaturally so he said you dont look to me as if youve rested any too well i didnt sleep all night what with me here to look after you its not me im worried about its you he said nothing do you feel hungover after youryour sleeping pill no guess i must have slipped into a natural sleep that all you worried about no branson was here just before one oclock he examined your eyes with a torch to see if you were still asleep no sense of privacy that man youd think i think hes again cast you in the role of prime suspect suspected of what van effens missing is he now you dont seem much concerned whats van effen to me or me to van effen no more alarms during the night at three oclock the bridge lights went off again ah nothing surprises you much does it why should the lights going out surprise me could have been a dozen reasons for it i think the reason is sitting right by me i was asleep you werent asleep when you were out on the bridge at midnight ill bet your new little ah camera wasnt all that inactive either she leaned towards him her eyes moving from one of his to the other you didnt by any chance just happen to kill van effen last night what do you think i am a murderer for hire i dont know what to think you will not have forgotten that i heard the contents of the message you sent when i was taken to the hospital i remember the exact words only branson and van effen are natural leaders those two i could kill i did say that i didnt kill van effen last night my life on it van effen in my opinion is alive and well if not exactly flourishing thats not what branson thinks how should you know that after bartlett left was relieved bartlett didnt mention to branson that he might just possibly have dozed off for a moment what do you think okay so he was alert and watchful as all hell and then and then thisthis gorilla came on revson looked at the new guard hirsute incredibly beetlebrowed with a negligible clearance between brows and hairline aprils description didnt flatter gorillas any yonnie revson said bransons mobile thinktank chrysler came by more than once i heard him saying to that man that he and branson knew that van effen was at the bottom of the golden gate im looking forward to seeing his face when he finds out just possibly for the first time in his life how wrong he can be you dont want to tell me no neither do you you seem very sure of yourself about that yes can you make an end to all this that im afraid is another matter he thought and smiled if i try very hard can i take you out for dinner tonight tonight you heard you can take me to timbuktu if you want hussies you can always tell them the phone callup in the communications centre in the presidential coach buzzed at exactly seven oclock branson picked it up yes quarry here we have acceded to your preposterous demands and made the necessary arrangements were waiting to hear from your contact in new york waiting to hearyou should have heard two hours ago quarry said wearily were waiting to hear from him again when did he call as you said two hours ago hes making some arrangements with what he calls european friends he was to have given you a password he did hardly original i thought peter branson branson smiled broadly and replaced the receiver he was still smiling when he stepped out into the early morning sunlight chrysler was there and he wasnt smiling at all chrysler was exhausted hed temporarily taken over the roles of both van effen and kowalski but the reason for his worry lay elsewhere branson said money side is all fixed up thats splendid mr branson bransons smile disappeared you seem less than overjoyed there are a couple of things id like to show you chrysler led them to the southfacing searchlight you probably know that a searchlight is not like an ordinary torch or flashlight i mean it doesnt use lamps it comes from an electric arm that jumps between two electrodes something like the sparking plug in a car except that there the spark is intermittent here the arc is continuous look at the electrode on the left branson looked it looks as if its been melted or bent or something like that and one must assume that those electrodes are designed to withstand the tremendous heat generated by the arc precisely and something you havent seen this tiny hole here in the glass what are you trying to tell me chrysler theres something else chrysler walking slowly back with branson pointed to the roof of the rear coach the radiowave scanner its kaput knocked out since we checked and doublechecked that there are no transceivers apart from ours on the bridge we havent bothered using it i just happened to check by accident this morning i went up and had a look theres a scorch mark on the base of the revolving spindle could have been caused by lightning both cases after all id knows there was plenty of it around last night i would point out mr branson that neither the radiowave scanner or the searchlight are earthed both are mounted on rubber wheels the scanner chrysler said patiently the coachs rubber wheels then what i think theyre using a laser beam on us even at that early hour all seven of the decisionmakers ashore were gathered round the table in the communications wagon when the phone rang the duty policeman picked it up branson here get me general carter he cant be far away hang on please the policeman covered the mouthpiece its branson for you general switch on the speaker so that we can all hear what he has to say tell him ive just come in the general has just arrived carter took the phone branson carter use that laser beam on us just once again and well throw say mr muir over the side for starters the other six at the table looked at one another with quick apprehension and possibly the relieved thought in their minds that it was carter who had to field this one explain yourself one of our searchlights and radiowave scanner have been knocked out all signs point to a laser beam youre a fool there was a brief silence branson clearly had been taken momentarily aback then he said muir wont think so when hes on his way down to the golden gate i repeat youre a fool and if you can listen ill tell you why in the first place youre not an expert and wouldnt recognize the signs of laser damage if it was on your breakfast plate in the second place there are no such units in the bay areaif there were id be the first person to know in the third place if we had laser beams we could have picked off every one of your villains as they walked about the bridge or dont you know how accurate and deadly a laser beam is with the proper telescopic sights you can puncture a football at ten thousand yards you seem to know a suspiciously great deal about lasers general it was a negative remark and branson could have been either thinking or stalling for time i dont deny it ive been trained in them i even helped in the development of them every general has his own trade or speciality general cartland is an explosives expert im an electronics engineer where was i yes in the fourth place we could have immobilized your helicopters without your knowing anything about it you tried to take off youre putting ideas into my head branson lastly the probable cause was an electrical discharge lightning neither the searchlight nor scanner was earthed theyre mounted on rubber wheels carter let irritation creep into his voice id stick to robbing banks if i were you you dont have to be earthed to be struck by lightning it happens to planes hundreds of times a year at altitudes up to twentyfive thousand feet would you call those earthed lightning has also quite an affinity for metal he paused of course you have a generator for your searchlight almost certainly a petrol generator and as you wouldnt want to be asphyxiated by carbon monoxide fumes you wouldnt have it inside a coach tell me do you also use the generator to recharge your coach batteries through a transformer i mean there was the barest pause then branson said yes carter sighed must i do all the thinking for you branson there you have a massive great lump of metal solidly earthed to the roadway and directly connected to both searchlight and scanner what a target for any wandering lightning flash would there be anything more yes pass the word that i want the tv cameras in position and ready at nine am carter hung up richards said approvingly quite a performance for the crack of dawn takes more than a few stars to make a general i suppose i have a feeling that our branson must be feeling more than a little harried by this time and when shall we be giving our own tv performance hagenbach said directly after bransons i should think ninethirtyish moment of maximum psychological impact and all that sort of thing as our ah anchorman you have your lines ready hagenbach didnt deign to reply branson said well you go along with that carters no fool thats sure chrysler was uncertain but if it were lightning transmitted through the generator why didnt it just jump from one electrode to the next instead of making a hole in the searchlight glass i mean where was it going im afraid its not my field im beginning to think its not mine either but im damned sure theres something fishy afoot he hesitated maybe i wasnt so bright with that one but ive another idea mr branson ideas are what i need myself im fresh out of them coming from branson chrysler thought that was quite a remarkable statement i do my best but im no van effen besides i feel just about all in even you cant keep going twentyfour hours a day you need a new lieutenant not to say a fresh oneand with respects to my colleagues well out with it now that our men are in possession of the mount tamalpais radar stations i think parker is quite capable of looking after things himself i suggest you send a chopper to bring in giscard you know him even better than i do hes tough hes a leader hes resourceful he doesnt panic and in some ways hes very astute by that i mean all respects to you mr branson hes never seen the inside of a courtroom it would take a helluva load off your back youre quite right of course if i didnt need a break i should have thought of that myself get hold of either johnson or bradleyno bradley johnson had guard duty tell him to move right away ill get on the phone and tell giscard ill also warn our friends ashore whats going to happen to them if they try to interfere not that they should need telling by now branson made his calls winced at the clattering roar as the sikorsky lifted cleanly off the bridge and headed north at least carter had been telling the truth about one thing the helicopter hadnt been subjected to the attentions of a laser beam revson said to april i dont want to sound indelicate but wouldnt you like to pay a visit to the ladies ah powder room she stared at him what on earth for oh well youll have a reason yes just repeat this after me she repeated it four times then said is that all yes once would have been enough well you never know what the helps like these days why cant you do it yourself its urgent and i want it done now there are four ladies aboard this bridge and at least fifty men your chances of privacy and seclusion are all that higher and what are you going to do you look pretty scruffy to me to rephrase the old song ive left my razor in san francisco then breakfast the wagons due at seventhirty i wish i had an appetite she rose and spoke briefly to yonnie who bared his teeth in a fearful grimace that he probably regarded as being a charmingly graceful assent the transistor in front of hagenbach buzzed he pulled it towards him and raised the volume the other six men bent forward in eager expectancy this call could be from only one source they were wrong mr hagenbach a feminine voice speaking april wednesday hagenbach took it with remarkable aplomb carry on my dear mr revson wants to know as soon as possible if its possible to reduce the last resort to a nonlethal level he wants you to have as much time as possible to try thats why im calling now ill try i cant guarantee he says to lay down a pattern of smoke bombs one minute before he says hell radio you one minute before that and i want to talk to revson just as urgently why isnt he doing this himself because im in the ladies toilets somebodys coming the voice trailed away in a whisper and the transceiver went dead hagenbach called to the communication desk the armoury emergency general carter im going to need your help on this one the ladies toilet quarry said unbelievingly are there no depths to which this man of yours wont descend be reasonable you didnt expect him to be there himself knowing revson i rate that an a for gentlemanly conduct vicepresident richards spoke slowly and distinctly up in the hospital you told us that you didnt know what the last resort was hagenbach looked at him coldly vicepresidents should know better no one has ever become the head of the fbi without being a master of prevarication breakfast arrived on midbridge at seventhirty branson passed it up which in view of the shock awaiting his nervous system was perhaps as well at sevenfortyfive bradley made a perfect touchdown in his sikorsky giscard grimfaced and purposeful stepped down on to the bridge not oddly enough looking at all incongruous in his police sergeants uniform he probably had more photographs taken of him in the next five minutes than hed had in the whole of his previous existencewhich would not have been difficult giscard as a purely professional safeguard made it his business never to have his photograph taken but even the redoubtable giscard had come too late at eight oclock an already troubled bransonno hint of concern showed in his composed and confident face received his first and far from faint intimations of mortality branson was deep in conversation with a fresh and confident giscard when reston duty guard on the presidential coach came hurrying up phone mr branson giscard said ill take care of things mr branson you try to get some rest he touched him lightly on the shoulder theres nothing to worry about giscard had no means of knowing it but it was the most wayout prophecy hed ever made or would ever be likely to make again it was hagenbach on the phone he said ive bad news for you branson kyronis doesnt want to see you not now not ever who branson saw the marbled knuckles on the hand holding the phone and made a conscious effort to relax kyronis the president of that caribbean island paradise of yours im afraid youre not welcome i dont know what your talking about im afraid you do and im afraid your worldwide publicity campaign has scared the poor man out of his wits we didnt find him he called us hes on the international line right now shall i patch him in branson didnt say whether he should patch him in or not a highpitched voice with a pronounced caribbean accent came to his ear you fool branson you madman you widemouthed boaster you had to tell the world that you were going to the caribbean you had to tell the world that it had a prison stockade in one corner you had to tell the world that it had no extradition treaty with the united states you damn fool how long do you think it would take american intelligence to piece that together i called them before they came calling on me their fleet has already moved out from their guantanamo base in cuba their cs are lined up on the runways in fort lauderdale with god knows how many paratroopers and marines standing by they could take our little principality over in ten minutes and your vicepresident has assured me that they would consider it a pleasure kyronis stopped to take what appeared to be his first breath since he started his tirade branson said nothing megalomania branson megalomania i always warned you it was the one thing that could bring you down sheer bloody megalomania branson hung up the phone twelve giscard took the news with remarkable aplomb so kyronis has ratted on us its not the end of the world and i dont see that it changes a single thing i think this is just part of a war of nerves attrition you know psychological warfare okay so youve been here what is it twentythree hours and i dont know what the strains have been like but im sure of this with no other way of getting at you theyre trying to pressurize you into making a mistake its kind of like a poker game but with no cards in theirhands all they can do is bluff giscard nodded to the presidential coach whats bluff when you hold all the cards in your hands there speaks the voice of reason is that it branson smiled you forget that i know kyroniss voice sure you do i dont doubt it was kyronis i also dont doubt that the government through some fast checking by the cia or the fbi got to him first what makes you think that because kyronis has your vhf number he could have radioed you direct instead of causing all this hullabaloo but that wouldnt have suited our friends department of psychological warfare and ive had an idea mr branson chrysler had shed much of his weariness since giscards arrival who needs kyronis the presidential boeing can reach half a dozen countries anywhere in the world that have no extradition treaty with the usa a dozen for all i know but theres no need to go further than the caribbean youve been thinking big all along mr branson nows the time to keep on thinking big branson rubbed his forehead think big aloud someone has to this morning havana theres no extradition treaty with them sure theres an agreement to repatriate hijackers but no ones going to return the hijacker of the presidential boeing especially if the president has a pistol to his head okay so the us is prepared to take over kyroniss tiny islet cuba is a vastly different proposition castro has a firstclass army airforce and navy any attempt to get the president out would lead to nothing short of fullscale war and dont forget that castro is moscows blueeyed boy an armed invasion of cuba would bring a violent reaction and i dont think the us would be prepared to risk an eyeballtoeyeball nuclear confrontation over a miserable half billion dollars branson nodded slowly curiously enough that was where van effen wanted to go and for much the same reasons and cant you see how castro would just love it hed go on tv and weep and wail and wring his hands and say how much hed love to be of help but his hands are hopelessly tied then when the cameras are switched off he falls about the place laughing branson said gentlemen you have restored my faith in human nature at least my own nature havana it is now our next show is at nine all the tackle and explosives as before peters can drive the electric truck as before bartlett and boyard fixed the last lot lets give reston and harrison a go branson smiled they think theyre better than bartlett and boyard and should have had the privilege of the first attempt see they carry walkietalkies which reminds me chrysler i want to be in a position where i can lay hands on a telephone wherever i happen to be i dont want to have to keep running to the presidents coach i just want a direct line to hagenbach and company you can fix one up in our coach id have to go through the local exchange so what by all means tell them to keep the line permanently open i want a lead to where ill be sitting when the tv is on and can you get a radiotelephone link from the lead helicopter turn a knob is all whats that for mr branson were going to need it some time better sooner than never it was another glorious morning of blue and gold a cloudless sky a fairytale setting which achieved the impossible of making even the grim fortress of alcatraz into an islet of shimmering beauty as on the previous day a low deep bank of fog was approaching from the west out of all three coaches there was only one person who was not savouring the delights of the morning or in the case of bransons men on duty revson sat in his seat elbow on the window ledge hand cupped to his cheeks so that no one could see his lips moving hagenbach said turn the volume down put the transceiver to your ear impossible my head and shoulders are above window level i can bend down for a few seconds but be quick revsons camera was upside down on his knees the transceiver nestling in the opened recess he turned down the volume and put his head low after about fifteen seconds he straightened and looked carelessly around nobody was paying any attention to him he turned up the volume well hagenbachs voice was querulous arent you surprised not all that much are you going to tell him remember you dont give any signal to go im all through at this end ill remember how about the cubs the experts arent all that happy about the prospects then use a few of them only and make up for the rest in gas bombs are you in touch with the two men at the top of the tower carmody and rogers yes tell them if they nab anyone to take them down to the pier of the tower why look im exposed is the admiral there hagenbach refrained from questions though it must have cost him a considerable effort newson came through revson said do you have any small quiet boats sir electrically powered ideally in abundance when the fog comes in do you think you could get one alongside the pier of the south tower consider it done with a breeches buoy pistol and suitable ropes no problem thank you sir mr hagenbach yes secretive bastard arent you yes sir the laser unit is ready for action ah good would you have it lined up on the drive shaft of the rotor of the lead helicopter thats to say the one furthest from you have it locked in position so that it can tut its target even through dense smoke why on earth somebody coming revson looked around there was nobody coming but hed no desire to bandy words with hagenbach he clipped the base of the camera slung it over his shoulder and left the coach a bit of trouble sir chrysler handed a walkietalkie to branson reston here mr branson reston and harrison had set off less than ten minutes earlier for the south pier the lift is out of order damn wait branson looked at his watch eight twentyfive his performance was due to start at nine he crossed to the rear coach where chrysler had already obtained a direct line to the communications centre ashore branson here hendrix dont tell me what youre after i know i was speaking to the bridge commissioners a few moments ago they tell me that the breaker for the tower lifts was burnt out during the night why isnt it repaired theyve been working on it for three hours and how much longer half an hour perhaps an hour they cant be certain call me the moment its fixed he returned to his walkietalkie sorry youll have to climb the lifts being repaired there was a silence then reston said jesus all that way all that way its not everest should be straightforward and you have your manual he laid down the walkietalkie and said to giscard i dont envy them myself another psychological pinprick could be but after a night like last night well revson joined ohare by the west barrier he said without preamble how hermetic is the rear door of your ambulance ohare had ceased to be surprised at anything revson said why say oxygen were to be abstracted from the inside how would you get on weve oxygen bottles of course not to mention the oxygen in the cardiac unit you may need it ever heard of cubs short for cluster bomb units ohare shook his head well theres liable to be a few around in the next hours this morning i shouldnt be surprised they are lethal asphyxiation bombs one of the more delightful of the recent advances in weaponry they suck the oxygen from the air and leave not a mark on the victims you should know but well its far fetched a pity you couldnt ask the hundreds who died at xuan loc because of them the cambodian government made frequent use of them in southeast asia the bombs i regret to say were supplied then by the united states navy this classified information no hanoi made plenty of noise about it at the time and youre going to use those bombs yes im trying to have them denatured you know their lethal potential lessened at least the experts are can they do it theres a certain lack of optimism who thought this one up you revson nodded just once you revson are a coldblooded bastard hasnt it occurred to you that the innocent will suffer maybe die as well as the guilty not for the first time i repeat that all doctors should be given an intelligence test before theyre allowed to practise the innocent will not suffer the innocent will be in their coaches and because its going to be hot theyll have the airconditioning on that means closed doors and the recirculation of cleaned used air when you see the first smoke bomb drop make for cover revson walked away and touched grafton on the arm may i have a word with you grafton hesitated shook his head in puzzlement then followed when he judged they were out of earshot of the nearest person revson stopped grafton said do we have to take a walk to talk in this case yes we havent been introduced youre mr grafton of up doyen of the newsmen on this bridge if you want to flatter me yes and youre mr revson foodtaster to royalty just a sideline with me you have another business dont tell me grafton regarded him with cool grey judicial eyes federal bureau of investigation thank you for sparing me the trouble of convincing you im glad your names not branson general cartland said if you cant have those cubs denatured as you call it some local funeral parlour is in for a brisk bit of business you prepared to use that cyanide pistol touche several minutes before nine branson had his usual stage set he seemed as calm and relaxed as ever the only change in his normal behaviour being that he had been polite almost deferential in his seating of the president at nine oclock the cameras began to turn at nine oclock too reston and harrison sweating profusely and complaining bitterly of the pain in their legs reached the top of their last ladder rogers eyeing them over his silenced pistol said sympathetically you must be exhausted after your long climb gentlemen giscard whispered in bransons ear you better get on with it mr branson looks as if that fog is coming in just about bridge level branson nodded then carried on speaking into the microphone so im sure you will be all as delighted as i am to know that the government has acceded to our very reasonable requests however we receive final confirmation we feel we might as well pass our time profitably and instruct and entertain you at the same time in showbusiness jargon there will be repeat performances at eleven and one oclock i really do urge you to watch those you will certainly never see other performances like them in your lives as before you can see the electric truck with its explosives and equipment leaving for the south tower now if we can have the zoom camera we shall be seeing two of my colleagues appearing on top of the south tower the zoom camera obliged hut the top of the tower was bereft of any sign of life a minute later it was still bereft branson said easily there seems to be a slight holdup a temporary delay please dont go away he was smiling the confident smile of one who knew that not one of his millions of watchers would have dreamed of going away when the phone on the road beside his chair rang branson smiled at the unseen millions said excuse me covered the microphone with his hand and picked up the phone hendrix here lifts fixed now you tell me do you know how long it should take a man to climb up to the top dont tell me your men haverather are trying to climb to the top they must be mad you must be mad to have sent them they have a manual what manual a copy of the original then they can be lost for days because of internal changes that manual was scrapped twenty years ago they can be lost all day in there branson replaced the phone still covering the microphone he said to giscard lifts working get bartlett and boyard here at the double tell them not to forget the weight he spoke into the microphone again sorry viewers a slight hitch the viewers spent the next ten minutes being rewarded with a variety of panoramic shots of the golden gate and the marvellous surrounding scenery with branson giving an occasional commentary after ten minutes he said right south tower again bartlett and boyard were there hands held high in salute then along with peters they repeated their previous days performance and had the second strap of explosives alongside the first in a remarkably short space of time bartlett and boyard waved again and disappeared inside the tower rogers eyed them over his silenced pistol you really are experts what a pity now youve put us to the trouble of having to remove a second set of detonators the phone by branson rang as he was delivering a farewell speech to the camera he picked it up hagenbach here sorry to have to cut in and cut you off but we have our own little show to watch youre off the air now and your viewers are now seeing and watching us same channel weve just watched your splendid production now perhaps youd like to watch our little show the screens picture changed to a closeup of hagenbach to san franciscans at least his background was unquestionably that of the presidio hagenbach said there seems little we can do to prevent this criminal branson from achieving his criminal ends but from all this some good might yet come i give you mr richards the vicepresident of the united states richards made an imposing figure at the microphone a convivial and highly articulate man at the best of times years of dominating conferences and campaigning across the nation had honed his natural abilities as a speaker he had reached a stage where he could have recited the alphabet backwards and still held his audience spellbound but he put his gifts into cold storage that morning this was a moment that was neither for conviviality nor rhetoric as became a man at the very heart of a national crisis he was stern quiet and exceptionally for him brief and to the point unfortunately what you have just heard is correct no matter how distasteful and humiliating this present situation may be there is no possibility in the world of endangering the president his royal guests and the good name of america we submit to blackmail this criminal branson would appear to have got away with the blackmailing equivalent of murder but i wish him to listen to me very carefully on information i have received this morning information as i shall shortly prove of the most reliable kind i believe that branson is very near the end of his road i believe he will very soon be alone and friendless i believe he will have no one left in the world to turn to i believe every mans hand will be against him and i believe that those hands that will be reaching out most eagerly to strike him down as they most surely will are the hands of his devoted criminal followers who misguidedly imagine their leader to be a man of honour and integrity richards lapsed into momentary rhetoric those are hands that will literally cut him down just as he figuratively intends to stab them all in the back some of bransons men were looking at him in a vague and baffled incomprehension revson and ohare exchanged enquiring glances only branson seemed entirely at his ease lounging back in his chair a faintly contemptuous smile on his lips i said that i had information of the most reliable kind as your vicepresident i have been accused more than once of not exactly being given to understatement in this case i was what i have is impeccable proof ladies and gentlemen and indeed viewers throughout the world may i present to you the man who until the early hours of this morning was bransons most devoted lieutenant mr johann van effen the camera changed to a picture of five men in medium shot sitting in adjoining chairs the man in the centre was unquestionably van effen who appeared to be his normal relaxed self and to be chatting with seeming amiability to his companions the picture wasnt close enough to show the glazed eyes the fact that he was still under the influence of drugs the drugs which had made him talk his head off during three long hours of probing by a skilled police psychiatrist who in turn had received continual prompting from hagenbach richards went on from left to right admiral newson naval commander west coast san francisco chief of police hendrix mr van effen mr hagenbach head of the fbi and general carter officer commanding west coast if i may be permitted a feeble joke i doubt whether van effen has ever found himself in such lawabiding company in his life branson had very definitely stopped both lounging and relaxing he was sitting far forward in his chair and for once his feelings were showing the expression on his face could be described as nothing else other than stunned disbelief van effen richards said defected in the very early hours of this morning he defected for what he and indeed i believed to have been very compelling reasons he departed for the excellent reason that he is still a comparatively young man and would like to live a little longer incidentally as the acting head of state i have already guaranteed van effen immunity from the due processes of the law his information has been invaluable as has been his information of eight major robberies in the past three years in each of which as we now know branson was the leader but i digress he defected because he feared for his life he defected because branson had suggested to him that he and van effen share the ransom money equally the rest could go to hell and presumably prison apart from the fact that van effen does appear to be possessed of a belief in honesty between thieves he was only too well aware that if he went along with this the next back to feel the blade of a knife literally would be his own van effen feels strongly that his excomrades should be made aware of what lies in store for them he has he tells me already persuaded four of bransons men to defect along with him and we expect them shortly when they arrive we shall show them on the screen if you can at all i suggest you dont stray too far from your television sets ohare said jesus talk about sowing seeds of dissension hows branson going to cope with this recover from this brilliant as the veep says whos going to trust him now among his own men this your idea revson i wish it were but even i am not as crafty evil and devious as that the unmistakable hand of hagenbach i never thought that van effen whatever youre about to say he didnt hagenbach made sure that there were no closeups of van effen had there been even a layman would have seen that van effen was doped to the eyes doped if he defected an involuntary defection i gassed him and lowered him down to an ah passing submarine of course what else an ah passing submarine ohare favoured him with the look of a psychiatrist who finds himself with an intractable case on his hands dear dear you dont believe me but of course old boy youre under stress again revson said kindly talking english english he parted the base of his camera how do you think i got hold of a brandnew radio transceiver in the middle of the night ohare stared at him he said with an effort and the four other promised defectors submariners all hell no forcible abduction all within the past half hour ohare got back to his staring in the mount tamalpais radar station parker until lately giscards number two looked away from the tv set and at the four men gathered around him he said sold down the river from the silence that met this observation it was clear that the others agreed with him but it could hardly have been called an agreeable silence richards was trying hard to show that he was not actively enjoying himself he said into his microphone i can see that the fog is going to pass over the bridge so you wont be able to see me in a couple of minutes dont suppose it will last long though when it clears well show you your four other faithful henchmen who have defected from you i will leave you with one last observation your moneys guaranteed but watch how you go i understand it takes exactly six minutes to block the major runways at havana airport branson his face quite without expression rose and walked to the rear coach giscard following it was noticeable that his own men either looked at him with puzzlement or thoughtfulness or just averted their eyes after entering the coach giscard went to the back and returned with scotch and two glasses he poured two large drinks and said im against drinking in the morning too branson most uncharacteristically drained half his glass in one gulp he said how does your back feel giscard with eleven years working for you and a seven figure bank balance my back feels okay i suggest we cut the comedy mr branson this could be damned serious with the exception of van effen yonnie and myself none of your men has known you for even as long as a year i forgot chrysler but the restdid you watch their faces as we came here branson shook his head slowly they just didnt know what to think blame them no blame van effen if i believed the sun wasnt going to set tonight id believe he defected he didnt notice that the camera showed no closeup and that be wasnt invited to speak he broke off as chrysler appeared at the doorway branson said its all right come in you look unhappy am unhappy i heard what giscard just said they let van effen stay in the background because he was drugged ill bet he told them his life story without realizing one word of what he was saying van effen defect never and theres another thing im unhappy about bartlett and boyard should have been back by this time they havent even appeared at the south tower whats more theyre not going to i know who the next four socalled defectors are going to be branson said drugs no defection coercion were all agreed on that but how did van effen leave the bridge giscard said god knows i wasnt here could it have been during one of the two blackouts you had that night branson said he was with me on both occasions any ideas chrysler none its as i said mr branson theres a rotten apple in the barrel somewhere he looked out moodily at the fog drifting over the bridge its getting so that i dont like this bridge much any more carmody removed the last of the detonators from the second strap of explosives and gingerly rejoined rogers on the top of the south tower he picked up the walkietalkie general carter please there was a few seconds delay then carter came through carmody said weve got them sir shall rogers and i take a stroll across to the other side branson i believe has promised another show at eleven itll be the west cable this time and we quite like our job of being a reception committee its a sensible precaution although i somehow dont think that branson is going to risk any more of his men in the south tower ah our four friends made it to terra firma sir with me now pity you havent a tv up there you and rogers some splendid shows on today therell be repeats we must leave sir fogs thinning quickly down below the fog in fact moved into the bay in less than five minutes leaving the bridge brilliant in the bright sunshine branson pacing up and down a short section of the bridge stopped as chrysler approached hagenbach on the phone mr branson he says to switch on the television in two minutes time branson nodded we all know what this is going to be this time hagenbach was the master of ceremonies he hadnt prepared his lines as well as the vicepresident but he made his point with considerable impact it does look as if bransons criminal empire if not at least crumbling is showing signs of coming apart at the seams the vicepresident promised you that more defectors would appear that van effen had talked four more into deserting the sinking ship well they have just so done as you can see for yourselves another camera picked up a table with four men sitting around it each with a glass in his hand a bottle stood on the middle of the table they could hardly be described as a gay and happy group but then they had no reason to be hagenbach moved into camera range there they are then ladies and gentlemen left to right messrs reston harrison bartlett and boyard incidentally one of bransons top men is in hospital with a fractured skull one does wonder what will happen next thank you for your kind attention the cameras had just stopped turning when a policeman came running up to hagenbach telephone for you sir its mount tamalpais ten seconds later hagenbach was inside the communications wagon listening intently he replaced the receiver and looked at hendrix newson and carter how long would it take to provide two helicopters one with a tv camera and crew the other with armed police carter said ten minutes twelve at the most giscard said bitterly attrition attrition attrition pinpricks and more pinpricks a steady undermining of confidence in those of us who are left and not a thing in the world you can do about it nothing to justify any violent retaliatory action against the hostages theyre just using the tv to play you at your own game mr branson yes they are branson didnt seem unduly disturbed what hed seen had come neither as shock nor surprise to him one has to admit that theyre quite good at it he looked at giscard and chrysler well gentlemen ive made up my mind your thoughts giscard and chrysler looked briefly at each other it was not in character with branson that he should ask anyones opinion weve got our hostages trapped here chrysler said now im the one whos beginning to feel trapped on this damned bridge weve no freedom of movement giscard said but we would have in the presidential boeing and it has the finest communications system in the world so we make orderly preparations for if need be an emergency takeoff i am in agreement they shall pay for this just to show them i mean what i say im still going to bring down their damned bridge now i hardly think it would be wise to wrap the remaining two explosive devices round the west cable at the top of the north tower not giscard said unless you want to have another couple of involuntary defectors so we wrap them round the cable just where we are here at the lowest point between the two helicopters that should do satisfactorily enough i think some half hour later shortly after the last two of the explosive straps had been secured to the west cable chrysler came up to branson hagenbach he says therell be an interesting programme coming on in just two minutes five minutes after the programme hes going to call you he says two very important messages are coming through from the east i wonder what that conniving old devil is up to now branson went and took his accustomed viewing place automatically the seats beside and behind him filled up the screen came to life it portrayed something that looked like an enormous white golf ball one of the mount tamalpais radar scanners then the camera zoomed in on a group of about ten men policemen hi then shirt sleeves all armed with submachineguns slightly in front of them stood hendrix a microphone in his hand the camera followed as hendrix moved forwards towards an opening door five men emerged all with their hands high the leading man of the five stopped when he was within three feet of hendrix hendrix said youre parker yes im hendrix chief of police san francisco do you men surrender voluntarily yes why better than being hunted and gunned down by youor stabbed in the back by that bastard branson youre under arrest get into the van hendrix watched them go then spoke again into the microphone when it comes to making speeches im afraid im not in the same league as the vicepresident or mr hagenbach so i wont even try all i can say with due modesty on the part of all of us is that ten defectors is not a bad mornings bag and the morning is not over yet incidentally there will be no more broadcasts from us for at least an hour revson stood up and glanced round casually in the space of only two seconds he caught the eye of both general cartland and grafton slowly casually the newsmen and the hostages began to drift off to their separate coaches the former presumably to write up their dispatches or refill cameras the later almost certainly in the pursuit of refreshments the president looked particularly thirsty besides the comfort of an airconditioned coach was vastly to be preferred to the already uncomfortable heat out on the bridge giscard said in anger the fool the fool the bloody fool why did he have to let himself be duped so easily there was just a trace of weary acceptance in bransons voice because he had no giscard there beside him thats why he could have phoned you he could have phoned me what might have been no older phrase in any language i dont really blame him chrysler said has it occurred to you mr branson that when youve received your ransom money and returned the hostages they might want most if not all of it back if you want their prisoners freed theyre no fools and they know damned well that you wouldnt let your men down therell be no deal i admit its going to make things a bit more tricky but therell be no deal well i suppose id better go and see what friend hagenbach wants branson rose and walked towards the rear coach his head bent in thought mack the guard waited until the last of his illustrious hostages had entered the presidential coach locked the door and pocketed the key his machinepistol was dangling from one hand he turned round to see cartlands little pistol not three feet from him cartland said dont try anything i beg you try to lift and fire that gun and it is the last thing you ever do cartlands calm impersonal voice carried immense conviction gentlemen i ask you to bear witness to that funny little popgun mack was openly contemptuous you couldnt even hurt me with that thing but id still cut you to pieces bear witness to the fact that i warned this man that this popgun is loaded with cyanidetipped bullets just has to break the skin and you wont even feel it youll be a dead man before you hit the floor in my country the king observed hed already be dead with the possible exception of yonnie none of bransons men was a fool mack was no fool he handed over his gun cartland marched him to the rear of the coach pushed him into the washroom extracted the inside key and locked the door from the outside the president said well cartland said theres going to be some ratherviolent unpleasantness outside in a minute or two i dont want to risk any of you at this late date i want this door kept sealed and locked because our friends ashore are going to use a special and very lethal bomb which sucks oxygen from the atmosphere and leaves you very dead thirdly branson is going to come around very quickly with the intention of shooting up one or two of you if the nastiness doesnt stop but if the doors locked and he cant get in he can fire ail day at this bulletproof glass and make no impression fourthly although we now have two guns were not going to use them when we do leave here as we must eventually i dont want a gunfight at the ok corral well be loaded into a helicopter but the helicopter isnt going any place the president said where did you get all this information from a wellinformed source fellow who gave me this gun revson how does he tie in dont know the chap you will hes stated as hagenbachs successor in the fbi the president was plaintive its like i always say no one ever tells me anything revson was much less verbose and not at all forthcoming with explanations ensuring that he was the last man in he turned and chopped the unsuspecting peters below the right ear just as peters turned the key in the lock revson relieved him of both key and machinepistol dragged him in and propped him in the drivers seat then brought out his radio revson here hendrix ready yet hagenbachs still on the phone to branson let me know immediately hes through so the moneys in europe branson said into the phone excellent but there had to be a codeword there was very appropriate this time hagenbachs voice was dry offshore branson permitted himself a slight smile hendrixs voice came through on revsons receiver he said theyre through clear with hagenbach clear now revson didnt replace the transistor in his camera case he put it in his pocket unslung his camera and laid it on the floor he unlocked the door leaving the key in the lock opened the door a judicious crack and peered back the first smoke bomb burst about two hundred yards away just as branson descended from the rear coach a second twenty yards nearer burst about two seconds later branson still remained as he was as if momentarily paralysed not so ohare revson observed who moved very swiftly into the back of his ambulance dosing the door hard behind him the driver revson assumed was already inside branson broke from his thrall he leapt inside the rear coach lifted a phone and shouted hagenbach hendrix he had apparently overlooked the fact that if hendrix had been at mount tamalpais some five minutes previously he could hardly have returned by that time hagenbach speaking what the hell do you think youre up to im not up to anything hagenbachs voice was infuriatingly unconcerned the dense clouds of smoke were now no more than a hundred yards away im going inside the presidential coach he was still shouting you know what that means he thrust the phone back and pulled out his pistol giscard tell the men to prepare for an attack on the south they must be mad johnson and bradley had advanced from the rear of the coach but he thrust them back you two i cant afford to lose not now stay here that goes for you too giscard tell the men get back here and tell hagenbach what im doing giscard eyed him with understandable concern an erratic repetitive and slightly incoherent branson he had not encountered before but then giscard had not spent the previous twentyfour hours on the golden gate bridge two more smoke bombs had fallen by the time branson jumped down to the roadway the pall of smoke thick and dense now totally obscuring the south tower was no more than fifty yards away he rushed to the door of the presidential coach grabbed the handle and tried to wrench the door open but the door remained immovable another smoke bomb exploded this one was just abort of the rear coach branson battered at the window of the door with the butt of his pistol and peered inside the drivers seat the seat which mack the guard should have been occupying was empty general cartland appeared at the doorway as the next smoke bomb burst not ten yards away branson shouted at him quite forgetting that he was only mouthing wordsfor the coach was totally soundproofand pointed at the drivers seat cartland shrugged his shoulders branson loosed off four quick shots at the lock and wrenched the handle again but the presidential coach had been specifically designed to withstand assaults of this nature which was as well for branson cartlands right hand held behind his back had the forefinger on the trigger of the cyanide gun the next bomb burst directly opposite branson and the dense acrid evilsmelling fumes were on him in seconds branson fired two more shots at the lock and tried again revson withdrew the key from the door of the lead coach dropped down to the roadway shut the door locked it and left the key in position a smoke bomb burst immediately opposite him vile though the fumes were to both nostrils and throat they were not incapacitating running his fingers along the side of the presidential coach branson made his way back to the rear coach opened the now closed door and went inside closing the door behind him the air in the coach was clear the lights were on the airconditioning unit was functioning and giscard was on the phone branson managed to control his coughing i couldnt get in doors locked and no sign of mack get anything i got hagenbach he says he knows nothing about this dont know whether to believe him or not hes sent for the vicepresident branson snatched the phone from him and as he did richardss voice came through you this fellow giscard branson there is no attack there will be no attack do you think were madyou there with guns at the heads of seven hostages its the army in the shape of carter whos gone mad heaven alone knows what he intended to achieve he refuses to answer the phone ive sent admiral newson to stop him its that or his career in the communications wagon richards turned to look at hagenbach how did i sound for the first time in his years of contact with richards hagenbach permitted an expression of approval to appear on his face youre keeping the wrong kind of company mr vicepresident youre as devious as i am giscard said do you believe him god only knows its sense its logical stay here and keep that door closed branson dropped down to the roadway the smoke was thinning now but there was still enough of it to make his eyes water and start him coughing again on his third step he bumped into a vaguelyseen shape in the opacity whos that chrysler chrysler was almost convulsed in his paroxysms of coughing what the hells going on mr branson god knows nothing according to richards any signs of an attack any signs of ani cant see a bloody yard no sounds anyway just as he spoke there came half a dozen cracks in rapid succession chrysler said those werent smoke bombs in a few seconds it was clear that they were indeed not smoke bombs both men started to gasp searching for oxygen and unable to find it branson was the first to guess at what might be happening he held his breath grabbed chrysler by the arm and dragging him towards the rear coach seconds later they were inside the door closed behind them chrysler lying unconscious on the floor branson barely conscious on his feet giscard said what in gods name airconditioning maximum bransons voice came in short painful gasps theyre using cubs unlike ohare giscard knew what cubs were asphyxiation bombs theyre not playing any more neither was general cartland macks machinepistol in hand he unlocked the washroom door mack gave him a baleful glare but with the machinepistols muzzle six inches from his stomach was unable to give any more direct expression of his feelings cartland said im the army chief of staff in an emergency such as this i am responsible to no one including the president for my actions give me the door key or ill shoot you dead two seconds later the door key was in cartlands hand cartland said turn round mack turned and almost immediately collapsed to the floor the impact from the butt of cartlands machinepistol may have been too heavy but from the indifferent expression on cartlands face it was clear that he didnt particularly care one way or another he locked the washroom door behind him pocketed the key walked forward thrust the machinepistol out of sight beneath the chair of a rather dazed president and made his way to the control panel in front of the drivers seat he touched a few buttons without effect pulled and pushed some switches then turned sharply as the entrance window slid down he took two paces sniffed the air wrinkled his nose and quickly moved back to push the last switch hed touched in the other direction the window closed again very briefly cartland touched the switch the window slid down an inch cartland moved across and dropped the door key outside returned and closed the window two minutes later the gentle western breeze from the pacific had blown the now dispersing fumes into the bay the bridge was clear branson opened the door of the rear coach the air was sweet and fresh and clean he stepped down looked at the figures lying on the ground and started running giscard johnson and bradley followed him a slowly recovering chrysler sat up but remained where he was shaking his head from side to side they checked the men lying on the bridge giscard said theyre all alive unconscious totally knocked out but theyre still breathing branson said after cubs i dont understand load them aboard your chopper bradley and take off when youre ready branson ran towards the presidential coach and immediately saw the key on the ground he picked it up and opened the bulletscarred door cartland was standing by the drivers seat branson said what happened here you tell me all i know is that your guard locked the door from the outside and ran he ran when the smoke reached here i assume that the smoke wasnt really smoke just a smokescreen to allow another defector to escape branson stared at him first shook his head then nodded stay here he ran towards the lead coach he at once saw the key in the lock twisted it and opened the door he looked at the slumped and clearly unconscious peters mounted the steps and looked down the coach he said wheres revson gone a wellrehearsed and apparently uncomprehending grafton spoke in a weary voice i can tell you only three things he chopped your guard he spoke on what looked like a miniature radio then when the smoke came he left locked the door from the outside and ran look branson were only bystanders civilians from your point of view you promised us safety whats happening out there which way did he run towards the north tower hell have reached there long ago branson remained silent for quite some time when he spoke it was in his accustomed measured tones i am going to destroy this bridge i do not kill innocent people can anybody here drive a coach a young journalist stood up i can get this coach off the bridge immediately through the south barrier he closed the door and ran towards the ambulance the rear door opened as he approached ohare appeared and said well you certainly know how to lay on entertainment for your guests get off this bridge this moment whatever for stay if you like im going to blow up this damned bridge branson left not running now just walking quickly he saw a dazed chrysler emerging from the rear coach he said go stay by the presidents coach giscard and johnson were standing by the rear helicopter bradley was leaning through an opened window branson said go now meet you at the airport bradley lifted his helicopter cleanly off the bridge even before branson had reached the presidents coach revson lifted himself from his cramped position on the floor of the rear seat of the lead helicopter and glanced briefly through a window the seven hostages escorted by branson giscard and chrysler were approaching the helicopter revson sank back into hiding and pulled the transceiver from his pocket he said mr hagenbach speaking can you see the rotor on this helicopter i can we all can we all have glasses on you first turn the rotor takes the laser beam the seven hostages were ushered in first the president and the king sat in the two front seats on the left the prince and cartland on the right behind them the mayor muir and the oil sheikh took up position giscard and chrysler took up separate positions in the third row each had a gun in his hand the ambulance was approaching the south tower when ohare tapped on the drivers window the window slid back ohare said turn back to the middle of the bridge turn back jesus doc hes about to blow up the damn bridge theres going to be some sort of an accident but not the kind you think turn back johnson was the last to enter the helicopter when he was seated branson said right lift off there came the usual earnumbing clattering roar a roar which rapidly developed into a screaming sound the sound of an engine running far above its rated revolutions but even so not loud enough to drown a fearsomely clattering sound outside johnson leaned forward and all the noise suddenly ceased branson said whats wrong what happened johnson stared ahead then said quietly im afraid you were right about the laser beam mr branson the rotors just fallen into the golden gate branson reacted very quickly he lifted a phone and pressed a button bradley mr branson weve had some trouble come back to the bridge and pick us up im afraid i cant do that ive had some trouble myself a couple of phantom jets riding herd on me im to land at the international airport im told there will be a welcoming committee revson was silently on his feet white pen in hand he pressed the button twice and almost in unison both men slumped forward then quite unexpectedly and to revsons shocked dismay toppled far from silently into the aisle their guns clattering on the metallic floor branson twisted round and there was a pistol in his hand revson was too far away for his tipped needles to carry branson took careful aim squeezed slowly and steadily then cried out in pain as the presidents cane slashed across his cheek revson threw himself to the floor of the aisle his right hand clamping on the butt of giscards gun by the time branson had wrenched away the presidents cane and swung round again revson was ready all he could see of branson was his head but he was ready they stood in a group isolated but not twenty yards from the ambulance the president the vicepresident the seven decisionmakers and revson revson had a firm grip on april wednesdays arm they stood and watched in silence as the shrouded stretcher was lowered from the helicopter and carried through the dozens of armed police and soldiers to the waiting ambulance nobody had anything to say there was nothing to say the president said our royal friends richards said cant wait to get to san rafael tomorrow theyre more than philosophic about the entire episode theyre downright pleased not only has it all given america a great big black eye but it will make them national heroes at home the president said wed better go talk to them he and richards made to turn away when revson said thank you sir the president looked at him in incredulity me you thank me ive already thanked you a hundred times yes sir as a rule i dont like owing favours but i rather care for having my life saved the president smiled and along with richards turned and walked away hagenbach said to revson well lets go to the office and have your full report ah that whats the penalty for disobeying an order by the head of the fbi you get fired pity i quite liked my job my proposal is that i shower shave change take miss wednesday for lunch and then file my report in the afternoon i guess you owe me at least that hagenbach pondered then nodded i guess i do two thousand miles away among the higher echelons in the fbi headquarters someone just came into a minor sweepstakes fortune hagenbach smiled
