beauty or a great man with his power har i wish i were assured of the sincerity of your love air butterd pease luck does my dearest harriot ask what for love i would pursue would you charmer know what task i would undertake for you ask the bold ambitious what he for honours would atchieve or the gay voluptuous that which hed not for pleasure give ask the miser what hed do to amass excessive gain or the saint what hed pursue his wishd heavn to obtain these i would attempt and more for oh my harriot is to me all ambition pleasure store or what heavn itself can be har would my dearest luckless know what his constant harriot can her tender love and faith to show for her dear her only man ask the vain coquette what she for mens adoration would or from censure to be free ask the vile censorious prude in a coach and six to ride what the mercenary jade or the widow to be bride to a brisk broadshoulderd blade all these i would attempt for thee could i but thy passion fix thy will my sole commander be and thy arms my coach and six money within harriot harriot har hear the dreadful summons adieu i will take the first opportunity of seeing you again luck adieu my pretty charmer go thy

jack sir luck fetch my other hat hither carry it to the pawnbrokers jack to your honours own pawnbroker luck ay and in thy way home call at the cooks shop so one way or other i find my head must always provide for my belly scene v luckless witmore luck i am surprized dear witmore wit dear harry luck this is kind indeed but i do not more wonder at finding a man in this age who can be a friend to adversity than that fortune should be so much my friend as to direct you to me for she is a lady i have not been much indebted to lately wit she who told me i assure you is one you have been indebted to a long while luck whom do you mean wit one who complains of your unkindness in not visiting her mrs lovewood luck dost thou visit there still then wit i throw an idle hour away there sometimes when i am in an illhumour i am sure of feeding it there with all the scandal in town for no bawd is half so diligent in looking after girls with an uncracked maidenhead as she in searching out women with cracked reputations luck the much more infamous office of the two wit thou art still a favourer of the women i find luck ay the women and the muses the high roads to beggary wit what art thou not cured of scribling yet luck no scribling is as impossible to cure as the gout wit and as sure a sign of poverty as the gout of riches sdeath in an age of learning and true politeness where a man might succeed by his merit there would be some encouragement but now when party and prejudice carry all before them when learning is decried wit not understood when the theatres are puppetshows and the comedians balladsingers when fools lead the town would a man think to thrive by his wit if you must write write nonsense write operas write hurlothrumbos set up an oratory and preach nonsense and you may meet with encouragement enough be profane be scurrilous be immodest if you would receive applause deserve to receive sentence at the old bailey and if you would ride in a coach deserve to ride in a cart luck you are warm my friend wit it is because i am your friend i cannot bear to hear the man i love ridiculed by fools by idiots to hear a fellow who had he been born a chinese had starved for want of genius to have been even the lowest mechanick toss up his empty noddle with an affected disdain of what he has not understood and women abusing what they have neither seen nor heard from an unreasonable prejudice to an honest fellow whom they have not known if thou wilt write against all these reasons get a patron be pimp to some worthless man of quality write panegyricks on him flatter him with as many virtues as he has vices then perhaps you will engage his lordship his lordship engages the town on your side and then write till your arms ake sense or nonsense it will all go down luck thou art too satirical on mankind it is possible to thrive in the world by justifiable means wit ay justifiable and so they are justifiable by custom what does the soldier or physician thrive by but slaughter the lawyer but by quarrels the courtier but by taxes the poet but by flattery i know none that thrive by profiting mankind but the husbandman and the merchant the one gives you the fruit of your own soil the other brings you those from abroad and yet these are represented as mean and mechanical and the others as honourable and glorious luck well but prithee leave railing and tell me what you would advise me to do wit do why thou art a vigorous young fellow and there are rich widows in town luck but i am already engaged wit why dont you marry then for i suppose you are not mad enough to have any engagement with a poor mistress luck even so faith and so heartily that i would not change her for the widow of a croesus wit now thou art undone indeed matrimony clenches ruin beyond retrieval what unfortunate stars wert thou born under was it not enough to follow those nine ragged jades the muses but you must fasten on some earthborn mistress as poor as them mar jun within order my chairman to call on me at st jamess no let them stay wit heyday whom the devil have we here luck the young captain sir no less a person i assure you scene vi luckless witmore marplay jun mar jun mr luckless i kiss your hands sir i am your most obedient humble servant you see mr luckless what power you have over me i attend your commands though several persons of quality have staid at court for me above this hour luck i am obliged to you i have a tragedy for your house mr marplay mar jun ha if you will send it to me i will give you my opinion of it and if i can make any alterations in it that will be for its advantage i will do it freely wit alterations sir mar jun yes sir alterations i will maintain it let a play be never so good without alteration it will do nothing wit very odd indeed mar jun did you ever write sir wit no sir i thank heaven mar jun oh your humble servant your very humble servant sir when you write yourself you will find the necessity of alterations why sir would you guess that i had altered shakspeare wit yes faith sir no one sooner mar jun alackaday was you to see the plays when they are brought to us a parcel of crude undigested stuff we are the persons sir who lick them into form that mould them into shape the poet make the play indeed the colourman might be as well said to make the picture or the weaver the coat my father and i sir are a couple of poetical tailors when a play is brought us we consider it as a tailor does his coat we cut it sir we cut it and let me tell you we have the exact measure of the town we know how to fit their taste the poets between you and me are a pack of ignorant wit hold hold sir this is not quite so civil to mr luckless besides as i take it you have done the town the honour of writing yourself mar jun sir you are a man of sense and express yourself well i did as you say once make a small sally into parnassus took a sort of flying leap over helicon but if ever they catch me there again sir the town have a prejudice to my family for if any play could have made them ashamed to damn it mine must it was all over plot it would have made half a dozen novels nor was it crammed with a pack of wittraps like congreve and wycherly where every one knows when the joke was coming i defy the sharpest critick of them all to have known when any jokes of mine were coming the dialogue was plain easy and natural and not one single joke in it from the beginning to the end besides sir there was one scene of tender melancholy conversation enough to have melted a heart of stone and yet they damned it and they damned themselves for they shall have no more of mine wit take pity on the town sir mar jun i no sir no ill write no more no more unless i am forced to it luck thats no easy thing marplay mar jun yes sir odes odes a man may be obliged to write those you know luck and wit ha ha ha thats true indeed luck but about my tragedy mr marplay mar jun i believe my father is at the playhouse if you please we will read it now but i must call on a young lady first hey whos there is my footman there order my chair to the door your servant gentlemen caro vien exit singing wit this is the most finished gentleman i ever saw and hath not i dare swear his equal luck if he has here he comes scene vii luckless witmore bookweight luck mr bookweight your very humble servant book i was told sir that you had particular business with me luck yes mr bookweight i have something to put into your hands i have a play for you mr bookweight book is it accepted sir luck not yet book oh sir when it is it will be then time enough to talk about it a play like a bill is of no value till it is accepted nor indeed when it is very often besides sir our playhouses are grown so plenty and our actors so scarce that really plays are become very bad commodities but pray sir do you offer it to the players or the patentees luck oh to the players certainly book you are in the right of that but a play which will do on the stage will not always do for us there are your acting plays and your reading plays wit i do not understand that distinction book why sir your acting play is entirely supported by the merit of the actor in which case it signifies very little whether there be any sense in it or no now your reading play is of a different stamp and must have wit and meaning in it these latter i call your substantive as being able to support themselves the former are your adjective as what require the buffoonery and gestures of an actor to be joined with them to shew their signification wit very learnedly defined truly luck well but mr bookweight will you advance fifty guineas on my play book fifty guineas yes sir you shall have them with all my heart if you will give me security for them fifty guineas for a play sir i would not give fifty shillings luck sdeath sir do you beat me down at this rate book no nor fifty farthings fifty guineas indeed your name is well worth that luck jack take this worthy gentleman and kick him down stairs book sir i shall make you repent this jack come sir will you please to brush book help murder ill have the law of you

in your power to drown a much greater do you but speak madam and i am sure no one will be heard but yourself money very well indeed fine reflexions on my character sir sir all the neighbours know that i have been as quiet a woman as ever lived in the parish i had no noises in my house till you came we were the family of love but you have been a nusance to the whole neighbourhood while you had money my doors were thundered at every morning at four and five by coachmen and chairmen and since you have had none my house has been besieged all day by creditors and bailiffs then theres the rascal your man but i will pay the dog i will scour him sir i am glad you are a witness of his abuses of me wit i am indeed madam a witness how unjustly he has abused you jack whispers luckless luck witmore excuse me a moment scene ix mrs moneywood witmore money yes sir and sir a man that has never shewn one the colour of his money wit very hard truly how much may he be in your debt pray because he has ordered me to pay you money ay sir i wish he had wit i am serious i assure you money i am very glad to hear it sir here is the bill as we settled it this very morning i always thought indeed mr luckless had a great deal of honesty in his principles any man may be unfortunate but i knew when he had money i should have it and what signifies dunning a man when he hath it not now that is a way with some people which i could never come in to wit there madam is your money you may give mr luckless the receipt money sir i give you both a great many thanks i am sure it is almost as charitable as if you gave it me for i am to make up a sum tomorrow morning well if mr luckless was but a little soberer i should like him for a lodger exceedingly for i must say i think him a very pleasant goodhumoured man scene x luckless witmore moneywood luck those are words i never heard out of that mouth before money ha ha ha you are pleased to be merry ha ha luck why witmore thou hast the faculty opposite to that of a witch and canst lay a tempest i should as soon have imagined one man could have stopt a cannonball in its full force as her tongue money ha ha ha he is the best company in the world sir and so full of his similitudes wit luckless good morrow i shall see you soon again luck let it be soon i beseech you for thou hast brought a calm into this house that was scarce ever in it before scene xi luckless mrs moneywood jack money well mr luckless you are a comical man to give one such a character to a stranger luck the company is gone madam and now like true man and wife we may fall to abusing one another as fast as we please money abuse me as you please so you pay me sir luck sdeath madam i will pay you money nay sir i do not ask it before it is due i dont question your payment at all if you was to stay in my house this quarter of a year as i hope you will i should not ask you for a farthing luck toll loll loll but i shall have her begin with her passion immediately and i had rather be the object of her rage for a year than of her love for half an hour money but why did you choose to surprise me with my money why did you not tell me you would pay me luck why have i not told you money yes you told me of a play and stuff but you never told me you would order a gentleman to pay me a sweet pretty goodhumoured gentleman he is heaven bless him well you have comical ways with you but you have honesty at the bottom and im sure the gentleman himself will own i gave you that character luck oh i smell you now you see madam i am better than my word to you did he pay it you in gold or silver money all pure gold luck i have a vast deal of silver which he brought me within will you do me the favour of taking it in silver that will be of use to you in the shop too money anything to oblige you sir luck jack bring out the great bag number one please to tell the money madam on that table money its easily told heaven knows theres not so much ont jack sir the bag is so heavy i cannot bring it in luck why then come and help to thrust a heavier bag out money what do you mean luck only to pay you in my bedchamber money villain dog ill swear a robbery and have you hanged rogues villains luck be as noisy as you please shuts the door jack call a coach and d ye hear get up behind it and attend me act ii scene i the playhouse luckless marplay senior marplay junior

smiling infant spring mar sen augh will you please to read that again sir luck then hence my sorrow hence my evry fear mar sen then hence my sorrow horror is a much better word and then in the second line no matter where so we are blessd together undoubtedly it should be no matter where so somewhere were together where is the question somewhere is the answer read on sir luck with thee mar sen no no i could alter those lines to a much better idea with thee the barren blocks where not a bit of human face is painted on the bark look green as coventgarden in the spring luck green as coventgarden

those are two excellent lines indeed i never writ better myself but sar luck leandras mine go bid the tongue of fate pronounce another word of bliss like that search thro the eastern mines and golden shores where lavish nature pours forth all her stores for to my lot could all her treasures fall i would not change leandra for them all there ends act the first and such an act as i believe never was on this stage yet mar jun nor never will i hope mar sen pray sir let me look at one thing falernian wines seem bitter to my taste pray sir what sort of wines may your falernian be for i never heard of

them to their old diet mar jun but suppose they wont feed ont mar sen then it shall be crammed down their throats mar jun i wish father you would leave me that art for a legacy since i am afraid i am like to have no other from you mar sen tis buff child tis buff true corinthian brass and heaven be praised tho i have given thee no gold i have given thee enough of that which is the better inheritance of the two gold thou mightst have spent but this is a lasting estate that will stick by thee all thy life mar jun what shall be done with that farce which was damned last night mar sen give it them again tomorrow i have told some persons of quality that it is a good thing and i am resolved not to be in the wrong let us see which will be weary first the town of damning or we of being damned mar jun rat the town i say mar sen thats a good boy and so say i but prithee what didst thou do with the comedy which i gave thee tother day that i thought a good one mar jun did as you ordered me returned it to the author and told him it would not do mar sen you did well if thou writest thyself and that i know thou art very well qualified to do it is thy interest to keep back all other authors of any merit and be as forward to advance those of none mar jun but i am a little afraid of writing for my writings you know have fared but ill hitherto mar sen that is because thou hast a little mistaken the method of writing the art of writing boy is the art of stealing old plays by changing the name of the play and new ones by changing the name of the author mar jun if it was not for these cursed hisses and catcalls mar sen harmless musick child very harmless musick and what when one is but well seasoned to it has no effect at all for my part i have been used to them mar jun ay and i have been used to them too for that matter mar sen and stood them bravely too idle young actors are fond of applause but take my word for it a clap is a mighty silly empty thing and does no more

now to the pit luck and i behind the scenes scene ix luckless harriot luck dear harriot har i was going to the playhouse to look after you i am frightened out of my wits i have left my mother at home with the strangest sort of man who is inquiring after you he has raised a mob before the door by the oddity of his appearance his dress is like nothing i ever saw and he talks of kings and bantam and the strangest stuff luck what the devil can he be har one of your old acquaintance i suppose in disguise one of his majestys officers with his commission in his pocket i warrant him luck well but have you your part perfect har i had unless this fellow hath frightened it out of my head again but i am afraid i shall play it wretchedly luck why so har i shall never have assurance enough to go through with it especially if they should hiss me luck oh your mask will keep you in countenance and as for hissing you need not fear it the audience are generally so favourable to young beginners but hist here is your mother and she has seen us adieu my dear make what haste you can to the playhouse exit scene x harriot moneywood har i wish i could avoid her for i suppose we shall have an alarum money so so very fine always together always caterwauling how like a hangdog he stole off and its well for him he did for i should have rung such a peal in his ears theres a friend of his at my house would be very glad of his company and i wish it was in my power to bring them together har you would not surely be so barbarous money barbarous ugh you whining puling fool hussey you have not a drop of my blood in you what you are in love i suppose har if i was madam it would be no crime money yes madam but it would and a folly too no woman of sense was ever in love with anything but a mans pocket what i suppose he has filled your head with a pack of romantick stuff of streams and dreams and charms and arms i know this is the stuff they all run on with and so run into our debts and run away with our daughters come confess are not you two to live in a wilderness together on love ah thou fool thou wilt find he will pay thee in love just as he has paid me in money if thou wert resolved to go abegging why did you not follow the camp there indeed you might have carried a knapsack but here you will have no knapsack to carry there indeed you might have had a chance of burying half a score husbands in a campaign whereas a poet is a longlived animal you have but one chance of burying him and that is starving him har well madam and i would sooner starve with the man i love than ride in a coach and six with him i hate and as for his passion you will not make me suspect that for he hath given me such proofs ont money proofs i shall die has he given you proofs of love har all that any modest woman can require money if he has given you all a modest woman can require i am afraid he has given you more than a modest woman should take because he has been so good a lodger i suppose i shall have some more of the family to keep it is probable i shall live to see half a dozen grandsons of mine in grubstreet scene xi moneywood harriot jack jack oh madam the man whom you took for a bailiff is certainly some great man he has a vast many jewels and other fine things about him he offered me twenty guineas to shew him my master and has given away so much money among the chairmen that some folks believe he intends to stand member of parliament for westminster money nay then i am sure he is worth inquiring into so dye hear sirrah make as much haste as you can before me and desire him to part with no more money till i come har so now my mother is in pursuit of money i may securely go in pursuit of my lover and i am mistaken good mamma if een you would not think that the better pursuit of the two in generous love transporting raptures lie which age with all its treasures cannot buy the tragedy of tragedies or the life and death of tom thumb the great with the annotations of h scriblerus secundus first acted in and altered in h scriblerus secundus his preface the town hath seldom been more divided in its opinion than concerning the merit of the following scenes while some publickly affirmed that no author could produce so fine a piece but mr p others have with as much vehemence insisted that no one could write anything so bad but mr f nor can we wonder at this dissension about its merit when the learned would have not unanimously decided even the very nature of this tragedy for though most of the universities in europe have honoured it with the name of egregium et maximi pretii opus tragoediis tam antiquis quam novis longe anteponendum nay dr b hath pronounced citius maevii aeneadem quam scribleri istrus tragoediam hanc crediderium cujus autorem senecam ipsum tradidisse haud dubitarim and the great professor burman hath styled tom thumb heroum omnium tragicorum facile principem nay though it hath among other languages been translated into dutch and celebrated with great applause at amsterdam where burlesque never came by the title of mynheer vander thumb the burgomasters receiving it with that reverent and silent attention which becometh an audience at a deep tragedy notwithstanding all this there have not been wanting some who have represented these scenes in a ludicrous light and mr d hath been heard to say with some concern that he wondered a tragical and christian nation would permit a representation on its theatre so visibly designed to ridicule and extirpate everything that is great and solemn among us this learned critick and his followers were led into so great an error by that surreptitious and piratical copy which stole last year into the world with what injustice and prejudice to our author will be acknowledged i hope by every one who shall happily peruse this genuine and original copy nor can i help remarking to the great praise of our author that however imperfect the former was even that faint resemblance of the true tom thumb contained sufficient beauties to give it a run of upwards of forty nights to the politest audiences but notwithstanding that applause which it received from all the best judges it was as severely censured by some few bad ones and i believe rather maliciously than ignorantly reported to have been intended a burlesque on the loftiest parts of tragedy and designed to banish what we generally call fine things from the stage now if i can set my country right in an affair of this importance i shall lightly esteem any labour which it may cost and this i the rather undertake first as it is indeed in some measure incumbent on me to vindicate myself from that surreptitious copy before mentioned published by some illmeaning people under my name secondly as knowing myself more capable of doing justice to our author than any other man as i have given myself more pains to arrive at a thorough understanding of this little piece having for ten years together read nothing else in which time i think i may modestly presume with the help of my english dictionary to comprehend all the meanings of every word in it but should any error of my pen awaken clariss bentleium to enlighten the world with his annotations on our author i shall not think that the least reward or happiness arising to me from these my endeavours i shall waive at present what hath caused such feuds in the learned world whether this piece was originally written by shakspeare though certainly that were it true must add a considerable share to its merit especially with such who are so generous as to buy and commend what they never read from an implicit faith in the author only a faith which our age abounds in as much as it can be called deficient in any other let it suffice that the tragedy of tragedies or the life and death of tom thumb was written in the reign of queen elizabeth nor can the objection made by mr d that the tragedy must then have been antecedent to the history have any weight when we consider that though the history of tom thumb printed by and for edward mr at the lookingglass on londonbridge be of a later date still must we suppose this history to have been transcribed from some other unless we suppose the writer thereof to be inspired a gift very faintly contended for by the writers of our age as to this historys not bearing the stamp of second third or fourth edition i see but little in that objection editions being very uncertain lights to judge of books by and perhaps mr mr may have joined twenty editions in one as mr cl hath ere now divided one into twenty nor doth the other argument drawn from the little care our author hath taken to keep up to the letter of this history carry any greater force are there not instances of plays wherein the history is so perverted that we can know the heroes whom they celebrate by no other marks than their names nay do we not find the same character placed by different poets in such different lights that we can discover not the least sameness or even likeness in the features the sophonisba of mairet and of lee is a tender passionate amorous mistress of massinissa corneille and mr thomson give her no other passion but the love of her country and make her as cool in her affection to massinissa as to syphax in the two latter she resembles the character of queen elizabeth in the two former she is the picture of mary queen of scotland in short the one sophonisba is as different from the other as the brutus of voltaire is from the marius jun of otway or as the minerva is from the venus of the ancients let us now proceed to a regular examination of the tragedy before us in which i shall treat separately of the fable the moral the characters the sentiments and the diction and first of the fable which i take to be the most simple imaginable and to use the words of an eminent author one regular and uniform not charged with a multiplicity of incidents and yet affording several revolutions of fortune by which the passions may be excited varied and driven to their full tumult of emotion nor is the action of this tragedy less great than uniform the spring of all is the love of tom thumb for huncamunca which caused the quarrel between their majesties in the first act the passion of lord grizzle in the second the rebellion fall of lord grizzle and glumdalca devouring of tom thumb by the cow and that bloody catastrophe in the third nor is the moral of this excellent tragedy less noble than the fable it teaches these two instructive lessons viz that human happiness is exceeding transient and that death is the certain end of all men the former whereof is inculcated by the fatal end of tom thumb the latter by that of all the other personages the characters are i think sufficiently described in the dramatis personae and i believe we shall find few plays where greater care is taken to maintain them throughout and to preserve in every speech that characteristical mark which distinguishes them from each other but says mr d how well doth the character of tom thumb whom we must call the hero of this tragedy if it hath any hero agree with the precepts of aristotle who defineth tragedy to be the imitation of a short but perfect action containing a just greatness in itself c what greatness can be in a fellow whom history relateth to have been no higher than a span this gentleman seemeth to think with serjeant kite that the greatness of a mans soul is in proportion to that of his body the contrary of which is affirmed by our english physiognomical writers besides if i understand aristotle right he speaketh only of the greatness of the action and not of the person as for the sentiments and the diction which now only remain to be spoken to i thought i could afford them no stronger justification than by producing parallel passages out of the best of our english writers whether this sameness of thought and expression which i have quoted from them proceeded from an agreement in their way of thinking or whether they have borrowed from our author i leave the reader to determine i shall adventure to affirm this of the sentiments of our author that they are generally the most familiar which i have ever met with and at the same time delivered with the highest dignity of phrase which brings me to speak of his diction here i shall only beg one postulatum viz that the greatest perfection of the language of a tragedy is that it is not to be understood which granted as i think it must be it will necessarily follow that the only way to avoid this is by being too high or too low for the understanding which will comprehend everything within its reach those two extremities of stile mr dryden illustrates by the familiar image of two inns which i shall term the aerial and the subterrestrial horace goes farther and sheweth when it is proper to call at one of these inns and when at the other telephus et peleus cum pauper et exul uterque projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba that he approveth of the sesquipedalia verba is plain for had not telephus and peleus used this sort of diction in prosperity they could not have dropt it in adversity the aerial inn therefore says horace is proper only to be frequented by princes and other great men in the highest affluence of fortune the subterrestrial is appointed for the entertainment of the poorer sort of people only whom horace advises dolere sermone pedestri the true meaning of both which citations is that bombast is the proper language for joy and doggrel for grief the latter of which is literally implied in the sermo pedestris as the former is in the sesquipedalia verba cicero recommendeth the former of these quid est tarn furiosum vel tragicum quam verborum sonitus inanis nulla subjecta sententia neque scientia what can be so proper for tragedy as a set of big sounding words so contrived together as to convey no meaning which i shall one day or other prove to be the sublime of longinus ovid declareth absolutely for the latter inn omne genus scripti gravitate tragoedia vincit tragedy hath of all writings the greatest share in the bathos which is the profound of scriblerus i shall not presume to determine which of these two stiles be properer for tragedy it sufficeth that our author excelleth in both he is very rarely within sight through the whole play either rising higher than the eye of your understanding can soar or sinking lower than it careth to stoop but here it may perhaps be observed that i have given more frequent instances of authors who have imitated him in the sublime than in the contrary to which i answer first bombast being properly a redundancy of genius instances of this nature occur in poets whose names do more honour to our author than the writers in the doggrel which proceeds from a cool calm weighty way of thinking instances whereof are most frequently to be found in authors of a lower class secondly that the works of such authors are difficultly found at all thirdly that it is a very hard task to read them in order to extract these flowers from them and lastly it is very difficult to transplant them at all they being like some flowers of a very nice nature which will flourish in no soil but their own for it is easy to transcribe a thought but not the want of one the earl of essex for instance is a little garden of choice rarities whence you can scarce transplant one line so as to preserve its original beauty this must account to the reader for his missing the names of several of his acquaintance which he had certainly found here had i ever read their works for which if i have not a just esteem i can at least say with cicero quae non contemno quippe quae nunquam legerim however that the reader may meet with due satisfaction in this point i have a young commentator from the university who is reading over all the modern tragedies at five shillings a dozen and collecting all that they have stole from our author which shall be shortly added as an appendix to this work dramatis personae men king arthur a passionate sort of king husband to queen dollallolla of

remarkable for the serenity of the sky or what we generally call a fine summers day so that according to this their exposition the same months are proper for tragedy which are proper for pastoral most of our celebrated english tragedies as cato mariamne tamerlane c begin with their observations on the morning lee seems to have come the nearest to this beautiful description of our authors the morning dawns with an unwonted crimson the flowers all odorous seem the garden birds sing louder and the laughing sun ascends the gaudy earth with an unusual brightness all nature smiles caes borg massinissa in the new sophonisba is also a favourite of the sun the sun too seems as conscious of my joy with broader eye to look abroad the world and all things smile like sophonisba memnon in the persian princess makes the sun decline rising that he may not peep on objects which would profane his brightness the morning rises slow and all those ruddy streaks that used to paint the days approach

thomas thumb victorious comes millions of giants crowd his chariot wheels giants to whom the giants in guildhall are infant dwarfs they frown and foam and roar while thumb regardless of their noise

ourselves revenge footnote dr b y reads the mighty tallmast thumb mr d s the mighty thumbing thumb mr t d reads thundering i think thomas more agreeable to the great simplicity so apparent in our author footnote that learned historian mr s n in the third number of his criticism on our author takes great pains to explode this passage it is says he difficult to guess what giants are here meant unless the giant despair in the pilgrims progress or the giant greatness in the royal villain for i have heard of no other sort of giants in the reign of king arthur petrus burmannus makes three tom thumbs one whereof he supposes to have been the same person whom the greeks called hercules and that by these giants are to be understood the centaurs slain by that hero another tom thumb he contends to have been no other than the hermes trismegistus of the antients the third tom thumb he places under the reign of king arthur to which third tom thumb says he the actions of the other two were attributed now though i know that this opinion is supported by an assertion of justus lipsius thomam illum thumbum non alium quam herculem fuisse satis constat yet shall i venture to oppose one line of mr midwinter against them all in arthurs court tom thumb did live but then says dr b y if we place tom thumb in the court of king arthur it will be proper to place that court out of britain where no giants were ever heard of spenser in his fairy queen is of another opinion where describing albion he says far within a savage nation dwelt of hideous giants and in the same canto then elfar with

to whisper in books says mr d s is arrant nonsense i am afraid this learned man does not sufficiently understand the extensive meaning of the word whisper if he had rightly understood what is meant by the senses whispring the soul in the persian princess or what whispring like winds is in aurengzebe or like thunder in another author he would have understood this emmeline in dryden sees a voice but

king if it be so let all men cry for joy till my whole court be drowned with their tears nay till they overflow my utmost land and leave me nothing but the sea to rule footnote these floods are very frequent in the tragick authors near to some murmuring brook ill lay me down whose waters if they should too shallow flow my tears shall swell them up till i will drown lees sophonisba pouring forth tears at such a lavish rate that were the world on fire they might have drownd the wrath of heaven and quenchd the mighty ruin mithridates one author changes the waters of grief to those of joy these

drunk as we footnote an expression vastly beneath the dignity of tragedy says mr d s yet we find the word he cavils at in the mouth of mithridates less properly used and applied to a more terrible idea i would be drunk with death mithridates the author of the new sophonisba taketh hold of this monosyllable and uses it pretty much to the same purpose the carthaginian sword with roman blood was drunk i would ask mr d s which gives him the best idea a drunken king or a drunken sword mr tate dresses up king arthurs resolution in heroick merry my lord o th captains humour right i am resolved to

thankd at all im thankd enough ive done my duty and ive done no more footnote this line is copied verbatim in the captives queen was ever such a godlike creature seen aside king thy modestys a candle to thy merit it shines itself and shews thy merit too but say my boy where didst thou leave the giants footnote we find a candlestick for this candle in two celebrated authors each star withdraws his golden head and burns within the socket nero a soul grown old and sunk into the socket sebastian thumb my liege without the castle gates they stand the castle gates too low for their admittance king what look they like thumb like nothing but themselves queen and sure thou art like nothing but thyself aside footnote this simile occurs very frequently among the dramatic writers of both kinds king

drawn by all the gods in council so fair she is that surely at her birth the council paused and then at length cryd out this is a woman footnote mr lee hath stolen this thought from our author this perfect face drawn by the gods in council which they were long a making luc jun brut at his birth the heavenly council paused and then at last cryd out this is a man dryden hath improved this hint to the utmost perfection so perfect that the very gods who formd you wonderd at their own skill and cryd a lucky hit has mended our design their envy hindered or you had been immortal and a pattern when

footnote it is impossible says mr w sufficiently to admire this natural easy line footnote this tragedy which in most points resembles the ancients differs from them in this that it assigns the same honour to lowness of stature which they did to height the gods and heroes in homer and virgil are continually described higher by the head than their followers the contrary of which is observed by our author in short to exceed on either side is equally admirable and a man of three foot is as wonderful a sight as a man of nine glum we yesterday were both a queen and wife one hundred thousand giants

windcholick time must shew o thumb what do we to thy valour owe ask some reward great as we can bestow footnote this doubt of the king puts me in mind of a passage in the captives where the noise of feet is mistaken for the rustling of leaves methinks i hear the sound of feet no twas the wind that shook yon cypress boughs thumb i ask not kingdoms i can conquer those i ask not money money ive

same opinion bru do not like young hawks fetch a course about your game flies fair fra do not fear it he answers you in your own hawking phrase injured love i think these two great authorities are sufficient to justify dollallolla in the use of the phrase hie away hie when in the same line she says she is speaking to a settingdog griz madam i go tom thumb shall feel the vengeance you have

theology of the pagans our modern poets would think it worth their while to enrich their works with the proverbial sayings of their ancestors mr dryden hath chronicled one in heroick two ifs scarce make one possibility conquest of granada my lord bacon is of opinion that whatever is known of arts and sciences might be proved to have lurked in the proverbs of solomon i am of the same opinion in relation to those abovementioned at least i am confident that a more perfect system of ethicks as well as oeconomy might be compiled out of them than is at present extant either in the works of the ancient philosophers or those more valuable as more voluminous ones of the modern divines act iii scene i king arthurs palace ghost solus hail ye black horrors of midnights midnoon ye fairies goblins bats and screechowls hail and oh ye mortal watchmen whose hoarse throats th immortal ghosts dread croakings counterfeit all hail ye dancing phantoms who by day are some condemnd to fast some feast in fire now play in churchyards skipping oer the graves to the loud music of the silent bell all hail footnote of all the particulars in which the modern stage falls short of the ancient there is none so much to be lamented as the great scarcity of ghosts whence this proceeds i will not presume to determine some are of opinion that the moderns are unequal to that sublime language which a ghost ought to speak one says ludicrously that ghosts are out of fashion another that they are properer for comedy forgetting i suppose that aristotle hath told us that a ghost is the soul of tragedy for so i render the greek text psychae o muythos taes tragodias which m dacier amongst others hath mistaken i suppose misled by not understanding the fabula of the latins which signifies a ghost as well as fable te premet nox fabulaeque manes horace of all the ghosts that have ever appeared on the stage a very learned and judicious foreign critick gives the preference to this of our author these are his words speaking of this tragedy nec quidquam in illa admirabilius quam phasma quoddam horrendum quod omnibus abis spectris quibuscum scatet angelorum tragoedia longe pace d ysn v doctiss dixerim praetulerim footnote we have already given instances of this figure scene ii king ghost king what noise is this what villain dares at this dread hoar with feet and voice profane disturb our royal walls ghost one who defies thy empty power to hurt him one who dares walk in thy bedchamber footnote almanzor reasons in the same manner a ghost ill be and from a ghost you know no place is free conquest of granada king presumptuous slave thou diest ghost threaten others with that word i am a ghost and am already dead footnote the man who writ this wretched pun says mr d would have picked your pocket which he proceeds to shew not only bad in itself but doubly so on so solemn an occasion and yet in that excellent play of liberty asserted we find something very much resembling a pun in the mouth of a mistress who is parting with the lover she is fond of ul oh mortal woe one kiss and then farewell irene the gods have given to others to fare well o miserably must irene fare agamemnon

thought what was the courage of a ghost yet dare not on thy life why say i that since life thou hast not dare not walk again within these walls on pain of the red sea for if henceforth i ever find

conquest of granada snatch me ye gods this moment into nothing cyrus the great footnote so art thou gone thou canst no conquest boast i thought what was the courage of a ghost conquest of granada king arthur seems to be as brave a fellow as almanzor who says most heroically in spite of ghosts ill on ghost were the red sea a sea of hollands gin the liquor when alive whose very smell i did detest did loathe yet for the sake of thomas thumb i would be laid therein king ha said you ghost yes my liege i said tom thumb whose fathers ghost i am once not unknown to mighty arthur but i see tis true the dearest friend when dead we all forget king tis he it is the honest gaffer thumb oh let me press thee in my eager arms thou best of ghosts thou something more than ghost ghost would i were something more that we again might feel each other in the warm embrace but now i have th advantage of my king for i feel thee whilst thou dost not feel me footnote the ghost of lausaria in cyrus is a plain copy of this and is therefore worth reading ah cyrus thou mayst as well grasp water or fleet air as think of touching my immortal shade cyrus the great king but say thou dearest air oh say what dread important business sends thee back to earth footnote thou better part of heavenly air conquest of granada ghost oh then prepare to hear which but to hear is full enough to send thy spirit hence thy

have i seen the stars in frosty nights so have i seen the sand in windy days so have i seen the ghosts on plutos shore so have i seen the flowers in spring arise so have i seen the leaves in autumn fall so have i seen the fruits in summer smile so have i seen the snow in winter frown footnote a string of similes says one proper to be hung up in the cabinet of a prince king d n all thou hast seen dost thou beneath the shape of gaffer thumb come hither to abuse me with similes to keep me on the rack hence or by all the torments of thy hell ill run thee through the body though thoust none footnote this passage hath been understood several different ways by the commentators for my part i find it difficult to understand it at all mr dryden says ive heard something how two bodies meet but how two souls join i know not so that till the body of a spirit be better understood it will be difficult to understand how it is possible to run him through it ghost arthur beware i must this moment hence not frighted by your voice but by the cocks arthur beware beware beware beware strive to avert thy yet impending fate for if thourt killd today tomorrow all thy care will come too late scene iii king solus king oh stay and leave me not uncertain thus and whilst thou tellest me whats like my fate oh teach me how i may avert it too curst be the man who first a simile made curst evry bard who writes so have i seen those whose comparisons are just and true and those who liken things not like at all the devil is happy that the whole creation can furnish out no simile to his fortune scene iv king queen queen what is the cause my arthur that you steal thus silently from dollallollas breast why dost thou leave me in the dark alone when well thou knowst i am afraid of sprites footnote cydaria is of the same fearful temper with dollallolla i never durst in darkness be alone indian emperor king oh dollallolla do not blame my love i hopd the fumes of last nights punch had laid thy lovely eyelids fast but oh i find there is no power in drams to quiet wives each morn as the returning sun they wake and shine upon their husbands queen think oh think what a surprise it must be to the sun rising to find the vanishd world away what less can be the wretched wifes surprise when stretching out her arms to fold thee fast she found her useless bolster in her arms think think on that oh think think well on that i do remember also to have read in drydens ovids metamorphoses that jove in form inanimate did lie with beauteous danae and trust me love i feard the bolster might have been a jove footnote think well of this think that think every way sophon footnote these quotations are more usual in the comick than in the tragick writers footnote this distress says mr d i must allow to be extremely beautiful and tends to heighten the virtuous character of dollallolla who is so exceeding delicate that she is in the highest apprehension from the inanimate embrace of a bolster an example worthy of imitation for all our writers of tragedy king come to my arms most virtuous of thy sex oh dollallolla were all wives like thee so many husbands never had worn horns should huncamunca of thy worth partake tom thumb indeed were blest oh fatal name for didst thou know one quarter what i know then wouldst thou know alas what thou wouldst know queen what can i gather hence

sallied out t encounter with the foe and swore unless his fate had him misled from grizzles shoulders to cut off his head and servet up with your chocolate in bed king tis well i found one devil told us both come dollallolla huncamunca come within well wait for the victorious thumb in peace and safety we secure may stay while to his arm we trust the bloody fray though men and giants should conspire with gods he is alone equal to all these odds footnote credat judaeus appella non ego says mr d for passing over the absurdity of being equal to odds can we possibly suppose a little insignificant fellow i say again a little insignificant fellow able to vie with a strength which all the samsons and herculeses of antiquity would be unable to encounter i shall refer this incredulous critick to mr drydens defence of his almanzor and lest that should not satisfy him i shall quote a few lines from the speech of a much braver fellow than almanzor mr johnsons achilles though human race rise in embattled hosts to force her from my arms oh son of atreus by that immortal powr whose deathless spirit informs this earth i will oppose them all victim queen he is indeed a helmet to us

the bill of fare whether the cod that northern king of fish or duck or goose or pig adorn the dish no fears the number of her guests afford but at her hour she sees the dinner on the board footnote i have heard of being supported by a staff says mr d but never of being supported by a helmet i believe he never heard of sailing with wings which he may read in no less a poet than mr dryden unless we borrow wings and sail through air love triumphant what will he say to a kneeling valley ill stand like a safe valley that low bends the knee to some aspiring mountain injured love i am ashamed of so ignorant a carper who doth not know that an epithet in tragedy is very often no other than an expletive do not we read in the new sophonisba of grinding chains blue plagues white occasions and blue serenity nay it is not the adjective only but sometimes half a sentence is put by way of expletive as beauty pointed high with spirit in the same play and in the lap of blessing to be most curst in the revenge scene vii plain grizzle foodle rebels griz thus far our arms with victory are crownd for though we have not fought yet we have found no enemy to fight withal footnote a victory like that of almanzor almanzor is victorious without fight conq of granada food yet i methinks would willingly avoid this day this first of april to engage our foes footnote well have we chose an happy day for

mother milkd the cow and yet the way to get a son this couple knew not how until such time the good old man to learned merlin goes and there to him in great distress in secret manner shows how in his heart he wishd to have a child in time to come to be his heir though it may be no bigger than his thumb of which old merlin was foretold that he his wish should have and so a son of stature small the charmer to him gave thoust heard the past look up and see the future footnote see the history of tom thumb page thumb lost in amazements gulf my senses sink see there glumdalca see another me footnote

ages yet unborn shall tribute pay to the heroick actions of this day then buskin tragedy at length shall chuse thy name the best supporter of her muse footnote the character of merlin is wonderful throughout but most so in this prophetick part we find several of these prophecies in the tragick authors who frequently take this opportunity to pay a compliment to their country and sometimes to their prince none but our author who seems to have detested the least appearance of flattery would have past by such an opportunity of being a political prophet thumb enough let every warlike musick sound we fall contented if we fall renownd scene ix lord grizzle foodle rebels on one side tom thumb glumdalca on the other food at length the enemy advances nigh i hear them with my ear and see them with my eye footnote i saw the villain myron with these eyes i saw him busiris in both which places it is intimated that it is sometimes possible to see with other eyes than your own griz draw all your swords for liberty we fight and liberty the mustard is of life footnote this mustard says mr d is enough to turn ones stomach i would be glad to know what idea the author had in his head when he wrote it this will be i believe best explained by a line of mr dennis and gave him liberty the salt of life liberty asserted the understanding that can digest the one will not rise at the other thumb

come i come most willingly i come so when some city wife for country air to hampstead or to highgate does repair her to make haste her husband does implore and cries my dear the coach is at the door with equal wish desirous to be gone she gets into the coach and then she cries drive on footnote this last speech of my lord grizzle hath been of great service to our poets ill hold it fast as life and when lifes gone ill hold this last and if thou takst it from me when im slain ill send my ghost and fetch it back again conquest of granada footnote my soul should with such speed obey it should

in my brains cleomenes footnote some kind sprite knocks softly at my soul to tell me fates at hand footnote mr dryden seems to have had this simile in his eye when he says my soul is packing up and

triumph lug rebellions dead and now ill go to breakfast footnote and in a purple vomit pourd his soul cleomenes footnote the devil swallows vulgar souls like whipt cream sebastian scene x king queen

name of ptolemy it is so long it asks an hour to write it by heaven ill change it into jove or mars or any other civil monosyllable that will not tire my hand cleomenes footnote here is a visible conjunction of two days in one by which our author may have either intended an emblem of a wedding or to insinuate that men in the honeymoon are apt to imagine time shorter than it is it brings into my mind a passage in the comedy called the coffeehouse politician we will celebrate this day at my house tomorrow illustration the death of lord grizzle nood oh monstrous dreadful terrible oh oh deaf be my ears for ever blind my eyes dumb be my tongue feet lame all senses lost howl wolves grunt bears hiss snakes shriek all ye ghosts footnote these beautiful phrases are all to be found in one single speech of king arthur or the british worthy king what does the blockhead mean nood i mean my liege only to grace my tale with decent horror whilst from my garret twice two stories high i lookd abroad into the streets below i saw tom thumb attended by the mob twice twenty shoeboys twice two dozen links chairmen and porters hackneycoachmen whores aloft he bore the grizly head of grizzle when of a sudden through the streets there came a cow of larger than the usual size and in a moment guess oh guess the rest and in a moment swallowd up tom thumb footnote i was but teaching him to grace

the child whom nurse from danger guards sends jack for mustard with a pack of cards kings queens and knaves throw one another down till the whole pack lies scatterd and oerthrown so all our pack upon the floor is cast and all i boast is that i fall the last dies footnote we may say with dryden death did at length so many slain forget and left the tale and took them by the great i know of no tragedy which comes nearer to this charming and bloody catastrophe than cleomenes where the curtain covers five principal characters dead on the stage these lines too i ask no questions then of who killd who the bodies tell the story as they lie seem to have belonged more properly to this scene of our author nor can i help imagining they were originally his the rival ladies too seem beholden to this scene were now a chain of lovers linkd in death julia goes first gonsalvo hangs on her and angelina hangs upon gonsalvo as i on angelina no scene i believe ever received greater honours than this it was applauded by several encores a word very unusual in tragedy and it was very difficult for the actors to escape without a second slaughter this i take to be a lively assurance of that fierce spirit of liberty which remains among us and which mr dryden in his essay on dramatick poetry hath observed whether custom says he hath so insinuated itself into our countrymen or nature hath so formed them to fierceness i know not but they will scarcely suffer combats and other objects of horror to be taken from them and indeed i am for having them encouraged in this martial disposition nor do i believe our victories over the french have been owing to anything more than to those bloody spectacles daily exhibited in our tragedies of which the french stage is so intirely clear pasquin a

four pound i suppose he will hardly get bail play wheres the tragedyauthor then i have a long part in both and its past ten oclock wom p ay i have a part in both too i wish any one else had them for they are not seven lengths put together i think it is very hard a woman of my standing should have a short part put upon her i suppose mrs merit will have all our principal parts now but i am resolved ill advertise against her ill let the town know how i am injured play oh here comes our tragedypoet enter fustian fust gentlemen your servant ladies yours i should have been here sooner but i have been obliged at their own requests to wait upon some halfdozen persons of the first quality with tickets upon my soul have been chid for putting off my play so long i hope you are all quite perfect for the town will positively stay for it no longer i think i may very well put upon the bills at the particular desire of several ladles of quality the first night enter prompter promp mr fustian we must defer the rehearsal of your tragedy for the gentleman who plays the first ghost is not yet up and when he is he has got such a churchyardcough he will not be heard to the middle of the pit play i wish you could cut the ghost out sir for i am terribly afraid hell be damned if you dont fust cut him out sir he is one of the most considerable persons in the play promp then sir you must give the part to somebody else for the present is so lame he can hardly walk the stage fust then he shall be carried for no man in england can act a ghost like him sir he was born a ghost he was made for the part and the part writ for him promp well sir then we hope you will give us leave to rehearse the comedy first fust ay ay you may rehearse it first if you please and act it first too if it keeps mine back above three nights i am mistaken i dont know what friends the author may have but if ever such stuff such damned incoherent senseless stuff was ever brought on any stage if the audience suffer it to go through three acts oh hes here enter trapwit dear mr trapwit your most humble servant sir i read your comedy over last night and a most excellent one it is if it runs as long as it deserves you will engross the whole season to yourself trap sir i am glad it met with your approbation as there is no man whose taste and judgment i have a better opinion of but pray sir why dont they proceed to the rehearsal of your tragedy i assure you sir i had much difficulty to get hither so early play yes faith i believe you had aside fust sir your comedy is to be rehearsed first trap excuse me sir i know the deference due to tragedy better fust sir i would not have you think i give up the cause of tragedy but my ghost being ill sir cannot get up without danger and i would not risque the life of my ghost on any account trap you are in the right ont sir for a ghost is the soul of tragedy fust ay sir i think it is not amiss to remind people of those things which they are nowadays too apt to disbelieve besides we have lately had an act against witches and i dont question but shortly we shall have one against ghosts but come mr trapwit as we are for this once to give the precedence to comedy een let us begin trap ay ay with all my heart come come wheres the gentleman who speaks the prologue this prologue mr fustian was given me by a friend who does not care to own it till he tries whether it succeeds or no enter player for the prologue come sir make a very low bow to the audience and shew as much concern as possible in your looks prologue as crafty lawyers to acquire applause try various arts to get a doubtful cause or as a dancing master in a jigg with various steps instructs the dancing prig or as a doctor writes you different bills or as a quack prescribes you different pills or as a fiddler plays more tunes than one or as a baker bakes more bread than brown or as a tumbler tumbles up and down so does our author rummaging his brain by various methods try to entertain brings a strange groupe of characters before you and shews you here at once both whig and tory or court and country party you may call em but without fear and favour he will maul em to you then mighty sages of the pit trap oh dear sir seem a little more affected i beseech you advance to the front of the stage make a low bow lay your hand upon your heart fetch a deep sigh and pull out your handkerchief to you then mighty sages of the pit prol to you then mighty sages of the pit our author humbly does his cause submit he trys to please oh take it not amiss and though it should be dull oh do not hiss laugh if you can if you cannot laugh weep when you can wake no longer fall asleep trap very well very well sir you have affected me i am sure fust and so he will the audience ill answer for them trap oh sir youre too goodnatured but sir i do assure you i had writ a much better prologue of my own but as this came gratis have reserved it for my next play a prologue saved is a prologue got brother fustian but come where are your actors is mr mayor and the aldermen at the table promp yes sir but they want wine and we can get none from the quakers cellar without ready money trap rat him cant he trust till the third night here take sixpence and fetch two pots of porter put it into bottles and it will do for wine well enough fust ay faith and the wine will be as good as the wit ill answer for it aside trap mr fustian youll observe i do not begin this play like most of our modern comedies with three or four gentlemen who are brought on only to talk wit for to tell you the truth sir i have very little if any wit in this play no sir this is a play consisting of humour nature and simplicity it is written sir in the exact and true spirit of moliere and this i will say for it that except about a dozen or a score or so there is not one impure joke in it but come clear the stage and draw the back scene mr fustian if you please to sit down by me mayor and aldermen discovered fust pray sir who are these characters trap sir they are mr mayor of the town and his brethren consulting about the election fust are they all of a side sir trap yes sir as yet for you must know sir that all the men in this borough are very sensible people and have no party principles for which they cannot give a good reason mr mayor you begin the play may gentlemen i have summoned you together to consider of proper representatives for this borough you know the candidates on the court side are my lord place and colonel promise the country candidates are sir henry foxchace and squire tankard all worthy gentlemen and i wish with all my heart we could chuse them all four ald but since we cannot mr mayor i think we should stand by our neighbours gentlemen whose honesty we are witnesses of and whose estates in our own neighbourhood render em not liable to be bribed fust this gentleman mr trapwit does not seem so unbiassed in his principles as you represented him trap pugh sir you must have one fool in a play beside i only writ him to set off the rest may mr alderman you have a narrow way of thinking honesty is not confined to a country a man that lives a hundred miles off may be as honest as him who lives but three ald ay ay ay ay shaking their heads may besides gentlemen are we not more obliged to a foreigner for the favours he does us than to one of our own neighbours who has obligations to us i believe gentlemen there is not one of us who does not eat and drink with sir harry at least twenty times in a twelvemonth now for my part i never saw or heard of either my lord or the colonel till within this fortnight and yet they are as obliging and civil and familiar as if we had been born and bred together ald nay they are very civil wellbred men that is the truth ont but wont they bring a standing army upon us may mr alderman you are deceived the country party will bring a standing army upon us whereas if we chuse my lord and the colonel we shant have a soldier in town but mum here are my lord and the colonel enter lord place and col promise place gentlemen your most humble servant i have brought the colonel to take a mornings whet with you may your lordship and the colonel do us great honour pray my lord be pleased to sit down pray colonel be pleased to sit more wine here fust i wish mr trapwit your actors dont get drunk in the first act trap dear sir dont interrupt the rehearsal place gentlemen prosperity to the corporation fust sir i am a wellwisher to the corporation and if you please will pledge his lordship success to your comedy mr trapwit drinks trap give me a glass sir heres to your tragedy now pray no more interruption for this scene is one continual joke and if you open your lips in it you will break the thread of the jest may my lord we are sensible of your great power to serve this corporation and we do not doubt but we shall feel the effect ont place gentlemen you may depend on me i shall do all in my power i shall do you some services which are not proper at present to mention to you in the meantime mr mayor give me leave to squeeze you by the hand in assurance of my sincerity trap you mr that act my lord bribe a little more openly if you please or the audience will lose that joke and it is one of the strongest in my whole play place sir i cannot possibly do it better at the table trap then get all up and come forward to the front of the stage now you gentlemen that act the mayor and aldermen range yourselves in a line and you my lord and the colonel come to one end and bribe away with right and left fust is this wit mr trapwit trap yes sir it is wit and such wit as will run all over the kingdom fust but methinks colonel promise as you call him is but illnamed for he is a man of very few words trap youll be of another opinion before the play is over at present his hands are too full of business and you may remember sir i before told you this is none of your plays wherein much is said and nothing done gentlemen are you all bribed omnes yes sir trap then my lord and the colonel you must go off and make room for the other candidates to come on and bribe too exeunt place and promise fust is there nothing but bribery in this play of yours mr trapwit trap sir this play is an exact representation of nature i hope the audience will date the time of action before the bill of bribery and corruption took place and then i believe it may go down but now mr fustian i shall shew you the art of a writer which is to diversify his matter and do the same thing several ways you must know sir i distinguish bribery into two kinds the direct and the indirect the first you have seen already and now sir i shall give you a small specimen of the other prompter call sir harry and the squire but gentlemen what are you doing how often shall i tell you that the moment the candidates are gone out you are to retire to the table and drink and look wise you mr mayor ought to look very wise fust youll take care he shall talk foolish enough ill warrant you aside may come heres a round to my lord and the colonels health a place and a promise i say they may talk of the pride of courtiers but i am sure i never had a civiller squeeze by the hand in my life trap ay you have squeezed that out pretty well but shew the gold at these words sir if you please may i have none trap pray mr prompter take care to get some counters against it is acted fust ha ha ha upon my word the courtiers have topt their part the actor has outdone the author this bribing with an empty hand is quite in the character of a courtier trap come enter sir harry and the squire where are they i play sir mr soundwell has been regularly summoned but he has refused to act the part trap has he been writ to i play yes sir and heres his answer

syllable trap why you would not have every man a speaker would you one of a side is sufficient and let me tell you sir one is full enough to utter all that the party has to say for itself fust methinks sir you should let the audience know they can speak if it were but an ay or a no trap sir the audience must know that already for if they could not say ay and no they would not be qualified for candidates fust oh your humble servant i am answered but pray sir what is the action of this play trap the action sir fust yes sir the fable the design trap oh you ask who is to be married why sir i have a marriage i hope you think i understand the laws of comedy better than to write without marrying somebody fust but is that the main design to which everything conduces trap yes sir fust faith sir i cant for the soul of me see how what has hitherto past can conduce at all to that end trap you cant indeed i believe you cant for that is the whole plot of my play and do you think i am like your shallow writers of comedy who publish the bans of marriage between all the couples in their play in the first act no sir i defy you to guess my couple till the thing is done slap all at once and that too by an incident arising from the main business of the play and to which everything conduces fust that will indeed surprise me trap sir you are not the first man my writings have surprised but

my lord come begin place pray mrs mayoress what do you think this lace cost a yard fust a very pretty beginning of polite conversation truly trap sir in this play i keep exactly up to nature nor is there anything said in this scene that i have not heard come out of the mouths of the finest people of the age sir this scene has cost me ten shillings in chairhire to keep the best company as it is called mrs m indeed my lord i cannot guess it at less than ten pounds a yard place pray madam was you at the last ridotto fust ridotto the devil a country mayoress at a ridotto sure that is out of character mr trapwit trap sir a conversation of this nature cannot be earned on without these helps besides sir this country mayoress as you call her may be allowed to know something of the town for you must know sir that she has been woman to a woman of quality fust i am glad to hear that mrs m oh my lord mention not those dear ridottos to me who have been confined these twelve long months in the country where we have no entertainment but a set of hideous strolling players nor have i seen any one human creature till your lordship came to town heaven send us a controverted election then i shall go to that dear delightful place once more miss m yes mama and then we shall see faribelly the strange manwoman that they say is with child and the fine pictures of merlins cave at the playhouses and the ropedancing and the tumbling fust by misss taste i believe she has been bred up under a woman of quality too place i cannot but with pleasure observe madam the polite taste miss shows in her choice of entertainments i dare swear she will be much admired in the beau monde and i dont question but will be soon taken into keeping by some man of quality miss m keeping my lord place ay that surprize looks well enough in one so young that does not know the world but miss every one now keeps and is kept there are no such things as marriages nowadays unless merely smithfield contracts and that for the support of families but then the husband and wife both take into keeping within a fortnight mrs m my lord i would have my girl act like other young ladies but she does not know any men of quality who shall introduce her to em place that madam must be your part you must take a house and see company in a little while you may keep an assembly and play at cards as high as you can and almost all the money that is won must be put into the box which you must call paying for the cards though it is indeed paying for your candles your cloaths your lodgings and in short everything you have i know some persons who make a very considerable figure in town whose whole estate lies in their cardbox mrs m and have i been so long contented to be the wife of a poor country tradesman when i might have had all this happiness fust how comes this lady mr trapwit considering her education to be so ignorant of all these things trap gad thats true i had forgot her education faith when i writ that speech its a fault i sometimes fall into a man ought to have the memory of a devil to remember every little thing but come go on go on ill alter it by and by place indeed madam it is a miserable state of life i hope we shall have no such people as tradesmen shortly i cant see any use they are of if i am chose ill bring in a bill to extirpate all trade out of the nation mrs m yes my lord that would do very well amongst people of quality who dont want money fust again sure mrs mayoress knows very little of people of quality considering she has lived amongst them trap lord sir you are so troublesome then she has not lived amongst people of quality she has lived where i please but suppose we should suppose she had been woman to a lady of quality may we not also suppose she was turned away in a fortnight and then what could she know sir go on go on place alackaday madam when i mention trade i only mean low dull mechanick trade such as the canaille practise there are several trades reputable enough which people of fashion may practise such as gaming intriguing voting and running in debt trap come enter a servant and whisper my lord enter a servant pray sir mind

into keeping mama mrs m child you must do whats in fashion miss m but i have heard thats a naughty thing mrs m that cant be if your betters do it people are punished for doing naughty things but people of quality are never punished therefore they never do any naughty things fust an admirable syllogism and quite in character trap pshaw dear sir dont trouble me with character its a good thing and if its a good thing what signifies who says it come enter the mayor drunk enter mayor may liberty and property and no excise wife mrs m ah filthy beast come not near me may but i will though i am

afraid of your liberties and your properties you are afraid of your wives and daughters i love to see soldiers in the town and you may say what you will i know the town loses nothing by em may the women dont i believe mrs m and ill have you know the womens wants shall be considered as well as yours i think my lord and the colonel do you too much honour in offering to represent such a set of clownish dirty beggarly animals ah i wish we women were to choose may ay we should have a fine set of members then indeed mrs m yes sir you would have none but pretty gentlemen there should not be one man in the house of commons without a laced coat miss m o la what a delicate fine charming sight that would be well i like a laced coat and if ever i am taken into keeping it shall be by a man in a laced coat may whats that you say minx whats that you say mrs m whats that to you sir may why madam must not i speak to my own daughter mrs m you have the greater obligation to me sir if she is i am sure if i had thought you would have endeavoured to ruin your family i would have seen you hanged before you should have had any by me may i ruin my family mrs m yes i have been making your fortune for you with my lord i have got a place for you but you wont accept ont miss m you shall accept ont mrs m you shall vote for my lord and the colonel miss m they are the finest men mrs m the prettiest

the place first exit mrs m come my dear follow me ill see whether he shall vote according to his conscience or mine ill teach mankind while policy they boast they bear the name of power we rule the roast trap there ends act the second exeunt mrs andmiss mayoress mr fustian i inculcate a particular moral at the end of every act and therefore might have put a particular motto before every one as the author of caesar in egypt has done thus sir my first act sweetly sings bribe all bribe all and the second gives you to understand that we are all under petticoatgovernment and my third will but you shall see enter my lord place colonel promise and several voters my lord you begin the third act enter lord place col promise and several voters place gentlemen be assured i will take care of you

your people and let the colonel advance fust ay faith i think it is high time for the colonel to be heard col depend upon it sir ill serve you fust upon my word the colonel begins very well but has not that been said already trap ay and if i was to bring a hundred courtiers into my play they should all say it none of them do it voter ant please your honour i have read in a book called fogs journal that your honours men are to be made of wax now sir i have served my time to a waxwork maker and desire to make your honours regiment col sir you may depend on me voter are your officers to be made of wax too sir because i would prepare a finer sort for them col no none but the chaplain voter o i have a most delicate piece of black wax for him trap you see sir the colonel can speak when military affairs are on the carpet hitherto mr fustian the play has gone on in great tranquillity now you shall see a scene of a more turbulent nature come enter the mob of both sides and cudgel one another off the stage colonel as your business is not to fight at present i beg you would go off before the battle comes on you and your brother candidate come into the middle of the stage you voters range yourselves under your several leaders the mob attempt to break in pray gentlemen keep back mind the colonels going off is the cue for the battle to enter now my lord and the colonel you are at the head of your parties but hold hold hold you beefeater go you behind my lord if you please and you soldiermaker come you behind the colonel now gentlemen speak place and col gentlemen well serve you my lord and the colonel flle off at different doors the parties following enter mob on each side of the stage crying out promiscuously down with the rump no courtiers no jacobites down with the pope no excise a place and a promise a foxchace and a tankard at last they fall together by the ears and cudgel one another off the stage enter sir harry squire tankard and mayor sir h bravely done my boys bravely done faith our party has got the day may ay sir harry at dry blows we always come off well if we could but disband the army i warrant we carried all our points but faith sir i have fought a hard battle on your account the other side have secured my wife my lord has promised her a place but i am not to be gulled in that manner i may be taken like a fish in the water by a bait but not like the dog in the water by a shadow sir h i know you are an honest man and love your country may faith that i do sir harry as well as any man if my country will but let me live by it thats all i desire fust mr mayor seems to have got himself sober very suddenly trap yes so would you too i believe if you had been scolded at by your wife as long as he has but if you think that is not reason enough he may be drunk still for any reason i see to the contrary pray sir act this scene as if you was drunk fust nay i must confess i think it quite out of character the mayor to be once sober during the whole election tank drunk a man that wont get drunk for his country is a rascal may so he is noble squire theres no honesty in a man that wont be drunk a man that wont drink is an enemy to the trade of the nation sir h those were glorious days when honest english hospitality flourished when a country gentleman could afford to make his neighbours drunk before your damned french fashions were brought over why mr mayor would you think it there are many of these courtiers who have six starved footmen behind a coach and not half a hogshead of wine in their house why how do you think all the money is spent may faith i cant tell sir h why in houses pictures lace embroidery nicknacks italian singers and french tumblers and those who vote for them will never get a dinner of them after the election is over may but there is a thought comes often into my head which is this if these courtiers be turned out who shall succeed them sir h who why we tank ay we sir h and then we may provide for our friends i love my country but i dont know why i may not get something by it as well as another at least to reimburse me and i do assure you though i have not bribed a single vote my election will stand me in a good five thousand pounds tank ay and so will mine me but if ever we should get uppermost sir harry i insist upon immediately paying off the debts of the nation sir h mr tankard that shall be done with all convenient speed tank ill have no delay in it sir may there spoke the spirit of a true englishman ah i love to hear the squire speak he will be a great honour to his country in foreign parts sir h our friends stay for us at the tavern well go and talk more over a bottle tank with all my heart but i will pay off the debts of the nation may come to the tavern then there while brisk wine improves our conversation we at our pleasure will reform the nation trap there ends act the third exeunt sir harry tankard and mayor fust pray sir whats the moral of this act trap and you really dont know fust no really trap then i really will not tell you but come sir since you cannot find that out ill try whether you can find out the plot for now it is just going to begin to open it will require a very close attention i assure you and the devil take me if i give you any assistance fust is not the fourth act a little too late to open the plot mr trapwit trap sir tis an error on the right side i have known a plot open in the first act and the audience and the poet too forget it before the third was over now sir i am not willing to burden either the audiences memory or my own for they may forget all that is hitherto past and know full as much of the plot as if they remembered it promp call mr mayor mrs mayoress and miss enter mayor mrs and miss mayoress mrs m oh have i found you at last sir i have been hunting for you this hour may faith my dear i wish you had found me sooner i have been drinking to the good old cause with sir harry and the squire

you never learn of me that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush may yes but i cant find that you had the bird in hand if that had been the case i dont know what i might have done but i am sure any mans promise is as good as a courtiers mrs m lookye mr embassador that is to be will you vote as i would have you or no i am weary of arguing with a fool any longer so sir i tell you you must vote for my lord and the colonel or ill make the house too hot to hold you ill see whether my poor family is to be ruined because you have whims miss m i know he is a jacobite in his heart mrs m what signifies what he is in his heart have not a hundred whom everybody knows to be as great jacobites as he acted like very good whigs what has a mans heart to do with his lips i dont trouble my head with what he thinks i only desire him to vote miss m i am sure mama is a very reasonable woman mrs m yes i am too reasonable a woman and have used gentle methods too long but ill try others goes to a corner of the stage and takes a stick may nay then liberty and property and no excise runs off mrs m ill excise you you villain runs after him miss m hey ho i wish somebody were here now would the man that i love best in the world were here that i might use him like a dog fust is not that a very odd wish mr trapwit trap no sir dont all the young ladies in plays use all their lovers so should we not

acquaintance i cant see why people may not keep their principles to themselves aside miss m pray miss sit down well have you any news in town miss s i dont know my dear for i have not been out these three days and i have been employed all that time in reading one of the craftsmen tis a very pretty one i have almost got it by heart miss m aside saucy flirt she might have spared that to me when she

it is in vain to deny it to me miss m i desire madam we may discourse no longer on this subject for we shall never agree on it miss s well then pray let me ask you seriously are you thoroughly satisfied with this peace miss m yes madam and i think you ought to be so too miss s i should like it well enough if i were sure the queen of spain was to be trusted miss m rising pray miss none of your insinuations against the queen of spain miss s dont be in a passion madam miss m yes madam but i will be in a passion when the interest of my country is at stake miss s rising perhaps madam i have a heart as warm in the interest of my country as you can have though i pay money for the papers i read and thats more than you can say miss m miss miss my papers are paid for too by somebody though i dont pay for them i dont suppose the old woman as you call her sends em about at her own expence but id have you to know miss i value my money as little as you in my countrys cause and rather than have no army i would part with every farthing of these sixteen shillings to maintain it miss s and if my sweetheart was to vote for the colonel though i like this fan of all the fans i ever saw in my life i would tear it all to pieces because it was his valentines gift to me oh heavens i have torn my fan i would not have torn my fan for the world oh my poor dear fan i wish all parties were

will you give it me for nothing miss m ill make you a free present of it miss s i am ashamed of your conquest but ill take the fan miss m and now my dear well go and drink a dish of tea together and let all parties blame me if they can whore bribed by honours trifling as a fan exeunt misses trap there ends act the fourth if you want to know the moral of this the devil must be in you faith this incident of the fan struck me so strongly that i was once going to call this comedy by the name of the fan but come now for act the fifth promp sir the player who is to begin it is just stepped aside on some business he begs you would stay a few minutes for him trap come fustian you and i will step into the greenroom and chat with the actresses meanwhile fust but dont you think these girls improper persons to talk of parties trap sir i assure you it is not out of nature and i have often heard these affairs canvast by men who had not one whit more understanding than these girls exeunt act iii scene i enter trapwit fustian and sneerwell trap fie upont fie upont make no excuses sneer consider sir i am my own enemy trap i do consider that you might have past your time perhaps here as well as in another place sneer but i hope i have not transgressed much trap alls over sir alls over you might as well have stayed away entirely the fifth acts beginning and the plots at an end sneer whats the plot at an end before the fifth act is begun trap no no no no i dont mean at an end but we are so far advanced in it that it will be impossible for you to comprehend or understand anything of it fust you have too mean an opinion of mr sneerwells capacity ill engage he shall understand as much of it as i who have heard the other four trap sir i cant help your want of understanding or apprehension tis not my fault if you cannot take a hint sir would you have a catastrophe in every act oons and the devil have not i promised you you should know all by and by but you are so impatient fust i think you have no reason to complain of my want of patience mr sneerwell be easy tis but one short act before my tragedy begins and that i hope will make you amends for what you are to undergo before it trapwit i wish you would begin trap i wish so too come prompter are the members in their chairs promp yes sir trap then carry them over the stage but hold hold hold where is the woman to strew the flowers the members are carried over the stage halloo mob halloo halloo oons mr prompter you must get more mob to halloo or these gentlemen will never be believed to have had the majority promp sir i can get no more mob all the rest of the mob are gone to st jamesspark to see the show sneer pray mr trapwit who are these gentlemen in the chairs trap ay sir this is your staying away so long if you had been here the first four acts you would have known who they were fust dear sneerwell ask him no more questions if you enquire into every absurdity you see we shall have no tragedy today trap come mr mayor and mrs mayoress enter mayor and mrs mayoress may so now you have undone yourself your own way you have made me vote against my conscience and interest too and now i have lost both parties mrs m how have you lost both parties may why my lord will never remember my voting for him now he has lost the day and sir harry who has won it will never forgive my voting against him let which side will be uppermost i shall have no place till the next election mrs m it will be your own fault then sir for you have it now in your power to oblige my lord more than ever go and return my lord and the colonel as duly elected and i warrant you i do your business with him yet may return em my dear why there was a majority of two or three score against em mrs m a fig for a majority of two or three score if there had been a majority of as many hundreds youll never be called to an account for returning them and when you have returned em youll have done all in your power how can you expect that great men should do anything to serve you if you stick at anything to serve them may my conscience boggles at this thing but yet it is impossible i should ever get anything by the other side mrs m ay let that satisfy your conscience that it is the only way to get anything may truly i think it is sneer i think mr trapwit interest would be a better word there than conscience trap ay interest or conscience they are words of the same meaning but i think conscience rather politer of the two and most used at court mrs m besides it will do a service to your town for half of them must be carried to london at the candidates expence and i dare swear there is not one of them whatever side he votes of but would be glad to put the candidate to as much expence as he can in an honest way exit mayor enter miss mayoress crying miss m oh mama i have grieved myself to death at the court partys losing the day for if the others should have a majority in the house what would become of us alas we should not go to london mrs m dry up your tears my dear all will be well your father shall return my lord and the colonel and we shall have a controverted election and we will go to london my dear miss m shall we go to london then i am easy but if we had staid here i should have broke my heart for the love of my country since my father returns them i hope justice will find some friends above where people have sense enough to know the right side from the left however happen what will there is some consolation in going to london mrs m but i hope you have considered well what my lord told you that you will not scruple going into keeping perhaps you will have it in your power to serve your family and it would be a great sin not to do all you can for your family miss m i have dreamt of nothing but coaches and six and balls and treats and shows and masquerades ever since fust dreamt sir why i thought the time of your comedy had been confined to the same day mr trapwit trap no sir it is not but suppose it was might she not have taken an afternoons nap sneer ay or dreamt waking as several people do enter lord place and col promise place madam i am come to take my leave of you i am very sensible of my many obligations to you and shall remember them till the next election when i will wait on you again nay i dont question but we shall carry our point yet though they have given us the trouble of a petition mrs m no no my lord you are not yet reduced to that i have prevailed on my husband to return you and the colonel place to return us madam mrs m yes my lord as duly elected and when we have returned you so it will be your own fault if you dont prove yourself so place madam this news has so transported my spirits that i fear some ill effect unless you instantly give me a dram mrs m if your lordship please to walk with me into my closet ill equip your lordship exit trap how do you like that dram sir sneer oh most excellent fust i cant say so unless i tasted it trap faith sir if it had not been for that dram my play had been at an end fust the devil take the dram with all my heart trap now mr fustian the plot which has hitherto been only carried on by hints and opened itself like the infant spring by small and imperceptible degrees to the audience will display itself like a ripe matron in its full summers bloom and cannot i think fail with its attractive charms like a loadstone to catch the admiration of every one like a trap and raise an applause like thunder till it makes the whole house like a hurricane i must desire a strict silence through this whole scene colonel stand you still on this side of the stage and miss do you stand on the opposite there now look at each other a long silence here fust pray mr trapwit is nobody ever to speak again trap oh the devil you have interrupted the scene after all my precautions the scenes destroyed the best scene of silence that ever was penned by man come come you may speak now you may speak as fast as you please col madam the army is very much obliged to you for the zeal you shew for it me it has made your slave for ever nor can i ever think of being happy unless you consent to marry me miss m ha and can you be so generous to forgive all my ill usage of you fust what ill usage mr trapwit for if i mistake not this is the first time these lovers spoke to one another trap what ill usage sir a great deal sir fust when sir where sir trap why behind the scenes sir what would you have everything brought upon the stage i intend to bring ours to the dignity of the french stage and i have horaces advice on my side we have many things both said and done in our comedies which might be better performed behind the scenes the french you know banish all cruelty from their stage and i dont see why we should bring on a lady in ours practising all manner of cruelty upon her lover besides sir we do not only produce it but encourage it for i could name you some comedies if i would where a woman is brought in for four acts together behaving to a worthy man in a manner for which she almost deserves to be hanged and in the fifth forsooth she is rewarded with him for a husband now sir as i know this hits some tastes and am willing to oblige all i have given every lady a latitude of thinking mine has behaved in whatever manner she would have her sneer well said my little trap but pray let us have the scene trap go on miss if you please miss m i have struggled with myself to put you to so many trials of your constancy nay perhaps have indulged myself a little too far in the innocent liberties of abusing you tormenting you coquetting lying and jilting which as you are so good to forgive i do faithfully promise to make you all the amends in my power by making you a good wife trap that single promise sir is more than any of my brother authors had ever the grace to put into the mouth of any of their fine ladies yet so that the hero of a comedy is left in a much worse condition

epilogue sneer what i have you writ none trap yes faith i have writ one but sneer but what trap faith sir i can get no one to speak it the actresses are so damnd difficult to please when first i writ it they would not speak it because there were not doubleentendres enough in it upon which i went to mr watts and borrowed all his plays went home read over all the epilogues and crammed it as full as possible and now forsooth it has too many in it oons i think we must get a pair of scales and weigh out a sufficient quantity of that same fust come come mr trapwit clear the stage if you please trap with all my heart for i have overstayed my time already i am to read my play today to six different companies of quality fust youll stay and see the tragedy rehearsed i hope trap faith sir it is my great misfortune that i cant i deny myself a great pleasure but cannot possibly stay to hear such damnd stuff as i know it must be aside sneer nay dear trapwit you shall not go consider your advice may be of some service to mr fustian besides he has stayed the rehearsal of your play fust yes i have and kept myself awake with much difficulty aside trap nay nay you know i cant refuse you though i shall certainly fall asleep in the first act aside sneer if youll let me know who your people of quality are ill endeavour to bring you off trap no no hang me if i tell you ha ha ha i know you too well but prithee now tell me fustian how dost thou like my play dost think it will do fust tis my opinion it will trap give me a guinea and ill give you a crown a night as long as it runs sneer thats laying against yourself mr trapwit trap i love a hedge sir fust before the rehearsal begins gentlemen i must beg your opinion of my dedication you know a dedication is generally a bill drawn for value therein contained which value is a set of nauseous fulsome compliments which my soul abhors and scorns for i mortally hate flattery and therefore have carefully avoided it sneer yes faith a dedication without flattery will be worth the seeing fust well sir you shall see it read it dear trapwit i hate to read my own works trap reads my lord at a time when nonsense dullness lewdness and all manner of profaneness and immorality are daily practised on the stage i have prevailed on my modesty to offer to your lordships protection a piece which if it has no merit to recommend it has at least no demerit to disgrace it nor do i question at this when every one else is dull you will be pleased to find one exception to the number i cannot indeed help assuming to myself some little merit from the applause which the town has so universally conferred upon me fust that you know mr sneer well may be omitted if it should meet with any illnatured opposition for which reason i shall not print off my dedication till after the play is acted trap reads i might here indulge myself with a delineation of your lordships character but as i abhor the least imputation of flattery and as i am certain your lordship is the only person in this nation that does not love to hear your praises i shall be silent only this give me leave to say that you have more wit sense learning honour and humanity than all mankind put together and your person comprehends in it everything that is beautiful your air is everything that is graceful your look everything that is majestic and your mind is a storehouse where every virtue and every perfection are lodged to pass by your generosity which is so great so glorious so diffusive that like the sun it eclipses and makes stars of all your other virtues i could say more sneer faith sir thats more than i could trap but shall commit a violence upon myself and conclude with assuring your lordship that i am my lord your lordships most obedient most devoted most obsequious and most obliged humble servant fust there you see it sir concise and not fulsome sneer very true sir if you had said less it would not have done fust no i think less would have been downright rude considering it was to a person of the first quality sneer prithee trap wit lets see yours trap i have none sir fust how sir no dedication trap no sir for i have dedicated so many plays and received nothing for them that i am resolved to trust no more ill let no more flattery go out of my shop without being paid beforehand fust sir flattery is so cheap and every man of quality keeps so many flatterers about him that egad our trade is quite spoild but if i am not paid for this dedication the next i write shall be a satirical one if they wont pay me for opening my mouth ill make them pay me for shutting it but since you have been so kind gentlemen to like my dedication ill venture to let you see my prologue sir i beg the favour of you to repeat the prologue if you are perfect in it to a player play sir ill do it to the best of my power fust this prologue was writ by a friend prologue when deaths sharp scythe has mowed the hero down the muse again awakes him to renown she tells proud fate that all her darts are vain and bids the hero live and strut about again nor is she only able to restore but she can make what neer was made before can search the realms of fancy and create what never came into the brain of fate forth from these realms to entertain tonight she brings imaginary kings and queens to light bids common sense in person mount the stage and harlequin to storm in tragick rage britons attend and decent reverence shew to her who made th athenian bosoms glow whom the undaunted romans could revere and who in shakespeares time was worshippd here if none of these can her success presage your hearts at least a wonder may engage oh i love her like her sister monsters of the age sneer faith sir your friend has writ a very fine prologue fust do you think so why then sir i must assure you that friend is no other than myself but come now for the tragedy gentlemen i must desire you all to clear the stage for i have several scenes which i could wish it was as big again for d player enters and whispers trapwit play sir a gentlewoman desires to speak to you trap is she in a chair play no sir she is in a ridinghood and says she has brought you a clean shirt exit trap ill come to her mr fustian you must excuse me a moment a lady of quality hath sent to take some boxes exit promp common sense sir desires to speak with you in the greenroom fust ill wait upon her sneer you ought for it is the first message i believe you ever received from her aside exeunt fus and sneer enter a dancer dane looke mr prompter i expect to dance first goddess i will not dance under miss minuet i am sure i shew more to the audience than any lady upon the stage promp madam it is not my business dane i dont know whose business it is but i think the town ought to be the judges of a dancers merit i am sure they are on my side and if i am not used better ill go to france for now we have got all their dancers away perhaps they may be glad of some of ours promp heyday whats the matter a noise within enter player play the author and common sense are quarrelling in the greenroom promp nay then thats better worth seeing than anything in the play exit promp danc hang this play and all plays the dancers are the only people that support the house if it were not for us they might act their shakspeare to empty benches act iv scene i enter fustian and sneerwell fust these little things mr sneerwell will sometimes happen indeed a poet undergoes a great deal before he comes to his third night first with the muses who are humorous ladies and must be attended for if they take it into their head at any time to go abroad and leave you you will pump your brain in vain then sir with the master of a playhouse to get it acted whom you generally follow a quarter of a year before you know whether he will receive it or no and then perhaps he tells you it wont do and returns it to you again reserving the subject and perhaps the name which he brings out in his next pantomime but if he should receive the play then you must attend again to get it writ out into parts and rehearsed well sir at last the rehearsals begin then sir begins another scene of trouble with the actors some of whom dont like their parts and all are continually plaguing you with alterations at length after having waded through all these difficulties his play appears on the stage where one man hisses out of resentment to the author a second out of dislike to the house a third out of dislike to the actor a fourth out of dislike to the play a fifth for the joke sake a sixth to keep all the rest in company enemies abuse him friends give him up the play is damned and the author goes to the devil so ends the farce sneer the tragedy rather i think mr fustian but whats become of trapwit fust gone off i suppose i knew he would not stay he is so taken up with his own performances that he has no time to attend any others but come prompter will the tragedy never begin enter prompter promp yes sir they are all ready come draw up the curtain firebrand law and physick discovered sneer pray mr fustian who are these personages fust that in the middle sir is firebrand priest of the sun he on the right represents law and he on the left physick fireb avert these omens ye auspicious stars fust what omens where the devil is the thunder and lightning promp why dont you let go the thunder there and flash your rosin thunder and lightning fust now sir begin if you please i desire sir you will get a larger thunderbowl and two pennyworth more of lightning against the representation now sir if you please fireb avert these omens ye auspicious stars o law o physick as last even late i offerd sacred incense in the temple the temple shook strange prodigies appeared a cat in boots did dance a rigadoon while a huge dog playd on the violin and whilst i trembling at the altar stood voices were heard i th air and seemd to say awake my drowsy sons and sleep no more they must mean something law certainly they must we have our omens too the other day a mighty deluge swam into our hall as if it meant to wash away the law lawyers were forced to ride on porters shoulders one o prodigious omen tumbled down and he and all his briefs were sousd together now if i durst my sentiments declare i think it is not hard to guess the meaning fireb speak boldly by the powers i serve i swear you speak in safety even though you speak against the gods provided that you speak not against priests law what then can the powers mean by these omens but to rouse us up from the lethargick sway of common sense and well they urge for while that drowsy queen maintains her empire what becomes of us phys my lord of law you speak my sentiments for though i wear the mask of loyalty and outward shew a reverence to the queen yet in my heart i hate her yes by heaven she stops my proud ambition keeps me down when i would soar upon an eagles wing and thence look down and dose the world below law thou knowst my lord of physick i had long been privileged by custom immemorial in tongues unknown or rather none at all my edicts to deliver through the land when this proud queen this common sense abridged my power and made me understood by all phys my lord there goes a rumour through the court that you descended from a family related to the queen reason is said t have been the mighty founder of your house law perhaps so but we have raised ourselves so high and shook this founder from us off so far we hardly deign to own from whence we came fireb my lords of law and physick i have heard with perfect approbation all youve said and since i know you men of noble spirit and fit to undertake a glorious cause i will divulge myself know through this mask which to impose on vulgar minds i wear i am an enemy to common sense but this not for ambitions earthly cause but to enlarge the worship of the sun to give his priests a just degree of power and more than half the profits of the land oh my good lord of law wouldst thou assist in spite of common sense it may be done law propose the method fireb here survey this list in it youll find a certain set of names whom well i know sure friends to common sense these it must be our care to represent the greatest enemies to the gods and her but hush the queen approaches enter queen common sense attended by twomaids of honour fust what but two maids of honour promp sir a jew carried off the other but i shall be able to pick up some more against the play is acted q c s my lord of law i sent for you this morning i have a strange petition given to me two men it seems have lately been at law for an estate which both of them have lost and their attorneys now divide between them law madam these things will happen in the law q c s will they my lord then better we had none but i have also heard a sweet bird sing that men unable to discharge their debts at a short warning being sued for them have with both power and will their debts to pay lain all their lives in prison for their costs law that may perhaps be some poor persons case too mean to entertain your royal ear q c s my lord while i am queen i shall not think one man too mean or poor to be redressd moreover lord i am informed your laws are grown so large and daily yet increase that the great age of old methusalem would scarce suffice to read your statutes out fireb madam a more important cause demands your royal care strange omens have appeard sights have been seen and voices have been heard the gods are angry and must be appeasd nor do i know to that a readier way than by beginning to appease their priests who groan for power and cry out after honour q c s the gods indeed have reason for their anger and sacrifices shall be offerd to them but would you make em welcome priest be meek be charitable kind nor dare affront the sun you worship while yourselves prevent that happiness to men you ask of him enter an officer q c s what means this hasty message in your looks offic forgive me madam if my tongue declares news for your sake which most my heart abhors queen ignorance is landed in your realm with a vast power from italy and france of singers fidlers tumblers and ropedancers q c s order our army instantly to get themselves in readiness our self will head em my lords you are concerned as well as we toppose this foreign force and we expect you join us with your utmost levies straight go priest and drive all frightful omens hence to fright the vulgar they are your pretence but sure the gods will side with common sense exit cum suis fireb they know their interest better or at least their priests do for em and themselves oh lords this queen of ignorance whom you have heard just now described in such a horrid form is the most gentle and most pious queen so fearful of the gods that she believes whateer their priests affirm and by the sun faith is no faith if it falls short of that id be infallible and that i know will neer be granted me by common sense wherefore i do disclaim her and will join the cause of ignorance and now my lords each to his post the rostrum i ascend my lord of law you to your courts repair and you my good lord physick to the queen handle her pulse potion and pill her well phys oh my good lord had i her royal ear would she but take the counsel i would give youd need no foreign power to overthrow her yes by the gods i would with one small pill unhinge her soul and tear it from her body but to my art and me a deadly foe she has averrd ay in the publick court that water gruel is the best physician for which when shes forgiven by the college or when we own the sway of common sense may we be forced to take our own prescriptions fireb my lord of physick i applaud thy spirit yes by the sun my heart laughs loud within me to see how easily the worlds deceived to see this common sense thus tumbled down by men whom all the cheated nations own to be the strongest pillars of her throne exeunt fireb law and phys fust thus ends the first act sir sneer this tragedy of yours mr fustian i observe to be emblematical do you think it will be understood by the audience fust sir i cannot answer for the audience though i think the panegyrick intended by it is very plain and very seasonable sneer what panegyrick fust on our clergy sir at least the best of them to shew the difference between a heathen and a christian priest and as i have touched only on generals i hope i shall not be thought to bring anything improper on the stage which i would carefully avoid sneer but is not your satire on law and physick somewhat too general fust what is said here cannot hurt either an honest lawyer or a good physician and such may be nay i know such are if the opposites to these are the most general i cannot help that as for the professors themselves i have no great reason to be their friend for they once joined in a particular conspiracy against me sneer ah how so fust why an apothecary brought me in a long bill and a lawyer made me pay it sneer ha ha ha a conspiracy indeed fust now sir for my second act my tragedy consists but of three sneer i thought that had been immethodical in tragedy fust that may be but i spun it out as long as i could keep common sense alive ay or even her ghost come begin the second act the scene draws and discovers queen common sense asleep sneer pray sir whos that upon the couch there fust i thought you had known her better sir thats common sense asleep sneer i should rather have expected her at the head of her army fust very likely but you do not understand the practical rules of writing as well as i do the first and greatest of which is protraction or the art of spinning without which the matter of a play would lose the chief property of all other matter namely extension and no play sir could possibly last longer than half an hour i perceive mr sneerwell you are one of those who would have no character brought on but what is necessary to the business of the play nor i neither but the business of the play as i take it is to divert and therefore every character that diverts is necessary to the business of the play sneer but how will the audience be brought to conceive any probable reason for this sleep fust why sir she has been meditating on the present general peace of europe till by too intense an application being not able thoroughly to comprehend it she was overpowered and fell fast asleep come ring up the first ghost ghost arises you know that ghost sneer upon my word sir i cant recollect any acquaintance with him fust i am surprized at that for you must have seen him often thats the ghost of tragedy sir he has walked all the stages of london several years but why are not you floured what the devil is become of the barber ghost sir hes gone to drurylane playhouse to shave the sultan in the new entertainment fust come mr ghost pray begin ghost from the dark regions of the realms below the ghost of tragedy has ridden post to tell thee common sense a thousand things which do import thee nearly to attend cock crows but ha the cursed cock has warnd me hence i did set out too late and therefore must leave all my business to some other time ghost descends sneer i presume this is a character necessary to divert for i can see no great business he has fulfilled fust wheres the second ghost sneer i thought the cock had crowed fust yes but the second ghost need not be supposed to have heard it pray mr prompter observe the moment the first ghost descends the second is to rise they are like the twin stars in that ghost rises ghost awake great common sense and sleep no more look to thyself for then when i was slain thyself was struck at think not to survive my murder long for while thou art on earth the convocation will not meet again the lawyers cannot rob men of their rights physicians cannot dose away their souls a courtiers promise will not be believed nor broken citizens again be trusted a thousand newspapers cannot subsist in which there is not any news at all playhouses cannot flourish while they dare to nonsense give an entertainments name shakspeare and jonson dryden lee and rowe thou wilt not bear to yield to sadlers wells thou wilt not suffer men of wit to starve and fools for only being fools to thrive thou wilt not suffer eunuchs to be hired at a vast price to be impertinent ghost rises ghost dear ghost the cock has crowd you cannot get under the ground a mile before tis day ghost your humble servant then i cannot stay ghost descends fust thunder and lightning thunder and lightning pray dont forget this when it is acted sneer pray mr fustian why must a ghost always rise in a storm of thunder and lightning for i have read much of that doctrine and dont find any mention of such ornaments fust that may be but they are very necessary they are indeed properly the paraphernalia of a ghost sneer but pray whose ghost was that fust whose should it be but comedys i thought when you had been told the other was tragedy you would have wanted no intimation who this was come common sense you are to awake and rub your eyes q c s waking whos there enter maid of honour did you not hear or see some wondrous thing maid no may it please your majesty i did not q c s i was adreamd i overheard a ghost maid in the next room i closely did attend and had a ghost been here i must have heard him enter firebrand q c s priest of the sun you come most opportune for here has been a dreadful apparition as i lay sleeping on my couch methought i saw a ghost sneer then i suppose she sleeps with her eyes open fust why you would not have common sense see a ghost unless in her sleep i hope fireb and if such toleration be sufferd as at present you maintain shortly your court will be a court of ghosts make a huge fire and burn all unbelievers ghosts will be hangd ere venture near a fire q c s men cannot force belief upon themselves and shall i then by torture force it on them fireb the sun will have it so q c s how do i know that fireb why i his priest infallible have told you q c s how do i know you are infallible fireb ha do you doubt it nay if you doubt that i will prove nothing but my zeal inspires me and i will tell you madam you yourself are a most deadly enemy to the sun and all his priests have greatest cause to wish you had been never born q c s ha sayest thou priest then know i honour and adore the sun and when i see his light and feel his warmth i glow with flaming gratitude towards him but know i never will adore a priest who wears prides face beneath religions mask and makes a picklock of his piety to steal away the liberty of mankind but while i live ill never give thee power fireb madam our power is not derived from you nor any one twas sent us in a box from the great sun himself and carriage paid phaeton brought it when he overturnd the chariot of the sun into the sea q c s shew me the instrument and let me read it fireb madam you cannot read it for being thrown into the sea the water has so damaged it that none but priests could ever read it since q c s and do you think i can believe this tale fireb i order you to believe it and you must q c s proud and imperious man i cant believe it religion law and physick were designd by heaven the greatest blessings on mankind but priests and lawyers and physicians made these general goods to each a private trade with each they rob with each they fill their purses and turn our benefits into our curses exit fust law and physick wheres law enter physic phys sir law going without the playhouse passage was taken up by a lord chiefjustices warrant fireb then we must go on without him fust no no stay a moment i must get somebody else to rehearse the part pox take all warrants for me if i had known this before i would have satirized the law ten times more than i have act v scene i enter fustian sneerwell prompter firebrand law physick fust i am glad you have made your escape but i hope you will make the matter up before the day of action come mr firebrand now if you please go on the moment common sense goes off the stage law and physick enter fireb oh my good lords of physick and of law had you been sooner here you would have heard the haughty queen of common sense throw out abuses on us all law i am not now to learn the hatred which she bears to me no more of that for now the warlike queen of ignorance attended with a train of foreigners all foes to common sense arrives at coventgarden and we ought to join her instantly with all our force at templebar some regiments parade the colonels clifford thavies and furnival through holborn lead their powers to drurylane attorneys all compleatly armed in brass these bailiffs and their followers will join with justices and constables and watchmen phys in warwicklane my powers expect me now a hundred chariots with a chief in each wellfamed for slaughter in his hand he bears a featherd dart that seldom errs in flight next march a band of choice apothecaries each armd with deadly pill a regiment of surgeons terrible maintain the rear all ready first to kill and then dissect fireb my lords you merit greatly of the queen and ignorance shall well repay your deeds for i foretel that by her influence men shall be brought what scarce can be believed to bribe you with large fees to their undoing success attend your glorious enterprize ill go and beg it earnest of the sun i by my office am from fight debarrd but ill be with you ere the bootys shared exeunt firebrand law and physick fust now mr sneerwell we shall begin my third and last act and i believe i may defy all the poets who have ever writ or ever will write to produce its equal it is sir so crammed with drums and trumpets thunder and lightning battles and ghosts that i believe the audience will want no entertainment after it it is as full of shew as merlins cave itself and for wit no ropedancing or tumbling can come near it come begin a ridiculous march is played enter queen ignorance attended with singers fidlers ropedancers tumblers c q ign here fix our standard what is this place called att great madam coventgarden is its name q ign ha then methinks we have ventured too far too near those theatres where common sense maintains her garrisons of mighty force who should they sally on us ere were joined by law and physick may offend us much drum beats within but ha what means this drum att it beats a parley not a point of war enter harlequin harl to you great queen of ignorance i come embassador from the two theatres who both congratulate you on your arrival and to convince you with what hearty meaning they sue for your alliance they have sent their choicest treasure here as hostages to be detaind till you are well convinced theyre not less foes to common sense than you q ign where are the hostages harl madam i have brought a catalogue and all therein shall be deliverd to your order but consider oh mighty queen they offer you their all and gladly for the least of these would give their poets and their actors in exchange q ign read the catalogue harl reads a tall man and a tall woman hired at a vast price a strong man exceeding dear two dogs that walk on their hind legs only and personate human creatures so well they might be mistaken for them a human creature that personates a dog so well that he might almost be taken for one two human cats a most curious set of puppies a pair of pigeons a set of ropedancers and tumblers from sadlerswells q ign enough enough and is it possible that they can hold alliance with my friends of sadlerswells then are they foes indeed to common sense and im indebted to em take back their hostages for they may need em and take this play and bid em forthwith act it there is not in it either head or tail harl madam they will most gratefully receive it the character you give would recommend it though it had come from a less powerful hand q ign the modish couple is its name myself stood gossip to it and i will support this play against the town i att madam the queen of common sense advances with her powers q ign draw up my men ill meet her as i ought this day shall end the long dispute between us enter queen common sense with a drummer fust heyday wheres common senses army promp sir i have sent all over the town and could not get one soldier for her except that poor drummer who was lately turned out of an irish regiment drum upon my shoul but i have been a drummer these twenty years master and have seen no wars yet and i was willing to learn a little of my trade before i died fust hush sirrah dont you be witty that is not in your part drum i dont know what is in my part sir but t desire to have something in it for i have been tired of doing nothing a great while fust silence q c s what is the reason madam that you bring these hostile arms into my peaceful realm q ign to ease your subjects from that dire oppression they groan beneath which longer to support unable they invited my redress q c s and can my subjects then complain of wrong base and ungrateful what is their complaint q ign they say you do impose a tax of thought upon their minds which theyre too weak to bear q c s wouldst thou from thinking then absolve mankind q ign i would for thinking only makes men wretched and happiness is still the lot of fools why should a wise man wish to think when thought still hurts his pride in spite of all his art malicious fortune by a lucky train of accidents shall still defeat his schemes and set the greatest blunderer above him q c s urgest thou that against me which thyself has been the wicked cause of which thy power thy artifice thy favourites have done could common sense bear universal sway no fool could ever possibly be great q ign what is this folly which you try to paint in colours so detestable and black ist not the general gift of fate to men and though some few may boast superior sense are they not calld odd fellows by the rest in any science if this sense peep forth shew men the truth and strive to turn their steps from ways wherein their gross forefathers errd is not the general cry against them straight sneer this ignorance mr fustian seems to know a great deal fust yes sir she knows what she has seen so often but you find she mistakes the cause and common sense can never beat it into her q ign sense is the parent still of fear the fox wise beast who knows the treachery of men flies their society and skulks in woods while the poor goose in happiness and ease fearless grows fat within its narrow coop and thinks the hand that feeds it is its friend then yield thee common sense nor rashly dare try a vain combat with superior force q c s know queen i never will give up the cause of all these followers when at the head of all these heroes i resign my right may my curst name be blotted from the earth sneer methinks common sense though ought to give it up when she has no more to defend it fust it does indeed look a little odd at present but ill get her an army strong enough against its acted come go on q ign then thus i hurl defiance at thy head draw all your swords q c s and gentlemen draw yours q ign fall on have at thy heart a fight q c s and have at thine fust oh fie upont fie upont i never saw a worse battle in all my life upon any stage pray gentlemen come some of you over to the other side sneer these are swiss soldiers i perceive mr fustian they care not which side they fight of fust now begin again if you please and fight away pray fight as if you were in earnest gentlemen they fight oons mr prompter i fancy you hired these soldiers out of the trained bands they are afraid to fight even in jest they fight again there there pretty well i think mr sneerwell we have made a shift to make out a good sort of a battle at last sneer indeed i cannot say i ever saw a better fust you dont seem mr sneerwell to relish this battle greatly sneer i cannot profess myself the greatest admirer of this part of tragedy and i own my imagination can better conceive the idea of a battle from a skilful relation of it than from such a representation for my mind is not able to enlarge the stage into a vast plain nor multiply half a score into several thousands fust oh your humble servant but if we write to please you and half a dozen others who will pay the charges of the house sir if the audience will be contented with a battle or two instead of all the rareefine shows exhibited to them in what they call entertainments sneer pray mr fustian how came they to give the name of entertainments to their pantomimical farces fust faith sir out of their peculiar modesty intimating that after the audience had been tired with the dull works of shakspeare jonson vanbrugh and others they are to be entertained with one of these pantomimes of which the master of the playhouse two or three painters and half a score dancingmasters are the compilers what these entertainments are i need not inform you who have seen em but i have often wondered how it was possible for any creature of human understanding after having been diverted for three hours with the production of a great genius to sit for three more and see a set of people running about the stage after one another without speaking one syllable and playing several juggling tricks which are done at fawkss after a much better manner and for this sir the town does not only pay additional prices but loses several fine parts of its best authors which are cut out to make room for the said farces sneer tis very true and i have heard a hundred say the same thing who never failed being present at them fust and while that happens they will force any entertainment upon the town they please in spite of its teeth ghost of common sense rises oons and the devil madam whats the meaning of this you have left out a scene was ever such an absurdity as for your ghost to appear before you are killed q c s i ask pardon sir in the hurry of the battle i forgot to come and kill myself fust well let me wipe the flour off your face then and now if you please rehearse the scene take care you dont make this mistake any more though for it would inevitably damn the play if you should go to the corner of the scene and come in as if you had lost the battle q c s behold the ghost of common sense appears fust sdeath madam i tell you you are no ghost you are not killed q c s deserted and forlorn where shall i fly the battles lost and so are all my friends enter a poet poet madam not so still you have one friend left q c s why what art thou poet madam i am a poet q c s whoeer thou art if thourt a friend to misery know common sense

barley corn prefer to all the jewels which you owe to her an essay on conversation man is generally represented as an animal formed for and delighted in society in this state alone it is said his various talents can be exerted his numberless necessities relieved the dangers he is exposed to can be avoided and many of the pleasures he eagerly affects enjoyed if these assertions be as i think they are undoubtedly and obviously certain those few who have denied man to be a social animal have left us these two solutions of their conduct either that there are men as bold in denial as can be found in assertion and as cicero says there is no absurdity which some philosopher or other hath not asserted so we may say there is no truth so glaring that some have not denied it or else that these rejectors of society borrow all their information from their own savage dispositions and are indeed themselves the only exceptions to the above general rule but to leave such persons to those who have thought them more worthy of an answer there are others who are so seemingly fond of this social state that they are understood absolutely to confine it to their own species and entirely excluding the tamer and gentler the herding and flocking parts of the creation from all benefits of it to set up this as one grand general distinction between the human and the brute species shall we conclude this denial of all society to the nature of brutes which seems to be in defiance of every days observation to be as bold as the denial of it to the nature of men or may we not more justly derive the error from an improper understanding of this word society in too confined and special a sense in a word do those who utterly deny it to the brutal nature mean any other by society than conversation now if we comprehend them in this sense as i think we very reasonably may the distinction appears to me to be truly just for though other animals are not without all use of society yet this noble branch of it seems of all the inhabitants of this globe confined to man only the narrow power of communicating some few ideas of lust or fear or anger which may be observable in brutes falling infinitely short of what is commonly meant by conversation as may be deduced from the origination of the word itself the only accurate guide to knowledge the primitive and literal sense of this word is i apprehend to turn round together and in its more copious usage we intend by it that reciprocal interchange of ideas by which truth is examined things are in a manner turned round and sifted and all our knowledge communicated to each other in this respect man stands i conceive distinguished from and superior to all other earthly creatures it is this privilege which while he is inferior in strength to some in swiftness to others without horns or claws or tusks to attack them or even to defend himself against them hath made him master of them all indeed in other views however vain men may be of their abilities they are greatly inferior to their animal neighbours with what envy must a swine or a much less voracious animal be surveyed by a glutton and how contemptible must the talents of other sensualists appear when opposed perhaps to some of the lowest and meanest of brutes but in conversation man stands alone at least in this part of the creation he leaves all others behind him at his first start and the greater progress he makes the greater distance is between them conversation is of three sorts men are said to converse with god with themselves and with one another the two first of these have been so liberally and excellently spoken to by others that i shall at present pass them by and confine myself in this essay to the third only since it seems to me amazing that this grand business of our lives the foundation of everything either useful or pleasant should have been so slightly treated of that while there is scarce a profession or handicraft in life however mean and contemptible which is not abundantly furnished with proper rules to the attaining its perfection men should be left almost totally in the dark and without the least light to direct or any guide to conduct them in the proper exerting of those talents which are the noblest privilege of human nature and productive of all rational happiness and the rather as this power is by no means selfinstructed and in the possession of the artless and ignorant is of so mean use that it raises them very little above those animals who are void of it as conversation is a branch of society it follows that it can be proper to none who is not in his nature social now society is agreeable to no creatures who are not inoffensive to each other and we therefore observe in animals who are entirely guided by nature that it is cultivated by such only while those of more noxious disposition addict themselves to solitude and unless when prompted by lust or that necessary instinct implanted in them by nature for the nurture of their young shun as much as possible the society of their own species if therefore there should be found some human individuals of so savage a habit it would seem they were not adapted to society and consequently not to conversation nor would any inconvenience ensue the admittance of such exceptions since it would by no means impeach the general rule of mans being a social animal especially when it appears as is sufficiently and admirably proved by my friend the author of an enquiry into happiness that these men live in a constant opposition to their own nature and are no less monsters than the most wanton abortions or extravagant births again if society requires that its members should be inoffensive so the more useful and beneficial they are to each other the more suitable are they to the social nature and more perfectly adapted to its institution for all creatures seek their own happiness and society is therefore natural to any because it is naturally productive of this happiness to render therefore any animal social is to render it inoffensive an instance of which is to be seen in those the ferocity of whose nature can be tamed by man and here the reader may observe a double distinction of man from the more savage animals by society and from the social by conversation but if men were merely inoffensive to each other it seems as if society and conversation would be merely indifferent and that in order to make it desirable by a sensible being it is necessary we should go farther and propose some positive good to ourselves from it and this presupposes not only negatively our not receiving any hurt but positively our receiving some good some pleasure or advantage from each other in it something which we could not find in an unsocial and solitary state otherwise we might cry out with the right honourable poet footnote the duke of buckingham give us our wildness and our woods our huts and caves again the art of pleasing or doing good to one another is therefore the art of conversation it is this habit which gives it all its value and as mans being a social animal the truth of which is incontestably proved by that excellent author of an enquiry c i have above cited presupposes a natural desire or tendency this way it will follow that we can fail in attaining this truly desirable end from ignorance only in the means and how general this ignorance is may be with some probability inferred from our want of even a word to express this art by that which comes the nearest to it and by which perhaps we would sometimes intend it being so horribly and barbarously corrupted that it contains at present scarce a simple ingredient of what it seems originally to have been designed to express the word i mean is good breeding a word i apprehend not at first confined to externals much less to any particular dress or attitude of the body nor were the qualifications expressed by it to be furnished by a milliner a taylor or a perriwigmaker no nor even by a dancingmaster himself according to the idea i myself conceive from this word i should not have scrupled to call socrates a wellbred man though i believe he was very little instructed by any of the persons i have above enumerated in short by goodbreeding notwithstanding the corrupt use of the word in a very different sense i mean the art of pleasing or contributing as much as possible to the ease and happiness of those with whom you converse i shall contend therefore no longer on this head for whilst my reader clearly conceives the sense in which i use this word it will not be very material whether i am right or wrong in its original application goodbreeding then or the art of pleasing in conversation is expressed two different ways viz in our actions and our words and our conduct in both may be reduced to that concise comprehensive rule in scripture do unto all men as you would they should do unto you indeed concise as this rule is and plain as it appears what are all treatises on ethics but comments upon it and whoever is well read in the book of nature and hath made much observation on the actions of men will perceive so few capable of judging or rightly pursuing their own happiness that he will be apt to conclude that some attention is necessary and more than is commonly used to enable men to know truly what they would have done unto them or at least what it would be their interest to have done if therefore men through weakness or inattention often err in their conceptions of what would produce their own happiness no wonder they should miss in the application of what will contribute to that of others and thus we may without too severe a censure on their inclinations account for that frequent failure in true goodbreeding which daily experience gives us instances of besides the commentators have well paraphrased on the abovementioned divine rule that it is to do unto men what you would they if they were in your situation and circumstances and you in theirs should do unto you and as this comment is necessary to be observed in ethics so it is particularly useful in this our art where the degree of the person is always to be considered as we shall explain more at large hereafter we see then a possibility for a man well disposed to this golden rule without some precautions to err in the practice nay even goodnature itself the very habit of mind most essential to furnish us with true goodbreeding the latter so nearly resembling the former that it hath been called and with the appearance at least of propriety artificial goodnature this excellent quality itself sometimes shoots us beyond the mark and shews the truth of those lines in horace insani sapiens nomen ferat sequus iniqui ultra quam satis est virtutem si petal ipsam instances of this will be naturally produced where we shew the deviations from those rules which we shall now attempt to lay down as this goodbreeding is the art of pleasing it will be first necessary with the utmost caution to avoid hurting or giving any offence to those with whom we converse and here we are surely to shun any kind of actual disrespect or affront to their persons by insolence which is the severest attack that can be made on the pride of man and of which florus seems to have no inadequate opinion when speaking of the second tarquin he says in omnes superbid qua crudelitate gravior est bonis grassatus he trod on all with insolence which sits heavier on men of great minds than cruelty itself if there is any temper in man which more than all others disqualifies him for society it is this insolence or haughtiness which blinding a man to his own imperfections and giving him a hawks quicksightedness to those of others raises in him that contempt for his species which inflates the cheeks erects the head and stiffens the gaite of those strutting animals who sometimes stalk in assemblies for no other reason but to shew in their gesture and behaviour the disregard they have for the company though to a truly great and philosophical mind it is not easy to conceive a more ridiculous exhibition than this puppet yet to others he is little less than a nuisance for contempt is a murtherous weapon and there is this difference only between the greatest and weakest man when attacked by it that in order to wound the former it must be just whereas without the shields of wisdom and philosophy which god knows are in the possession of very few it wants no justice to point it but is certain to penetrate from whatever corner it comes it is this disposition which inspires the empty cacus to deny his acquaintance and overlook men of merit in distress and the little silly pretty phillida or foolida to stare at the strange creatures round her it is this temper which constitutes the supercilious eye the reserved look the distant bowe the scornful leer the affected astonishment the loud whisper ending in a laugh directed full in the teeth of another hence spring in short those numberless offences given too frequently in public and private assemblies by persons of weak understandings indelicate habits and so hungry and foulfeeding a vanity that it wants to devour whatever comes in its way now if goodbreeding be what we have endeavoured to prove it how foreign and indeed how opposite to it must such a behaviour be and can any man call a duke or a dutchess who wears it wellbred or are they not more justly entitled to those inhuman names which they themselves allot to the lowest vulgar but behold a more pleasing picture on the reverse see the earl of c noble in his birth splendid in his fortune and embellished with every endowment of mind how affable how condescending himself the only one who seems ignorant that he is every way the greatest person in the room but it is not sufficient to be inoffensive we must be profitable servants to each other we are in the second place to proceed to the utmost verge in paying the respect due to others we had better go a little too far than stop short in this particular my lord shaftesbury hath a pretty observation that the beggar in addressing to a coach with my lord is sure not to offend even though there be no lord there but on the contrary should plain sir fly in the face of a nobleman what must be the consequence and indeed whoever considers the bustle and contention about precedence the pains and labours undertaken and sometimes the prices given for the smallest title or mark of preeminence and the visible satisfaction betrayed in its enjoyment may reasonably conclude this is a matter of no small consequence the truth is we live in a world of common men and not of philosophers for one of these when he appears which is very seldom among us is distinguished and very properly too by the name of an odd fellow for what is it less than extreme oddity to despise what the generality of the world think the labour of their whole lives well employed in procuring we are therefore to adapt our behaviour to the opinion of the generality of mankind and not to that of a few odd fellows it would be tedious and perhaps impossible to specify every instance or to lay down exact rules for our conduct in every minute particular however i shall mention some of the chief which most ordinarily occur after premising that the business of the whole is no more than to convey to others an idea of your esteem of them which is indeed the substance of all the compliments ceremonies presents and whatever passes between wellbred people and here i shall lay down these positions first that all meer ceremonies exist in form only and have in them no substance at all but being imposed by the laws of custom become essential to goodbreeding from those highflown compliments paid to the eastern monarchs and which pass between chinese mandarines to those coarser ceremonials in use between english farmers and dutch boors secondly that these ceremonies poor as they are are of more consequence than they at first appear and in reality constitute the only external difference between man and man thus his grace right honourable my lord right reverend reverend honourable sir esquire mr c have in a philosophical sense no meaning yet are perhaps politically essential and must be preserved by goodbreeding because thirdly they raise an expectation in the person by law and custom entitled to them and who will consequently be displeased with the disappointment now in order to descend minutely into any rules for goodbreeding it will be necessary to lay some scene or to throw our disciple into some particular circumstance we will begin them with a visit in the country and as the principal actor on this occasion is the person who receives it we will as briefly as possible lay down some general rules for his conduct marking at the same time the principal deviations we have observed on these occasions when an expected guest arrives to dinner at your house if your equal or indeed not greatly your inferior he should be sure to find your family in some order and yourself dressed and ready to receive him at your gate with a smiling countenance this infuses an immediate chearfulness into your guest and persuades him of your esteem and desire of his company not so is the behaviour of polysperchon at whose gate you are obliged to knock a considerable time before you gain admittance at length the door being opened to you by a maid or some improper servant who wonders where the devil all the men are and being asked if the gentleman is at home answers she believes so you are conducted into a hall or backparlour where you stay some time before the gentleman in a dishabille from his study or his garden waits upon you asks pardon and assures you he did not expect you so soon your guest being introduced into a drawingroom is after the first ceremonies to be asked whether he will refresh himself after his journey before dinner for which he is never to stay longer than the usual or fixed hour but this request is never to be repeated oftener than twice not in imitation of calepus who as if hired by a physician crams wine in a morning down the throats of his most temperate friends their constitutions being not so dear to them as their present quiet when dinner is on the table and the ladies have taken their places the gentlemen are to be introduced into the eatingroom where they are to be seated with as much seeming indifference as possible unless there be any present whose degrees claim an undoubted precedence as to the rest the general rules of precedence are by marriage age and profession lastly in placing your guests regard is rather to be had to birth than fortune for though pursepride is forward enough to exalt itself it bears a degradation with more secret comfort and ease than the former as being more inwardly satisfied with itself and less apprehensive of neglect or contempt the order in helping your guests is to be regulated by that of placing them but here i must with great submission recommend to the lady at the upper end of the table to distribute her favours as equally and as impartially as she can i have sometimes seen a large dish of fish extend no farther than to the fifth person and a haunch of venison lose all its fat before half the table had tasted it a single request to eat of any particular dish how elegant soever is the utmost i allow i strictly prohibit all earnest solicitations all complaints that you have no appetite which are sometimes little less than burlesque and always impertinent and troublesome and here however low it may appear to some readers as i have known omissions of this kind give offence and sometimes make the offenders who have been very wellmeaning persons ridiculous i cannot help mentioning the ceremonial of drinking healths at table which is always to begin with the ladys and next the masters of the house when dinner is ended and the ladies retired though i do not hold the master of the feast obliged to fuddle himself through complacence and indeed it is his own fault generally if his company be such as would desire it yet he is to see that the bottle circulate sufficient to afford every person present a moderate quantity of wine if he chuses it at the same time permitting those who desire it either to pass the bottle or to fill their glass as they please indeed the beastly custom of besotting and ostentatious contention for preeminence in their cups seems at present pretty well abolished among the better sort of people yet methus still remains who measures the honesty and understanding of mankind by a capaciousness of their swallow who sings forth the praises of a bumper and complains of the light in your glass and at whose table it is as difficult to preserve your senses as to preserve your purse at a gamingtable or your health at a b yhouse on the other side sophronus eyes you carefully whilst you are filling out his liquor the bottle as surely stops when it comes to him as your chariot at templebar and it is almost as impossible to carry a pint of wine from his house as to gain the love of a reigning beauty or borrow a shilling of p w but to proceed after a reasonable time if your guest intends staying with you the whole evening and declines the bottle you may propose play walking or any other amusement but these are to be but barely mentioned and offered to his choice with all indifference on your part what person can be so dull as not to perceive in agyrtes a longing to pick your pockets or in alazon a desire to satisfy his own vanity in shewing you the rarities of his house and gardens when your guest offers to go there should be no solicitations to stay unless for the whole night and that no farther than to give him a moral assurance of his being welcome so to do no assertions that he shant go yet no laying on violent hands no private orders to servants to delay providing the horses or vehicles like desmophylax who never suffers any one to depart from his house without entitling him to an action of false imprisonment let us now consider a little the part which the visitor himself is to act and first he is to avoid the two extremes of being too early or too late so as neither to surprise his friend unawares or unprovided nor detain him too long in expectation orthrius who hath nothing to do disturbs your rest in a morning and the frugal chronophidus lest he should waste some minutes of his precious time is sure to spoil your dinner the address at your arrival should be as short as possible especially when you visit a superior not imitating phlenaphius who would stop his friend in the rain rather than omit a single bowe be not too observant of trifling ceremonies such as rising sitting walking first in or out of the room except with one greatly your superior but when such a one offers you precedence it is uncivil to refuse it of which i will give you the following instance an english nobleman being in france was bid by louis xiv to enter the coach before him which he excused himself from the king then immediately mounted and ordering the door to be shut drove on leaving the nobleman behind him never refuse anything offered you out of civility unless in preference of a lady and that no oftener than once for nothing is more truly good breeding than to avoid being troublesome though the taste and humour of the visitor is to be chiefly considered yet is some regard likewise to be had to that of the master of the house for otherwise your company will be rather a penance than a pleasure methusus plainly discovers his visit to be paid to his sober friends bottle nor will philopasus abstain from cards though he is certain they are agreeable only to himself whilst the slender leptines gives his fat entertainer a sweat and makes him run the hazard of breaking his wind up his own mounts if conveniency allows your staying longer than the time proposed it may be civil to offer to depart lest your stay may be incommodious to your friend but if you perceive the contrary by his solicitations they should be readily accepted without tempting him to break these rules we have above laid down for him causing a confusion in his family and among his servants by preparations for your departure lastly when you are resolved to go the same method is to be observed which i have prescribed at your arrival no tedious ceremonies of taking leave not like hyperphylus who bows and kisses and squeezes by the hand as heartily and wishes you as much health and happiness when he is going a journey home of ten miles from a common acquaintance as if he was leaving his nearest friend or relation on a voyage to the east indies having thus briefly considered our reader in the circumstance of a private visit let us now take him into a public assembly where as more eyes will be on his behaviour it cannot be less his interest to be instructed we have indeed already formed a general picture of the chief enormities committed on these occasions we shall here endeavour to explain more particularly the rules of an opposite demeanour which we may divide into three sorts viz our behaviour to our superiors to our equals and to our inferiors in our behaviour to our superiors two extremes are to be avoided namely an abject and base servility and an impudent and encroaching freedom when the wellbred hyperdulus approaches a nobleman in any public place you would be persuaded he was one of the meanest of his domestics his cringes fall little short of prostration and his whole behaviour is so mean and servile that an eastern monarch would not require more humiliation from his vassals on the other side anaischyntus whom fortunate accidents without any pretensions from his birth have raised to associate with his betters shakes my lord duke by the hand with a familiarity savouring not only of the most perfect intimacy but the closest alliance the former behaviour properly raises our contempt the latter our disgust hyperdulus seems worthy of wearing his lordships livery anaischyntus deserves to be turned out of his service for his impudence between these two is that golden mean which declares a man ready to acquiesce in allowing the respect due to a title by the laws and customs of his country but impatient of any insult and disdaining to purchase the intimacy with and favour of a superior at the expence of conscience or honour as to the question who are our superiors i shall endeavour to ascertain them when i come in the second place to mention our behaviour to our equals the first instruction on this head being carefully to consider who are such every little superiority of fortune or profession being too apt to intoxicate mens minds and elevate them in their own opinion beyond their merit or pretensions men are superior to each other in this our country by title by birth by rank in profession and by age very little if any being to be allowed to fortune though so much is generally exacted by it and commonly paid to it mankind never appear to me in a more despicable light than when i see them by a simple as well as mean servility voluntarily concurring in the adoration of riches without the least benefit or prospect from them respect and deference are perhaps justly demandable of the obliged and may be with some reason at least from expectation paid to the rich and liberal from the necessitous but that men should be allured by the glittering of wealth only to feed the insolent pride of those who will not in return feed their hunger that the sordid niggard should find any sacrifices on the altar of his vanity seems to arise from a blinder idolatry and a more bigoted and senseless superstition than any which the sharp eyes of priests have discovered in the human mind all gentlemen therefore who are not raised above each other by title birth rank in profession age or actual obligation being to be considered as equals let us take some lessons for their behaviour to each other in public from the following examples in which we shall discern as well what we are to elect as what we are to avoid authades is so absolutely abandoned to his own humour that he never gives it up on any occasion if seraphina herself whose charms one would imagine should infuse alacrity into the limbs of a cripple sooner than the bath waters was to offer herself for his partner he would answer he never danced even though the ladies lost their ball by it nor doth this denial arise from incapacity for he was in his youth an excellent dancer and still retains sufficient knowledge of the art and sufficient abilities in his limbs to practise it but from an affectation of gravity which he will not sacrifice to the eagerest desire of others dyskolus hath the same aversion to cards and though competently skilled in all games is by no importunities to be prevailed on to make a third at ombre or a fourth at whisk and quadrille he will suffer any company to be disappointed of their amusement rather than submit to pass an hour or two a little disagreeably to himself the refusal of philautus is not so general he is very ready to engage provided you will indulge him in his favourite game but it is impossible to persuade him to any other i should add both these are men of fortune and the consequences of loss or gain at the rate they are desired to engage very trifling and inconsiderable to them the rebukes these people sometimes meet with are no more equal to their deserts than the honour paid to charistus the benevolence of whose mind scarce permits him to indulge his own will unless by accident though neither his age nor understanding incline him to dance nor will admit his receiving any pleasure from it yet would he caper a whole evening rather than a fine young lady should lose an opportunity of displaying her charms by the several genteel and amiable attitudes which this exercise affords the skilful of that sex and though cards are not adapted to his temper he never once baulked the inclinations of others on that account but as there are many who will not in the least instance mortify their own humour to purchase the satisfaction of all mankind so there are some who make no scruple of satisfying their own pride and vanity at the expence of the most cruel mortification of others of this kind is agroicus who seldom goes to an assembly but he affronts half his acquaintance by overlooking or disregarding them as this is a very common offence and indeed much more criminal both in its cause and effect than is generally imagined i shall examine it very minutely and i doubt not but to make it appear that there is no behaviour to speak like a philosopher more contemptible nor in a civil sense more detestable than this the first ingredient in this composition is pride which according to the doctrine of some is the universal passion there are others who consider it as the foible of great minds and others again who will have it to be the very foundation of greatness and perhaps it may of that greatness which we have endeavoured to expose in many parts of these works but to real greatness which is the union of a good heart with a good head it is almost diametrically opposite as it generally proceeds from the depravity of both and almost certainly from the badness of the latter indeed a little observation will shew us that fools are the most addicted to this vice and a little reflexion will teach us that it is incompatible with true understanding accordingly we see that while the wisest of men have constantly lamented the imbecility and imperfection of their own nature the meanest and weakest have been trumpeting forth their own excellencies and triumphing in their own sufficiency pride may i think be properly defined the pleasure we feel in contemplating our own superior merit on comparing it with that of others that it arises from this supposed superiority is evident for however great you admit a mans merit to be if all men were equal to him there would be no room for pride now if it stop here perhaps there is no enormous harm in it or at least no more than is common to all other folly every species of which is always liable to produce every species of mischief folly i fear it is for should the man estimate rightly on this occasion and the ballance should fairly turn on his side in this particular instance should he be indeed a greater orator poet general should he be more wise witty learned young rich healthy or in whatever instance he may excel one or many or all yet if he examine himself thoroughly will he find no reason to abate his pride is the quality in which he is so eminent so generally or justly esteemed is it so entirely his own doth he not rather owe his superiority to the defects of others than to his own perfection or lastly can he find in no part of his character a weakness which may counterpoise this merit and which as justly at least threatens him with shame as this entices him to pride i fancy if such a scrutiny was made and nothing so ready as good sense to make it a proud man would be as rare as in reality he is a ridiculous monster but suppose a man on this comparison is as may sometimes happen a little partial to himself the harm is to himself and he becomes only ridiculous from it if i prefer my excellence in poetry to pope or young if an inferior actor should in his opinion exceed quin or garrick or a signpost painter set himself above the inimitable hogarth we become only ridiculous by our vanity and the persons themselves who are thus humbled in the comparison would laugh with more reason than any other pride therefore hitherto seems an inoffensive weakness only and entitles a man to no worse an appellation than that of a fool but it will not stop here though fool be perhaps no desirable term the proud man will deserve worse he is not contented with the admiration he pays himself he now becomes arrogant and requires the same respect and preference from the world for pride though the greatest of flatterers is by no means a profitable servant to itself it resembles the parson of the parish more than the squire and lives rather on the tithes oblations and contributions it collects from others than on its own demesne as pride therefore is seldom without arrogance so is this never to be found without insolence the arrogant man must be insolent in order to attain his own ends and to convince and remind men of the superiority he affects will naturally by illwords actions and gestures endeavour to throw the despised person at as much distance as possible from him hence proceeds that supercilious look and all those visible indignities with which men behave in public to those whom they fancy their inferiors hence the very notable custom of deriding and often denying the nearest relations friends and acquaintance in poverty and distress lest we should anywise be levelled with the wretches we despise either in their own imagination or in the conceit of any who should behold familiarities pass between us but besides pride folly arrogance and insolence there is another simple which vice never willingly leaves out of any composition and this is illnature a goodnatured man may indeed provided he is a fool be proud but arrogant and insolent he cannot be unless we will allow to such a still greater degree of folly and ignorance of human nature which may indeed entitle them to forgiveness in the benign language of scripture because they know not what they do for when we come to consider the effect of this behaviour on the person who suffers it we may perhaps have reason to conclude that murder is not a much more cruel injury what is the consequence of this contempt or indeed what is the design of it but to expose the object of it to shame a sensation as uneasy and almost intolerable as those which arise from the severest pains inflicted on the body a convulsion of the mind if i may so call it which immediately produces symptoms of universal disorder in the whole man which hath sometimes been attended with death itself and to which death hath by great multitudes been with much alacrity preferred now what less than the highest degree of illnature can permit a man to pamper his own vanity at the price of anothers shame is the glutton who to raise the flavour of his dish puts some birds or beasts to exquisite torment more cruel to the animal than this our proud man to his own species this character then is a composition made up of those odious contemptible qualities pride folly arrogance insolence and illnature i shall dismiss it with some general observations which will place it in so ridiculous a light that a man must hereafter be possessed of a very considerable portion either of folly or impudence to assume it first it proceeds on one grand fallacy for whereas this wretch is endeavouring by a supercilious conduct to lead the beholder into an opinion of his superiority to the despised person he inwardly flatters his own vanity with a deceitful presumption that this his conduct is founded on a general preconceived opinion of this superiority secondly this caution to preserve it plainly indicates a doubt that the superiority of our own character is very slightly established for which reason we see it chiefly practised by men who have the weakest pretensions to the reputation they aim at and indeed none was ever freer from it than that noble person whom we have already mentioned in this essay and who can never be mentioned but with honour by those who know him thirdly this opinion of our superiority is commonly very erroneous who hath not seen a general behave in this supercilious manner to an officer of lower rank who hath been greatly his superior in that very art to his excellence in which the general ascribes all his merit parallel instances occur in every other art science or profession fourthly men who excel others in trifling instances frequently cast a supercilious eye on their superiors in the highest thus the least pretensions to preeminence in title birth riches equipages dress c constantly overlook the most noble endowments of virtue honour wisdom sense wit and every other quality which can truly dignify and adorn a man lastly the lowest and meanest of our species are the most strongly addicted to this vice men who are a scandal to their sex and women who disgrace human nature for the basest mechanic is so far from being exempt that he is generally the most guilty of it it visits alehouses and ginshops and whistles in the empty heads of fidlers mountebanks and dancingmasters to conclude a character on which we have already dwelt longer than is consistent with the intended measure of this essay this contempt of others is the truest symptom of a base and a bad heart while it suggests itself to the mean and the vile and tickles their little fancy on every occasion it never enters the great and good mind but on the strongest motives nor is it then a welcome guest affording only an uneasy sensation and brings always with it a mixture of concern and compassion we will now proceed to inferior criminals in society theoretus conceiving that the assembly is only met to see and admire him is uneasy unless he engrosses the eyes of the whole company the giant doth not take more pains to be viewed and as he is unfortunately not so tall he carefully deposits himself in the most conspicuous place nor will that suffice he must walk about the room though to the great disturbance of the company and if he can purchase general observation at no less rate will condescend to be ridiculous for he prefers being laughed at to being taken little notice of on the other side dusopius is so bashful that he hides himself in a corner he hardly bears being looked at and never quits the first chair he lights upon lest he should expose himself to public view he trembles when you bowe to him at a distance is shocked at hearing his own voice and would almost swoon at the repetition of his name the audacious anedes who is extremely amorous in his inclinations never likes a woman but his eyes ask her the question without considering the confusion he often occasions to the object he ogles and languishes at every pretty woman in the room as there is no law of morality which he would not break to satisfy his desires so is there no form of civility which he doth not violate to communicate them when he gets possession of a womans hand which those of stricter decency never give him but with reluctance he considers himself as its master indeed there is scarce a familiarity which he will abstain from on the slightest acquaintance and in the most public place seraphina herself can make no impression on the rough temper of agroicus neither her quality nor her beauty can exact the least complacence from him and he would let her lovely limbs ach rather than offer her his chair while the gentle lyperus tumbles over benches and overthrows teatables to take up a fan or a glove he forces you as a good parent doth his child for your own good he is absolute master of a ladys will nor will allow her the election of standing or sitting in his company in short the impertinent civility of lyperus is as troublesome though perhaps not so offensive as the brutish rudeness of agroicus thus we have hinted at most of the common enormities committed in public assemblies to our equals for it would be tedious and difficult to enumerate all nor is it needful since from this sketch we may trace all others most of which i believe will be found to branch out from some of the particulars here specified i am now in the last place to consider our behaviour to our inferiors in which condescension can never be too strongly recommended for as a deviation on this side is much more innocent than on the other so the pride of man renders us much less liable to it for besides that we are apt to overrate our own perfections and undervalue the qualifications of our neighbours we likewise set too high an esteem on the things themselves and consider them as constituting a more essential difference between us than they really do the qualities of the mind do in reality establish the truest superiority over one another yet should not these so far elevate our pride as to inflate us with contempt and make us look down on our fellowcreatures as on animals of an inferior order but that the fortuitous accident of birth the acquisition of wealth with some outward ornaments of dress should inspire men with an insolence capable of treating the rest of mankind with disdain is so preposterous that nothing less than daily experience could give it credit if men were to be rightly estimated and divided into subordinate classes according to the superior excellence of their several natures perhaps the lowest class of either sex would be properly assigned to those two disgraces of the human species commonly called a beau and a fine lady for if we rate men by the faculties of the mind in what degree must these stand nay admitting the qualities of the body were to give the preeminence how many of those whom fortune hath placed in the lowest station must be ranked above them if dress is their only title sure even the monkey if as well dressed is on as high a footing as the beau but perhaps i shall be told they challenge their dignity from birth that is a poor and mean pretence to honour when supported with no other persons who have no better claim to superiority should be ashamed of this they are really a disgrace to those very ancestors from whom they would derive their pride and are chiefly happy in this that they want the very moderate portion of understanding which would enable them to despise themselves and yet who so prone to a contemptuous carriage as these i have myself seen a little female thing which they have called my lady of no greater dignity in the order of beings than a cat and of no more use in society than a butterfly whose mien would not give even the idea of a gentlewoman and whose face would cool the loosest libertine with a mind as empty of ideas as an opera and a body fuller of diseases than an hospital i have seen this thing express contempt to a woman who was an honour to her sex and an ornament to the creation to confess the truth there is little danger of the possessors ever undervaluing this titular excellence not that i would withdraw from it that deference which the policy of government hath assigned it on the contrary i have laid down the most exact compliance with this respect as a fundamental in goodbreeding nay i insist only that we may be admitted to pay it and not treated with a disdain even beyond what the eastern monarchs shew to their slaves surely it is too high an elevation when instead of treating the lowest human creature in a christian sense as our brethren we look down on such as are but one rank in the civil order removed from us as unworthy to breathe even the same air and regard the most distant communication with them as an indignity and disgrace offered to ourselves this is considering the difference not in the individual but in the very species a height of insolence impious in a christian society and most absurd and ridiculous in a trading nation i have now done with my first head in which i have treated of goodbreeding as it regards our actions i shall in the next place consider it with respect to our words and shall endeavour to lay down some rules by observing which our wellbred man may in his discourse as well as actions contribute to the happiness and wellbeing of society certain it is that the highest pleasure which we are capable of enjoying in conversation is to be met with only in the society of persons whose understanding is pretty near on an equality with our own nor is this equality only necessary to enable men of exalted genius and extensive knowledge to taste the sublimer pleasures of communicating their refined ideas to each other but it is likewise necessary to the inferior happiness of every subordinate degree of society down to the very lowest for instance we will suppose a conversation between socrates plato aristotle and three dancingmasters it will be acknowledged i believe that the heel sophists would be as little pleased with the company of the philosophers as the philosophers with theirs it would be greatly therefore for the improvement and happiness of conversation if society could be formed on this equality but as men are not ranked in this world by the different degrees of their understanding but by other methods and consequently all degrees of understanding often meet in the same class and must ex necessitate frequently converse together the impossibility of accomplishing any such utopian scheme very plainly appears here therefore is a visible but unavoidable imperfection in society itself but as we have laid it down as a fundamental that the essence of goodbreeding is to contribute as much as possible to the ease and happiness of mankind so will it be the business of our wellbred man to endeavour to lessen this imperfection to his utmost and to bring society as near to a level at least as he is able now there are but two ways to compass this viz by raising the lower and by lowering what is higher let us suppose then that very unequal company i have before mentioned met the former of these is apparently impracticable let socrates for instance institute a discourse on the nature of the soul or plato reason on the native beauty of virtue and aristotle on his occult qualities what must become of our dancingmasters would they not stare at one another with surprise and most probably at our philosophers with contempt would they have any pleasure in such society or would they not rather wish themselves in a dancingschool or a greenroom at the playhouse what therefore have our philosophers to do but to lower themselves to those who cannot rise to them and surely there are subjects on which both can converse hath not socrates heard of harmony hath not plato who draws virtue in the person of a fine woman any idea of the gracefulness of attitude and hath not aristotle himself written a book on motion in short to be a little serious there are many topics on which they can at least be intelligible to each other how absurd then must appear the conduct of cenodoxus who having had the advantage of a liberal education and having made a pretty good progress in literature is constantly advancing learned subjects in common conversation he talks of the classics before the ladies and of greek criticisms among fine gentlemen what is this less than an insult on the company over whom he thus affects a superiority and whose time he sacrifices to his vanity wisely different is the amiable conduct of sophronus who though he exceeds the former in knowledge can submit to discourse on the most trivial matters rather than introduce such as his company are utter strangers to he can talk of fashions and diversions among the ladies nay can even condescend to horses and dogs with country gentlemen this gentleman who is equal to dispute on the highest and abstrusest points can likewise talk on a fan or a horserace nor had ever any one who was not himself a man of learning the least reason to conceive the vast knowledge of sophronus unless from the report of others let us compare these together cenodoxus proposes the satisfaction of his own pride from the admiration of others sophronus thinks of nothing but their amusement in the company of cenodoxus every one is rendered uneasy laments his own want of knowledge and longs for the end of the dull assembly with sophronus all are pleased and contented with themselves in their knowledge of matters which they find worthy the consideration of a man of sense admiration is involuntarily paid the former to the latter it is given joyfully the former receives it with envy and hatred the latter enjoys it as the sweet fruit of goodwill the former is shunned the latter courted by all this behaviour in cenodoxus may in some measure account for an observation we must have frequent occasion to make that the conversation of men of very moderate capacities is often preferred to that of men of superior talents in which the world act more wisely than at first they may seem for besides that backwardness in mankind to give their admiration what can be duller or more void of pleasure than discourses on subjects above our comprehension it is like listening to an unknown language and if such company is ever desired by us it is a sacrifice to our vanity which imposes on us to believe that we may by these means raise the general opinion of our own parts and knowledge and not from that cheerful delight which is the natural result of an agreeable conversation there is another very common fault equally destructive of this delight by much the same means though it is far from owing its original to any real superiority of parts and knowledge this is discoursing on the mysteries of a particular profession to which all the rest of the company except one or two are utter strangers lawyers are generally guilty of this fault as they are more confined to the conversation of one another and i have known a very agreeable company spoilt where there have been two of these gentlemen present who have seemed rather to think themselves in a court of justice than in a mixed assembly of persons met only for the entertainment of each other but it is not sufficient that the whole company understand the topic of their conversation they should be likewise equally interested in every subject not tending to their general information or amusement for these are not to be postponed to the relation of private affairs much less of the particular grievance or misfortune of a single person to bear a share in the afflictions of another is a degree of friendship not to be expected in a common acquaintance nor hath any man a right to indulge the satisfaction of a weak and mean mind by the comfort of pity at the expence of the whole companys diversion the inferior and unsuccessful members of the several professions are generally guilty of this fault for as they fail of the reward due to their great merit they can seldom refrain from reviling their superiors and complaining of their own hard and unjust fate farther as a man is not to make himself the subject of the conversation so neither is he to engross the whole to himself as every man had rather please others by what he says than be himself pleased by what they say or in other words as every man is best pleased with the consciousness of pleasing so should all have an equal opportunity of aiming at it this is a right which we are so offended at being deprived of that though i remember to have known a man reputed a good companion who seldom opened his mouth in company unless to swallow his liquor yet i have scarce ever heard that appellation given to a very talkative person even when he hath been capable of entertaining unless he hath done this with buffoonery and made the rest amends by partaking of their scorn together with their admiration and applause a wellbred man therefore will not take more of the discourse than falls to his share nor in this will he shew any violent impetuosity of temper or exert any loudness of voice even in arguing for the information of the company and the conviction of his antagonist are to be his apparent motives not the indulgence of his own pride or an ambitious desire of victory which latter if a wise man should entertain he will be sure to conceal with his utmost endeavour since he must know that to lay open his vanity in public is no less absurd than to lay open his bosom to an enemy whose drawn sword is pointed against it for every man hath a dagger in his hand ready to stab the vanity of another wherever he perceives it having now shewn that the pleasure of conversation must arise from the discourse being on subjects levelled to the capacity of the whole company from being on such in which every person is equally interested from every ones being admitted to his share in the discourse and lastly from carefully avoiding all noise violence and impetuosity it might seem proper to lay down some particular rules for the choice of those subjects which are most likely to conduce to the cheerful delights proposed from this social communication but as such an attempt might appear absurd from the infinite variety and perhaps too dictatorial in its nature i shall confine myself to rejecting those topics only which seem most foreign to this delight and which are most likely to be attended with consequences rather tending to make society an evil than to procure us any good from it and first i shall mention that which i have hitherto only endeavoured to restrain within certain bounds namely arguments but which if they were entirely banished out of company especially from mixed assemblies and where ladies make part of the society it would i believe promote their happiness they have been sometimes attended with bloodshed generally with hatred from the conquered party towards his victor and scarce ever with conviction here i except jocose arguments which often produce much mirth and serious disputes between men of learning when none but such are present which tend to the propagation of knowledge and the edification of the company secondly slander which however frequently used or however savoury to the palate of illnature is extremely pernicious as it is often unjust and highly injurious to the person slandered and always dangerous especially in large and mixed companies where sometimes an undesigned offence is given to an innocent relation or friend of such person who is thus exposed to shame and confusion without having any right to resent the affront of this there have been very tragical instances and i have myself seen some very ridiculous ones but which have given great pain as well to the person offended as to him who hath been the innocent occasion of giving the offence thirdly all general reflections on countries religions and professions which are always unjust if these are ever tolerable they are only from the persons who with some pleasantry ridicule their own country it is very common among us to cast sarcasms on a neighbouring nation to which we have no other reason to bear an antipathy than what is more usual than justifiable because we have injured it but sure such general satire is not founded on truth for i have known gentlemen of that nation possessed with every good quality which is to be wished in a man or required in a friend i remember a repartee made by a gentleman of this country which though it was full of the severest wit the person to whom it was directed could not resent as he so plainly deserved it he had with great bitterness inveighed against this whole people upon which one of them who was present very coolly answered i dont know sir whether i have not more reason to be pleased with the compliment you pay my country than to be angry with what you say against it since by your abusing us all so heavily you have plainly implied you are not of it this exposed the other to so much laughter especially as he was not unexceptionable in his character that i believe he was sufficiently punished for his illmannered satire fourthly blasphemy and irreverent mention of religion i will not here debate what compliment a man pays to his own understanding by the profession of infidelity it is sufficient to my purpose that he runs the risque of giving the cruelest offence to persons of a different temper for if a loyalist would be greatly affronted by hearing any indecencies offered to the person of a temporal prince how much more bitterly must a man who sincerely believes in such a being as the almighty feel any irreverence or insult shewn to his name his honour or his institution and notwithstanding the impious character of the present age and especially of many among those whose more immediate business it is to lead men as well by example as precept into the ways of piety there are still sufficient numbers left who pay so honest and sincere a reverence to religion as may give us a reasonable expectation of finding one at least of this stamp in every large company a fifth particular to be avoided is indecency we are not only to forbear the repeating of such words as would give an immediate affront to a lady of reputation but the raising of any loose ideas tending to the offence of that modesty which if a young woman hath not something more than the affectation of she is not worthy the regard even of a man of pleasure provided he hath any delicacy in his constitution how inconsistent with goodbreeding it is to give pain and confusion to such is sufficiently apparent all doubleentendres and obscene jests are therefore carefully to be avoided before them but suppose no ladies present nothing can be meaner lower and less productive of rational mirth than this loose conversation for my own part i cannot conceive how the idea of jest or pleasantry came ever to be annexed to one of our highest and most serious pleasures nor can i help observing to the discredit of such merriment that it is commonly the last resource of impotent wit the weak strainings of the lowest silliest and dullest fellows in the world sixthly you are to avoid knowingly mentioning anything which may revive in any person the remembrance of some past accident or raise an uneasy reflection on a present misfortune or corporal blemish to maintain this rule nicely perhaps requires great delicacy but it is absolutely necessary to a wellbred man i have observed numberless breaches of it many i believe proceeding from negligence and inadvertency yet i am afraid some may be too justly imputed to a malicious desire of triumphing in our own superior happiness and perfections now when it proceeds from this motive it is not easy to imagine anything more criminal under this head i shall caution my wellbred reader against a common fault much of the same nature which is mentioning any particular quality as absolutely essential to either man or woman and exploding all those who want it this renders every one uneasy who is in the least selfconscious of the defect i have heard a boor of fashion declare in the presence of women remarkably plain that beauty was the chief perfection of that sex and an essential without which no woman was worth regarding a certain method of putting all those in the room who are but suspicious of their defect that way out of countenance i shall mention one fault more which is not paying a proper regard to the present temper of the company or the occasion of their meeting in introducing a topic of conversation by which as great an absurdity is sometimes committed as it would be to sing a dirge at a wedding or an epithalamium at a funeral thus i have i think enumerated most of the principal errors which we are apt to fall into in conversation and though perhaps some particulars worthy of remark may have escaped me yet an attention to what i have here said may enable the reader to discover them at least i am persuaded that if the rules i have now laid down were strictly observed our conversation would be more perfect and the pleasure resulting from it purer and more unsullied than at present it is but i must not dismiss this subject without some animadversions on a particular species of pleasantry which though i am far from being desirous of banishing from conversation requires most certainly some reins to govern and some rule to direct it the reader may perhaps guess i mean raillery to which i may apply the fable of the lapdog and the ass for while in some hands it diverts and delights us with its dexterity and gentleness in others it paws daubs offends and hurts the end of conversation being the happiness of mankind and the chief means to procure their delight and pleasure it follows i think that nothing can conduce to this end which tends to make a man uneasy and dissatisfied with himself or which exposes him to the scorn and contempt of others i here except that kind of raillery therefore which is concerned in tossing men out of their chairs tumbling them into water or any of those handicraft jokes which are exercised on those notable persons commonly known by the name of buffoons who are contented to feed their belly at the price of their br ch and to carry off the wine and the p ss of a great man together this i pass by as well as all remarks on the genius of the great men themselves who are to fetch a phrase from school a phrase not improperly mentioned on this occasion great dabs at this kind of facetiousness but leaving all such persons to expose human nature among themselves i shall recommend to my wellbred man who aims at raillery the excellent character given of horace by persius omne vafer vitium ridenti flaccus amico tangit et admissus circum praecordia ludit callidus excusso populum suspendere naso thus excellently rendered by the late ingenious translator of that obscure author yet could shrewd horace with disportive wit rally his friend and tickle while he bit winning access he playd around the heart and gently touching prickd the tainted part the crowd he sneerd but sneerd with such a grace it passd for downright innocence of face the raillery which is consistent with goodbreeding is a gentle animadversion on some foible which while it raises a laugh in the rest of the company doth not put the person rallied out of countenance or expose him to shame and contempt on the contrary the jest should be so delicate that the object of it should be capable of joining in the mirth it occasions all great vices therefore misfortunes and notorious blemishes of mind or body are improper subjects of raillery indeed a hint at such is an abuse and an affront which is sure to give the person unless he be one shameless and abandoned pain and uneasiness and should be received with contempt instead of applause by all the rest of the company again the nature and quality of the person are to be considered as to the first some men will not bear any raillery at all i remember a gentleman who declared he never made a jest nor would ever take one i do not indeed greatly recommend such a person for a companion but at the same time a wellbred man who is to consult the pleasure and happiness of the whole is not at liberty to make any one present uneasy by the quality i mean the sex degree profession and circumstances on which head i need not be very particular with regard to the two former all raillery on ladies and superiors should be extremely fine and gentle and with respect to the latter any of the rules i have above laid down most of which are to be applied to it will afford sufficient caution lastly a consideration is to be had of the persons before whom we rally a man will be justly uneasy at being reminded of those railleries in one company which he would very patiently bear the imputation of in another instances on this head are so obvious that they need not be mentioned in short the whole doctrine of raillery is comprized in this famous line quid de quoque viro et cui dicas saepe caveto be cautious what you say of whom and to whom and now methinks i hear some one cry out that such restrictions are in effect to exclude all raillery from conversation and to confess the truth it is a weapon from which many persons will do wisely in totally abstaining for it is a weapon which doth the more mischief by how much the blunter it is the sharpest wit therefore is only to be indulged the free use of it for no more than a very slight touch is to be allowed no hacking nor bruising as if they were to hew a carcase for hounds as shakspeare phrases it nor is it sufficient that it be sharp it must be used likewise with the utmost tenderness and goodnature and as the nicest dexterity of a gladiator is shewn in being able to hit without cutting deep so is this of our railler who is rather to tickle than wound true raillery indeed consists either in playing on peccadilloes which however they may be censured by some are not esteemed as really blemishes in a character in the company where they are made the subject of mirth as too much freedom with the bottle or too much indulgence with women c or secondly in pleasantly representing real good qualities in a false light of shame and bantering them as ill ones so generosity may be treated as prodigality oeconomy as avarice true courage as foolhardiness and so of the rest lastly in ridiculing men for vices and faults which they are known to be free from thus the cowardice of a le the dulness of ch d the unpoliteness of d ton may be attacked without danger of offence and thus lyt n may be censured for whatever vice or folly you please to impute to him and however limited these bounds may appear to some yet in skilful and witty hands i have known raillery thus confined afford a very diverting as well as inoffensive entertainment to the whole company i shall conclude this essay with these two observations which i think may be clearly deduced from what hath been said first that every person who indulges his illnature or vanity at the expense of others and in introducing uneasiness vexation and confusion into society however exalted or hightitled he may be is thoroughly illbred secondly that whoever from the goodness of his disposition or understanding endeavours to his utmost to cultivate the goodhumour and happiness of others and to contribute to the ease and comfort of all his acquaintance however low in rank fortune may have placed him or however clumsy he may be in his figure or demeanour hath in the truest sense of the word a claim to goodbreeding the true patriot no tuesday january qui non recte instituunt atque erudiunt liberos non solum liberis sed et reipublicae faciunt injuriam cicero mr adams having favoured me with a second letter i shall give it the public without any apology if anything in it should at first a little shock those readers who know the world better i hope they will make allowances for the ignorance and simplicity of the writer to the true patriot my worthy friend i am concerned to find by all our public accounts that the rebels still continue in the land in my last i evidently proved that their successes were owing to a judgment denounced against our sins and concluded with some exhortations for averting the divine anger by the only methods which suggested themselves to my mind these exhortations by the event i perceive have not had that regard paid to them i had reason to expect indeed i am the more confirmed in this conjecture by a lad whom i lately met at a neighbouring baronets where i sojourned the two last days of the year with my good friend mr wilson this lad whom i imagined to have been come from school to visit his friends for the holidays for though he is perhaps of sufficient age i found on examination he was not yet qualified for the university is it seems a man sui juris and is as i gather from the young damsels sir johns daughters a member of the society of bowes i know not whether i spell the word right for i am not ashamed to say i neither understand its etymology nor true import as it hath never once occurred in any lexicon or dictionary which i have yet perused whatever this society may be either the lad with whom i communed is an unworthy member or it would become the government to put it down by authority for he uttered many things during our discourse for which i would have well scourged any of the youth under my care he had not long entered the chamber before he acquainted the damsels that he and his companions had carried the opera in opposition to the puts by which i afterwards learnt he meant all sober and discreet persons and fags says he i am afraid though he made use of a worse word we expected the bishops would have interfered but if they had we should have silenced them i then thought to myself strippling if i had you well horsed on the back of another lad i would teach you more reverence to their lordships this opera i am informed is a diversion in which a prodigious sum of money more than is to be collected out of twenty parishes is lavished away on foreign eunuchs and papists very scandalous to be suffered at any time especially at a season when both war and famine hang over our heads illustration he acquainted the damsels that he and his companions had carried the opera during the whole time of our repast at dinner the young gentleman entertained us with an account of several drums and routs at which he had been present these are it seems large congregations of men and women who instead of assembling together to hear something that is good nay or to divert themselves with gambols which might be allowed now and then in holiday times meet for no other purpose but that of gaming for a whole guinea and much more at a stake at this married women sit up all night nay sometimes till one or two in the morning neglect their families lose their money and some mr wilson says have been suspected of doing even worse than that yet this is suffered in a christian kingdom nay quod prorsus incredibile est the holy sabbath is it seems prostituted to these wicked revellings and cardplaying goes on as publickly then as on any other day nor is this only among the young lads and damsels who might be supposed to know no better but men advanced in years and grave matrons are not ashamed of being caught at the same pastime o tempora o mores when grace was said after meat and the damsels departed the lad began to grow more wicked sir john who is an honest englishman hath no other wine but that of portugal this our bowe could not drink and when sir john very nobly declared he scorned to indulge his palate with rarities for which he must furnish the foe with money to carry on a war with the nation the stripling replied rat the nation god forgive me for repeating such words i had rather live under french government than be debarred from french wine oho my youth if i had you horsed thinks i again but indeed sir john well scourged him with his tongue for that expression and i should have hoped he had made him ashamed had not his subsequent behaviour shewn him totally void of grace for when sir john asked him for a toast which you know is another word for drinking the health of ones friend or wife or some person of public eminence he named the health of a married woman filled out a bumper of wine swore he would drink her health in vinegar and at last openly profest he would commit adultery with her if he could proh pudor nay and if such a sin might admit of any aggravation she is it seems a lady of very high degree et quidem the wife of a lord et dies et charta deficerent si omnia vellem percurrere multa quldem impura et impudica quae memorare nefas recitavit nor is this youth it seems a monster or prodigy in the age he lives on the contrary i am told he is an exemplar only of all the rest but i now proceed to what must surprize you after he had spent an hour in rehearsing all the vices to which youth have been ever too much addicted and shewn us that he was possessed of them all ut qui impudicus adulter ganeo alea manu ventre pene bona patria laceraverat he began to enter upon politics o proceres censore opus an haruspice nobis this stripling this bowe this rake discovered likewise all the wickedness peculiar to age and that he had not with those vices which proceed from the warmth of youth one of the virtues which we should naturally expect from the same sanguine disposition he shewed us that grey hairs could add nothing but hypocrisy to him for he avowed public prostitution laughed at all honour public spirit and patriotism and gave convincing proofs that the most phlegmatic old miser upon earth could not be sooner tempted with gold to perpetrate the most horrid iniquities than himself whether this youth be quod vix credo concerned himself in the public weal or whether he have his information from others i hope he greatly exceeded the truth in what he delivered on this subject for was he to be believed the conclusion we must draw would be that the only concern of our great men even at this time was for places and pensions that instead of applying themselves to renovate and restore our sick and drooping commonweal they were struggling to get closest to her heart and like leeches to suck her last drop of vital blood i hope however better things and that this lad deserves a good rod as well for lying as for all his other iniquity and if his parents do not take care to have it well laid on i can assure them they have much to answer for mr wilson now found me grow very uneasy as indeed i had been from the beginning nor could anything but respect to the company have prevented me from correcting the boy long before he therefore endeavoured to turn the discourse and asked our spark when he left london to which he answered the wednesday before how sir said i travel on christmas day was it so says he fags thats more than i knew but why not travel on christmas day as well as any other why not said i lifting my voice for i had lost all patience was you not brought up in the christian religion did you never learn your catechism he then burst out into an unmannerly laugh and so provoked me that i should certainly have smote him had i not laid my crabstick down in the window and had not mr wilson been fortunately placed between us odso mr parson says he are you there i wonder i had not smoked you before smoke me answered i and at the same time leaped from my chair my wrath being highly kindled at which instant a jackanapes who sat on my left hand whipped my peruke from my head which i no sooner perceived than i porrected him a remembrance over the face which laid him sprawling on the floor i was afterwards concerned at the blow though the consequence was only a bloody nose and the lad who was a companion of the others and had uttered many wicked things which i pretermitted in my narrative very well deserved correction a bustle now arose not worth recounting which ended in my departure with mr wilson though we had purposed to tarry there that night in our way home we both lamented the peculiar hardiness of this country which seems bent on its own destruction nor will take warning by any visitation till the utmost wrath of divine vengeance overtakes it in discoursing upon this subject we imputed much of the present profligacy to the notorious want of care in parents in the education of youth who as my friend informs me with very little schoollearning and not at all instructed ne minime quidem imbuti in any principles of religion virtue and morality are brought to the great city or sent to travel to other great cities abroad before they are twenty years of age where they become their own masters and enervate both their bodies and minds with all sorts of diseases and vices before they are adult i shall conclude with a passage in aristotles politics lib viii cap i greek text which for the sake of women and those few gentlemen who do not understand greek i have rendered somewhat paraphrastically in the vernacular no man can doubt but that the education of youth ought to be the principal care of every legislator by the neglect of which great mischief accrues to the civil polity in every city i am while you write like an honest man and a good christian your hearty friend and wellwisher abraham adams the coventgarden journal no tuesday february at nostri proavi plautinos et numeros et laudavere sales nimium patienter utrumque ne dicam stulte mirati modernised in former times this tasteless silly town too fondly praisd tom durfey and tom brown the present age seems pretty well agreed in an opinion that the utmost scope and end of reading is amusement only and such indeed are now the fashionable books that a reader can propose no more than mere entertainment and it is sometimes very well for him if he finds even this in his studies letters however were surely intended for a much more noble and profitable purpose than this writers are not i presume to be considered as mere jackpuddings whose business it is only to excite laughter this indeed may sometimes be intermixed and served up with graver matters in order to titillate the palate and to recommend wholesome food to the mind and for this purpose it hath been used by many excellent authors for why as horace says should not any one promulgate truth with a smile on his countenance ridicule indeed as he again intimates is commonly a stronger and better method of attacking vice than the severer kind of satire when wit and humour are introduced for such good purposes when the agreeable is blended with the useful then is the writer said to have succeeded in every point pleasantry as the ingenious author of clarissa says of a story should be made only the vehicle of instruction and thus romances themselves as well as epic poems may become worthy the perusal of the greatest of men but when no moral no lesson no instruction is conveyed to the reader where the whole design of the composition is no more than to make us laugh the writer comes very near to the character of a buffoon and his admirers if an old latin proverb be true deserve no great compliments to be paid to their wisdom after what i have here advanced i cannot fairly i think be represented as an enemy to laughter or to all those kinds of writing that are apt to promote it on the contrary few men i believe do more admire the works of those great masters who have sent their satire if i may use the expression laughing into the world such are the great triumvirate lucian cervantes and swift these authors i shall ever hold in the highest degree of esteem not indeed for that wit and humour alone which they all so eminently possest but because they all endeavoured with the utmost force of their wit and humour to expose and extirpate those follies and vices which chiefly prevailed in their several countries i would not be thought to confine wit and humour to these writers shakspeare moliere and some other authors have been blessed with the same talents and have employed them to the same purposes there are some however who though not void of these talents have made so wretched a use of them that had the consecration of their labours been committed to the hands of the hangman no good man would have regretted their loss nor am i afraid to mention rabelais and aristophanes himself in this number for if i may speak my opinion freely of these two last writers and of their works their design appears to me very plainly to have been to ridicule all sobriety modesty decency virtue and religion out of the world now whoever reads over the five great writers first mentioned in this paragraph must either have a very bad head or a very bad heart if he doth not become both a wiser and a better man in the exercise of the mind as well as in the exercise of the body diversion is a secondary consideration and designed only to make that agreeable which is at the same time useful to such noble purposes as health and wisdom but what should we say to a man who mounted his chamberhobby or fought with his own shadow for his amusement only how much more absurd and weak would he appear who swallowed poison because it was sweet how differently did horace think of study from our modern readers quid verum atque decens curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum condo et compono quae mox depromere possim truth and decency are my whole care and enquiry in this study i am entirely occupied these i am always laying up and so disposing that i can at any time draw forth my stores for my immediate use the whole epistle indeed from which i have paraphrased this passage is a comment upon it and affords many useful lessons of philosophy when we are employed in reading a great and good author we ought to consider ourselves as searching after treasures which if well and regularly laid up in the mind will be of use to us on sundry occasions in our lives if a man for instance should be overloaded with prosperity or adversity both of which cases are liable to happen to us who is there so very wise or so very foolish that if he was a master of seneca and plutarch could not find great matter of comfort and utility from their doctrines i mention these rather than plato and aristotle as the works of the latter are not i think yet completely made english and consequently are less within the reach of most of my countrymen but perhaps it may be asked will seneca or plutarch make us laugh perhaps not but if you are not a fool my worthy friend which i can hardly with civility suspect they will both the latter especially please you more than if they did for my own part i declare i have not read even lucian himself with more delight than i have plutarch but surely it is astonishing that such scribblers as tom brown tom durfey and the wits of our age should find readers while the writings of so excellent so entertaining and so voluminous an author as plutarch remain in the world and as i apprehend are very little known the truth i am afraid is that real taste is a quality with which human nature is very slenderly gifted it is indeed so very rare and so little known that scarce two authors have agreed in their notions of it and those who have endeavoured to explain it to others seem to have succeeded only in shewing us that they know it not themselves if i might be allowed to give my own sentiments i should derive it from a nice harmony between the imagination and the judgment and hence perhaps it is that so few have ever possessed this talent in any eminent degree neither of these will alone bestow it nothing is indeed more common than to see men of very bright imaginations and of very accurate learning which can hardly be acquired without judgment who are entirely devoid of taste and longinus who of all men seems most exquisitely to have possessed it will puzzle his reader very much if he should attempt to decide whether imagination or judgment shine the brighter in that inimitable critic but as for the bulk of mankind they are clearly void of any degree of taste it is a quality in which they advance very little beyond a state of infancy the first thing a child is fond of in a book is a picture the second is a story and the third a jest here then is the true pons asinorum which very few readers ever get over from what i have said it may perhaps be thought to appear that true taste is the real gift of nature only and if so some may ask to what purpose have i endeavoured to show men that they are without a blessing which it is impossible for them to attain now though it is certain that to the highest consummation of taste as well as of every other excellence nature must lend much assistance yet great is the power of art almost of itself or at best with only slender aids from nature and to say the truth there are very few who have not in their minds some small seeds of taste all men says cicero have a sort of tacit sense of what is right or wrong in arts and sciences even without the help of arts this surely it is in the power of art very greatly to improve that most men therefore proceed no farther than as i have above declared is owing either to the want of any or which is perhaps yet worse to an improper education i shall probably therefore in a future paper endeavour to lay down some rules by which all men may acquire at least some degree of taste in the meanwhile i shall according to the method observed in inoculation recommend to my readers as a preparative for their receiving my instructions a total abstinence from all bad books i do therefore most earnestly intreat all my young readers that they would cautiously avoid the perusal of any modern book till it hath first had the sanction of some wise and learned man and the same caution i propose to all fathers mothers and guardians evil communications corrupt good manners is a quotation of st paul from menander evil books corrupt at once both our manners and our taste no saturday april odi profanum vulgas hor i hate profane rascals sir in this very learned and enlightened age in which authors are almost as numerous as booksellers i doubt not but your correspondents furnish you with a sufficient quantity of waste paper i perhaps may add to the heap for as men do not always know the motive of their own actions i may possibly be induced by the same sort of vanity as other puny authors have been to desire to be in print but i am very well satisfied with you for my judge and if you should not think proper to take any notice of the hint i have here sent you i shall conclude that i am an impertinent correspondent but that you are a judicious and impartial critic in my own defence however i must say that i am never better pleased than when i see extraordinary abilities employed in the support of his honour and religion who has so bountifully bestowed them it is for this reason that i wish you would take some notice of the character or rather story here sent you in my travels westward last summer i lay at an inn in somersetshire remarkable for its pleasant situation and the obliging behaviour of the landlord who though a downright rustic had an awkward sort of politeness arising from his goodnature that was very pleasing and if i may be allowed the expression was a sort of goodbreeding undrest as i intended to make a pretty long journey the next day i rose time enough to behold that glorious luminary the sun set out on his course which bytheby is one of the finest sights the eye can behold and as it is a thing seldom seen by people of fashion unless it be at the theatre at coventgarden i could not help laying some stress upon it here the kitchen in this inn was a very pleasant room i therefore called for some tea sat me in the window that i might enjoy the prospect which the country afforded and a more beautiful one is not in the power of imagination to frame this house was situated on the top of a hill and for two miles below it meadows enlivened with variety of cattle and adorned with a greater variety of flowers first caught my sight at the bottom of this vale ran a river which seemed to promise coolness and refreshment to the thirsty cattle the eye was next presented with fields of corn that made a kind of an ascent which was terminated by a wood at the top of which appeared a verdant hill situate as it were in the clouds where the sun was just arrived and peeping oer the summit which was at this time covered with dew gilded it over with his rays and terminated my view in the most agreeable manner in the world in a word the elegant simplicity of every object round me filled my heart with such gratitude and furnished my mind with such pleasing meditations as made me thank heaven i was born but this state of joyous tranquillity was not of long duration i had scarce begun my breakfast when my ears were saluted with a genteel whistle and the noise of a pair of slippers descending the staircase and soon after i beheld a contrast to my former prospect being a very beauish gentleman with a huge laced hat on as big as pistols in the play a wig somewhat dishevelled and a face which at once gave you a perfect idea of emptiness assurance and intemperance his eyes which before were scarce open he fixt on me with a stare which testified surprise and his coat was immediately thrown open to display a very handsome secondhand goldlaced waistcoat in one hand he had a pair of saddlebags and in the other a hanger of mighty size both of which with a graceful g d d n you he placed upon a chair then advancing towards the landlord who was standing by me he said by g d landlord your wine is damnable strong i dont know replied the landlord it is generally reckoned pretty good for i have it all from london pray who is your wine merchant says the man of importance a very great man says the landlord in his way perhaps you may know him sir his name is kirby ah what honest tom he and i have cracked many a bottle of claret together he is one of the most considerable merchants in the city the dog is hellish poor damnable poor for i dont suppose he is worth a farthing more than a hundred thousand pound only a plum thats all he is to be our lordmayor next year i ask pardon sir that is not the man for our mr kirbys name is not thomas but richard ay says the gentleman thats his brother they are partners together i believe says the landlord you are out sir for that gentleman has no brother d n your nonsense with you and your outs says the beau as if i should not know better than you country puts i who have lived in london all my lifetime i ask a thousand pardons says the landlord i hope no offence sir no no cries the other we gentlemen know how to make allowance for your country breeding then stepping to the kitchen door with an audible voice he called the ostler and in a very graceful accent said d n your blood you cockeyed son of a bitch bring me my boots did not you hear me call then turning to the landlord said faith that mr whatdecallum the exciseman is a damned jolly fellow yes sir says the landlord he is a merryish sort of a man but says the gentleman as for that schoolmaster he is the queerest bitch i ever saw he looks as if he could not say boh to a goose i dont know sir says the landlord he is reckoned to be a desperate good schollard about us and the gentry likes him vastly for he understands the measurement of land and timber knows how to make dials and such things and for ciphering few can outdo en ay says the gentleman he does look like a cipher indeed for he did not speak three words all last night the ostler now produced the boots which the gentleman taking in his hand and having placed himself in the chair addressed in the following speech my good friends mr boots i tell you plainly that if you plague me so damnably as you did yesterday morning by g ill commit you to the flames stap my vituals as my lord huntingdon says in the play he then looked full in my face and asked the landlord if he had ever been at drurylane playhouse which he answered in the negative what says he did you never hear talk of mr garrick and king richard no sir says the landlord by g says the gentleman he is the cleverest fellow in england he then spouted a speech out of king richard which begins give me an horse c there says he that that is just like mr garrick having pleased himself vastly with this performance he shook the landlord by the hand with great goodhumour and said by g you seem to be an honest fellow and good blood if youll come and see me in london ill give you your skinful of wine and treat you with a play and a whore every night you stay ill show you how it is to live my boy but here bring me some paper my girl come let us have one of your loveletters to air my boots upon which the landlord presented him with a piece of an old newspaper d n you says the gent this is not half enough have you never a bible or common prayerbook in the house half a dozen chapters of genesis with a few prayers make an excellent fire in a pair of boots oh lord forgive you says the landlord sure you would not burn such books as those no cries the spark where was you born go into a shop of london and buy some butter or a quartern of tea and then youll see what use is made of these books ay says the landlord we have a saying here in our country that tis as sure as the devil is in london and if he was not there they could not be so wicked as they be here a country fellow who had been standing up in one corner of the kitchen eating of cold bacon and beans and who i observed trembled at every oath this spark swore took his dish and pot and marched out of the kitchen fearing as i afterwards learnt that the house would fall down about his ears for he was sure he said that man in the goldlaced hat was the devil the young spark having now displayed all his wit and humour and exerted his talents to the utmost thought he had sufficiently recommended himself to my favour and convinced me he was a gentleman he therefore with an air addressed himself to me and asked me which way i was travelling to which i gave him no answer he then exalted his voice but at my continuing silent he asked the landlord if i was deaf upon which the landlord told him he did not believe the gentleman was dunch for that he talked very well just now the man of wit whispered in the landlords ear and said i suppose he is either a parson or a fool he then drank a dram observing that a man should not cool too fast paid sixpence more than his reckoning called for his horse gave the ostler a shilling and galloped out of the inn thoroughly satisfied that we all agreed with him in thinking him a clever fellow and a man of great importance the landlord smiling took up his money and said he was a comical gentleman but that it was a thousand pities he swore so much if it was not for that he was a very good customer and as generous as a prince for that the night before he had treated everybody in the house i then asked him if he knew that comical gentleman as he called him no really sir said the landlord though a gentleman was saying last night that he was a sort of rider or rideout to a linendraper at london this mr censor i have since found to be true for having occasion to buy some cloth i went last week into a linendrapers shop in which i found a young fellow whose decent behaviour and plain dress shewed he was a tradesman upon looking full in his face i thought i had seen it before nor was it long before i recollected where it was and that this was the same beau i had met with in somersetshire the difference in the same man in london where he was known and in the country where he was a stranger was beyond expression and was it not impertinent to make observations to you i could inlarge upon this sort of behaviour for i am firmly of opinion that there is neither spirit nor good sense in oaths nor any wit or humour in blasphemy but as vulgar errors require an abler pen than mine to correct them i shall leave that task to you and am sir your humble servant r s familiar letters note see introduction the following five letters were given me by the author of the preface i should have thought this hint unnecessary had not much nonsense and scurrility been unjustly imputed to him by the good judgment or goodnature of the age they can know but little of his writings who want to have them pointed out but they know much less of him who impute any such base and scandalous productions to his pen letter cli a letter from a french gentleman to his friend in paris in imitation of horace addison and all other writers of travelling letters done into english monsieur at whitehall we took a pair of oars for putney these we had indeed some difficulty to procure for many refused to go with us farther than foxhall or ranelagh gardens at last we prevailed with two fellows for three halfcrowns to take us on board i have been told there was formerly a law regulating the fares of these people but that is to be sure obsolete i think it pity it was not revived as the weather was extremely fine we did not regret the tides running against us since by that means we had more opportunity of making observations on the finest river in the world except the seine after taking a survey of the new bridge which must be greatly admired by all who have not seen the pontneuf we past by a row of buildings not very remarkable for their elegance being chiefly built of wood and irregular many of them are supported by pillars but of what order we could not plainly discern we came now to lambeth where is a palace of the archbishop of canterbury the metropolitan of england this is a vast pile of building not very beautiful indeed in its structure but wonderfully well calculated as well to signify as to answer the use for which it was i suppose originally intended containing a great number of little apartments for the reception of travelling and distressed christians lambeth is perhaps so called from lamb which is the type of meekness the next place of note as we ascend the river is foxhall or rather foxhole the first syllable of which is corrupted into vaux by the vulgar who tell a foolish story of one vaux who resided here and attempted to blow up the thames but the true reading is foxhole as appears by an ancient piece of painting representing that animal whence it takes its name and which is now to be seen on a high wooden pillar anglice a signpost not far from the landingplace a very little farther stands marblehall of which we had a full view from the water this is a most august edifice built all of a rich marble which reflecting the sunbeams creates an object too dazzling for the sight having passed this we were entertained with a most superb piece of architecture of white or rather yellow brick this belongs to one of the bourgeois as do indeed most of the villas which border on both sides this river and they tend to give as magnificent an idea of the riches which flow in to these people by trade as the shipping doth which is to be seen below the bridge of london hence a range of most delicious meadows begins to open which being richly enamelled with flowers of all kinds seem to contend whether they shall convey most pleasure to your sight or to your smell our contemplation was however diverted from this scene by a boat in which were two young ladies extremely handsome who accosted us in some phrase which we who thought ourselves pretty good masters of the english tongue did not understand they were answered however by our watermen who afterwards told us that this is called waterlanguage and consequently i suppose not to be learned on shore the next place which presents itself on the surry side for i reserve the other shore for my return is the pleasant village of battersea the true reading of which we conjectured to be bettersee and that it was formerly a bishoprick and had the preference to shelsee of which we shall speak anon it is chiefly famous at present for affording a retreat to one of the greatest statesmen of his time who hath here a magnificent palace from bettersee verging to the southwest stands wanser as it is vulgarly called but its true name was undoubtedly windmillshore from whence it is a very easy corruption and several windmills are yet to be found in its neighbourhood here are to be seen a parish church and some houses but it is otherwise little worth the curiosity of travellers as you sail from hence two lofty towers at once salute your eyes from opposite shores of the river divided by a magnificent wooden bridge that on the surry shore is called putney or putnigh a fair and beautiful town consisting principally of one vast street which extends from north to south and is adorned with most beautiful buildings here we went ashore in order to regale ourselves in one of their houses of entertainment as they are called but in reality there is no entertainment at them here were no tarts nor cheesecakes nor any sort of food but an english dish called bread and cheese and some raw flesh but if it be difficult to find anything to allay hunger it is still more so to quench your thirst there is a liquor sold in this country which they call wine most of the inhabitants indeed call it wind of what ingredients it is composed i cannot tell but you are not to conceive as the word seems to import that this is a translation of our french word vin a liquor made of the juice of the grape for i am very well assured there is not a drop of any such juice in it there must be many ingredients in this liquor from the many different tastes some of which are sweet others sour and others bitter but though it appeared so nauseous to me and my friend that we could not swallow it the english relish it very well nay they will often drink a gallon of it at a sitting and sometimes in their cups for it intoxicates will wantonly give it the names of all our best wines however though we found nothing to eat or drink we found something to pay i send you a copy of the bill produced us on this occasion as i think it a curiosity s d for bred and bear eating wind watermens eating and lickor so that with the drawer we were at the expence of ten shillings though no catholic ever kept an ashwednesday better the drawers here may want some explanation you must know then that in this country in whatever house you eat or drink whether private or public you are obliged to pay the servants a fee at your departure otherwise they certainly affront you these fees are called vails and they serve instead of wages for though in private houses the master generally contracts with his servant to give him wages yet these are seldom or never paid and indeed the vails commonly amount to much more from putnigh we crossed over to the other shore where stands the fair and beautiful town of fullhome vulgarly called fulham it is principally remarkable for being the residence of a bishop but a large grove of trees prevented our seeing his palace from the water these two towns were founded by two sisters and they received their names from the following occasion these ladies being on the surry shore called for a boat to convey them across the water the watermen being somewhat lazy and not coming near enough to the land the lady who had founded the town which stands in surry bid them put nigh upon which her sister immediately cried out a good omen let putnigh be the name of the place when they came to the other side she who had founded the other town ordered the watermen to push the boat full home her sister then returned the favour and gave the name of fullhome to the place here stands a most stately and magnificent bridge we enquired of the watermen by whose benefaction this was built benefaction do you call it says one of them with a sneer i heartily wish it had been by mine there hath been a fine parcel of money got by that job a name which the english give to all works of a public nature for so grateful are these people that nobody ever doth anything for the public but he is certain to make his fortune by it we now returned by the shore of middlesex and passed by several beautiful meadows where the newmowed hay would have wonderfully delighted our smell had it not been for a great variety of dead dogs cats and other animals which being plentifully bestrewed along this shore a good deal abated the sweetness which must have otherwise impregnated the air we at length arrived at shelsee a corruption of shallowsee for the word shallow signifies empty worthless thus a shallow purse and a shallow fellow are words of contempt this formerly was doubtless a small bishoprick and inferior to that on the other side of the water which was called bettersee here are many things worthy the curiosity of travellers this place is famous for the residence of don saltero a spanish nobleman who hath a vast collection of all sorts of rarities but we had no time to see them here is likewise a walk called paradise row from the delightful situation and the magnificent buildings with which it is adorned we had certainly gone on shore to admire the beauty of this walk but here being no landingplace we must have spoiled our stockings by stepping into the mud and were besides informed that the road was so abominably dirty that it would be difficult to cross the rather as it seemed entirely stopped up by a great number of dustcarts a little farther stands an hospital or rather a palace for the reception of old and wounded soldiers a benefaction of so noble a kind that it really doth honour to the english nation here are some very beautiful apartments which they told us belonged to the officers a word which led us into a mistake as we afterwards discovered for we imagined that these apartments were allotted to those gentlemen who had borne commissions in the army and who had by being disabled in the service entitled themselves to the public favour but on farther enquiry we were surprized to find there was no provision at all for any such and that these officers were a certain number of placemen who had never borne arms nor had any military merit whatever beyond this stands ranelagh of which we shall say no more than that it is a very large round room and will contain abundance of people this is indeed a sufficient recommendation to the english who never inquire farther into the merit of any diversion when they hear it is very much frequented a humour of which we saw many instances all their publick places being either quite empty of company or so crouded that we could hardly get to them hence sailing by a shore where we saw little very remarkable save only the carcases of animals which were here in much greater quantity than we had before found them we arrived at a place called millbank or milebank and soon after we passed as we were informed by the senatehouses but though we went within a few yards of them we could not discern with any certainty which were they having again shot as they call it the new bridge we saw the palace of a nobleman who hath the honour to be a duke of france as well as of england and the happiness to be greatly esteemed in both countries near this palace stands that of another duke who among other great and good qualities is reputed the most benevolent man in the world a little further we saw the palace of an earl of a very high character likewise among his countrymen and who in times of corruption hath maintained the integrity of an old roman the palaces of these three noblemen who do a real honour to their high rank and who are greatly beloved and respected by their country are extremely elegant in their buildings as well as delightful in their situation and to be sincere are the only edifices that discover any true taste which we saw in all our voyage we now approached to hungerfordstairs the place destined for our landing where we were entertained with a sight very common it seems in this country this was the ducking of a pickpocket when we were first told this we imagined it might be the execution of some legal sentence but we were informed that his executioners had been likewise his judges to give you some idea of this for it is impossible for any one who doth not live in what they call a free country to have an adequate notion of a mob whenever a pickpocket is taken in the fact the person who takes him calls out pickpocket upon which word the mob who are always at hand in the street assemble and having heard the accusation and sometimes the defence though they are not always very strict as to the latter judging a good deal by appearances if they believe the accuser the prisoner is sentenced to be ducked and this sentence is immediately executed with such rigour that he hardly escapes with his life the mob take cognizance of all other misdemeanours which happen in the streets and they are a court which generally endeavours to do justice though they sometimes err by the hastiness of their decisions perhaps it is the only court in the world where there is no partiality arising from respect of persons they are great enemies to the use of swords as they are weapons with which they are not intrusted if a gentleman draws a sword though it be only in terrorem to defend himself he is certain to be very severely treated by them but they give great encouragement to their superiors who will condescend to shew their courage in the way which the mob themselves use by boxing of which we shall presently shew you an instance our boat was now with some difficulty close to the landingplace for there was a great croud of boats every one of which instead of making way for us served to endeavour to keep us out upon this occasion many hundred curses passed between our watermen and their fellows and not a few affronts were cast on us especially as we were drest after the manner of our country at last we arrived safe on shore where we payed our watermen who grumbled at our not giving them something to drink for all the labouring people in this country apply their hire only to eatables for which reason they expect something over and above to drink as we walked towards the strand a drayman ran his whip directly into my friends face perhaps with no design of doing this but at the same time without any design of avoiding it my friend who is impatient of an affront immediately struck the carter with his fist who attempted to return the favour with his whip but monsieur bellair who is extremely strong and active and who hath learnt to box in this country presently closed in with him and tript up his heels the mob now assembled round us and being pleased with my friend for not having drawn his sword inclined visibly to his side and commended many blows which he gave his adversary and other feats of activity which he displayed during the combat that lasted some minutes at the end of which the drayman yielded up the victory crying with a sneer d n you you have been on the stage or i am mistaken the mob now gave a huzza in my friends favour and sufficiently upbraided his antagonist who they said was well enough served for affronting a gentleman monsieur bellair had on the beginning of the scuffle while the enemy lay on the ground delivered his sword to one of the bystanders which person had unluckily walked off in the croud without remembering to restore it upon this the mob raged violently and swore vengeance against the thief if he could be discovered but as this could not be done he was obliged at length to submit to the loss when we began to depart several of our friends demanded of us something to drink but as we were more out of humour with the loss than pleased with the glory obtained we could not be prevailed upon to open our purses the company were incensed with this we were saluted with the titles of mounshire and other contemptuous appellations several missile weapons such as dirt c began likewise to play on us and we were both challenged to fight by several who told my friend though he beat the drayman he was not above half a man we then made the best of our way and soon escaped into a hackneycoach thus i have sent you a particular account of this voyage from some parts of which you may perhaps conclude that the meanest rank of people are in this country better provided for than their superiors and that the gentry at least those of the lower class of that order fare full as well in other places for to say the truth it appears to me that an englishman in that station is liable to be opprest by all above him and insulted by all below him i am c the end
