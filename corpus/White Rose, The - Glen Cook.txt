 chapter one the plain of fear the still desert air had a lenselike quality the riders seemed frozen in time moving without drawing closer we took turnscounting i could not get the same number twice running a breath of a breeze whined in the coral stirred the leaves of old father tree they tinkled off one another with the song of wind chimes to the north the glimmer of change lightning limned the horizon like the far clash of warring gods a foot crunched sand i turned silent gawked at a talking menhir it had appeared in the past few seconds startling him sneaky rocks like to play games there are strangers on the plain it said i jumped it chuckled menhirs have the most malevolent laughs this side of fairy stories snarling i ducked into its shadow hot out here already and thats oneeye and goblin back from tanner it was right and i was wrong i was too narrowly focused the patrol had been away a month longer than planned we were worried lately the ladys troops have been more active along the bounds of the plain of fear another chuckle from the block of stone it towered over me thirteen feet tall a middlesized one those over fifteen feetseldom move the riders were closer yet seemed no nearer blame nerves times are desperate for the black company we cannot afford casualties any man lost would be a friend of many years i counted again seemed right this time but there was a riderless mount i shivered despite the heat they were on the downtrail leading to a creek three hundred yards from where we watched concealed within a great reef the walking trees beside the ford stirred though the breeze had failed the riders urged their mounts to hurry the animals were tired they were reluctant though they knew they were almost home into the creek water splashing i grinned pounded silents back they were all there every man and another silent shed his customary cool returned a smile elmo slipped out of the coral and went to meet our brethren otto silent and i hurried after him behind us the morning sun was a great seething ball of blood men piled off horses grinning but they looked bad goblin and oneeye worst of all but they had come back to territory where their wizards powers were useless this near darling they are no greater than the rest of us i glanced back darling had come to the head of the tunnel stood like a phantom in its shadow all in white men hugged men then old habit took charge everybody pretended it was just another day rough out there i asked oneeye i considered the man accompanying them he was not familiar yes the driedup little black man was more diminished than first i had thought you all right took an arrow he rubbed his side flesh wound from behind oneeye goblin squeaked they almost got us been chasing us a month we couldnt shake them lets get you down in the hole i told oneeye not infected i cleared it i still want a look he has been my assistant since i enlisted as company physician his judgment is sound yet health is my responsibility ultimately they were waiting for us croaker darling was gone from the mouth of the tunnel back to the stomach of our subterranean fastness the sun remained bloody in the east legacy of the change storms passing something big drifted across its face windwhale ambush i glanced back at the patrol not us specifically for trouble they were on the ball the patrol had had a double mission to contact our sympathizers in tanner to find out if the ladys people were coming alive after a long hiatus and to raid the garrison there in order to prove we could hurt an empire that bestrides half a world as we passed it the menhir said there are strangers on the plain croaker why do these things happen to me the big stones talk to me more than to anyone else twice a charm i paid attention for a menhir to repeat itself meant it considered its message critical the men hunting you i asked oneeye he shrugged they wouldnt give up whats happening out there hiding on the plain i might as well be buried alive oneeyes face remained unreadable corder will tell it corder that the guy you brought in i knew the name though not the man one of our best informants yeah no good news eh no we slipped into the tunnel which leads down to our warren our stinking moldering damp tight little rabbithole fortress it is disgusting but it is the heart and soul of the new white rose rebellion the new hope as it is whispered among the captive nations the joke hope to those of us who live here it is as bad as any ratinfested dungeonthough a man can leave if he does not mind a venture into a world where all the might of an empire is turned upon him chapter two the plain of fear corder was our eyes and ears in tanner he had contacts everywhere his work against the lady goes back decades he is one of the few who escaped her wrath at charm where she obliterated the rebel of old in great part the company was responsible in those days we were her strong right arm we piloted her enemies into the trap a quarter million men died at charm never was there a battle so vast or grim nor of outcome so definitive even the dominators bloody failure in the old forest consumed but half as many lives fate compelled us to switch sidesonce there was no one left to help us in our fight oneeyes wound was as clean as he claimed i cut him loose ambled off to my quarters word was darling wanted the patrol rested before she accepted its report i shivered with premonition afraid to hear their tidings an old tired man that is what i am what became of the old fire drive ambition there were dreams once upon a time dreams now all but forgotten on sad days i dust them off and fondle them nostalgically with a patronizing wonder at the naivete of the youth who dreamed them old infests my quarters my great project eighty pounds of ancient documents captured from the general whisper when we served the lady and she the rebel they are supposed to contain the key to breaking the lady and the taken i have had them six years and in six years i have found nothing so much failure depressing nowadays more often than not i merely shuffle them then turn to these annals since our escape from juniper they have been little more than a personal journal the remnant of the company generates little excitement what outside news we get is so slim and unreliable i seldom bother recording it moreover since her victory over her husband in juniper the lady seems to be in stasis even more than we running on inertia appearances deceive of course and the ladys essence is illusion croaker i looked up from a page of old tellekurre already studied a hundred times goblin stood in the doorway he looked like an old toad yeah something happening up top grab a sword i grabbed my bow and a leather cuirass i am too ancient for handtohand id rather stand off and plink if i have to fight at all i considered the bow as i followed goblin it had been given me by the lady herself during the battle at charm oh the memories with it i helped slay soulcatcher the taken who brought the company into the ladys service those days now seemed almost prehistoric we galloped into sunlight others came out with us dispersed amidst cactus and coral the rider coming down the trailthe only path in herewould not see us he rode alone on a motheaten mule he was not armed all this for an old man on a mule i asked men scooted through coral and between cacti making one hell of a racket the oldtimer had to know we were there wed better work on getting out here more quietly yeah startled i whirled elmo was behind me one hand shading his eyes he looked as old and tired as i felt each day something reminds me that none of us are young anymore hell none of us were young when we came north over the sea of torments we need new blood elmo he sneered yes we will be a lot older before this is done if we last for we are buying time decades hopefully the rider crossed the creek stopped he raised his hands men materialized weapons held negligently one old man alone at the heart of darlings null presented no danger elmo goblin and i strolled down as we went i asked goblin you and oneeye have fun while you were gone they have been feuding for ages but here where darlings presence forbids it they cannot play sorcerous tricks goblin grinned when he grins his mouth spreads from ear to ear i loosened him up we reached the rider tell me later goblin giggled a squeaking noise like water bubbling in a teakettle yeah who are you elmo asked the mule rider tokens that was not a name it was a password for a courier from the far west we had not heard it for a long time western messengers had to reach the plain through the ladys most tamed provinces yeah elmo said how about that want to step down the old man eased off his mount presented his bonafides elmo found them acceptable then he announced ive got twenty pounds of stuff here he tapped a case behind his saddle every damn town added to the load make the whole trip yourself i asked every foot from oar oar thats more than a thousand miles i hadnt known we had anyone up there but there is a lot i do not know about the organization darling has assembled i spend my time trying to get those damned papers to tell me something that may not be there the old man looked at me as though subjecting my soul to an accounting you the physician croaker yeah so got something for you personal he opened his courier case for a moment everyone was alert you never know but he brought out an oilskin packet wrapped to protect something against the end of the world rains all the time up there he explained he gave me the packet i weighed it not that heavy oilskin aside whos it from the old man shrugged whered you get it from my cell captain of course darling has built with care structuring her organization so that it is almost impossible for the lady to break more than a fraction the child is a genius elmo accepted the rest told otto take him down and find him a bunk get some rest oldtimer the white rose will question you later an interesting afternoon upcoming maybe what with this guy and corder both to report i hefted the mystery packet told elmo ill go give this a look who could have sent it i knew no one outside the plain well but the lady would not inject a letter into the underground would she twinge of fear it had been a while but she had promised to keep in touch the talking menhir that had forewarned us about the messenger remained rooted beside the path as i passed it said there are strangers on the plain croaker i halted what more of them it reverted to character would say no more never will i comprehend those old stones hell i still dont understand why they are on our side they hate all outsiders separately but equally they and every one of the weird sentiences out here i slipped into my quarters unstrung my bow left it leaning against the earth wall i settled at my worktable and opened the packet i did not recognize the hand i found the ending was not signed i began to read chapter three story from yesteryear croaker the woman was bitching again bomanz massaged his temples the throbbing did not slacken he covered his eyes saita sayta suta he murmured his sibilants angry and ophidian he bit his tongue one did not make a sending upon ones wife one endured with humbled dignity the consequences of youthful folly ah but what temptation what provocation enough fool study the damned chart neither jasmine nor the headache relented bloody hell he slapped the weights off the corners of the chart rolled the thin silk around a wisp of glass rod he slipped the rod inside the shaft of a fake antique spear that shaft was shiny with handling besand would spot it in a minute he grumbled he ground his teeth as his ulcer took a bite of gut the closer the end drew the greater was the danger his nerves were shot he was afraid he might crack at the last barrier that cowardice would devour him and he would have lived in vain thirtyseven years was a long time to live in the shadow of the headsmans axe jasmine he muttered and call a sow beauty he flung the doorhanging aside shouted downstairs what is it now it was what it always was nagging unconnected with the root of her dissatisfaction an interruption of his studies as a payback for what she fancied was his having misspent their lives he could have become a man of consequence in oar he could have given her a great house overstuffed with fawning servants he could have draped her in clothofgold he could have fed her tumbledown fat with meat at every meal instead he had chosen a scholars life disguising his name and profession dragging her to this bleak haunted break in the old forest he had given her nothing but squalor icy winters and indignities perpetrated by the eternal guard bomanz stamped down the narrow squeaky treacherous stairway he cursed the woman spat on the floor thrust silver into her desiccated paw drove her away with a plea that supper for once be a decent meal indignity he thought ill tell you about indignity you old crow ill tell you what its like to live with a perpetual whiner a hideous old bag of vapid juvenile dreams stop it bomanz he muttered shes the mother of your son give her her due she hasnt betrayed you if nothing else they still shared the hope represented by the map on silk it was hard for her waiting unaware of his progress knowing only that nearly four decades had yielded no tangible result the bell on the shop door tinkled bomanz clutched at his shopkeeper persona he scuttled forward a fat bald little man with blueveined hands folded before his chest tokar he bowed slightly i didnt expect you so soon tokar was a trader from oar a friend of bomanzs son stancil he had a bluff honest irreverent manner bomanz deluded himself into seeing as the ghost of his own at a younger age didnt plan to be back so soon bo but antiques are the rage it surpasses comprehension you want another lot already youll clean me out unsaid the silent complaint bomanz this means replenishment work time lost from research the domination is hot this year stop pottering around bo make hay and all that next year the market could be as dead as the taken theyre not maybe im getting too old tokar i dont enjoy the rows with besand anymore hell ten years ago i went looking for him a good squabble killed boredom the digging grinds me down too im used up i just want to sit on the stoop and watch life go by while he chattered bomanz set out his best antique swords pieces of armor soldiers amulets and an almost perfectly preserved shield a box of arrowheads with roses engraved a pair of broadbladed thrusting spears ancient heads mounted on replica shafts i can send you some men show them where to dig ill pay you commission you wont have to do anything thats a damned fine axe bo tellekurre i could sell a bargeload of tellekurre weaponry uchitelle actually a twinge from his ulcer no no helpers that was all he needed a bunch of young hotshots hanging over his shoulder while he made his field calculations just a suggestion sorry dont mind me jasmine was on me this morning softly tokar asked found anything connected with the taken with the ease of decades bomanz dissembled feigning horror the taken am i a fool i wouldnt touch it if i could get it past the monitor tokar smiled conspiratorily sure we dont want to offend the eternal guard nevertheless theres one man in oar who would pay well for something that could be ascribed to one of the taken hed sell his soul for something that belonged to the lady hes in love with her she was known for that bomanz avoided the younger mans gaze how much had stance revealed was this one of besands fishing expeditions the older bomanz became the less he enjoyed the game his nerves could not take this double life he was tempted to confess just for the relief no damnit he had too much invested thirtyseven years digging and scratching every minute sneaking and pretending the most abject poverty no he would not give up not now not when he was this close in my way i love her too he admitted but i havent abandoned good sense id scream for besand if i found anything so loud youd hear me in oar all right whatever you say tokar grinned enough suspense he produced a leather wallet letters from stancil bomanz seized the wallet havent heard from him since last time you were here can i start loading bo sure go ahead absently bomanz took his current inventory list from a pigeonhole mark off whatever you take tokar laughed gently all of it this time bo just quote me a price everything half is junk i told you the domination is hot you saw stance how is he he was halfway through the first letter his son had nothing substantial to relate his missives were filled with daily trivia duty letters letters from a son to his parents unable to span the timeless chasm sickeningly healthy bored with the university read on theres a surprise tokar was here bomanz said he grinned danced from foot to foot that thief jasmine scowled did you remember to get paid her fat sagging face was set in perpetual disapproval generally her mouth was open in the same vein he brought letters from stance here he offered the packet he could not contain himself stance is coming home home he cant he has his position at the university hes taking a sabbatical hes coming for the summer why to see us to help with the shop to get away so he can finish a thesis jasmine grumbled she did not read the letters she had not forgiven her son for sharing his fathers interest in the domination what hes doing is coming here to help you poke around where youre not supposed to poke isnt he bomanz darted furtive glances at the shops windows his was an existence of justifiable paranoia its the year of the comet the ghosts of the taken will rise to mourn the passing of the domination this summer would mark the tenth return of the comet which had appeared at the hour of the dominators fall the ten who were taken would manifest strongly bomanz had witnessed one passage the summer he had come to the old forest long before stancils birth the barrowland had been impressive with ghosts walking excitement tightened his belly jasmine would not appreciate it but this was the summer end of the long quest he lacked only one key find it and he could make contact could begin drawing out instead of putting in jasmine sneered why did i get into this my mother warned me its stancil were talking about woman our only ah bo dont call me a cruel old lady of course ill welcome him dont i cherish him too wouldnt hurt to show it bomanz examined the remnants of his inventory nothing left but the worst junk these old bones ache just thinking of the digging ill have to do his bones ached but his spirit was eager restocking was a plausible excuse for wandering the edges of the barrowland no time like now to start you trying to get me out of the house that wouldnt hurt my feelings sighing bomanz surveyed his shop a few pieces of timerotted gear broken weapons a skull that could not be attributed because it lacked the triangular inset characteristic of domination officers collectors were not interested in the bones of kerns or in those of followers of the white rose curious he thought why are we so intrigued by evil the white rose was more heroic than the dominator or taken she has been forgotten by everybody but the monitors men any peasant can name half the taken the barrowland where evil lies restless is guarded and the grave of the white rose is lost neither here nor there bomanz grumbled time to hit the field here here spade divining wand bags maybe tokar was right maybe i should get a helper brushes help carry that stuff around transit maps cant forget those what else claim ribbons of course that wretched men fu he stuffed things into a pack and hung equipment all about himself he gathered spade and rake and transit jasmine jasmine open the damned door she peeped through the curtains masking their living quarters shouldve opened it first dimwit she stalked across the shop one of these days bo youre going to get organized probably the day after my funeral he stumbled down the street grumbling ill get organized the day you die damned well better believe i want you in the ground before you change your mind chapter four the near past corbie the barrowland lies far north of charm in the old forest so storied in the legends of the white rose corbie came to the town there the summer after the dominator failed to escape his grave through juniper he found the ladys minions in high morale the grand evil in the great barrow was no longer to be feared the dregs of the rebel had been routed the empire had no more enemies of consequence the great comet harbinger of all catastrophes would not return for decades one lone focus of resistance remained a child claimed to be the reincarnation of the white rose but she was a fugitive running with the remnants of the traitorous black company nothing to fear there the ladys overwhelming resources would swamp them corbie came limping up the road from oar alone a pack on his back a staff gripped tightly he claimed to be a disabled veteran of the limpers forsberg campaigns he wanted work there was work aplenty for a man not too proud the eternal guard were wellpaid many hired drudgework taken off their duties at that time a regiment garrisoned the barrowland countless civilians orbited its compound corbie vanished among those when companies and battalions transferred out he was an established part of the landscape he washed dishes curried horses cleaned stables carried messages mopped floors peeled vegetables assumed any burden for which he might earn a few coppers he was a quiet tall dusky brooding sort who made no special friends but made no enemies either seldom did he socialize after a few months he asked for and received permission to occupy a ramshackle house long shunned because once it belonged to a sorcerer from oar as time and resources permitted he restored the place and like the sorcerer before him he pursued the mission that had brought him north ten twelve fourteen hours a day corbie worked around town then went home and worked some more people wondered when he rested if there was anything that detracted from corbie it was that he refused to assume his role completely most scutboys had to endure a lot of personal abuse corbie would not accept it victimize him and his eyes went cold as winter steel only one man ever pressed corbie once he got that look corbie beat him with ruthless relentless efficiency no one suspected him of leading a double life outside his home he was corbie the swamper nothing more he lived the role to his heart when he was home in the more public hours he was corbie the renovator creating a new home from an old only in the wee hours while all but the night patrol slept did he become corbie the man with a mission corbie the renovator found a treasure in a wall of the wizards kitchen he took it upstairs where corbie the driven came up from the deeps the scrap of paper bore a dozen words scribbled in a shaky hand a cipher key that lean dusky longunsmiling face shed its ice dark eyes sparkled fingers turned up a lamp corbie sat and for an hour stared at nothing then still smiling he went downstairs and out into the night he raised a hand in gentle greeting whenever he encountered the night patrol he was known now no one challenged his right to limp about and watch the constellations wheel he went home when his nerves settled there would be no sleep for him he scattered papers began to study to decipher to translate to write a storyletter that would not reach its destination for years chapter five the plain of fear oneeye stopped by to tell me darling was about to interview corder and the messenger shes looking peaked croaker you been watching her i watch i advise she ignores what can i do we got twentysome years till the comet shows no point her working herself to death is there tell her that she just tells me this mess will be settled long before the comet comes around again that its a race against time she believes that but the rest of us cannot catch her fire isolated in the plain of fear cut off from the world the struggle with the lady sometimes slips in importance the plain itself too often preoccupies us i caught myself outdistancing oneeye this premature burial has not been good for him without his skills he has weakened physically he is beginning to show his age i let him catch up you and goblin enjoy your adventure he could not choose between a smirk or scowl got you again eh their battle has been on since the dawn oneeye starts each skirmish goblin usually finishes he grumbled something what yo someone shouted everybody up top alert alert oneeye spat twice in one day what the hell i knew what he meant we have not had twenty alerts our whole two years out here now two in one day improbable i dashed back for my bow this time we went out with less clatter elmo had made his displeasure painfully apparent in a few private conversations sunlight again like a blow the entrance to the hole faces westward the sun was in our eyes when we emerged you damned fool elmo was yelling what the hell you doing a young soldier stood in the open pointing i let my gaze follow oh damn i whispered oh double bloody damn oneeye saw it too taken the airborne dot drifted higher circling our hideout spiraling inward it wobbled suddenly yeah taken whisper or journey good to see old friends goblin said as he joined us we had not seen the taken since reaching the plain before that they had been in our hair constantly having pursued us all the four years it had taken us to get here from juniper they are the ladys satraps her understudies in terror once there were ten in the time of the domination the lady and her husband enslaved the greatest of their contemporaries making them their instruments the ten who were taken the taken went into the ground with their masters when the white rose defeated the dominator four centuries ago and they arose with the lady two turns of the comet back and in fighting among themselvesfor some remained loyal to the dominatormost perished but the lady obtained new slaves feather whisper journey feather and the last of the old ones the limper went down at juniper when we overcame the dominators bid for his own resurrection two are left whisper journey the flying carpet wobbled because it had reached the boundary where darlings null was enough to overpower its buoyancy the taken turned away falling outward got far enough to recover complete control pity it didnt come straight in i said and come down like a rock theyre not stupid goblin said theyre just scouting us now he shook his head shuddered he knew something i did not probably something learned during his venture outside the plain campaign heating up i asked yep whatre you doing batbreath he snapped at oneeye pay attention the little black man was ignoring the taken he stared at the wild windcarved bluffs south of us our job is to stay alive oneeye said so smug you knew he had something to get goblins goat that means dont get distracted by the first flashy show you see what the hell does that mean means while the rest of you are eyeballing that clown up there another one sneaked up behind the bluffs and put somebody down goblin and i glared at the red cliffs we saw nothing too late oneeye said its gone but i reckon somebody should go collect the spy i believed oneeye elmo get over here i explained beginning to move he murmured just when i was hoping theyd forgotten us oh they havent goblin said they most certainly havent again i felt he had something on his mind elmo scanned the ground between us and the bluffs he knew it well we all do one day our lives may depend on our knowing it better than someone hunting us okay he told himself i see it ill take four men after i see the lieutenant the lieutenant does not come up for alerts he and two other men camp in the doorway to darlings quarters if ever the enemy reaches darling it will be over their bodies the flying carpet went away westward i wondered why it had gone unchallenged by the creatures of the plain i went to the menhir that had spoken to me earlier i asked instead of answering it said it begins croaker mark this day yeah right and i do call that day the beginning though parts of it started years before that was the day of the first letter the day of the taken and the day of tracker and toadkiller dog the menhir had a final remark there are strangers on the plain it would not defend the various flyers for not resisting the taken elmo returned i said the menhir says we might have more visitors elmo raised an eyebrow you and silent have the next two watches yep be careful goblin oneeye come here they put their heads together then elmo picked four youngsters and went hunting chapter six the plain of fear i went up top for my watch there was no sign of elmo and his men the sun was low the menhir was gone there was no sound but the voice of the wind silent sat in shadow inside a reef of thousandcoral dappled by sunlight come through twisted branches coral makes good cover few of the plains denizens dare its poisons the watch is always in more danger from native exotica than from our enemies i twisted and ducked between deadly spines joined silent he is a long lean aging man his dark eyes seemed focused on dreams that had died i deposited my weapons anything he shook his head a single miniscule negative i arranged the pads i had brought the coral twisted around us branches and fans climbing twenty feet high we could see little but the creek crossing and a few dead menhirs and the walking trees on the far slope one tree stood beside the brook taproot in the water as though sensing my attention it began a slow retreat the visible plain is barren the usual desert lifelichens and scrub brush snakes and lizards scorpions and spiders wild dogs and ground squirrelsis present but scarce you encounter it mainly when that is inconvenient which sums up plain life generally you encounter the real strangeness only when that is most inopportune the lieutenant claims a man trying to commit suicide here could spend years without becoming uncomfortable the predominant colors are reds and browns rust ochre blood and wineshaded sandstones like the bluffs with here and there the random stratum of orange the corals lay down scattered white and pink reefs true verdance is absent both walking trees and scrub plants have leaves a dusty greygreen in which green exists mainly by acclamation the menhirs living and dead are a stark greybrown unlike any stone native to the plain a bloated shadow drifted across the wild scree skirting the cliffs it covered many acres was too dark to be the shadow of a cloud windwhale silent nodded it cruised the upper air between us and the sun but i could not spot it i had not seen one in years last time elmo and i were crossing the plain with whisper on the ladys behalf that long ago time does flee and with little fun in it strange waters under the bridge my friend strange waters under he nodded but he did not speak he is silent he has not spoken in all the years i have known him nor in the years he has been with the company yet both oneeye and my predecessor as annalist say he is quite capable of speech from hints accumulated over the years it has become my firm conviction that in his youth before he signed on he swore a great oath never to speak it being the iron law of the company not to pry into a mans life before he enlisted i have been unable to learn anything about the circumstances i have seen him come close to speaking when he was angry enough or amused enough but always he caught himself at the last instant for a long time men made a game of baiting him trying to get him to break his vow but most abandoned the effort quickly silent had a hundred little ways of discouraging a man like filling his bedroll with ticks shadows lengthened stains of darkness spread at last silent rose stepped over me returned to the hole a darkly clad shadow moving through darkness a strange man silent not only does he not talk he does not gossip how can you get a handle on a guy like that yet he is one of my oldest and closest friends go explain that well croaker the voice was as hollow as a ghosts i started malicious laughter rattled through the coral reef a menhir had slipped up on me i turned slightly it stood square on the path silent had taken twelve feet tall and ugly a runt of its kind hello rock having amused itself at my expense it now ignored me stayed as silent as a stone haha the menhirs are our principal allies upon the plain they interlocute for the other sentient species they let us know what is happening only when it suits them however whats happening with elmo i asked nothing are they magic i guess not otherwise they would not survive inside the nullity darling radiates but what are they mysteries like most of the bizarre creatures out here there are strangers on the plain i know i know night creatures came out dots of luminescence fluttered and swooped above the windwhale whose shadow i saw came far enough eastward to show me its glimmering underbelly it would descend soon trailing tendrils to trap whatever came its way a breeze rose sagey scents trickled across my nostrils air chuckled and whispered and murmured and whistled in the coral from farther away came the windchimes tinkle of old father tree he is unique first or last of his kind i do not know there he stands twenty feet tall and ten thick brooding beside the creek radiating something akin to dread his roots planted on the geographical center of the plain silent goblin and oneeye have all tried to unravel his significance they have gotten nowhere the scarce wild human tribesmen of the plain worship him they say he has been here since the dawn he does have that timeless feel the moon rose while it lay torpid and pregnant on the horizon i thought i saw something cross it taken or one of the plain creatures a racket rose round the mouth of the hole i groaned i did not need this goblin and oneeye for half a minute uncharitably i wished they had not come back knock it off i dont want to hear that crap goblin scooted up outside the coral grinned dared me to do something he looked rested recuperated oneeye asked feeling cranky croaker damned straight whatre you doing out here needed some fresh air he cocked his head stared at the line of cliffs so worried about elmo hell be all right i said i know oneeye added i lied darling sent us she felt something stir at the west edge of the null ah i dont know what it was croaker suddenly he was defensive pained he would have known but for darling he stands where i would were i stripped of my medical gear helpless to do what he has trained at all his life whatre you going to do build a fire what that fire roared oneeye got so ambitious he dragged in enough deadwood to serve half a legion the flames beat back the darkness till i could see fifty yards beyond the creek the last walking trees had departed probably smelled oneeye coming he and goblin dragged in a fallen tree of the ordinary sort we leave the walkers alone except to right clumsies that trip on their own roots not that that happens often they do not travel much they were bickering about who was dogging his share of work they dropped the tree fade goblin said and in a moment there was no sign of them baffled i surveyed the darkness i saw nothing heard nothing i found myself having trouble remaining awake i broke up the dead tree for something to do then i felt the oddness i stopped in midbreak how long had the menhirs been gathering i counted fourteen on the verges of the light they cast long deep shadows whats up i asked my nerves a bit frayed there are strangers on the plain hell of a tune they played i settled near the fire back to it tossed wood over my shoulder building the flames the light spread i counted another ten menhirs after a time i said thats not exactly news one comes that was new and spoken with passion something i had not witnessed before once twice i thought i caught a flicker of motion but i could not be sure firelight is tricky i piled on more wood movement for sure beyond the creek manshape coming toward me slowly wearily i settled in pretended boredom he came nearer across his right shoulder he carried a saddle and blanket held with his left hand in his right he carried a long wooden case its polish gleaming in the firelight it was seven feet long and four inches by eight curious i noticed the dog as they crossed the creek a mongrel ragged mangy mostly a dirty white but with a black circle around one eye and a few daubs of black on its flanks it limped carrying one forepaw off the ground the fire caught its eyes they burned bright red the man was over six feet maybe thirty he moved lithely even in his weariness he had muscles on muscles his tattered shirt revealed arms and chest crisscrossed with scars his face was empty of emotion he met my gaze as he approached the fire neither smiling nor betraying unfriendly intent chill touched me lightly he looked tough but not tough enough to negotiate the plain of fear alone first order of business would be to stall otto was due out to relieve me soon the fire would alert him he would see the stranger then duck down and rouse the hole hello i said he halted exchanged glances with his mongrel the dog came forward slowly sniffing the air searching the surrounding night it stopped a few feet away shook as though wet settled on its belly the stranger came forward just that far take a load off i invited he swung his saddle down lowered his case sat he was stiff he had trouble crossing his legs lose your horse he nodded broke a leg west of here five six miles i lost the trail there are trails through the plain some of them the plain honors as safe sometimes according to a formula known only to its denizens only someone desperate or stupid hazards them alone though this fellow did not look like an idiot the dog made a whuffling sound the man scratched its ears where you headed place called the fastness that is the legendname the propaganda name for the hole a calculated bit of glamor for the troops in faraway places name tracker this is toadkiller dog pleased to meet you tracker toadkiller the dog grumbled tracker said you have to use his whole name toadkiller dog i kept a straight face only because he was such a big grim toughlooking man whats this fastness i asked i never heard of it he lifted hard dark eyes from the mutt smiled ive heard it lies near tokens twice in one day was it the day of twos no not bloody likely i did not like the look of the man either reminded me too much of our onetime brother raven ice and iron i donned my baffled face it is a good one tokens thats a new one on me must be somewhere way the hell out east what are you headed there for anyway he smiled again his dog opened one eye gave me a baleful look they did not believe me carrying messages i see mainly a packet addressed to somebody named croaker i sucked spittle between teeth slowly scanned the surrounding darkness the circle of light had shrunk but the number of menhirs remained undiminished i wondered about oneeye and goblin now theres a name ive heard i said some kind of sawbones again the dog gave me that look this time i decided it was sarcastic oneeye stepped out of the darkness behind tracker sword ready to do the dirty deed damn but he came quiet witchery or no i gave him away with a flicker of surprise tracker and his dog looked back both were startled to see someone there the dog rose its hackles lifted then it sank to the ground again having twisted till it could keep us both in sight but then goblin appeared just as quietly i smiled tracker glanced over his eyes narrowed he looked thoughtful like a man discovering he was in a card game with rogues sharper than he had expected goblin chuckled he wants in croaker i say we take him down trackers hand twitched toward the case he had carried his animal growled tracker closed his eyes when they opened he was in control his smile returned croaker eh then ive found the fastness youve found it friend slowly so as not to alarm anyone tracker took an oilskin packet from his saddlebag it was the twin of that i had received only half a day before he offered it to me i tucked it inside my shirt whered you get it oar he told the same story as the other messenger i nodded youve come that far then yes we should take him in then i told oneeye he caught my meaning we would let this messenger come face to face with the other see if sparks flew oneeye grinned i glanced at goblin he approved none of us felt quite right about tracker i am not sure why lets go i said i hoisted myself off the ground with my bow tracker eyed the stave he started to say something shut up as though he recognized it i smiled as i turned away maybe he thought he had fallen foul of the lady follow me he did and goblin and oneeye followed him neither helping with his gear his dog limped beside him nose to the ground before we went inside i glanced southward concerned when would elmo come home we put tracker and mutt into a guarded cell they did not protest i went to my quarters after wakening otto who was overdue i tried to sleep but that damned packet lay on the table screaming i was not sure i wanted to read its contents it won the battle chapter seven the second letter croaker bomanz peered through his transit sighting on the prow of the great barrow he stepped back noted the angle opened one of his crude field maps this was where he had unearthed the tellekurre axe wish occules descriptions werent so vague this must have been the flank of their formation the axis of their line should have paralleled the others so shifter and the knights would have bunched up over there ill be damned the ground there humped slightly good less ground water to damage buried artifacts but the overgrowth was dense scrub oak wild roses poison ivy especially poison ivy bomanz hated that pestilential weed he started scratching just thinking about it bomanz what he whirled raising his rake whoa take it easy bo whats the matter with you sneaking up like that aint funny besand want me to rake that idiot grin off your face ooh nasty today arent we besand was a lean old man approximately bomanzs age his shoulders slumped following his head which thrust forward as though he was sniffing a trail great blue veins humped the backs of his hands liver spots dotted his skin what the hell do you expect come jumping out of the bushes at a man bushes what bushes your conscience bothering you bo besand youve been trying to trap me since the moon was green why dont you give up first jasmine gives me a hard way to go then tokar buys me out so i have to go digging fresh stock and now i have to dance with you go away im not in the mood besand grinned a big lopsided grin revealing pickets of rotten teeth i havent caught you bo but that dont mean youre innocent it just means i never caught you if im not innocent you must be damned stupid not to catch me in forty years damn man why the hell cant you make life easy for both of us besand laughed real soon now ill be out of your hair for good theyre putting me out to pasture bomanz leaned on his rake considered the guardsman besand exuded a sour odor of pain really im sorry bet you are my replacement might be smart enough to catch you give it a rest you want to know what im doing figuring where the tellekurre knights went down tokar wants spectacular stuff thats the best i can do short of going over there and giving you an excuse to hang me hand me that dowser besand passed the divining rod mound robbing eh tokar suggest that icy needles burrowed into bomanzs spine this was more than a casual question we have to do this constantly havent we known each other long enough to do without the catandmouse i enjoy it bo besand trailed him to the overgrown hummock going to have to clear this out just cant keep up anymore no enough men not enough money could you get it right away thats where i want to dig i think poison ivy oh ware poison ivy bo besand snickered each summer bomanz cursed his way through numerous botanical afflictions about tokar i dont deal with people who want to break the law thats been my rule forever nobody bothers me anymore oblique but acceptable bomanzs wand twitched ill be dipped in sheep shit right in the middle sure look at it jump mustve buried them in one big hole about tokar what about him dammit you want to hang him go ahead just give me time to hook up with somebody else who can handle my business as good i dont want to hang anybody bo i just want to warn you theres a rumor out of oar that says hes a resurrectionist bomanz dropped his rod he gobbled air really a resurrectionist the monitor scrutinized him intently just a rumor i hear all kinds thought you might want to know were as close as two men get around here bomanz accepted the olive branch yeah honestly hes never dropped a hint whew thats a load to drop on a man a load which deserved some heavy thinking dont tell anybody what i found that thief men fu besand laughed yet again his mirth had a sephulchral quality you enjoy your work dont you i mean harassing people who dont dare fight back careful bo i could drag you in for questioning besand spun stalked away bomanz sneered at his back of course besand enjoyed his job it let him play dictator he could do anything to anyone without having to answer for it once the dominator and his minions fell and were buried in their mounds behind barriers wrought of the finest magicks of their day the white rose decreed that an eternal guard be posted a guard beholden to none charged with preventing the resurrection of the undead evil beneath the mounds the white rose understood human nature always there would be those who would see profit in using or following the dominator always there would be worshippers of evil who wished their champion freed the resurrectionists appeared almost before the grass sprouted on the barrows tokar a resurrectionist bomanz thought dont i have enough trouble besand will pitch his tent in my pocket now bomanz had no interest in reviving the old evils he merely wanted to make contact with one of them so as to illuminate several ancient mysteries besand was out of sight he should stomp all the way back to his quarters there would be time for a few forbidden observations bomanz realigned his transit the barrowland did not have the look of great evil only of neglect four hundred years of vegetation and weather had restructured that once marvelous work the barrows and mystical landscaping were all but lost amidst the brush covering them the eternal guard no longer had the wherewithal to perform adequate upkeep monitor besand was fighting a desperate rearguard action against time itself nothing grew well on the barrowland the vegetation was twisted and stunted still the shapes of the mounds and the menhirs and fetishes which bound the taken were often concealed bomanz had spent a lifetime sorting out which mound was which who lay where and where each menhir and fetish stood his master chart his silken treasure was nearly complete he could almost thread the maze he was so close he was tempted to try before he was truly ready but he was no fool he meant to try nursing sweet milk from the blackest of cows he dared make no mistake he had besand on the one hand the poisonous old wickedness on the other but if he succeeded ah if he succeeded if he made contact and nursed away the secrets mans knowledge would be extended dramatically he would become the mightiest of living mages his fame would course with the wind jasmine would have everything she quarreled about sacrificing if he made contact he would by damn neither fear nor the infirmity of age would stay him now a few months and he would have the last key bomanz had lived his lies so long he often lied to himself even in his honest moments he never confessed his most powerful motive his intellectual affair with the lady it was she who had intrigued him from the beginning she whom he was trying to contact she who made the literature endlessly fascinating of all the lords of the domination she was the most shadowed the most surrounded by myth the least encumbered by historical fact some scholars called her the greatest beauty ever to have lived claiming that simply to have seen her was to have fallen into her thrall some called her the true motive force of the domination a few admitted that their documentaries were really little more than romantic fantasies others admitted nothing while demonstrably embellishing bomanz had become perpetually bemused while still a student back in his attic he spread his silken chart his day had not been a complete waste he had located a previously unknown menhir and had identified the spells it anchored and he had found the tellekurre site that would buy the mutton and beans he glared at the chart as if pure will might conjure the information he needed there were two diagrams the upper was a fivepointed star within a slightly larger circle such had been the shape of the barrowland when newly constructed the star had stood a fathom above the surrounding terrain retained by limestone walls the circle represented the outer bank of a moat the earth from which had been used to build the barrows the star and a pentagon within the star today the moat was little more than boggy ground besands predecessors had been unable to keep up with nature within the star drawn off the points where the arms met was a pentagon another fathom high it too had been retained but the walls had fallen and become overgrown central to the pentagon on a northsouth axis lay the great barrow where the dominator slept at the points of his chart star clockwise from the top bomanz had penned the odd numbers from one to nine accompanying each was a name soulcatcher shapeshifter nightcrawler stormbringer bonegnasher the occupants of the five outer barrows had been identified the five inner points were numbered evenly beginning at the right foot of the arm of the star pointing northward at four was the howler at eight the limper the graves of three of the ten who were taken remained unidentified whos in that damned six spot bomanz muttered he slammed a fist against the table dammit four years and he was no closer to that name the mask concealing that identity was the one remaining substantial barrier everything else was plain technical application a matter of negating wardspells then of contacting the great one in the central mound the wizards of the white rose had left volumes bragging about their performances of their art but not one word of where their victims lay such was human nature besand bragged about the fish he caught the bait he used and seldom produced the veritable piscine trophy below his star chart bomanz had drawn a second portraying the central mound it was a rectangle on a northsouth axis surrounded by and filled with ranks of symbols outside each corner was a representation of a menhir which on the barrowland was a twelvefoot pillar topped by a twofaced owls head one face glared inward the other out the menhirs formed the corner posts anchoring the first line of spells warding the great barrow along the sides were the line posts little circles representing wooden fetish poles most had rotted and fallen their spells drooping with them the eternal guard had no staff wizard capable of restoring or replacing them within the mound proper there were symbols ranked in three rectangles of declining size the outermost resembled pawns the next knights and the inner elephants the crypt of the dominator was surrounded by men who had given their lives to bring him down ghosts were the middle line between old evil and a world capable of recalling it bomanz anticipated no difficulty getting past them the ghosts were there in his opinion to discourage common grave robbers within the three rectangles bomanz had drawn a dragon with its tail in its mouth legend said a great dragon lay curled round the crypt more alive than the lady or dominator catnapping the centuries away while awaiting an attempt to recall the trapped evil bomanz had no way of coping with the dragon but he had no need either he meant to communicate with the crypt not to open it damn if he could only lay hands on an old guardsmans amulet the early guards had worn amulets which had allowed them to go into the barrowland to keep it up the amulets still existed though they were no longer used besand wore one the others he kept squirreled away besand that madman that sadist bomanz considered the monitor his closest acquaintance but a friend never no never a friend sad commentary on his life that the man nearest him would be one who would jump at a chance to torture or hang him what was that about retirement someone outside this forsaken forest had recalled the barrowland bomanz are you going to eat bomanz muttered imprecations and rolled his chart the dream came that night something sirenic called him he was young again single strolling the lane that passed his house a woman waved who was she he didnt know he didnt care he loved her laughing he ran toward her floating steps effort took him no nearer her face saddened she faded dont go he called please but she disappeared and took with her his sun a vast starless night devoured his dream he floated in a clearing within a forest unseen slowly slowly a diffuse silver something limned the trees a big star with a long silver mane he watched it grow till its tail spanned the sky twinge of uncertainty shadow of fear its coming right at me he cringed threw his arm across his face the silver ball filled the sky it had a face the womans face bo stop it jasmine punched him again he sat up uhn what you were yelling that nightmare again he listened to his heart hammer sighed could it take much more he was an old man the same one it recurred at unpredictable intervals it was stronger this time maybe you ought to see a dream doctor out here he snorted disgustedly i dont need a dream doctor anyway no probably just your conscience nagging you for luring stancil back from oar i didnt lure go to sleep to his amazement she rolled over for once unwilling to pursue their squabble he stared into the darkness it had been so much clearer almost too crisp and obvious was there a meaning hidden behind the dreams warning against tampering slowly slowly the mood of the beginning of the dream returned that sense of being summoned of being but one intuitive step from hearts desire it felt good his tension drained away he fell asleep smiling besand and bomanz stood watching guardsmen clear the brush from bomanzs site bomanz suddenly spat dont bum it you idiot stop him besand besand shook his head a guard with a torch backed away from the brush pile son you dont burn poison ivy the smoke spreads the poison bomanz was scratching and wondering why his companion was being so reasonable besand smirked get itchy just thinking about it dont you yes theres your other itch he pointed bomanz saw his competitor men fu observing from a safe distance he growled i never hated anybody but he tempts me he has no ethics no scruples and no conscience hes a thief and a liar i know him bo and lucky for you i do let me ask you something besand monitor besand how come you dont aggravate him the way you do me what do you mean lucky he accused you of resurrectionist tendencies i dont shadow him because his many virtues include cowardice he doesnt have the hair to recover proscribed artifacts and i do that little wart libeled me with capital crimes if i werent an old man hell get his bo and you do have the guts ive just never caught you with the inclination bomanz rolled his eyes here we go the veiled accusations not so veiled my friend theres a moral laxness in you an unwillingness to accept the existence of evil that stinks like an old corpse give it its head and ill catch you bo the wicked are cunning but they always betray themselves for an instant bomanz thought his world was falling apart then he realized besand was fishing a dedicated fisherman the monitor shaken he countered im sick of your sadism if you really suspected anything youd be on me like a snake on shit legalities never meant anything to you guards youre probably lying about men fu youd haul your own mother in on the word of a sorrier villain than him youre sick besand you know that diseased right here he tapped his temple you cant relate without cruelty youre pushing your luck again bo bomanz backed down fright and temper had been talking in his own odd way besand had shown him special tolerance it was as though he were necessary to the monitors emotional health besand needed one person outside the guard whom he did not victimize someone whose immunity repaid him in a sort of validation im symbolic of the people he defends bomanz snorted that was rich that business about being retired did he say more than i heard is he calling off all bets because hes leaving maybe he does have a sense for scofflaws maybe he wants to go out with a flash what about the new man another monster unblinkered by the gossamer ive spun across besands eyes maybe someone who will come in like the bull into the corrida and tokar the possible resurrectionist how does he fit whats the matter besand asked concern colored his words ulcers bothering me bomanz massaged his temples hoping the headache would not come too plant your markers men fu might jump you right here yeah bomanz took a half dozen stakes from his pack each trailed a strip of yellow cloth he planted them custom dictated that the ground so circumscribed was his to exploit men fu could make night raids or whatever and bomanz would have no legal recourse claims had no standing in law only in private treaty the antique miners exercised their own sanctions men fu was under every sanction but violence nothing altered his thieving ways wish stancil was here bomanz said he could watch at night ill growl at him thats always good for a few days i heard stance was coming home yeah for the summer were excited we havent seen him in four years friend of tokar isnt he bomanz whirled damn you you never let up do you he spoke softly in genuine rage without the shouts and curses and dramatic gestures of his habitual semirage all right bo ill drop it youd better youd damned well better i wont have you crawling all over him all summer wont have it you hear i said id drop it chapter eight the barrowland corbie came and went at will around the guard compound the walls inside the headquarters building boasted several dozen old paintings of the barrowland he studied those often while he cleaned shivering his reaction was not unique the dominators attempt to escape through juniper had rocked the ladys empire stories of his cruelties had fed upon themselves and grown fat in the centuries since the white rose laid him down the barrowland remained quiet those who watched saw nothing untoward morale rose the old evil had shot its bolt but it waited it would wait throughout eternity if need be it could not die its apparent last hope was no hope the lady was immortal too she would allow nothing to open her husbands grave the paintings recorded progressive decay the latest dated from shortly after the ladys resurrection even then the barrowland had been much more whole sometimes corbie went to the edge of town stared at the great barrow shook his head once there had been amulets which permitted guards safely within the spells making the barrowland lethal to allow for upkeep but those had disappeared the guard could but watch and wait now time ambled slow and grey and limping corbie became a town fixture he spoke seldom but occasionally enlivened the lie sessions at blue willy with a wooly anecdote from the forsberg campaigns the fire blazed in his eyes then no one doubted he had been there even if he saw those days a little walleyed he made no true friends rumor said he did share the occasional private chess game with the monitor colonel sweet for whom he had done some special small services and of course there was the recruit case who devoured his tales and accompanied him on his hobbling walks rumor said corbie could read case hoped to learn no one ever visited the second floor of corbies home there in the heart of the night he slowly unravelled the treacherous mares nest of a tale that time and dishonesty had distorted out of any parallel with truth only parts were encrypted most was hastily scribbled in tellekurre the principal language of the domination era but scattered passages were in uchitelle a tellekurre regional vulgate times were when battling those passages corbie smiled grimly he might be the only man alive able to puzzle through those sometimes fragmentary sentences benefit of a classical education he would murmur with a certain sarcasm i then he would become reflective introspective he would take one of his late night walks to shake revenant memory ones own yesterday is a ghost that will not be laid death is the only exorcism he saw himself as a craftsman did corbie a smith an armorer cautiously forging a lethal sword like his predecessor in that house he had dedicated his life to the search for a fragment of knowledge the winter was astonishing the first snows came early after an early and unusually damp autumn it snowed often and heavily spring came late in the forests north of the barrowland where only scattered clans dwelt life was harsh tribesmen appeared bearing furs to trade for food factors for the furriers of oar were ecstatic old folks called the winter a harbinger of worse to come but old folks always see todays weather as more harsh than that of yore or milder never never the same spring sprung a swift thaw set the creeks and rivers raging the great tragic which looped within three miles of the barrowland spread miles beyond its banks it abducted tens and hundreds of thousands of trees the flood was so spectacular that scores from town wandered out to watch it from a hilltop for most the novelty faded but corbie limped out any day case could accompany him case was yet possessed of dreams corbie indulged him why so interested in the river corbie i dont know maybe because of its grand statement what corbie swung an encompassing hand the vastness the ongoing rage see how significant we are brown water gnawed at the hill furious fumbling forests of driftwood less turbulent arms hugged the hill probed the woods behind case nodded like the feeling i get when i look at the stars yes yes but this is more personal closer to home not so i guess case sounded baffled corbie smiled legacy of a farm youth lets go back its peaked but i dont trust it with those clouds rolling in rain did threaten were the river to rise much more the hill would become an island case helped corbie cross the boggy parts and up to the crest of the low rise which kept the flood from reaching cleared land much of that was a lake now shallow enough to be waded if some fool dared under grey skies the great barrow stood out poorly reflecting off the water as a dark lump corbie shuddered case hes still there the youth leaned on his spear interested only because corbie was interested he wanted to get out of the drizzle the dominator lad whatever else did not escape waiting filling with ever more hatred for the living case looked at corbie the older man was taut with tension he seemed frightened if he gets loose pity the world but didnt the lady finish him in juniper she stopped him she didnt destroy him that may not be possible well it must be he has to be vulnerable somehow but if the white rose couldnt harm him the rose wasnt so strong corbie she couldnt even hurt the taken or even their minions all she could do was bind and bury them it took the lady and the rebel the rebel i doubt that she did it corbie lunged forward forcing his leg he marched along the edge of the lake his gaze remained fixed on the great barrow case feared corbie was obsessed with the barrowland as a guard he had to be concerned though the lady had exterminated the resurrectionists in his grandfathers time still that mound exerted its dark attraction monitor sweet remained frightened someone would revive that idiocy he wanted to caution corbie could think of no polite way to phrase himself wind stirred the lake ripples ran from the barrow toward them both shivered wish this weather would break corbie muttered time for tea yes the weather continued chill and wet summer came late autumn arrived early when the great tragic did at last recede it left a mud plain strewn with the wrecks of grand trees its channel had shifted a half mile westward the woodland tribes continued selling furs serendipity corbie was near done renovating he was restoring a closet in removing a wooden clothes rod he fumbled the rod separated into parts when it hit the floor he knelt he stared his heart hammered a slim spindle of white silk lay exposed gently gently he put the rod back together carried it upstairs carefully carefully he removed the silk unrolled it his stomach knotted it was bomanzs chart of the barrowland complete with notes about which taken lay where where fetishes were located and why the puissance of protective spells and a scatter of known resting places of minions of the taken who had gone into the ground with their captains a cluttered chart indeed mostly annotated in tellekurre also noted were burial sites outside the barrowland proper most of the ordinary fallen had gone into mass graves the battle fired corbies imagination for a moment he saw the dominators forces standing firm dying to the last man he saw wave after wave of the white rose horde give themselves up to contain the shadow within the trap overhead the great comet seared the sky a vast flaming scimitar he could only imagine though there were no reliable histories he commiserated with bomanz poor foolish little man dreaming seeking the truth he had not earned his dark legend corbie remained fixed over the chart all night letting it seep into bone and soul it did little to help him translate but it did illuminate the barrowland some and even more it illuminated a wizard so dedicated he had spent his entire adult life studying the barrowland dawns light stirred corbie for a moment he doubted himself could he become prey to the same fatal passion chapter nine the plain of fear the lieutenant himself stirred me out elmos back croaker eat some breakfast then report to the conference room he was a sour man getting sourer every day sometimes i regret having voted for him after the captain died in juniper but the captain wished it it was his dying request be there soonest i said piling out without my customary growl i grabbed clothing stirred papers silently mocked myself how often did i doubt voting for the captain himself yet when he wanted to resign we did not let him my quarters look nothing like a physicians den the walls are floor to ceiling with old books i have read most after having studied the languages in which they are written some are as old as the company itself recounting ancient histories some are noble genealogies stolen from widely dispersed old temples and civil offices the rarest and most interesting chronicle the rise and growth of the domination the rarest of all are those in tellekurre the followers of the white rose were not gentle victors they burned books and cities transported women and children profaned ancient works of art and famous shrines the customary afterglow of a great conflagration so there is little left to key one into the languages and thinking and history of the losers some of the most plainly written documents i possess remain totally inaccessible how i wish raven were with us still instead of dwelling among the dead men he had a passing familiarity with written tellekurre few outside the ladys intimate circle do goblin stuck his head in you coming or not i cried on his shoulder it was the old lament no progress he laughed go blow in your girlfriends ear she might help when will you guys let up it had been fifteen years since i wrote my last simpleminded romance about the lady that was before the long retreat which led the rebel to his doom before the tower at charm they do not let you forget never croaker never who else has spent the night with her who else goes carpetflying with her i would rather forget those were times of terror not romance she became aware of my annalistic endeavors and asked me to show her side more or less she did not censor or dictate but did insist i remain factual and impartial i recall thinking she expected defeat wanted an unbiased history set down somewhere goblin glanced at the mound of documents you cant get any handle on it i dont think there is a handle everything i do translate turns out a big nothing somebodys expense record an appointment calendar a promotions list a letter from some officer to a friend at court everything way older than what im looking for goblin raised an eyebrow ill keep on trying there was something there we took them from whisper when she was a rebel they meant a lot to her and our mentor then soulcatcher thought them of empiretoppling significance thoughtfully goblin remarked sometimes the whole is greater than the sum of its parts maybe you should look for what ties it all together the thought had occurred to me a name here there elsewhere revealing the wake of someone through his or her earlier days maybe i would find it the comet would not return for a long time but i had my doubts darling is a young thing yet just into her middle twenties but the bloom of youth has abandoned her hard years have piled on hard years there is little feminine about her she had no chance to develop in that direction even after two years on the plain none of us think of her as woman she is tall maybe two inches under six feet her eyes are a washedout blue that often seems vacant but they become swords of ice when she is thwarted her hair is blonde as from much exposure to the sun without continuous attention it hangs in straggles and strings not vain she keeps it shorter than is stylish in dress too she leans toward the utilitarian some firsttime visitors are offended because she dresses so masculine but she leaves them with no doubts that she can handle business her role came to her unwanted but she has made peace with it has assumed it with stubborn determination she shows a wisdom remarkable for her age and for one handicapped as she is raven taught her well during those few years he was her guardian she was pacing when i arrived the conference room is earthsided smokey crowded even when empty it smells of long occupation by too many unclean men the old messenger from oar was there so were tracker and corder and several other outsiders most of the company were present i fingersigned a greeting darling gave me a sisterly hug asked if i had any progress to report i spoke for the group and signed for her i am sure we dont have all the documents we found in the forest of cloud not just because i cant identify what im looking for either everything i do have is too old darlings features are regular nothing stands out yet you sense character will that this woman cannot be broken she has been to hell already it did not touch her as a child she will not be touched now she was not pleased she signed we will not have the time we thought my attention was half elsewhere i had hoped for sparks between tracker and the other westerner on a gut level i had responded negatively to tracker i found myself with an irrational hope for evidence to sustain that reaction nothing not surprising the cell structure of the movement keeps our sympathizers insulated from one another darling wanted to hear from goblin and oneeye next goblin used his squeakiest voice everything we heard is true they are reinforcing their garrisons but corder can tell you better for us the mission was a bust they were ready they chased us all over the plain we were lucky to get away we didnt get no help either the menhirs and their weird pals are on our side supposedly sometimes i wonder they are unpredictable they help or dont according to a formula only they understand darling was little interested in details of the failed raid she moved on to corder he said armies are gathering on both sides of the plain under command of the taken taken i asked i knew of only the two he sounded like he meant many a chill then there is a longtime rumor that the lady has been quiet so long because she is raising a new crop of taken i had not believed it the age is sorrowfully short of characters of the magnificently villainous vitality of those the dominator took in olden times soulcatcher the hanged man nightcrawler shapeshifter the limper and such those were nastymen of the grand scope nearly as wild and hairy in their wickedness as the lady and dominator themselves this is the era of the weak sister excepting only darling and whisper corder responded shyly the rumors are true lord lord me because i stand near the heart of the dream i hate it yet eat it up yes they may not be stormbringers or howlers these new taken he smiled feebly sir tucker observed that the old taken were wild devils as unpredictable as the lightning and the new ones are the predictable tame thunder of bureaucracy if you follow my meaning i do go on it is believed that there are six new ones lord sir tucker believes they are about to be unleashed thus the great buildup around the plain sir tucker believes the lady has made a competition of our destruction tucker our most dedicated agent one of the few survivors of the long siege of rust his hatred knows no bounds corder had a strange look a greenaroundtheedges look a look that said there was more and all bad well i said spit it out the names of the taken have been enscribed on stellae raised in their respective demenses at rust the army commander is named benefice his stella appeared after a carpet arrived by night he has not actually been seen that bore investigation only the taken can manage a carpet but no carpet can reach rust without crossing the plain of fear the menhirs have reported no such passage benefice interesting name the others in thud the stella bears the name blister chuckles i said i liked it better when the names were descriptive like the limper moonbiter the faceless man at frost we have one called the creeper thats better darling gave me a cautionary look at rue there is one called learned and at hull one called scorn scorn i like that too the western bounds of the plain are held by whisper and journey both operating from a village called spit being a natural mathematical phenom i summed and said thats five new ones and two old where is the other new one i dont know the only other is the commander over all his stella stands in the military compound outside rust the way he said that abraded my nerves he was pale he started shaking a premonition gripped me i knew i would not like what he said next but well that stella bears the sigil of the limper right so right i did not like it at all the feeling was universal oh goblin shrieked oneeye said holy shit in a soft awed tone that was all the more meaningful for its reserve i sat down right there right in the middle of the floor i folded my head in my hands i wanted to cry impossible i said i killed him with my own hands and saying it i did not believe it anymore though i had had faith in that fact for years but how cant keep a good man down elmo chided that he was shaken was evidenced by the smart remark elmo says nothing gratuitously the feud between the limper and the company dates to our arrival north of the sea of torments for it was then that we enlisted raven a mysterious native of opal a man of former high estate who had been done out of his titles and livings by minions of the limper raven was as tough as they come and utterly fearless the robbery sanctioned by taken or not he struck back he slew the villains among them the limpers most competent people then our path kept crossing the limpers each time something worsened the weather between us in the confusion after juniper limper thought to settle with us i engineered an ambush he charged in i would have bet anything i killed him i tell you at that moment i was as rattled as ever i have been i was on the precipice of panic oneeye noticed dont get hysterical croaker we survived him before hes one of the old ones idiot one of the real taken from times when they had real wizards and hes never really been allowed to go full speed at us before and with all that help eight taken and five armies to assault the plain of fear seldom were there more than seventy of us here in the hole my head filled with terrible visions those taken might be secondrate but they were so many their fury would fire the plain whisper and the limper have campaigned here before they are not ignorant of the plains perils in fact whisper battled here both as a rebel and as taken she won most of the most famous battles of the eastern war reason reasserted itself but did little to brighten tomorrow once i thought i reached the inescapeable conclusion that whisper knows the plain too well might even have allies out here darling touched my shoulder that was more calming than any words from friends her confidence is contagious she signed now we know and smiled still time has become a hanging hammer about to fall the long wait for the comet has been rendered irrelevant we have to survive right now trying for a bright side i said the limpers true name is somewhere in my document collection but that recalled my problem darling the specific document i want is not there she raised an eyebrow unable to speak she has developed one of the most expressive faces ive ever seen we have to have a sitdown when you have time to go over exactly what happened to those papers while raven had them some are missing they were there when i turned them over to soulcatcher they were there when i got them back from her i am sure they were there when raven took them what happened to them later tonight she signed i will make time she seemed distracted suddenly because i mentioned raven he meant a lot to her but youd think the edge would be off by now unless there was more to the story than i knew and that was plenty possible i really have no idea what their relationship became in the years after raven left the company his death certainly bothers her still because it was so pointless i mean after surviving everything the shadow threw his way he drowned in a public bath the lieutenant says there are nights she cries herself to sleep he does not know why but he suspects raven is at the root i have asked her about those years when they were on their own but she will not tell the tale the emotional impression i get is one of sorrow and grave disappointment she pushed her troubles away now turned to tracker and his mutt behind them the men elmo caught on the bluff squirmed their turn was coming they knew the reputation of the black company but we did not get to them nor even to tracker and toadkiller dog for the watch above shrieked another alert this was getting tiresome the rider crossed the stream as i entered the coral water splashed his mount staggered it was covered with foam never again would it run well it hurt me to see an animal so broken but its rider had cause two taken darted about just beyond the bound of the null one flung a violet bolt it perished long before it reached us oneeye cackled and raised a middle finger always wanted to do that oh wonder of wonders goblin squeaked looking the other way a number of mantas big blueblacks soared off the rosy bluffs caught updrafts must have been a dozen though they were hard to count maneuvering as they did to avoid stealing one anothers wind these were giants of their kind their wings spanned almost a hundred feet when they were high enough they dove at the taken in pairs the rider halted fell he had an arrow in his back he remained conscious just long enough to gasp tokens the first manta pair seeming to move with slow stately grace though actually they streaked ten times faster than a man can run ripped past the nearer taken just inside darlings null each loosed a brilliant lightning bolt lightning could speed where taken witchery would not survive one bolt hit taken and carpet reeled glowed briefly smoke appeared the carpet twisted and spun earthward we sent up a ragged cheer the taken regained control rose clumsily drifted away i knelt by the messenger he was little more than a boy he was alive he had a chance if i got to work a little help here oneeye manta pairs ripped along the boundary of the null blasting away at the second taken this one evaded effortlessly did nothing to fight back thats whisper elmo said yeah i said she knows her way around oneeye grumbled you going to help this kid or not croaker all right all right i hated to miss the show it was the first i had seen so many mantas the first i had seen them support us i wanted to see more well said elmo while calming the boys horse and going through his saddlebags another missive for our esteemed annalist he proffered another oilskin packet baffled i tucked it under my arm then helped oneeye carry the messenger down into the hole chapter ten bomanzs story croaker jasmines squeal rattled the windows and doors bomanz you come down here come down right now you hear me bomanz sighed a man couldnt get five minutes alone what the hell did he get married for why did any man you spent the rest of your life doing hard time doing what other people wanted not what you wanted bomanz im coming dammit damned woman cant blow her nose without me there to hold her hand he added sotto voce he did a lot of talking under his breath he had feelings to vent and peace to maintain he compromised always he compromised he stamped downstairs each footfall a declaration of irritation he mocked himself as he went you know youre getting old when everything aggravates you what do you want where are you in the shop there was an odd note in her voice suppressed excitement he decided he entered the shop warily surprise his world came alive grouchiness deserted him stance he flung himself at his son powerful arms crushed him here already we didnt expect you till next week i got away early youre getting pudgy pop stancil opened his arms to include jasmine in a threeway hug thats your mothers cooking times are good were eating regular tokars been he glimpsed a faded ugly shadow so how are you back up let me look at you you were still a boy when you left and jasmine doesnt he look great so tall and healthy and such nice clothes mock concern you havent been up to any funny business have you mother what could a junior instructor get up to he met his fathers eye smiled a smile that said same old mom stancil was four inches taller than his father in his middle twenties and looked athletic despite his profession more like an adventurer than a wouldbe don bomanz thought of course times changed it had been eons since his own university days maybe standards had changed he recalled the laughter and pranks and allnight dreadfully serious debates on the meaning of it all and was bitten by an imp of nostalgia what had become of that mentally quick foxy young bomanz some silent unseen guardsman of the mind had interred him in a barrow in the back of his brain and there he lay dreaming while a bald jowly potbellied gnome gradually usurped him they steal our yesterdays and leave us no youth but that of our children well come on tell us about your studies get out of that selfpitying mindset bomanz you old fool four years and nothing but letters about doing laundry and debates at the stranded dolphin stranded he would be in oar before i die i want to see the sea i never have old fool dream out loud and thats the best you can do would they really laugh if you told them the youth is still alive in there somewhere his mind wanders jasmine explained who are you calling senile bomanz snapped pop mom give me a break i just got here bpmanz gobbled air hes right peace truce armistice you referee stance two old warhorses like us are set in their ways jasmine said stance promised me a surprise before you came down well bomanz asked im engaged to be married how can this be this is my son my baby i was changing his diapers last week time thou unspeakable assassin i feel thy cold breath i hear thine ironshod hooves hmph young fool sorry tell us about her since you wont tell us about anything else i would if i could get a word in bomanz be quiet tell us about her stance you probably know something already shes tokars sister glory bomanzs stomach plunged to the level of his heels tokars sister tokar who might be a resurrectionist whats the matter now pop tokars sister eh what do you know about that family whats wrong with them i didnt say anything was i asked you what you know about them enough to know i want to marry glory enough to know tokar is my best friend enough to know if theyre resurrectionists silence slammed into the shop bomanz stared at his son stancil stared back twice he started to respond changed his mind tension rasped the air pop thats what besand thinks the guard is watching tokar and me now its the time of the comet stance the tenth passage besand smells some big resurrectionist plot hes making life hard this thing about tokar will make it worse stancil sucked spittle between his teeth he sighed maybe it was a mistake coming home i wont get anything done wasting time ducking besand and fighting with you no stance jasmine said your father wont start anything bo you werent starting a fight youre not going to start one uhm my son engaged to a resurrectionist he turned away took a deep breath quietly berated himself jumping to conclusions on word no better than besands son im sorry hes been riding me he glanced at jasmine besand wasnt his only persecutor thanks pop hows the research coming jasmine grumbled and muttered bomanz said this conversation is crazy were all asking questions and nobody is answering give me some money bo jasmine said what for you two wont say hello before you start your plotting i might as well go marketing bomanz waited she eschewed her arsenal of pointed remarks about womans lot he shrugged dribbled coins into her palm lets go upstairs stance shes mellowed stancil said as they entered the attic room i hadnt noticed so have you but the house hasnt changed bomanz lighted the lamp cluttered as ever he admitted he grabbed his hiding spear got to make a new one of these its getting worn he spread his chart on the little table not much improvement pop get rid of besand he tapped the sixth barrow right there the only thing standing in my way that route the only option pop could you get the top two or even one that would leave you a fiftyfifty chance of guessing the other two i dont guess this isnt a card game you cant deal a new hand if you play your first one wrong stancil took the one chair stared at the chart he drummed the tabletop with his fingers bomanz fidgeted a week passed the family settled into new rhythms including living with the monitors intensified surveillance bomanz was cleaning a weapon from the tellekurre site a trove that was a veritable trove a mass burial with weapons and armor almost perfectly preserved stancil entered the shop bomanz looked up rough night not bad hes ready to give up only came round once men fu or besand men fu besand was there a half dozen times they were working shifts men fu was the public excuse in reality bomanz hoped to wear besand down before the comets return it was not working your mother has breakfast ready bomanz began assembling his pack wait up pop ill go too you need to rest thats all right i feel like digging okay something was bothering the boy maybe he was ready to talk theyd never done much of that their preuniversity relationship had been one of confrontation with stance always on the defensive he had grown these four years but the boy was still there inside he was not yet ready to face his father mantoman and bomanz had not grown enough to forget that stancil was his little boy those growths sometimes never come one day the son is looking back at his own son wondering what happened bomanz resumed rubbing flakes off a mace he sneered at himself thinking about relationships this isnt like you you old coot hey pop stance called from the kitchen almost forgot i spotted the comet last night a claw reached in and grabbed a handful of bomanzs guts the comet couldnt be not already he was not ready for it nervy little bastard bomanz spat he and stancil knelt in the brush watching men fu toss artifacts from their diggings i ought to break his leg wait here a minute ill circle around and cut him off when he runs bomanz snorted not worth the trouble its worth it to me pop just to keep the balance all right bomanz watched men fu pop up to look around ugly little head jerking like that of a nervous pigeon he dropped back into the excavation bomanz stalked forward he drew close enough to hear the thief talking to himself oh lovely lovely a stone fortune stone fortune that fat little ape dont deserve it all the time sucking up to besand that creep fat little ape you asked for it bomanz shed his pack and tools got a firm grip on his spade men fu came up out of the pit his arms filled his eyes grew huge his mouth worked soundlessly bomanz wound up now bo dont be bomanz swung men fu danced took the blow on his hip squawked dropped his burden flailed the air and toppled into the pit he scrambled out the far side squealing like a wounded hog bomanz wobbled after him landed a mighty stroke across his behind men fu ran bomanz charged after him spade high yelling stand still you thieving sonofabitch take it like a man he took a last mighty swing it missed it flung him around he fell bounced back up continued the chase sans avenging spade stancil threw himself into men fus way the thief put his head down and bulled through bomanz ploughed into stancil father and son rolled in a tangle of limbs bomanz gasped what the hell hes gone now he sprawled on his back panted stancil started laughing whats so damned funny the look on his face bomanz sniggered you werent much help they guffawed finally bomanz gasped id better find my spade stancil helped his father stand pop i wish you could have seen yourself glad i didnt lucky i didnt have a stroke he lapsed into a fit of giggles you all right pop sure just cant laugh and catch my breath at the same time oh oh my i wont be able to move again if i sit down lets go dig thatll keep you loose you dropped the spade around here didnt you there it is the giggles haunted bomanz all morning he would recall men fus flailing retreat and his selfcontrol would go pop stancil was working the far side of the pit look here this may be why he didnt notice you coming bomanz limped over watched stancil brush loose soil off a perfectly preserved breastplate it was as black and shiny as rubbed ebony an ornate ornament in silver bossed its center uhm bomanz popped out of the pit nobody around that halfman halfbeast design thats shapeshifter he led the tellekurre he wouldnt be buried here though its his armor pop i can see that dammit he popped up like a curious groundhog no one in sight sit up here and keep watch ill dig it out you sit pop you were up all night im a lot younger than you are im feeling just fine thank you what color is the sky pop blue what kind of question hallelujah we agree on something youre the most contrary old goat stancil sorry pop well take turns flip a coin to see who goes first bomanz lost he settled down with his pack as a backrest going to have to spread the dig out going straight down like this itll cave in first heavy rain yeah be a lot of mud ought to think about a drainage trench hey pop theres nobody in this thing looks like the rest of his armor too stancil had recovered a gauntlet and uncovered part of a greave yeah i hate to turn it in turn it in why tokar could get a fortune for it maybe so but what if friend men fu did spot it hell tell besand out of spite weve got to stay on his good side we dont need this stuff not to mention he might have planted it what it shouldnt be here right and no body inside the armor and the soil is loose bomanz grunted besand was capable of a frame leave everything the way it is ill go get him sourfaced old fart stancil muttered as the monitor departed i bet he did plant it no sense cussing we cant do anything bomanz settled against his pack whatre you doing loafing i dont feel like digging anymore he ached all over it had been a busy morning we should get what we can while the weather is good go ahead pop stancil thought better of it how come you and mom fight all the time bomanz let his thoughts drift the truth was elusive stance would not remember the good years i guess because people change and we dont want them to he could find no better words you start out with a woman shes magical and mysterious and marvelous the way they sing it then you get to know each other the excitement goes away it gets comfortable then even that fades she starts to sag and turn grey and get lined and you feel cheated you remember the fey shy one you met and talked with till her father threatened to plant a boot in your ass you resent this stranger so you take a poke i guess its the same for your mother inside im still twenty stance only if i pass a mirror or if my body wont do what i want do i realize that im an old man i dont see the potbelly and the varicose veins and the grey hair where ive got any left she has to live with it every time i see a mirror im amazed i end up wondering whos taken over the outside of me a disgusting old goat from the look of him the kind i used to snicker at when i was twenty he scares me stance he looks like a dying man im trapped inside him and im not ready to go stancil sat down his father never talked about his feelings does it have to be that way maybe not but it always is thinking about glory stance i dont know you cant get out of getting old you cant get out of having a relationship change maybe none of it has to be if we manage this dont tell me about maybes stance ive been living on maybes for thirty years his ulcer took a sample nibble from his gut maybe besand is right for the wrong reasons pop what are you talking about youve given your whole life to this what im saying stance is that im scared its one thing to chase a dream its another to catch it you never get what you expect i have a premonition of disaster the dream might be stillborn stancils expression ran through a series of changes but youve got to i dont have to do anything but be bomanz the antiquary your mother and i dont have much longer this dig should yield enough to keep us if you went ahead youd have a lot more years and a lot more im scared stance of going either way that happens when you get older change is threatening pop im talking about the death of dreams son about losing the big wild makebelieves that keep you going the impossible dreams that kind of jolly pretend is dead for me all i can see is rotten teeth in a killers smile stancil hoisted himself out of the pit he plucked a strand of sweetgrass sucked it while gazing into the sky pop how did you feel right before you married mom numb stancil laughed okay how about when you went to ask her father on the way there i thought i was going to dribble down my leg you never met your grandfather hes the one who got them started telling troll stories something like you feel now something yes but its not the same i was younger and i had a reward to look forward to and you dont now arent the stakes bigger both ways win or lose know what youre having what they call a crisis of selfconfidence thats all couple of days and youll be raring to go again that evening after stancil had gone out bomanz told jasmine thats a wise boy weve got we talked today really talked for the first time he surprised me why hes your son isnt he the dream came stronger than ever before more quickly than ever it wakened bomanz twice in one night he gave up trying to sleep he went and sat on the front stoop taking in the moonlight the night was bright he could make out rude buildings along the dirty street some town he thought remembering the glories of oar the guard us antiquaries and a few people who scratch a living serving us and the pilgrims hardly any of those anymore even with the domination fashionable the barrowland is so disreputable nobody wants to look at it he heard footsteps a shadow approached bo besand uhm the monitor settled on the next step down whatre you doing couldnt sleep been thinking about how the barrowland has gotten so blighted even selfrespecting resurrectionists dont come here anymore you youre not taking the night patrol yourself are you couldnt sleep either that damned comet bomanz searched the sky cant see it from here have to go around back youre right nobody knows were here anymore us or those things in the ground over there i dont know whats worse neglect or plain stupidity uhm something was gnawing at the monitor bo theyre not replacing me because im old or incompetent though i guess im enough of both theyre moving me out so somebodys nephew can have a post an exile for a black sheep that hurts bo that really hurts theyve forgotten what this place is theyre telling me i wasted my whole life doing a job any idiot can sleep his way through the world is full of fools fools die eh they laugh when i talk about the comet or about resurrectionists striking this summer they cant believe that i believe they dont believe theres anything under those mounds not anything still alive bring them out here walk them through the barrowland after dark i tried they told me to quit whining if i wanted a pension youve done all you can then its on their heads i took an oath bo i was serious about it then and im serious now this job is all i have youve got jasmine and stance i might as well have been a monk now theyre discarding me for some young he began making strange noises sobs bomanz thought from the monitor from this man with a heart of flint and all the mercy of a shark he took besands elbow lets go look at the comet i havent seen it yet besand got hold of himself you havent thats hard to believe why i havent been up late stancil has done the night work never mind slipping into my antagonistic character again we shouldve been lawyers you and i weve got the argumentative turn of mind you could be right spent a lot of time lately wondering what im doing out here what are you doing here bo i was going to get rich i was going to study the old books open a few rich graves go back to oar and buy into my uncles drayage business idly bomanz wondered how much of his faked past besand accepted he had lived it so long that he now remembered some fraudulent anecdotes as factual unless he thought hard what happened laziness plain oldfashioned laziness i found out theres a big difference between dreaming and getting in there and doing it was easier to dig just enough to get by and spend the rest of the time loafing bomanz made a sour face he was striking near the truth his researches were in fact partly an excuse for not competing he simply did not have the drive of a tokar you havent had too bad a life one or two hard winters when stancil was a pup but we all went through those a helping hand here or there and we all survived there she is besand indicated the sky over the barrowland bomanz gasped it was exactly what he had seen in his dreams showy isnt it wait till it gets close itll fill half the sky pretty too stunning id say but also a harbinger an ill omen the old writers say itll keep returning till the dominator is freed ive lived with that stuff most of my life besand and even i find it hard to believe theres anything to it wait i get that spooky feeling around the barrowland too but i just cant believe those creatures could rise again after four hundred years in the ground bo maybe you are honest if you are take a hint when i leave you leave take the tellekurre stuff and head for oar youre starting to sound like stance i mean it some idiot unbeliever kid takes over here all hell is going to break loose literally get out while you can you could be right im thinking about going back but what would i do i dont know oar anymore the way stance tells it id get losthell this is home now i never really realized that this dump is home i know what you mean bomanz looked at that great silver blade in the sky soon now whats going on out there who is that came from bomanzs back door you clear off hear ill have the guard after you its me jasmine besand laughed and the monitor mistress the guard is here already bo whatre you doing talking looking at the stars ill be getting along besand said see you tomorrow from his tone bomanz knew tomorrow would be a day of normal harassments take care he settled on the dewy back step let the cool night wash over him birds called in the old forest their voices lonely a cricket chirruped optimistically humid air barely stirred the remnants of his hair jasmine came out and sat beside him couldnt sleep he told her me either must be going around he glanced at the comet was startled by an instant of deja vu remember the summer we came here when we stayed up to see the comet it was a night like this she took his hand entwined her fingers with his youre reading my mind our first month anniversary those were fool kids those two they still are inside chapter eleven the barrowland for corbie the unravelling came quickly now when he kept his mind on business but more and more he became distracted by that old silk map those strange old names in tellekurre they had a ring absent in modern tongues soulcatcher stormbringer moonbiter the hanged man they seemed so much more potent in the old tongue but they were dead the only great ones left were the lady and the monster who started it all out there under the earth often he went to a small window and stared toward the barrowland the devil in the earth calling perhaps surrounded by lesser champions few of them recalled in the legends and few the old wizard identified bomanz had been interested only in the lady so many fetishes and a dragon and fallen champions of the white rose their shades set to eternal guard duty it seemed so much more dramatic than the struggle today corbie laughed the past was always more interesting than the present for those who lived through the first great struggle it must have seemed deadly slow too only in the final battle were the legends and legacies created a few days out of decades he worked less now now that he had a sound place to live and a little saved he spent more time wandering especially by night case came calling one morning before corbie was fully wakened he allowed the youth inside tea all right youre nervous what is it colonel sweet wants you chess again or work neither hes worried about your wandering around at night i told him i go with you and all you do is look at the stars and stuff guess hes getting paranoid corbie smiled a smile he did not feel just doing his job guess my life looks odd getting past it lost in my own mind do i act senile sometimes here sugar please sugar was a treat the guard could not provide it any rush i havent eaten he didnt put it that way good more time to prepare fool he should have guessed his walks would attract attention the guard was paranoid by design corbie prepared oats and bacon which he shared with case for all they were well paid the guard ate poorly because of ongoing foul weather the oar road was all but impassable the army quartermasters strove valiantly but often could not get through well lets see the man corbie said and thats the last bacon the colonel better think about farming here just in case they talked about it corbie had befriended case partly because he served at headquarters colonel sweet would play chess and talk old times but he never revealed any plans and not enough land not enough fodder pigs they get fat on acorns need herdsmen else the tribemen would get them i guess so the colonel ushered corbie into his private quarters corbie joked dont you ever work sir the operation runs itself been rolling four centuries thats the way it goes i have a problem corbie corbie grimaced sir appearances corbie this is a world that lives by perceptions you arent presenting a proper appearance sir we had a visitor last month from charm i didnt know that neither did anyone else except me what you might call a prolonged surprise inspection they happen occasionally sweet settled behind his worktable pushed aside the chess set over which they had contested so often he drew a long sheet of southern paper from a cubby at his right knee corbie glimpsed printing in a crabbed hand taken sir corbie never sirred anyone except as an afterthought the habit disturbed sweet yes with the ladys carte blanche he did not abuse it but he did make recommendations and he did mention people whose behavior he found unacceptable your name was first on the list what the hell are you doing wandering around all night thinking i cant sleep the war did something the things i saw the guerrillas you dont want to go to sleep because they might attack if you do sleep you dream about the blood homes and fields burning animals and children screaming that was the worst the babies crying i still hear the babies crying he exaggerated very little each time he went to bed he had to get past the crying of babes he told most of the truth and wound it into an imaginative lie babies crying the babies who haunted him were his own innocents abandoned in a moment of fear of commitment i know sweet replied i know at rust they killed their children rather than let us capture them the hardest men in the regiment wept when they saw the mothers hurling their infants down from the walls then jumping after them i never married i have no children but i know what you mean did you have any a son corbie said in a voice both soft and strained from a body almost shaking with pain and a daughter twins they were long ago and far away and what became of them i dont know i would hope theyre living still they would be about cases age sweet raised an eyebrow but let the remark slide past and their mother corbies eyes became iron hot iron like a brand dead im sorry corbie did not respond his expression suggested he was not sorry himself you understand what im saying corbie sweet asked you were noticed by one of the taken thats never healthy i get the message which was it i cant say which of the taken are where when could be of interest to the rebel corbie snorted what rebel we wiped them out at charm perhaps but there is that white rose i thought they were going to get her yeah the stories you hear going to have her in chains before the month is out been saying that since first we heard of her shes light on her feet maybe light enough sweets smile faded at least i wont be around next time the comet comes brandy yes chess or do you have a job not right away ill go you one game halfway through sweet said remember what i said eh the taken claimed he was leaving but theres no guarantee could be behind a bush someplace watching ill pay more attention to what im doing he would the last thing he wanted was a taken interested in him he had come too far to waste himself now chapter twelve the plain of fear i had the watch my belly gnawed weighted by lead all day dots had traversed the sky high up a pair were there now patroling the continuous presence of taken was not a good omen closer two manta pairs planed the afternoon air they would ride the updrafts up then circle down taunting the taken trying to lure them across the boundary they resented outsiders the more so these because these would crush them but for darlinganother intruder walking trees were on the move beyond the creek the dead menhirs glistened somehow changed from their usual dullness things were happening on the plain no outsider could comprehend their import fully one great shadow clung to the desert way up there daring the taken a lone windwhale hovered an occasional barely perceptible bass roar tumbled down id never heard one talk before they do so only when enraged a breeze muttered and whimpered in the coral old father tree sang counterpoint to the windwhale a menhir spoke behind me your enemies come soon i shivered it recalled the flavor of a nightmare i have been having lately i can recall no specifics afterward only that it is filled with terror i refused to be unsettled by the sneaky stone much what are they where did they come from why are they different from normal stones for that matter why is the plain ridiculously different why so bellicose we are here on sufferance only allied against a greater enemy shatter the lady and see how our friendship prospers how soon when they are ready brilliant old stone positively illuminating my sarcasm did not go unnoticed just unremarked the menhirs have their own flare for sarcasm and the sharpedged tongue five armies said the voice they will not wait long i indicated the sky the taken cruise at will unchallenged they have not challenged true but a weak excuse allies should be allies more windwhales and mantas usually consider appearance on the plain sufficient challenge it occurred to me the taken might have bought them off not so the menhir had moved its shadow now fell across my toes i finally looked this one was just ten feet tall a real runt it had guessed my thought damn it continued telling me what i already knew it is not possible to deal from a position of strength always take care there has been a call to the peoples to reassess your acceptance on the plain so this overtalkative hunk was an emissary the natives were scared some thought they could save themselves trouble by booting us out yes the peoples doesnt properly describe the parliament of species that makes decisions here but i know no better title if the menhirs are to be believedand they lie only by omission or indirectionover forty intelligent species inhabit the plain of fear those i know include menhirs walking trees windwhales and mantas a handful of humans two kinds of lizard a bird like a buzzard a giant white bat and an extremely scarce critter that looks like a camelcentaur put together backward i mean the humanoid half is behind the creature runs toward what most would take as its fanny no doubt i have encountered others without recognizing them goblin says there is a tiny rock monkey that lives in the hearts of the great coral reefs he claims it looks like a miniature oneeye but goblin is not to be trusted where oneeye is concerned i am charged with delivering a warning the menhir said there are strangers on the plain i asked questions when it did not answer i turned irritably it was gone damned stone tracker and his mutt stood in the mouth of the hole watching the taken darling interviewed tracker thoroughly im told i missed that she was satisfied i had an argument with elmo elmo liked tracker reminds me of raven he said we could use a few hundred ravens reminds me of raven too and thats what i dont like but what good arguing we cannot always like everyone darling thinks he is all right elmo thinks so the lieutenant accepts him why should i be different hell if he is from the same mold as raven the lady is in trouble he will be tested soon enough darling has something in mind something preemptive i suspect possibly toward rust rust where the limper had raised his stella the limper back from the dead i did everything but burn the body should have done that i guess bloody hell the scary part is wondering if he is the only one did others survive apparent certain death are they hidden away now waiting to astound the world a shadow fell across my feet i returned to the living tracker stood beside me you look distressed he said he did show one every courtesy i must admit i looked toward those patroling reminders of the struggle i said i am a soldier grown old and tired and confused i have been fighting since before you were born and i have yet to see anything gained he smiled a thin almost secretive smile it made me uncomfortable everything he did made me uncomfortable even his damned dog made me uncomfortable and it did nothing but sleep much as it loafed how had it managed the journey from oar too much like work i swear that dog wont even get in a hurry to eat be of good faith croaker tracker said she will fall he spoke with absolute conviction she hasnt the strength to tame the world there was that scariness again true or not the way he expressed the sentiment was disturbing well bring them all down he indicated the taken they arent real like those of old toadkiller dog sneezed on trackers boot he looked down i thought he would kick the mutt but instead he bent to scratch the dogs ear toadkiller dog what kind of name is that oh its an old joke from when we were both a lot younger he took a shine to it insists on it now tracker seemed only half there his eyes were vacant his gaze far away though he continued to watch the taken weird at least he admitted to having been young there was a hint of human vulnerability in that it is the apparent invulnerability of characters like tracker and raven that rattles me chapter thirteen the plain of fear yo croaker the lieutenant had come outside what let tracker cover you i had only minutes left in my watch darling wants you i glanced at tracker he shrugged go ahead he assumed a stance facing westward i swear it was like he turned the vigilance on as though on the instant he became the ultimate sentinel even toadkiller dog opened an eye and went to watching i brushed the dogs scalp with my fingers as i left what i thought a friendly gesture he growled be like that i said and joined the lieutenant he seemed disturbed generally he is a cold customer what is it shes got one of her wild hairs oh boy what rust oh yeah brilliant get it all over with fast i thought that was just talk i trust you tried to argue her out of it you would think a man would grow accustomed to stench after having lived with it for years but as we descended into the hole my nose wrinkled and tightened you just cant keep a bunch of people stuffed in a pit without ventilation we have precious little i tried she says load the wagon let me worry about the mule being blind shes right most of the time shes a damned military genius but that dont mean she can pull off any cockamamie scheme she dreams up some dreams are nightmares hell croaker the limper is out there which is where we started when we reached the conference room silent and i bore the brunt because we are darlings favorites seldom do i see such unanimity among my brethren even goblin and oneeye spoke with a single voice and those two will fight over whether it is night or day with the sun at high noon darling prowled like a caged beast she had doubts they nagged her two taken in rust i argued thats what corder said one of them our oldest and nastiest enemy break them and we will shatter their entire plan of campaign she countered break them girl youre talking about the limper i proved he is invincible before no you proved that he will survive unless you are thorough you might have burned him yeah or cut him into pieces and fed him to the fish or given him a swim in a vat of acid or a dust bath in quicklime but those things take time we had the lady herself coming down on us we barely got away as it was assuming we can get there undetectedwhich i do not believe for a momentand manage total surprise how long before all the taken get on us i signed vigorously more angry than frightened i never refuse darling ever but this time i was ready her eyes flashed for the first time ever i saw her battle her temper she signed if you will not accept orders you should not be here i am not the lady i do not sacrifice pawns for small gain i agree there is great risk in this operation but far less than you argue with potential impact far greater than you suppose convince me that i cannot do if you are captured you must not know i was primed you just telling me that is enough for the taken to get on a trail maybe i was more scared than i could admit or maybe it was just an alltime case of the contraries no she signed there was something more but she held it back silent dropped a hand on my shoulder he had given up the lieutenant joined him youre overstepping yourself croaker darling repeated if you will not accept orders croaker leave she meant it really i stood with mouth open stunned all right i stamped out i went to my quarters shuffled those obstinate old papers and of course found not a damned thing new they left me alone for a while then elmo came he did not announce himself i just glanced up and found him leaning against the door frame by then i was half ashamed of my performance yeah mail call he said and tossed me another of those oilskin packets i snapped it out of the air he departed without explaining its appearance i placed it on my worktable wondered who i knew no one in oar was it some sort of trick the lady is patient and clever i would not put past her some grand maneuver using me i guess i must have thought about it an hour before reluctantly i opened the packet chapter fourteen the story of bomanz croaker bomanz and tokar stood in one corner of the shop what do you think bomanz asked bring a good price tokar stared at the piece de resistance of bomanzs new tellekurre collection a skeleton in perfectly restored armor its marvelous bo how did you do it wired the joints together see the forehead jewel im not up on domination heraldry but wouldnt a ruby mean somebody important a king that would be the skull of king broke his bones too and armor youre rich bo ill just take a commission on this one a wedding present to the family you took me serious when i said come up with something good the monitor confiscated the best we had shapeshifters armor tokar had brought helpers this trip a pair of hulking gorilla teamsters they were carrying antiques to wagons outside their backandforth made bomanz nervous really damn id give my left arm for that bomanz spread his hands apologetically what could i do besand keeps me on a short leash anyway you know my policy im stretching it to deal with a future daughterinlaws brother hows that stuck my foot in it now bomanz thought he ploughed ahead besand has heard youre a resurrectionist stance and i are getting a hard time now thats sick im sorry bo resurrectionist i shot my mouth off once years ago and said even the dominator would be better for oar than our clown mayor one stupid remark they never let you forget its not enough that they hounded my father into an early grave now they have to torment me and my friends bomanz had no idea what tokar was talking about he would have to ask stance but it reassured him which was all he really wanted tokar keep the profits from this lot for stance and glory as my wedding present have they set a date nothing definite after his sabbatical and thesis come winter i guess thinking about coming down thinking about moving back to oar i dont have enough fight left to break in a new monitor tokar chuckled probably wont be much call for domination artifacts after this summer anyway ill see if i can find you a place you do work like the king here you wont have trouble making a living you really like it i was thinking about doing his horse too bomanz felt a surge of pride in his craftsmanship horse really they buried his horse with him armor and all i dont know who put the tellekurre in the ground but they didnt loot weve got a whole box of coins and jewelry and badges domination coinage thats hotter than hot most of it was melted down a domination coin in good shape can bring fifty times its metal value leave king whosis here ill put his horse together for him pick him up next trip i wont be long either ill unload and zip right back wheres stance anyway i wanted to say hello tokar waved one of those leather wallets glory glory she ought to write romances going to break me buying paper hes out to the dig lets go jasmine im taking tokar out to the dig during the walk bomanz kept glancing over his shoulder the comet was now so bright it could be seen barely by day going to be one hell of a sight when it peaks out he predicted i expect so tokars smile made bomanz nervous im imagining he told himself stancil used his back to open the shop door he dumped a load of weapons were getting mined out pop pretty much all common junk last night bomanz twisted a strand of copper wire wriggled out of the framework supporting the horse skeleton then let men fu take over not much more room here anyway the shop was almost impassable bomanz would not have to dig for years were that his inclination looking good stance said of the horse tarrying before going for another armful from a borrowed cart youll have to show me how to get the king on top so i can put them together when i go back i may do it myself thought youd decided to stay maybe i dont know when are we going to start that thesis im working on it making notes once i get organized i can write it up like that he snapped his fingers dont worry ive got plenty of time he went outside again jasmine brought tea i thought i heard stance bomanz jerked his head outside she looked for a place to set teapot and cups youre going to have to get this mess organized i keep telling myself that stancil returned enough odds and ends here to make a suit of armor long as nobody tries to wear it tea his mother asked sure pop i came past headquarters that new monitor is here already youre going to love him he brought a coach and three wagons filled with clothing for his mistress and a platoon of servants what ha hell die when besand shows him his quarters the monitor lived in a cell more fit for a monk than for the most powerful man in the province he deserves it you know him by reputation polite people call him the jackal if id known it was him what could i have done nothing hes lucky his family got him sent here somebody would have killed him if hed stayed around the city not popular eh youll find out if you stay come back pop ive got a job to do stance how much longer a couple of days or forever you know ive got to get that name pop we could try now while things are confused no experiments stance i want it cold i wont take chances with the ten stancil wanted to argue but sipped tea instead he went out to the cart again when he returned he said tokar should be turned around by now maybe hell bring more than two wagons bomanz chuckled maybe hell bring more than wagons you mean like maybe a sister i was thinking that yes how are you going to get a thesis written theres always a spare moment bomanz ran a dust cloth over the jewel in the brow of his dead kings horse enough for now dobbin going out to the dig swing by and check the excitement stancil suggested i wouldnt miss it besand came to the dig that afternoon he caught bomanz napping what is this he demanded sleeping on the job bomanz sat up you know me just getting out of the house i hear the new man showed up besand spat dont mention him bad worse than i expected mark me bo today writes the end of an era those fools will rue it you decide what youre going to do go fishing bloody go fishing as far from here as i can get take a day to break him in then head south i always wanted to retire to one of the jewel cities ive never seen the sea so youre headed out right away eh you dont have to sound so damned cheerful about it you and your resurrectionist friends have won but ill go knowing you didnt beat me on my own ground we havent fought much lately thats no reason to make up for lost time yeah yeah that was uncalled for sorry its frustration im helpless and everything is going under it cant be that bad it can i have my sources bo im not some lone crazy there are knowledgeable men in oar who fear the same things i do they say the resurrectionists are going to try something youll see too unless you get out i probably will stancil knows this guy but i cant go before we finish the dig besand gave him a narroweyed look bo i ought to make you clean up before i go looks like hell puked here bomanz was not a fastidious worker for a hundred feet around his pit the earth was littered with bones useless scraps of old gear and miscellaneous trash a gruesome sight bomanz did not notice why bother itll be overgrown in a year besides i dont want to make men fu work any harder than he has to youre all heart bo i work at it see you around all right and bomanz tried to puzzle out what he had done wrong what besand had come for and not found he shrugged snuggled into the grass closed his eyes the woman beckoned never had the dream been so clear and never so successful he went to her and took her hand and she led him along a cool green treelined path thin shafts of sunlight stabbed through the foliage golden dust danced in the beams she spoke but he could not decipher her words he did not mind he was content gold became silver silver became a great blunt blade stabbing a nighttime sky obscuring the weaker stars the comet came down came down and a great female face opened upon him it was shouting shouting angrily and he could not hear the comet vanished a full moon rode the diamondstudded sky a great shadow crossed the stars obscuring the milky way a head bomanz realized a head of darkness a wolfs head snapping at the moon then it was gone he was with the woman again walking that forest path tripping over sunbeams she was promising him something he wakened jasmine was shaking him bo youre dreaming again wake up im all right he mumbled it wasnt that bad youve got to stop eating so many onions a man your age and with an ulcer bomanz sat up patted his paunch the ulcer had not bothered him lately maybe he had too much else on his mind he swung his feet to the floor and stared into the darkness what are you doing thinking about going out to see stance you need your rest bull old as i am old people dont need to rest cant afford to dont have the time left to waste he felt for his boots jasmine muttered something typical he ignored her he had that down to a fine art she added take care out there eh be careful i dont feel comfortable now that besand is gone he only left this morning yes but bomanz left the house muttering about superstitious old women who could not stand change he took a random roundabout route occasionally pausing to watch the comet it was spectacular a great mane of glory he wondered if his dream had been trying to tell him something a shadow devouring the moon not solid enough he decided nearing the edge of town he heard voices he softened his step people were not usually out at this time of night they were inside an abandoned shack a candle flickered inside pilgrims he supposed he found a peephole but he could see nothing save a mans back something about those slumped shoulders besand of course not too wide more like that one ape of tokars he could not identify the voices which were mostly whispers one did sound a lot like men fus habitual whine the words were distinct enough though look we did everything we could to get him out of here you take a mans job and home he ought to realize hes not wanted but he wont go a second voice then its time for heroic measures whiny voice thats going too far short of disgust yellow ill do it where is he holed up in the old stable the loft fixed himself a pallet like an old dog in a comer a grunt as someone rose feet moving bomanz grabbed his belly mousestepped away and hid in a shadow a hulking figure crossed the road comet light glittered upon a naked blade bomanz scuttled to a more distant shadow and stopped to think what did it mean murder surely but who why who had moved into the abandoned stable pilgrims and transients used the empty places all the time who were those men possibilities occurred he banished them they were too grim when his nerves returned he hurried to the dig stancils lantern was there but he was nowhere in sight stance no answer stancil where are you still no answer almost in panic he shouted stancil that you pop where are you taking a crap bomanz sighed sat down his son appeared a moment later brushing sweat off his forehead why it was a cool night stance did besand change his mind i saw him leave this morning a while ago i heard men plotting to kill somebody sounded like they meant him kill who i dont know one of them might have been men fu there were three or four of them did he come back i dont think so you didnt dream something did you what are you doing out in the middle of the night anyway that nightmare again i couldnt sleep i didnt imagine it those men were going to kill somebody because he wouldnt leave that doesnt make sense pop i dont care bomanz whirled he heard the strange noise again a figure staggered into the light it took three steps and fell besand it is besand what did i tell you the former monitor had a bloody wound across his chest im okay he said ill be okay just shock its not as bad as it looks what happened tried to kill me told you all hell would break loose told you theyd make a play beat them this round though got their assassin instead i thought you left i saw you leave i changed my mind couldnt go i took an oath bo they took away my job but not my conscience ive got to stop them bomanz met his sons gaze stancil shook his head pop look at his wrist bomanz looked i dont see anything thats the point his amulet is gone he turned it in when he left didnt you no besand said lost it in the fight couldnt find it in the dark he made that funny sound pop hes bad hurt i better go to the barracks stance besand gasped dont tell him get corporal husky right stancil hurried off the light of the comet filled the night with ghosts the barrowland seemed to twist and crawl momentary shapes drifted amongst the brush bomanz shuddered and tried to convince himself that his imagination was acting up now dawn was approaching besand was over his shock sipping broth jasmine had sent corporal husky came to report the result of his investigation couldnt find anything sir not no body not no amulet not even no sign of no fight its like it never happened i sure as hell didnt try to kill myself bomanz became thoughtful had he not overheard the conspirators he would have doubted besand the man was capable of staging an assault for sympathy i believe you sir i was just saying what i found they blew their best chance were warned now keep alert better not forget whos in charge now bomanz interjected dont get anybody in trouble with our new leader that rockbrain do what you can husky dont crawl out on a limb yes sir the corporal departed stancil said pop you ought to get back to the house youre looking grey bomanz rose you all right now he asked besand replied ill be fine dont worry about me the sun is up that kind dont try anything in broad daylight dont bet on it bomanz thought not if theyre devotees of the domination theyll bring the darkness to high noon out of earshot stancil said i was thinking last night pop before this got started about our name problem and suddenly it hit me theres an old stone in oar a big one with runic carvings and pictographs been around forever nobody knows what it is or where it came from nobody really cares so let me show you whats carved on it stancil picked up a twig brushed a dusty area clear of debris he started drawing theres a crude star in a circle at the top then some lines of runes nobody can read i cant remember those then some pictures he sketched rapidly thats pretty rough so is the original but look this one stick figure with a broken leg here a worm here a man superimposed over an animal here a man with a lightning bolt you see the limper nightcrawler shifter stormbringer maybe and maybe youre reaching stancil kept drawing okay thats the way they are on the rock the four i named in the same order as on your chart look here at your empty spots they could be the taken whose graves we havent identified he tapped what looked like a simple circle a stick figure with its head cocked and a beast head with a circle in its mouth the positions match bomanz admitted so so what youre being intentionally thick pop a circle is a zero maybe maybe a sign for the one called the faceless man or nameless man and here the hanged man and here moondog or moonbiter i see it stance im just not sure i want to he told stance about having dreamed of a great wolfs head snapping at the moon you see your own mind is trying to tell you go check the evidence see if it dont fit this way i dont have to why not i know it by heart it fits then whats the matter im not sure i want to do it anymore pop pop if you wont i will i mean it im not going to let you throw away thirtyseven years whats changed anyway you gave up a hell of a future to come out here can you just write that off im used to this life i dont mind it pop ive met people who knew you back when they all say you could have been a great wizard they wonder what happened to you they know that you had some great secret plan and went off to chase it they figure youre dead now cause anybody with your talent wouldve been heard from right now im wondering if theyre not right bomanz sighed stancil would never understand not without getting old under the threat of the noose i mean it pop ill do it myself no you wont you have neither the knowledge nor the skill ill do it i guess its fated lets go not so eager this isnt a tea party itll be dangerous i need rest and time to get into the right frame of mind i have to assemble my equipment and prepare the stage pop stancil who is the expert who is going to do this i guess you are then shut your mouth and keep it shut the quickest i could try is tomorrow night assuming i stay comfortable with those names stancil looked pained and impatient whats the hurry whats your stake in it i just i think tokar is bringing glory i wanted everything out of the way when she got here bomanz raised a despairing eyebrow lets go to the house im exhausted he glanced back at besand who was staring into the barrowland the man was stiff with defiance keep him out of my hair he wont be getting around too good for a while later bomanz muttered i wonder what it was all about anyway really resurrectionists stancii said the resurrectionists are a myth besands bunch use to keep themselves employed bomanz recalled some university acquaintances dont be too sure when they reached the house stance trudged upstairs to study the chart bomanz ate a small meal before lying down he told jasmine keep an eye on stance hes acting funny funny how i dont know just funny pushy about the barrowland dont let him find my gear he might try to open the path himself he wouldnt i hope not but watch him chapter fifteen the barrowland case heard corbie was back at last he ran to the old mans home corbie greeted him with a hug how you been lad we thought you were gone for good corbie had been away eight months i tried to get back theres damned near no roads anymore i know the colonel asked the taken to fly supplies in i heard the military government in oar got off their butts when that hit sent a whole regiment to start a new road its about a third of the way built i came up on part of it case donned his serious face was it really your daughter no corbie said on departing he had announced that he was off to meet a woman who might be his daughter he claimed to have given over his savings to a man who would find his children and bring them to oar you sound disappointed he was his researches had not worked out well too many records were missing what sort of winter was it case bad it was bad down there too i worried for you all we had trouble with the tribes that was the worst part you can always stay inside and throw another log on but you cant eat if thieves steal your stores i thought it might come to that we watched your house they broke in some of the empty places thank you corbies eyes narrowed his home had been violated how thoroughly a careful searcher might have found enough to hang him he glanced out a window looks like rain it always looks like rain when it dont look like snow it got twelve feet deep last winter people are worried whats happened to the weather old folks say it goes this way after the great comet the winters turn bad for a few years down in oar it never got that cold plenty of snow though wasnt that cold here just snowed so much you couldnt get out i like to went crazy the whole barrowland looked like a frozen lake you could hardly tell where the great barrow was uhm i have to unpack yet if you dont mind let everyone know im back im near broke ill need work will do corbie corbie watched from a window as case ambled back to the guard compound taking an elevated walkway built since his departure the mud below explained it that and colonel sweets penchant for keeping his men occupied once case vanished he went to the second floor nothing had been disturbed good he peeped out a window toward the barrowland how it had changed in just a few years a few more and you would not be able to find it he grunted stared the harder then he retrieved the silken map from its hiding place studied it then the barrowland again after a time he fished sweatstained papers from inside his shirt where he had carried them since stealing them from the university in oar he spread them over the map late that afternoon he rose donned a cloak gathered the cane he now carried and went out he limped through the water and mud and drizzle till he reached a point overlooking the great tragic river it was in flood as always its bed had continued to shift after a time he cursed smote an old oak with his cane and turned back the day had gone grey with the hour it would be dark before he got home damned complications he muttered i never counted on this what the hell am i going to do take the high risk the one chance he wished most to avoid though its possible necessity was his real reason for having wintered in oar for the first time in years he wondered if the game were worth the candle whatever his course it would be dark before he got home chapter sixteen the plain of fear you get mad and walk out on darling you can miss a lot elmo oneeye goblin otto those guys like to bait me they were not about to clue me in they got everybody else to go along even tracker who seemed to be taking a shine to me and chattered at me more than everybody else combined would not drop a hint so when the day came i went topside in total ignorance id packed the usual field gear our traditions are heavy infantry though mostly we ride these days all of us are too old to lug eighty pounds of gear i dragged mine to the cavern that serves as a stable and smells like the grandfather of them alland found that not one animal was saddled well one darlings the stable boy just grinned when i asked what was going on go on up he said sir yeah rotten bastards they play games with me ill get them they damned well better start remembering who keeps the annals around here i bitched and moaned all the way into the premoonset shadows that lurked around the tunnel mouth there i found the rest of the outfit all already up with light gear each man carried his weapons and a sack of dried food what you doing croaker oneeye asked with suppressed laughter look like youre taking everything you own you a turtle carry your house on your back and elmo we aint moving boy just going on a raid youre a bunch of sadists you know that i stepped into the wan light the moon was half an hour from setting far taken drifted on the night those sonofabitches were determined to keep a close watch nearer a whole horde of menhirs had gathered they looked like a graveyard out on the desert there were so many of them there were a lot of walking trees too more though there was no breeze i could hear old father tree tinkling no doubt that meant something a menhir might have explained but the stones remain closemouthed about themselves and their fellow species especially about father tree most of them wont admit he exists better lighten your load croaker the lieutenant said he would not explain either you going too i asked surprised yep move it we dont have long weapons and field medical kit should do it scoot i met darling going down she smiled grouchy as i was i smiled back i cant stay mad at her i have known her since she was so high since raven rescued her from the limpers thugs long ago in the forsberg campaigns i cannot see the woman that is without recalling the child that was i get all sentimental and soft they tell me i suffer from a crippling romantic streak looking back im almost inclined to agree ah those silly stories i wrote about the lady the moon was on the rim of the world when i returned topside a whisper of excitement coursed among the men darling was up there with them astride her flashy white mare moving around gesturing at those who understood sign above the spots of luminescence that are characteristic of windwhale tentacles drifted lower than id ever heard tell of except in horror stories about starved whales dropping down to drag their tentacles on the ground ripping up every plant and animal in their path hey i said wed better look out that sucker is coming down a vast shadow blotted out thousands of stars and it was expanding manias swarmed around it big ones little ones inbetween onesmore than id ever seen my expostulation drew laughter i turned surly again i moved among the men harassing them about the medical kits i expect them to carry on a mission i was in a better mood when i finished they all had them the windwhale kept coming down the moon disappeared the instant it did the menhirs began to move moments later they began to glow on the side toward us the side away from the taken darling rode along the pathway they marked when she passed a menhir its light went out i suspect it moved to the far end of the line i had no time to check elmo and the lieutenant herded us into a line of our own above the night filled with the squeaks and flutter of manias squabbling for flying room the windwhale settled astride the creek my god it was big big i had no idea it stretched from the coral over the creek another two hundred yards four five hundred yards long all total and seventy to a hundred wide a menhir spoke i could not make out its words but the men began moving forward in a minute my worst suspicions were confirmed they were climbing the creatures flank onto its back where mantas normally nested it smelled smelled unlike anything ive ever smelled before and strongly richly you might say not necessarily a bad smell but overpowering and it felt strange to the touch not hairy scaly horny not exactly slimy but still spongy and slick like a full exposed intestine there were plenty of handholds our fingers and boots did not bother it the menhir mumbled and grumbled like an old first sergeant both issuing orders and relaying complaints from the windwhale i got the impression the windwhale was a naturally grouchy sort he did not like this any more than did i cant say i blame him up top there were more menhirs each balanced precariously as i arrived one menhir told me to go to another of its kind that one told me to sit about twenty feet away the last men climbed aboard only moments later the menhirs vanished i began to feel odd at first blush i thought that was because the whale was lifting off when i flew with the lady or whisper or soulcatcher my stomach was in continual rebellion but this was a different malaise it took a while to understand it as an absence darlings null was fading it had been with me so long it had become part of my life what was happening we were going up i felt the breeze shift the stars turned ponderously then suddenly the whole north lighted up mantas were attacking the taken a whole mess of them the stroke was a complete surprise for all the taken must have sensed their presence but the mantas were not doing that sort of thing oh hell i thought theyre pushing them our way i grinned not our way at all toward darling and her null in a place unexpected as the thought occurred i saw the flash of vain sorceries saw a carpet stagger flutter earthward a score of mantas swarmed it maybe darling was not as dumb as i thought maybe these taken could be taken out a profit for sure if nothing else went right but what were we doing the lightning illuminated my companions nearest me were tracker and toadkiller dog tracker seemed bored but toadkiller dog was as alert as i had seen him he was sitting up watching the display the only time i ever saw him not on his belly was at mealtime his tongue was out he panted had he been human i would have said he was grinning the second taken tried to impress the mantas with his power he was too immensely outnumbered and below darling was moving that second taken suddenly entered her null down he went the manta swarm pursued both would survive landing but then they would be afoot at the heart of the plain which tonight had taken a stand their chances of walking out looked grim the windwhale was up a couple thousand feet now moving northeast gaining speed how far to the edge of the plain nearest rust two hundred miles fine we might make it before dawn but what about the last thirty miles beyond the plain tracker started singing his voice was soft at first his song was old soldiers of the north countries had sung it for generations it was a dirge a songbeforedeath sung in memory of those about to die i heard it in forsberg sung on both sides another voice took it up then another and another perhaps fifteen men knew it of forty or so the windwhale glided northward far far below the plain of fear slid away utterly invisible i began to sweat though the upper air was cold chapter seventeen rust my first false assumption was that the limper would be home when we called darlings maneuver against the taken obviated that i should have recalled that the taken touch one another over long distances mind to mind limper and benefice passed nearby as we moved north down goblin squealed when we were fifty miles short of the edge of the plain taken nobody move as always old croaker considered himself the exception to the rule for the annals of course i crept nearer the side of our monster mount peered out into the night way below two shadows raced down our backtrack once they were past i took a cussing from elmo the lieutenant goblin oneeye and anybody else who wanted a piece i settled back beside tracker he just grinned and shrugged he came ever more to life as action approached my second false assumption was that the windwhale would drop us at the edge of the plain i was up again as that drew near ignoring naughty remarks directed my way but the windwhale did not go down it did not descend for many minutes yet i began to babble sillinesses when i resumed my place by tracker he had his tillnow mysterious case open it contained a small arsenal he checked his weapons one longbladed knife did not please him he began applying a whetstone how many times had raven done the same in the brief year he spent with the company the whales descent was sudden elmo and the lieutenant passed among us telling us to get off in a hurry elmo told me stick close to me croaker you too tracker oneeye you feel anything down there nothing goblin has his sleeping spell ready their sentries will be snoring when we touch down unless they arent and raise the alarm i muttered damn but didnt i have it for the dark side no problems we grounded men poured over the side they spread out as if this part had been rehearsed parts may have been while i was sulking i could do nothing but what elmo told me the early going reminded me of another barracks raid long ago south of the sea of torments ere we enlisted with the lady we had slaughtered the urban cohorts of the jewel city beryl our wizards keeping them snoozing while we murdered them not work i enjoy ill tell you most of them were just kids who enlisted for want of something better to do but they were the enemy and we were making a grand gesture a grander gesture than i had supposed darling could order or had in mind the sky began to lighten not one man of an entire regiment save perhaps a few awol for the night survived out on the main parade of the compound which stood well outside rust proper elmo and the lieutenant began to yell hurry hurry more to do this squad to wreck the stellae of the taken that squad to plunder regimental headquarters another to set out stuff to fire the barracks buildings still another to search the limpers quarters for documents hurry hurry got to get gone before the taken return darling cannot distract them forever somebody screwed up naturally it always happens somebody fired one barracks early smoke rose over in rust we soon learned there was another regiment in minutes a squadron of horse were galloping our way and again someone had screwed up the gates were not secured almost without warning the horsemen were among us men shouted weapons clanged arrows flew horses shrieked the ladys men got out leaving half their number behind now elmo and the lieutenant were in a hurry for sure those boys were going for help while we were scattering the imperials the windwhale lifted off maybe half a dozen men managed to scramble aboard it rose just enough to clear the rooftops then headed south there was not yet enough light to betray it you can imagine the cussing and shouting even toadkiller dog found the energy to snarl i slumped in defeat dropped my butt onto a hitching rail sat there shaking my head a few men sped arrows after the monster it did not notice tracker leaned on the rail beside me i grumped you wouldnt think something that big would be chicken i mean a windwhale can destroy a city do not impart motives to a creature you do not understand you have to see its reasoning what not reasoning i dont know the right word he reminded me of a fouryearold struggling with a difficult concept its outside the lands it knows beyond bounds its enemies believe it can breech it runs for fear it will be seen and a secret betrayed it has never worked with men how can it remember them in a desperate moment he was right probably but at the moment i was more interested in him than in his theory that i would have stumbled across after i settled down he made it seem one huge and incredibly difficult piece of thinking i wondered about his mind was he just slightly more than a halfwit was his ravenlike act not a product of personality but of simpleness the lieutenant stood on the parade ground hands on hips watching the windwhale leave us in the enemys palm after a minute he shouted officers assemble after we gathered he said were in for it as i see it we have one hope that that big bastard gets in touch with the menhirs when it gets back and that they decide were worth saving so what we do is hold out till nightfall and hope oneeye made an obscene noise i think we better run for it yeah and let the imperials track us were how far from home you think we can make it with the limper and his pals after us theyll be after us here maybe and maybe theyll keep them busy out there at least if were here theyll know where to find us elmo survey the walls see if we can hold them goblin silent get those fires put out the rest of you clean out the takens documents elmo post sentries oneeye your job is to figure out how we can get help from rust croaker give him a hand you know who we have where come on move a good man the lieutenant he kept his cool when like all of us what he wanted to do was run in circles and scream we didnt have a chance really this was the end of it even if we held off the troops from the city there was benefice and the limper goblin oneeye and silent would be of no value against them the lieutenant knew that too he did not have them put their heads together to plot a surprise we could not get the fire controlled the barracks had to burn itself out while i tended two wounded men the others made the compound as defensible as thirty men could finished doctoring i went poking through the limpers documents i found nothing immediately interesting about a hundred men coming out of rust someone shouted the lieutenant snapped make this place look abandoned men scurried i popped up to the wall top for a quick peek at the scrub woods north of us oneeye was out there creeping toward the city hoping to get to corders friends even after having been triply decimated in the great sieges and occupied for years rust remained adamant in its hatred for the lady the imperials were careful they sent scouts around the wall they sent a few men up close to draw fire only after an hour of cautious maneuver did they rush the halfopen gate the lieutenant let fifteen get inside before tripping the portcullus those went down in a storm of arrows then we hustled to the wall and let fly at those milling around outside another dozen fell the others retreated beyond bowshot there they milled and grumbled and tried to decide what next tracker remained nearby all that time i saw him loose only four arrows each ripped right through an imperial he might not be bright but he could use a bow if theyre smart i told him theyll set a picket line and wait for the limper no point them getting hurt when he can handle us tracker grunted toadkiller dog opened one eye grumbled deep in his throat down the way goblin and silent crouched with heads together alternately popping up to look outside i figured they were plotting tracker stood up grunted again i looked myself more imperials were leaving rust hundreds more nothing happened for an hour except that more and more troops appeared they surrounded us goblin and silent unleashed their wizardry it took the form of a cloud of moths i could not discern their provenance they just gathered around the two when they were maybe a thousand strong they fluttered away for a while there was a lot of screaming outside when that died i ambled over and asked a grimfaced goblin what happened somebody with a touch of talent he squeaked almost as good as us we in trouble in trouble us we got it whipped croaker we got them on the run they just dont know it yet i meant he wont hit back he dont want to give himself away theres two of us and only one of him the imperials began assembling artillery pieces the compound had not been built to withstand bombardment time passed the sun climbed we watched the sky when would doom come riding in on a carpet certain the imperials would not immediately attack the lieutenant had some of us gather our plunder on the parade ground ready to board a windwhale whether he believed it or not he insisted we would be evacuated after sunset he would not entertain the possibility that the taken would arrive first he did keep morale up the first missile fell an hour after noon a ball of fire smacked down a dozen feet short of the wall another arced after it it fell on the parade ground sputtered fizzled going to burn us out i muttered to tracker a third missile came it burned cheerfully but also upon the parade tracker and toadkiller dog stood and stared over the ramparts the dog stretching on his hind legs after a while tracker sat down opened his wooden case withdrew a half dozen overly long arrows he stood again stared toward the artillery engines arrow across his bow it was a long flight but reachable even with my weapon but i could have plinked all day and not come close tracker fell into a state of concentration almost trancelike he lifted and bent his bow pulled it to the head of his arrow let fly a cry rolled up the slope the artillerymen gathered around one of their number tracker loosed shafts smoothly and quickly id guess he put four in the air at one time each found a target then he sat down thats that say what no more good arrows maybe thats enough to discourage them it was for a while about long enough for them to move back and put up some protective mantlets then the missiles came again one found a building the heat was vicious the lieutenant prowled the wall restlessly i joined his silent prayer that the imperials would not get worked up and rush us there would be no way to stop them chapter eighteen siege the sun was settling we were alive still no taken carpet had come swooping out of the plain we had begun to believe there was a chance something hammered on the gate a great loud pounding like the hammer of doom oneeye roared up let me in damnit somebody scooted down and opened up he came to the ramparts well goblin demanded i dont know too many imperials not enough rebels they wanted to argue it out how did you get through i asked walked he snapped then less belligerently trade secret croaker sorcery of course the lieutenant paused to hear oneeyes report resumed his ceaseless prowl i watched the imperials there were indications they were out of patience oneeye evidently supported my suspicion with direct evidence he goblin and silent started plotting i am not certain what they did not moths but the results were similar a big outcry soon stifled but now we had three spook doctors to work the mine the extra man sought the imperial who negated the spell a man ran toward the city aflame goblin and oneeye howled victoriously not two minutes later an artillery engine burst into flames then another i watched our wizards closely silent remained all business but goblin and oneeye were getting carried away having a good time i feared they would go too far that the imperials would attack in hope of overwhelming them they came but later than i expected they waited till nightfall and then they were more cautious than the situation demanded meantime smoke began to waft up over the ruined walls of rust oneeyes mission had succeeded somebody was doing something some of the imperials pulled out and hurried back to deal with it as the stars came out i told tracker guess well soon know if the lieutenant was right he just looked puzzled imperial horns sounded signals companies moved toward the wall he and i stood to our bows seeking targets that were difficult in the darkness though there was a bit of moon out of the nowhere he asked whats she like croaker what who i let fly the lady they say you met her yeah a long time ago well whats she like he loosed a cry answered the twang of his bowstring he seemed perfectly calm seemed unaware that he might die in minutes that disturbed me about what youd expect i replied what could i say my contacts with her were but sketchy memories now hard and beautiful the answer did not satisfy him it never satisfies anyone but it is the best i can give what did she look like i dont know tracker i was scared shitless and she did things to my mind i saw a young beautiful woman but you can see those anywhere his bow twanged was answered by another cry he shrugged i sort of wondered he began loosing more quickly the imperials were close now i swear he never missed i loosed when i saw something but he has eyes like an owl all i saw was shadows among shadows goblin oneeye and silent did what they could their witcheries painted the field with shortlived little flares and screams what they could do was not enough ladders slapped against the wall most went right back over again but men came up a few then there were a dozen more i scattered arrows into the darkness almost randomly as quickly as i could then drew my sword the rest of the men did likewise the lieutenant shouted its here i flicked a glance at the stars yes a vast shape had appeared overhead it was settling the lieutenant had guessed right now all we had to do was get aboard some of the young men broke for the parade ground the lieutenants curses did not slow them neither did elmos snarls and threats the lieutenant yelled for the rest of us to follow goblin and oneeye loosed something nasty for a moment i thought it was some cruel conjured demon it looked vile enough and it did stall the imperials but like much of their magic it was illusion not substance the enemy soon caught on but we had us a head start the men reached the parade before the imperials recollected themselves they roared certain they had us i reached the windwhale as it touched down silent snagged my arm as i started to scramble aboard he indicated the documents we had scrounged oh damn there isnt time men scrambled past me during my moment of indecision then i tossed sword and bow topside and began pitching bundles up to silent who got somebody to relay them to the top a gang of imperials charged toward us i started for an abandoned sword saw i could not reach it in time thought oh shitnot now not here tracker stepped between me and them his blade was like something out of legend he killed three men in the blink of an eye wounded another two before the imperials decided they faced someone preternatural he took the offensive though still outnumbered never have i seen a sword used with such skill style economy and grace it was a part of him an extension of his will nothing could stand before it for that moment i could believe old tales about magic swords silent kicked me in the back signed at me quit gawking and get moving i tossed up the last two bundles began scaling the monster the men tracker faced received reinforcements he retreated from up top someone sped arrows down but i did not think he would make it i kicked at a man who had gotten behind him another took his place leapt at me toadkiller dog came out of nowhere he locked his jaws in my assailants throat the man gurgled responded as he might have if bitten by a krite he lasted only a second toadkiller dog dropped away i climbed a few feet still trying to guard trackers back he reached up i caught his hand and heaved there were awful shouts and screams among the imperials it was too dark to see why i figured oneeye goblin and silent were earning their keep tracker flung up past me took a firm hold helped me i climbed a few feet looked down the ground was fifteen feet below the windwhale was going up fast the imperials stood around gawking i fought my way to the top i looked down again as someone dragged me to safety the fires in rust were beneath us several hundred feet below we were going up fast no wonder my hands were cold chills were not the reason i lay down shaking though after it passed i asked anybody hurt wheres my medical kit where i wondered were the taken how had we gotten through the day without a visit from our beloved enemy the limper going home i noticed more than i did coming north i felt the life beneath me the grumble and hum within the monster i noted preadolescent mantas peeping from nesting places among the appendages which forested parts of the whales back and i saw the plain in a different light with the moon up to illuminate it it was another world spare and crystalline at times luminescent at others sparkling and glowing in spots what looked like lava pools lay to the west beyond the flash and curl of a change storm illuminated the horizon i suppose we were crossing its backtrail later deeper into the plain the desert became more mundane our steed was not the cowardly windwhale this one was smaller and smelled less strongly it was more spritely too and less tentative in its movements about twenty miles from home goblin squealed taken and everyone went flat the whale climbed i peeked over its side taken for sure but not interested in us there was a lot of flash and roar way down there patches of desert were aflame i saw the long creepy shadows of walking trees on the move the shapes of manias rushing across the light the taken themselves were afoot except one desperado aloft battling the mantas the one aloft was not the limper i would have recognized his tattered brown even at that distance whisper surely trying to escort the others out of enemy territory great they would be busy for a few days the windwhale began to descend it touched down shortly from the ground a menhir called get down hurry getting off was more trouble than boarding the wounded now realized they were hurt everyone was tired and stiff and tracker would not move he was catatonic nothing reached him he just sat there staring at infinity what the hell elmo demanded whats wrong with him i dont know maybe he got hit i was baffled and the more so once we got him into some light so i could examine him there was nothing physically wrong he had come through without a bruise darling came outside she signed you were right croaker i am sorry i thought it would be a stroke so bold it would fire the whole world of elmo she asked how many lost four men i dont know if they were killed or just got left he seemed ashamed the black company does not leave its brethren behind toadkiller dog tracker said we left toadkiller dog oneeye disparaged the mutt tracker rose angrily he had salvaged nothing but his sword his magnificent case and arsenal remained in rust with his mongrel here now the lieutenant snapped none of that oneeye go below croaker keep an eye on this man ask darling if the guys who ran out yesterday made it back elmo and i both did her answer was not reassuring the great cowardly windwhale dumped them a hundred miles north according to the menhirs at least it descended before forcing them off they were walking home the menhirs promised to shield them from the natural wickedness of the plain we all went down into the hole bickering there is nothing like failure to set the sparks flying failure of course can be relative the damage we did was considerable the repercussions would echo a long time the taken had to be badly rattled our capture of so many documents would force a restructuring of their plan of campaign but still the mission was unsatisfactory now the taken knew wind whales were capable of ranging beyond traditional bounds now the taken knew we had resources beyond those they had suspected when you gamble you do not show all your cards till after the final bet i scrounged around and found the captured papers took them to my quarters i did not feel like participating in the conference room postmortem it was sure to get nastyeven with everyone agreeing i shed my weapons lighted a lamp picked one of the document bundles turned to my worktable and there lay another of those packets from the west chapter nineteen bomanzs tale croaker bomanz walked his dreams with a woman who could not make him understand her words the green path of promise led past mooneating dogs hanged men and sentries without faces through breaks in the foliage he glimpsed a skyspanning comet he did not sleep well the dream invariably awaited him when he dozed off he did not know why he could not slide down into deep sleep as nightmares went this was mild most of the symbolism was obvious and most of it he refused to heed night had fallen when jasmine brought tea and asked are you going to lie here all week i might how are you going to sleep tonight i probably wont till late ill work in the shbp whats stance been up to he slept a while went and brought a load from the site pottered around the shop ate and went back out when somebody came to say men fu was out there again what about besand its all over town the new monitor is furious because he didnt leave says he wont do anything about it the guards are calling him a horses ass they wont take his orders hes getting madder and madder maybe hell learn something thanks for the tea is there anything to eat leftover chicken get it yourself im going to bed grumbling bomanz ate cold greasy chicken wings washing them down with tepid beer he thought about his dream his ulcer gave him a nip his head started aching here we go he muttered and dragged himself upstairs he spent several hours reviewing the rituals he would use to leave his body and slide through the hazards of the barrowland would the dragon be a problem indications were it was meant for physical intruders finally itll work as long as that sixth barrow is moondogs he sighed leaned back closed his eyes the dream began and midway through he found himself staring into green ophidian eyes wise cruel mocking eyes he started awake pop you up there yeah come on up stancil pushed into the room he looked awful what happened the barrowland the ghosts are walking they do that when the comet gets close i didnt expect them so soon must be going to get frisky this time thats no call to get shook up wasnt that i expected that that i could handle no its besand and men fu what men fu tried to get into the barrowland with besands amulet i was right that little go on he was at the dig he had the amulet he was scared to death he saw me coming and headed downhill when he got near where the moat used to be besand came out of nowhere screaming and waving a sword men fu started running besand kept after him its pretty bright out there but i lost track when they got up around the howlers barrow besand must have caught him i heard them yelling and rolling around in the brush then they started screaming stancil stopped bomanz waited i dont know how to describe it pop i never heard sounds like that ah the ghosts piled onto the howlers barrow it went on a long time then the screaming started getting closer stancil bomanz concluded had been shaken deeply shaken the way a man is when his basic beliefs are uprooted odd go on it was besand he had the amulet but it didnt help he didnt make it across the moat he dropped it the ghosts jumped him hes dead pop the guards were all out there they couldnt do anything but look the monitor wouldnt give them amulets so they could get him bomanz folded his hands on the tabletop stared at them so now we have two men dead three counting the one last night how many will we have tomorrow night will i have to face a platoon of new ghosts youre going to do it tomorrow night thats right with besand gone theres no reason to delay it is there pop maybe you shouldnt maybe the knowledge out there should stay buried whats this my son parroting my misgivings pop lets dont fight maybe i pushed too hard maybe i was wrong you know more about the barrowland than me bomanz stared at his son more boldly than he felt he said im going in its time to put doubts aside and get on with it theres the list see if theres an area of inquiry that ive forgotten pop dont argue with me boy it had taken him all evening to shed the ingrained bomanz persona and surface the wizard so long and artfully hidden but he was out now bomanz went to a comer where a few seemingly innocuous objects were piled he stood taller than usual he moved more precisely more quickly he began piling things on the table when you go back to oar you can tell my old classmates what became of me he smiled thinly he could recall a few who would shudder even now knowing he had studied at the ladys knee hed never forgotten never forgiven and they knew him that well stancils pallor had disappeared now he was uncertain this side of the father had not been seen since before the sons birth it was outside his experience do you want to go out there pop you brought back the essential details besand is dead men fu is dead the guards arent going to get excited i thought he was your friend besand besand had no friends he had a mission whatre you looking at a man with a mission could be something kept me here take this stuff downstairs well do it in the shop where do you want it doesnt matter besand was the only one who could have separated it from the junk stancil went out later bomanz finished a series of mental exercises and wondered what had become of the boy stance hadnt returned he shrugged went on he smiled he was ready it was going to be simple the town was in an uproar a guard had tried to assassinate the new monitor the monitor was so bewildered and frightened he had locked himself in his quarters crazy rumors abounded bomanz walked through it with such calm dignity that he startled people who had known him for years he went to the edge of the barrowland considered his longtime antagonist besand lay where he had fallen the flies were thick bomanz threw a handful of dirt the insects scattered he nodded thoughtfully besands amulet had disappeared again bomanz located corporal husky if you cant do anything to get besand out then toss dirt in on him theres a mountain around my pit yes sir husky said and only later seemed startled by his easy acquiescence bomanz walked the perimeter of the barrowland the sun shone a little oddly through the comets tail colors were a trifle strange but there were no ghosts aprowl now he saw no reason not to make his communication attempt he returned to the village wagons stood before the shop teamsters were busy loading them jasmine shrilled inside cursing someone who had taken something he shouldnt damn you tokar bomanz muttered why today you could have waited till it was over he felt a fleeting concern he could not rely on stance if the boy were distracted he shoved into the shop its grand tokar said of the horse absolutely magnificent youre a genius bo youre a pain in the butt whats going on here who the hell are all these people my drivers my brother clete my sister glory stances glory and our baby sister snoopy we called her that because she was always spying on us pleased to meet you all wheres stance jasmine said i sent him to get something for supper with this crowd ill have to start cooking early bomanz sighed just what he needed this night of nights a house full of guests you put that back where you got it you snoopy keep your hands off of stuff tokar asked whats with you bo bomanz raised one eyebrow met the mans gaze did not answer wheres the driver with the big shoulders not with me anymore tokar frowned thought not ill be upstairs if something critical comes up he stamped through the shop went up settled in his chair willed himself to sleep his dreams were subtle it seemed he could hear at last but could not recall what he heard stancil entered the upstairs room bomanz asked what are we going to do that crowd is gumming up the works how long do you need pop this could go all night every night for weeks if it works out he was pleased stancil had recovered his courage cant hardly run them off and cant go anywhere else either the guards were in a hard bitter mood how noisy will you be pop could we do it here on the quiet guess well have to try going to be crowded get the stuff from the shop ill make room bomanzs shoulders slumped when stancil left he was getting nervous not about the thing he would challenge but about his own foresight he kept thinking he had forgotten something but he had reviewed four decades of notes without detecting a flaw in his chosen approach any reasonably educated apprentice should be able to follow his formulation he spat into a corner antiquarians cowardice he muttered oldfashioned fear of the unknown stancil returned moms got them into a game of throws i wondered what snoopy was yelling about got everything yes okay go down and kibbitz ill be there after i set up well do it after theyre in bed okay stance are you ready im okay pop i just had the jitters last night its not every day i see a man killed by ghosts better get a feel for that kind of thing it happens stancil looked blank youre sneaking studies on black campus arent you black campus was that hidden side of the university on which wizards learned their trade officially it did not exist legally it was prohibited but it was there bomanz was a laureate graduate stancil gave one sharp nod and left i thought so bomanz whispered and wondered how black are you son he pottered around till he had triplechecked everything till he realized that caution had become an excuse for not socializing youre something he mumbled to himself one last look chart laid out candles bowl of quicksilver silver dagger herbs censers he still had that feeling what the hell could i have missed throws was essentially fourplayer checkers the board was four times the usual size players played from each side an element of chance was added by throwing a die before each move if a players throw came up six he could move any combination of pieces six moves checkers rules generally applied except that a jump could be declined snoopy appealed to bomanz the moment he appeared theyre ganging up on me she was playing opposite jasmine glory and tokar were on her flanks bomanz watched a few moves tokar and the older sister were in cahoots conventional elimination tactics on impulse bomanz controlled the fall of the die when it came to snoopy she threw a six squealed sent men charging all over bomanz wondered if he had been that rich in adolescent enthusiasm and optimism he eyed the girl how old fourteen he made tokar throw a one let jasmine and glory have what fate decreed then gave snoopy another six and tokar another one after a third time around tokar grumbled this is getting ridiculous the balance of the game had shifted glory was about to abandon him and side with her sister against jasmine jasmine gave bomanz the fisheye when snoopy threw yet another six he winked let tokar throw free a two tokar grumbled im on the comeback trail now bomanz wandered into the kitchen poured himself a mug of beer he returned to find snoopy on the edge of disaster again her play was so frenetic she had to throw fours or better to survive tokar on the other hand played a tediously conservative game advancing in echelon trying to occupy his flankers king rows a man much like himself bomanz reflected first he plays to make sure he doesnt lose then he worries about the win he watched tokar roll a six and send a piece on an extravagant tour in which he took three men from his nominal ally glory treacherous too bomanz thought thats worth keeping in mind he asked stancil wheres clete tokar said he decided to stay with the teamsters thought we were crowding you too much i see jasmine won that game and tokar the next whereupon the antique merchant said thats all for me take my seat bo see you all in the morning glory said im done too can we go for a walk stance stancil glanced at his father bomanz nodded dont go far the guards are in a bad mood we wont stance said his father smiled at his eager departure it had been that way for him and jasmine long ago jasmine observed a lovely girl stance is lucky thank you tokar said we think shes lucky too snoopy made a sour face bomanz allowed himself a wry smile somebody had a crush on stancil threehanded game he suggested take turns playing the dummy till somebody is out he let chance have its way with the players throws but turned five and sixes for the dummy snoopy went out and took the dummy jasmine seemed amused snoopy squealed delightedly when she won glory i won she enthused when her sister and stancil returned i beat them stancil looked at the board at his father pop i fought all the way she got the lucky throws stancil smiled a disbelieving smile glory said thats enough snoopy bedtime this isnt the city people go to bed early here aw the girl complained but went bomanz sighed being sociable was a strain his heartbeat quickened as he anticipated the nights work stancil completed a third reading of his written instructions got it bomanz asked i guess timing isnt importantas long as youre late not early if we were going to conjure some damnfool demon youd study your lines for a week lines stancil would do nothing but tend candles and observe he was there to help if his father got into trouble bomanz had spent the past two hours neutralizing spells along the path he intended to follow the moondog name had been a gold strike is it open stancil asked wide it almost pulls you ill let you go yourself later in the week bomanz took a deep breath exhaled he surveyed the room he still had that nagging feeling of having forgotten something he hadnt a hint what it might be okay he settled into the chair closed his eyes dumni he murmured um muji dumni haikon dumni um muji dumni stancil pinched herbs into a diminutive charcoal brazier pungent smoke filled the room bomanz relaxed let the lethargy steal over him he achieved a quick separation drifted up hovered beneath the rafters watched stancil the boy showed promise bo checked his ties with his body good excellent he could hear with both his spiritual and physical ears he tested the duality further as he drifted downstairs each sound stance made came through clearly he paused in the shop stared at glory and snoopy he envied them their youth and innocence outside the comets glow filled the night bomanz felt its power showering the earth how much more spectacular would it become by the time the world entered its mane suddenly she was there beckoning urgently he reexamined his ties to his flesh yes still in trance not dreaming he felt vaguely ill at ease she led him to the barrowland following the path he had opened he reeled under the awesome power buried there away from the might radiating from the menhirs and fetishes seen from his spiritual viewpoint they took the form of cruel hideous monsters leashed on short chains ghosts stalked the barrowland they howled beside bomanz trying to breach his spells the power of the comet and the might of the warding spells joined in a thunder which permeated bomanzs being how mighty were the ancients he thought that all this should remain after so long they approached the dead soldiers represented by pawns on bomanzs chart he thought he heard footsteps behind him he looked back saw nothing realized he was hearing stancil back at the house a knights ghost challenged him its hatred was as timeless and relentless as the pounding surf along a cold bleak shore he sidled around great green eyes stared into his own ancient wise merciless eyes arrogant mocking and contemptuous the dragon exposed its teeth in a sneer this is it bomanz thought what i overlooked but no the dragon could not touch him he sensed its irritation its conviction that he would make a tasty morsel in the flesh he hurried after the woman no doubt about it she was the lady she had been trying to reach him too best be wary she wanted more than a grateful chela they entered the crypt it was massive spacious filled with all the clutter that had been the dominators in life clearly that life had not been spartan he pursued the woman around a furniture pileand found her vanished where he saw them side by side on separate stone slabs shackled enveloped by crackling humming forces neither breathed yet neither betrayed the grey of death they seemed suspended marking time legend exaggerated only slightly the ladys impact even in this state was immense bo you have a grown son part of him wanted to stand on its hind legs and howl like an adolescent in rut he heard steps again damn that stancil couldnt he stand still he was making racket enough for three people the womans eyes opened her lips formed a glorious smile bomanz forgot stancil welcome said a voice within his mind we have waited a long time havent we dumbstruck he simply nodded have watched you yes i see everything in this forsaken wilderness i tried to help the barriers were too many and too great that cursed white rose she was no fool bomanz glanced at the dominator that huge handsome warrioremperor slept on bomanz envied him his physical perfection he sleeps a deeper sleep did he hear mockery he could not read her face the glamor was too much for him he suspected that had been true for many men and that it was true that she had been the driving force of the domination was and next time next time mirth surrounded him like the tinkle of wind chimes in a gentle breeze you came to learn o wizard how will you repay vour teacher here was the moment for which he had lived his triumph lay before him one part to go you were crafty you were so careful took so long even that monitor discounted you i applaud you wizard the hard part binding this creature to his will windchimes laughter you dont plan to bargain you mean to compel if i have to you wont give me anything i cant give you what you want mirth again silverbells mirth you cant compel me bomanz shrugged imaginary shoulders she was wrong he had a lever he had stumbled onto it as a youth had recognized its significance immediately and had set his feet on the long path leading to this moment he had found a cipher he had broken it and it had given him the ladys patronym a name common in predomination histories circumstances implicated one of that familys several daughters as the lady a little historical detective work had completed the task so he had solved a mystery that had baffled thousands for hundreds of years knowing her true name gave him the power to compel the lady in wizardry the true name is identical with the thing i could have shrieked it seemed my correspondent ended on the brink of the very revelation for which i had been searching these many years damn his black heart this time there was a postscript a little something more than story the letterwriter had added what looked like chicken scratches that they were meant to communicate i had no doubt but i could make nothing of them as always there was neither signature nor seal chapter twenty the barrowland the rain never ceased mostly it was little more than a drizzle when the day went especially well it slackened to a falling mist but always there was precipitation corbie went out anyway though he complained often about aches in his leg if the weather bothers you so why stay here case asked you said you think your kids live in opal why not go down there and look for them yourself at least the weather would be decent it was a tough question corbie had yet to create a convincing answer he had not yet found one that would do himself let alone enemies who might ask there was nothing corbie was afraid to do in another life as another man he had challenged the hellmakers themselves unafraid swords and sorcery and death could not intimidate him only people and love could terrify him habit i guess he said weakly maybe i could live in oar maybe i dont deal well with people case i dont like them that much i couldnt stand the jewel cities did i tell you i was down there once case had heard the story several times he suspected corbie had been more than down there he thought one of the jewel cities was corbies original home yeah when the big rebel push in forsberg started you told me about seeing the tower on the way up thats right i did memorys slipping cities i dont like them lad dont like them too many people sometimes theres too many of them here was when i first came nowadays its about right about right maybe too much fuss and bother because of the undead over there he poked his chin toward the great barrow but otherwise about right one or two of you guys i can talk to nobody else to get in my way case nodded he thought he understood while not understanding he had known other old veterans most had had their peculiarities hey corbie you ever run into the black company when you was up here corbie froze stared with such intensity the young soldier blushed uh whats the matter corbie i say something wrong corbie resumed walking his limp not slowing a furiously increased pace it was odd like you were reading my mind yes i ran into those guys bad people very bad people my dad told us stories about them he was with them during the long retreat to charm lords the windy country the stair of tear all those battles when he got leave time after the battle at charm he came home told awful stories about those guys i missed that part i got left behind at roses when shifter and the limper lost the battle who was your dad with youve never talked about him much nightcrawler i dont talk about him because we never got along corbie smiled sons seldom get on with their fathers and thats the voice of experience speaking what did your father do corbie laughed he was a farmer of sorts but id rather not talk about him what are we doing out here corbie doublechecking bomanzs surveys but corbie could not tell the lad that nor could he think of an adequate lie walking in the rain corbie can we keep it quiet for a while case please sure corbie limped all the way around the barrowland maintaining a respectful distance never being too obvious he did not use equipment that would bring colonel sweet on the run instead he consulted the wizards chart in his mind the thing blazed with its own life there those arcane tellekurre symbols glowing with a wild and dangerous life studying the remains of the barrowland he could find but a third of the maps referents the rest had been undone by time and weather corbie was no man to have trouble with his nerve but he was afraid now near the end of their stroll he said case i want a favor perhaps a double favor sir sir call me corbie you sounded so serious it is serious say on then can you be trusted to keep your mouth shut if necessary i want to extract a conditional vow of silence i dont understand case i want to tell you something in case something happens to me corbie im not a young man case and i have a lot wrong with me ive been through a lot i feel it catching up i dont expect to go soon but things happen if something should theres something i dont want to die with me okay corbie if i suggested something can you keep it to yourself even if you think you maybe shouldnt can you do something for me youre making it hard not telling me i know its not fair the only other man i trust is colonel sweet and his position wouldnt let him make such a promise its not illegal not strictly speaking i guess dont guess case all right you have my word good thank you it is appreciated never doubt that two things first if something happens to me go to the room on the second floor of my home if i have left an oilskin packet on the table there see that it gets to a blacksmith named sand in oar case looked suitably dubious and baffled second after you do thatand only aftertell the colonel the undead are stirring case stopped walking case there was a note of command in corbies voice the youth had not heard before yes all right thats it corbie no questions now in a few weeks maybe i can explain everything all right okay not a word now and remember packet to sand the blacksmith then word to the colonel tell you what if i can ill leave the colonel a letter too case merely nodded corbie took a deep breath it had been twenty years since he had attempted the simplest divining spell never had he tried anything on the order of what he now faced back in those ancient times when he was another man or boy sorcery was a diversion for wealthy youths who would rather play wizard than pursue legitimate studies all was ready the tools of the sorcerer appropriate to the task lay on the table on the second floor of the house that bomanz built it was fitting that he follow the old one he touched the oilskin packet left for case the opaque letter to sweet and prayed neither would touch the young mans hands but if what he suspected were true it was better the enemy knew than the world be surprised there was nothing left to do but do it he gulped half a cup of cold tea took his seat he closed his eyes began a chant taught him when he was younger than case his was not the method bomanz had used but it was as effective his body would not relax would not cease distracting him but at last the full lethargy closed in his ka loosed its ten thousand anchors to his flesh part of him insisted he was a fool for attempting this without the skills of a master but he hadnt the time for the training a bomanz required he had learned what he could during his absence from the old forest free of the flesh yet connected by invisible bonds that would draw him back if his luck held he moved away carefully he conformed to the rule of bodies exactly he used the stairway the doorway and the sidewalks built by the guard maintain the pretense of flesh and the flesh would be harder to forget the world looked different each object had its unique aura he found it difficult to concentrate on the grand task he moved to the bounds of the barrowland he shuddered under the impact of thrumming old spells that kept the dominator and several lesser minions bound the power there carefully he walked the boundary till he found the way that bomanz had opened still not fully healed he stepped over the line he drew the instant attention of every spirit benign and malign chained within the barrowland there were far more than he expected far more than the wizards map indicated those soldier symbols that surrounded the great barrow they were not statues they were men soldiers of the white rose who had been set as spirit guards perpetually standing between the world and the monster that would devour it how driven must they have been now dedicated to their cause the path wound past the former resting places of old taken outer circle inner circle twisting within the inner circle he saw the true forms of several lesser monsters that had served the domination the path stretched like a trail of pale silver mist behind him that mist became more dense his passage strengthening the way ahead stronger spells and all those men who had gone into the earth to surround the dominator and beyond them the greater fear the dragon thing that on bomanzs map lay coiled around the crypt in the heart of the great barrow spirits shrieked at him in tellekurre in uchitelle in languages he did not know and tongues vaguely like some still current one and all they cursed him one and all he ignored them there was a thing in a chamber beneath the greatest mound he had to see if it lay as restless as he suspected the dragon oh by all the gods that never were that dragon was real real alive of flesh yet it sensed and saw him the silver trail curved past its jaws through the gap between teeth and tail it beat at him with a palpable will but he would not be stayed no more guardians just the crypt and the monster man inside was constrained he had survived the worst the old devil should be sleeping hadnt the lady defeated him in his attempt to escape through juniper hadnt she put him back down it was a tomb like many around the world perhaps a bit richer the white rose had laid her opponents down in style there were no sarcophagi though there that empty table was where the lady would have lain the other boasted a sleeping man a big man and handsome but with the mark of the beast upon him even in repose a face full of hot hatred of the anger of defeat ah then his suspicions were groundless the monster slept indeed the dominator sat up and smiled his smile was the most wicked corbie had ever seen then the undead extended a hand in welcome corbie ran mocking laughter pursued him panic was an emotion entirely unfamiliar seldom had he experienced it he could not control it he was only vaguely aware of passing the dragon and the hatefilled spirits of white rose soldiers he barely sensed the dominators creatures beyond all howling in delight even in his panic he clung to the misty trail he made only one misstep but that was sufficient the storm broke over the barrowland it was the most furious in living memory the lightning clashed with the ferocity of heavenly armies hammers and spears and swords of fire smiting earth and sky the downpour was incessant and impenetrable one mighty bolt struck the barrowland earth and shrubbery flew a hundred yards into the air the earth staggered the eternal guard scrambled to arms terrified sure the old evil had broken its chains on the barrowland two large shapes one fourfooted one bipedal formed in the afterglow of the lightning strike in a moment both raced along a twisting path leaving no mark upon water or mud they passed the bounds of the barrowland fled toward the forest no one saw them when the guard reached the barrowland carrying weapons and lanterns and fear like vast loads of lead the storm had waned the lightning had ceased its boisterous brawl the rain had fallen off to normal colonel sweet and his men spent hours roaming the bounds of the barrowland no one found a thing the eternal guard returned to its compound cursing the gods and weather on the second floor of corbies house corbies body continued to breathe one breath each five minutes his heart barely turned over he would be a long time dying without his spirit chapter twentyone the plain of fear i asked to see darling and got an immediate audience she expected me to come in raising hell about illadvised military actions by outfits that could not afford losses she expected lessons in the importance of maintaining cadres and forcesinbeing i surprised her by coming with neither here she was primed to weather the worst to get it over so she could get back to business and i disappointed her instead i took her the letters from oar which i had shared with no one yet she expressed curiosity i signed read them it took a while the lieutenant ducked in and out growing more impatient each time she finished looked at me well she signed that comes from the core of the documents i am missing along with a few other things that story is what i have been hunting soulcatcher gave me to believe that the weapon we want is hidden inside this story it is not complete no but does it not give you pause you have no idea who the writer is no and no way to find out short of looking him up or her actually i had a couple of suspicions but each seemed more unlikely than the other these have come with swift regularity darling observed after all this time that made me suspect she shared one of my suspicions that all this time the couriers believe they were forwarded over a more spread period it is interesting but not yet useful we must await more it will not hurt to consider what it means the end part of the last there that is beyond me i have to work on that it may be critical unless it is meant to baffle someone who intercepts the fragment she shuffled out the last sheet stared at it a sudden light illuminated her face it is the finger speech croaker she signed the letters see the speaking hand as it forms the alphabet i circled behind her i saw it now and felt abysmally stupid for having missed it once you saw that it was easy to read if you knew your sign it said this may be the last communication croaker there is something i must do the risks are grave the chances hang against me but i must go ahead if you do not receive the final installment about bomanzs last days you will have to come collect it i will conceal one copy within the home of the wizard as the story describes you may find another in oar ask for the blacksmith named sand wish me luck by now you must have found a place of safety i would not bring you forth unless the fate of the world hinged upon it there was no signature here either darling and i stared at one another i asked what do you think what should i do wait and if no further episodes are forthcoming then you must go looking yes fear the world was marshaled against us the rust raid would have the taken in a vengeful frenzy it may be the great hope croaker the barrowland darling only the tower itself could be more dangerous perhaps i should accompany you no you will not be risked not under any circumstances the movement can survive the loss of one beatup wornout old physician it cannot without the white rose she hugged me hard backed off signed i am not the white rose croaker she is dead four centuries i am darling our enemies call you the white rose our friends do there is power in a name i waved the letters that is what this is about one name what you have been named you must be i am darling she insisted to me maybe to silent to a few others but to the world you are the white rose the hope and the salvation it occurred to me that a name was missing the name darling wore before she became a ward of the company always she had been darling because that was what raven called her had he known her birthname if so it no longer mattered she was safe she was the last alive to know it if even she remembered the village where we found her mauled by the limpers troops was not the sort that kept written records go she signed study think be of good faith somewhere soon you will find the thread chapter twentytwo the plain of fear the men who fled rust with the cowardly windwhale eventually arrived we learned that the taken had escaped the plain all in a rage because but one carpet survived their offensive would be delayed till the carpets were replaced and carpets are among the greatest and most costly magicks i suspect the limper had to do a lot of explaining to the lady i drafted oneeye goblin and silent into an expanded project i translated they extracted proper names assembled them in charts my quarters became all but impenetrable and barely livable while they were there for goblin and oneeye had had a couple of tastes of life outside darlings null they were at one another constantly and i began having nightmares one evening i posed a challenge half as a result of no further courier arriving half as busy work meant to stop goblin and oneeye from driving me mad i said i may have to leave the plain can you do something so i dont attract any special attention they had their questions i answered most honestly they wanted to go too as if a journey west was established fact i said no way are you going a thousand miles of this crap id commit suicide before we got off the plain or murder one of you which im considering anyway goblin squeaked he pretended mortal terror oneeye said get within ten feet of me and ill turn you into a lizard i made a rude noise you can barely turn food into shit goblin cackled chickens and cows do better you can fertilize with theirs you got no room to talk runt i snapped getting touchy in his old age oneeye observed must be rheumatiz got the rheumatiz croaker hell wish his problem was rheumatism if he keeps on goblin promised its bad enough i have to put up with you but youre at least predictable predictable like the seasons they were off i sped silent a look of appeal the sonofabitch ignored me next day goblin ambled in wearing a smug smile we figured something out croaker in case you do go wandering like what well need your amulets i had two that they had given me long ago one was supposed to warn me of the proximity of the taken it worked quite well the other ostensibly was protective but it also let them locate me from a distance silent tracked it the time catcher sent raven and me to ambush limper and whisper in the forest of cloud when limper tried to go over to the rebel long ago and far away memories of a younger croaker well work up some modifications so you cant be located magically let me have them later well have to go outside to test them i eyed him narrowly he said youll have to come so we can test them by trying to find you yeah sounds like a drummedup excuse to get outside the null maybe he grinned whatever darling liked the notion next evening we headed up the creek skirting old father tree he looks a little peaked i said caught the side wash of a taken spell during the brouhaha oneeye explained i dont think he was pleased the old tree tinkled i stopped considered it it had to be thousands of years old trees grow very slow on the plain what stories it would tell come on croaker goblin called old father aint talking he grinned his frog grin they know me too well know when i see anything old i wonder what it has seen damn them anyhow we left the watercourse five miles from the hole quartered westward into desert where the coral was especially dense and dangerous i guess there were five hundred species in reefs so close they were almost impenetrable the colors were riotous fingers fronds branches of coral soared thirty feet into the air i remain eternally amazed that the wind does not topple them in a small sandy place surrounded by coral oneeye called a halt this is far enough well be safe here i wondered our progress had been followed by manias and the creatures that resemble buzzards never will i trust such beasts completely long long ago after the battle at charm the company crossed the plain en route to assignments in the east i saw horrible things happen i could not shake the memories goblin and oneeye played games but also tended to business they remind me of active children always into something just to be doing i lay back and watched the clouds soon i fell asleep goblin wakened me he returned my amulets were going to play hideandseek he said well give you a head start if weve done everything right we wont be able to find you now thats wonderful i replied me alone out here wandering around lost i was just carping i could find the hole as a nasty practical joke i was tempted to head straight there this was business though i set off to the southwest toward the buttes i crossed the westward trail and went into hiding among quiescent walking trees only after darkness fell did i give up waiting i walked back to the hole wondering what had become of my companions i startled the sentry when i arrived goblin and oneeye come in no i thought they were with you they were concerned i went below asked the lieutenants advice go find them he told me how he looked at me like i was a halfwit leave your silly amulets go outside the null and wait oh okay so i went back outside walked up the creek grumbling my feet ached i was not used to so much hiking good for me i told myself had to be in shape if there was a trip to oar in the cards i reached the edge of the coral reefs oneeye goblin you guys around no answer i was not going on looking though the coral would kill me i circled north assuming they had moved away from the hole each few minutes i dropped to my knees hoping to spot a menhirs silhouette the menhirs would know what had become of them once i saw some flash and fury from the corner of my eye and without thinking ran that way thinking it was goblin and oneeye squabbling but a direct look revealed the distant rage of a change storm i stopped immediately belatedly remembering that only death hurries on the plain by night i was lucky just steps onward the sand became spongy loose i squatted sniffed a handful it held the smell of old death i backed away carefully who knows what lay in waiting beneath that sand better plant somewhere and wait for the sun i muttered i was no longer certain of my position i found some rocks that would break the wind some brush for firewood and pitched camp the fire was more to declare myself to beasts than to keep warm the night was not cold firemaking was a symbolic statement out there once the flames rose i found that the place had been used before smoke had blackened the rocks native humans probably they wander in small bands we have little intercourse with them they have no interest in the world struggle will failed me sometime after the second hour i fell asleep the nightmare found me and found me unshielded by amulets or null she came it had been years last time it was to report the final defeat of her husband in the affair at juniper a golden cloud like dust motes dancing in a sunbeam an allover feeling of being awake while sleeping calmness and fear together an inability to move all the old symptoms a beautiful woman formed in the cloud a woman out of daydream the sort you hope to meet someday knowing there is no chance i cannot say what she wore if she wore anything my universe consisted of her face and the terror its presence inspired her smile was not at all cold long ago for some reason she took an interest in me i supposed she retained some residue of the old affection as one does for a pet long dead physician breeze in the reeds beside the waters of eternity the whisper of angels but never could she make me forget the reality whence the voice sprang nor was she ever so gauche as to tempt me either with promises or herself that perhaps is one reason i think she felt a certain fondness when she used me she gave it to me straight going in i could not respond you are safe long ago by your standard of time i said i would remain in touch i have been unable you cut me off i have been trying for weeks the nightmares explained what i squeaked like goblin join me at charm be my historian as always when she touched me i was baffled she seemed to consider me outside the struggle while yet a part of it on the stair of tear on the eve of the most savage sorcerous struggle ever i witnessed she came to promise me i would come to no harm she seemed intrigued with my lesser role as company historian back when she insisted i record events as they happened without regard to pleasing anyone i had done so within the limits of my prejudices the heat in the crucible is rising physician your white rose is crafty her attack behind the limper was a grand stroke but insignificant on the broader canvas dont you agree how could i argue i did agree as your spies have no doubt reported five armies stand poised to cleanse the plain of fear it is a strange and unpredictable land but it will not withstand what is being marshaled again i could not argue for i believed her i could but do what darling so often spoke of buy time you may be surprised perhaps surprises have been calculated into my plans come out of that cold waste croaker come to the tower become my historian this was as near temptation as ever she had come she spoke to a part of me i do not understand a part almost willing to betray comrades of decades if i went there was so much i would know so many answers illuminated so many curiosities satisfied you escaped us at queens bridge heat climbed my neck during our years on the run the ladys forces had overtaken us several times queens bridge was the worst a hundred brothers had fallen there and to my shame i left the annals behind buried in the river bank four hundred years worth of company history abandoned there was just so much that could be carried away the papers down in the hole were critical to our future i took them instead of the annals but i suffer frequent bouts of guilt i must answer the shades of brethren who have gone before those annals are the black company while they exist the company lives we escaped and escaped and will continue to escape it is fated she smiled amused i have read your annals croaker new and old i began throwing wood onto the embers of my fire i was not dreaming you have them till that moment i had silenced guilt with promises to recover them they were found after the battle they came to me i was pleased you are honest as historians go thank you i try come to charm there is a place for you in the tower you can see the grand canvas from here i cant i cannot shield you there if you stay you must face what befalls your rebel friends the limper commands that campaign i will not interfere he is not what he was you hurt him and he had to be hurt more to be saved he has not forgiven you that croaker i know how many times had she used my name in all our contacts previously over years she had used it but once dont let him take you a slight twisted bit of humor rose from somewhere inside me you are a failure lady she was taken aback fool that i am i recorded my romances in the annals you read them you know i never characterized you as black not i think as i would characterize your husband i suspect an unconsciously sensed truth lies beneath the silliness of those romances indeed i dont think you are black i think youre just trying i think that for all the wickedness youve done part of the child that was remains untainted a spark remains and you cant extinguish it unchallenged i became more daring i think youve selected me as a symbolic sop to that spark i am a reclamation project meant to satisfy a hidden streak of decency the way my friend raven reclaimed a child who became the white rose you read the annals you know to what depths raven sank once he concentrated all decency in one cup better perhaps that he had had none at all juniper might still exist so might he juniper was a boil overdue for lancing i am not come to be mocked physician i will not be made to look weak even before an audience of one i started to protest for i know that this too will end up in your annals she knew me but then she had had me before the eye come to the tower croaker i demand no oath lady even the taken bind themselves with deadly oaths you may remain free just do what you do heal and record the truth what you would do anywhere you have value not to be wasted out there now there was a sentiment with which i could agree wholeheartedly i would take it back and rub some peoples noses in it say what she started to speak i raised a warning hand i had spoken to myself not to her was that a footfall yes something big coming something moving slowly wearily she sensed it too an eye blink and she was gone her departure sucking something from my mind so that once more i was not certain i had not dreamed everything for all that every word remained immutably inscribed on the stone of my mind i shuffled brush onto my fire backed into a crack behind the dagger that was the only weapon id had sense enough to bring it came closer then paused then came on my heartbeat increased something thrust into the firelight toadkiller dog what the hell hey whatre you doing come on in out of the cold boy the words tumbled out bearing fear away boy will tracker be glad to see you what happened to you he came forward cautiously looking twice as mangy as ever he dropped onto his belly rested his chin on forepaws closed one eye i dont have any food im sort of lost myself youre damned lucky know that making it this far the plain is a bad place to be on your own right then that old mongrel looked like he agreed body language if you will he had survived but it had not been easy i told him sun comes up well head back goblin and oneeye got lost its their own tough luck after toadkiller dogs arrival i rested better i guess the old alliance is imprinted on people too i was confident he would warn me if trouble beckoned come morning we found the creek and headed for the hole i stopped as i often do to approach old father tree for a little onesided conversation about what he had seen during his long sentinelship the dog would not come anywhere near weird but so what weird is the order of the day on the plain i found oneeye and goblin snoring sleeping in they had returned to the hole only minutes after my departure in search of them bastards i would redress the balance when the chance came i drove them crazy by not mentioning my night out did it work i demanded down the tunnel tracker was having a noisy reunion with his mutt sort of goblin said he was not enthusiastic sort of whats sort of does it work or doesnt it well what we got is a problem mainly we can keep the taken from locating you from getting a fix on you so to speak obfuscation is a sure sign of trouble with this guy but butt me the but goblin if you go outside the null theres no hiding the fact that you are out great real great what good are you guys anyway its not that bad oneeye said you wouldnt attract any attention unless they find out youre out from some other source i mean they wouldnt be watching for you would they no reason to so its just as good as if we got it to do everything we wanted crap you better start praying that next letter comes through because if i go out and get my ass killed guess whos going to haunt whom forever darling wouldnt send you out bet shell go through three or four days of soulsearching but shell send me because that last letter will give us the key sudden fear had the lady probed my mind whats the matter croaker i was saved a lie by trackers advent he bounced in and pumped my hand like a mad fool thank you croaker thanks for bringing him home out he went what the hell was that goblin asked i brought his dog home weird oneeye chortled the pot calling the kettle black yeah lizard snot want me to tell you about weird stow it i said if i get sent out of here i want this stuff in perfect order i just wish we had people who could read this junk maybe i can help tracker was back the big dumb lout a devil with a sword but probably unable to write his own name how i could read some of that stuff i know some old language my father taught me he grinned as if at a huge joke he selected a piece written in tellekurre he read it aloud the ancient language rolled off his tongue naturally as i had heard it spoken among the old taken then he translated it was a memo to a castle kitchen about a meal to be prepared for visiting notables i went over it painstakingly his translation was faultless better than i could do a third of the words evaded me well welcome to the team ill tell darling i slipped out exchanging a puzzled glance with oneeye behind trackers back stranger and stranger what was this man besides weird at first encounter he reminded me of raven and fit the role when i came to think of him as big slow and clumsy he fit that role was he a reflection of the image in his beholder a good fighter though bless him worth ten of anyone else we have chapter twentythree the plain of fear it was the time of the monthly meeting the big confab during which nothing gets done during which all heads yammer of pet projects on which action cannot be taken after six or eight hours of which darling closes debate by telling us what to do the usual charts were up one showed where our agents believed the taken to be another showed incursions reported by the menhirs both showed a lot of white areas of plain unknown to us a third chart showed the months change storms a pet project of the lieutenants he was looking for something as always most were along the periphery but there was an unusually large number and higher than normal percentage in this charts interior seasonal a genuine shift who knew we had not been watching long enough the menhirs will not bother explaining such trivia darling took charge immediately she signed the operation in rust had the effect i hoped our agents have reported antiimperial outbreaks almost everywhere they have diverted some attention from us but the armies of the taken keep building whisper has become especially aggressive in her incursions imperial troops entered the plain almost every day probing for a response and preparing their men for the plains perils whispers operations as always were very professional militarily she is to be feared far more than the limper limper is a loser that is not his fault entirely but the stigma has attached itself winner or loser though he is running the other side word came this morning that whisper has established a garrison a days march inside the boundary she is erecting fortifications daring our response her strategy was apparent establish a network of mutually supporting fortresses build it slowly until it is spread out over the plain she was dangerous that woman especially if she sold the idea to the limper and got all the armies into the act as a strategy it goes back to the dawn of time having been used again and again where regular armies face partisans in wild country it is a patient strategy that depends on the will of the conqueror to persevere it works where that will exists and fails where it does not here it will work the enemy has twentysome years to root us out and feels no need to hold the plain once done with us us let us say instead darling the rest of us are nothing in the equation if darling falls there is no rebellion they are taking away time darling signed we need decades we have to do something here it comes i thought she had on that look she was going to announce the result of much soulsearching so i was not struck down with astonishment when she signed i am sending croaker to recover the rest of his correspondents story news of the letters had spread darling will gossip goblin and oneeye will accompany and support him what there aint no way croaker i wont do it look at me im a nothing guy whos going to notice me one old guy wandering around the world is full of them but three guys one of them black one of them a runt with goblin and oneeye sped me milkcurdling looks i snickered my outburst put them in a tight place though they wanted to go no more than i wanted them along they now dared not agree with me publicly worse they had to agree with each other ego but my point remained goblin and oneeye are known characters for that matter so am i but as i pointed out im not physically remarkable darling signed danger will encourage their cooperation i fled to my last citadel the lady touched me on the desert that night i was out darling she is watching for me darling thought a moment signed back that changes nothing we must have that last piece of story before the taken close in she was right about that but she signed you three will go be careful tracker followed the debate with ottos help he offered ill go i know the north especially the great forest thats where i got my name behind him toadkiller dog yawned croaker darling asked i was not yet resigned to going so i passed it back to her up to you you could use a fighter she signed tell him you accept i mumbled and muttered faced tracker she says you go he looked pleased as far as darling was concerned that was that the thing was settled they hastened down the agenda to a report from corder suggesting tanner was ripe for a raid like that on rust i fussed and fumed and no one paid me any mind except goblin and oneeye who sent me looks saying i would rue my insults no fooling around we left fourteen hours later with everything arranged for us dragged out of bed soon after midnight i quickly found myself topside beside the coral watching a small windwhale descend a menhir yammered behind me instructing me in the care and stroking of the windwhale ego i ignored him this had come on too swiftly i was being shoved into the saddle before id made up my mind to go i was living behind events i had my weapons my amulets money food everything i should need likewise goblin and oneeye who had provided themselves with a supplementary arsenal of thaumaturgic gewgaws the plan was to purchase a wagon and team after the windwhale dropped us behind enemy lines all the junk they were bringing i grumbled we might need two tracker traveled light though food an array of weapons selected from what we had on hand and his mutt the windwhale rose night enveloped us i felt lost i hadnt gotten so much as a goodbye hug the windwhale went up where the air was chill and thin to the east the south and northwest i spied the glimmer of change storms they were becoming more common i guess i was getting blase about windwhaleriding shivering huddling into myself ignoring tracker who was a positive chatterbox yammering about trivia i fell asleep i wakened to a shaking hand and trackers face inches from mine wake up croaker he kept saying wake up oneeye says we got trouble i rose expecting to find taken circling us we were surrounded but by four windwhales and a score of mantas where did they come from showed up while you were sleeping whats the trouble tracker pointed off what i guess you would call our starboard bow change storm shaping just popped out of nowhere goblin said joining us too nervous to remember he was mad at me looks like a bad one too the rate its growing the change storm was no more than four hundred yards in diameter now but the pasteliightninged fury in its heart said it would grow swiftly and terribly its touch would be more than normally dramatic varicolored light painted faces and windwhales bizarrely our convoy shifted course the windwhales are not as much affected as humans but they prefer to dodge trouble where possible it was clear though that fringes of the monster would brush us even as i recognized and thought about it the storms size increased six hundred yards in diameter eight hundred roiling boiling color within what looked like black smoke serpents of silent lightning snapped and snarled soundlessly around one another the bottom of the change storm touched ground all those lightnings found their voices and the storm expanded even more rapidly hurling in another direction that growth which should have gone earthward it was terrible with energy this one change storms seldom came nearer than eight miles to the hole they are impressive enough from that distance when you catch only a whiff that crackles in your hair and makes your nerves go frazzled in olden times when we still served the lady i talked to veterans of whispers campaigns who told me of suffering through the storms i never wholly credited their tales i did so as the boundary of the storm gained on us one of the manias was caught you could see through it its bones white against sudden darkness then it changed everything changed rocks and trees became protean small things that followed and pestered us shifted form there is a hypothesis which states that the strange species of the plain have appeared as a result of change storms it has been proposed too that the change storms are responsible for the plain itself that each gnaws a bit more off our normal world the whales gave up trying to outrun the storm and plunged earthward below the curve of expanding storm getting down where the fall would be shorter if they changed into something unable to fly standard procedure for anyone caught in a change storm stay low and dont move whispers veterans spoke of lizards growing to elephant size of spiders becoming monstrous of poisonous serpents sprouting wings of intelligent creatures going mad and trying to murder everything about them i was scared not too scared to observe though after the manta showed us its bones it resumed its normal form but grew as did a second when the boundary overtook it did that mean a common tendency toward growth on a storms outward pulse the storm caught our windwhale which was the slowest getting down young it was but conscientious about its burden the crackle in my hair peaked i thought my nerves would betray me completely a glance at tracker convinced me we were going to have a major case of panic goblin or oneeye one decided to be a hero and stay the storm might as well have ordered the sea to turn the crash and roar of a major sorcery vanished in the rage of the storm there was an instant of utter stillness when the boundary reached me then a roar out of hell the winds inside were ferocious i thought of nothing but getting down and hanging on around me gear was flying about changing shape as it flew then i spied goblin and nearly threw up goblin indeed his head had swelled ten times normal size the rest of him looked inside out around him swarmed a horde of the parasites that live on a windwhales back some as big as pigeons tracker and toadkiller dog were worse the mutt had become something half as big as an elephant fanged possessed of the most evil eyes ive ever seen he looked at me with a starved lust that chilled my soul and tracker had become something demonic vaguely apelike yet certainly much more both looked like creatures from an artists or sorcerers nightmares oneeye was the least changed he swelled but remained oneeye perhaps he is wellrooted in the world being so damned old near as i can tell he is pushing a hundred fifty the thing that was toadkiller dog crept toward me with teeth bared the windwhale touched down impact sent everyone tumbling the wind screamed around us the strange lightning hammered earth and air the landing area itself was in a protean mood rocks crawled trees changed shape the animals of that part of the plain were out and gamboling in revised forms onetime prey turning upon predator the horror show was illuminated by a shifting sometimes ghastly light then the vacuum at the heart of the storm enveloped us everything froze in the form it had at the last instant nothing moved tracker and toadkiller dog were down on the ground thrown there after impact oneeye and goblin faced one another in the first phase of letting their feud go beyond its customary gamesmanship the other windwhales lay nearby not visibly affected a manta plunged out of the color above crashed that stasis lasted maybe three minutes in the stillness sanity returned then the change storm began to collapse the devolution of the storm was slower than its growth but saner too we suffered it for several hours and then it was done and our sole casualty was the one manta that had crashed but damn was it ever a shaking experience damn lucky i told the others as we inventoried our possessions lucky we werent all killed no luck to it croaker oneeye replied the moment these monsters saw a storm coming they headed for safe ground a place where there would be nothing that could kill us or them goblin nodded they were doing a lot of agreeing lately but we all recalled how close they had come to murder i asked what did i look like i didnt feel any change except a sort of nervous turmoil like being drunk drugged and halfcrazy all at the same time looked like croaker to me oneeye said only twice as ugly and dull goblin added you made the most inspiring speech about the glories the black company won during the campaign against chew i laughed come on really you were just croaker maybe those amulets are good for something tracker was going over his weaponry toadkiller dog was napping near his feet i pointed oneeye signed didnt see goblin signed he grew up and got claws they did not seem concerned i decided i should not be after all the whale lice were the nastiest thing after the mutt the windwhales remained grounded for the sun was rising their backs assumed the dun color of the earth complete with sagecolored patches and we waited for the night the mantas nested down on the other four whales none came near us you get the feeling humans make them uncomfortable chapter twentyfour the wide world they never tell me anything but i should complain secrecy is our armor need to know all that crap in our outfit it is the iron rule of survival our escort was not along just to help us break out of the plain of fear they had their own mission what i had not been told was that whispers headquarters was to be attacked whisper had no warning our companion windwhales dropped away slowly as the edge of the plain approached their mantas dropped with them they caught favorable winds and pulled ahead we climbed higher into the pure shivers and gasp for breaths the mantas struck first in twos and threes they crossed the town at treelop level loosing their bolts into whispers quarters rock and timbers flew like the dust around slamping hooves fires broke out the monsters of the upper air rolled in behind as soldiers and civilians hit the streets they unleashed bolls of their own but the real horror was their tentacles the windwhales gorged upon men and animals they ripped houses and fortifications apart they yanked trees out by their roots and they pounded away at whisper with their bolls the mantas meantime rose a thousand feet and plunged again in their pairs and threes this time to slrike at whisper as she responded her response though it did set a broad patch of one windwhales flank gruesomely aglow pinpointed her for the mantas they slapped her around good though she did bring one down we passed over the flash and fires illuminating our monsters belly if anyone in the crucible spotted us i doubt they guessed we were going on goblin and oneeye detected no interest in anything but survival it continued as we lost sight of the town goblin said they had whisper on the run too busy saving her own ass to help her men glad they never pulled any of this crap on us i said its a oneshot goblin countered next time theyll be ready id have thought theyd be now because of rust maybe whisper has an ego problem no maybe about it i had dealt with her it was her weak spot she would have made no preparations because she believed we feared her too much she was after all the most brilliant of the taken our mighty steed ploughed the night back brushing the stars body gurgling chugging humming i began to feel optimistic at dawn we dropped into a canyon in the windy country another big desert unlike the plain though it is normal a big emptiness where the wind blows all the time we ate and slept when night fell we resumed our journey we left the desert south of lords turned north over the forest of cloud avoiding settlements beyond the forest of cloud though the windwhale descended and we were on our own i wish we could have gone the whole way airborne but that was as far as darling and the windwhales were willing to risk beyond lay heavily inhabited country we could not hope to come down and pass the daylight hours unseen so from there on we would travel the oldfashioned way the free city of roses was about fifteen miles away roses has been free throughout history a republican plutocracy even the lady did not see fit to buck tradition one huge battle took place nearby during the northern campaigns but the site was of rebel choosing not ours we lost for several months roses lost its independence then the ladys victory at charm ended rebel dominion all in all though unaligned roses is a friend of the lady crafty bitch we hiked our journey was an allday affair neither i nor goblin nor oneeye were in good shape too much loafing getting too old this isnt smart i said as we approached a gate in roses pale red walls toward sunset weve all been here before you two should be wellremembered what with having robbed half the citizens robbed oneeye protested who robbed both of you clowns selling those damned guaranteedtowork amulets when we were after raker raker was a onetime rebel general he had beaten the crap out of the limper farther north then the company with a little help from soulcatcher had sucked him into a trap in roses both goblin and oneeye had preyed on the populace oneeye was an old hand at that back when we were in the south beyond the sea of torments he had been involved in every shady scheme he could find most of his illgotten gains he soon lost at cards he is the worlds worst cardplayer youd think by onefifty he would learn to count them the plan was for us to lay up at some sleazy noquestionsasked inn tracker and i would go out next day and buy a wagon and team then we would head out the way we had come pick up what gear we had been unable to carry and circle the city by heading north that was the plan goblin and oneeye did not stick to it rule number one for a soldier stick to the mission the mission is paramount for goblin and oneeye all rules are made to be broken when tracker and i returned with toadkiller dog loafing along behind it was late afternoon we parked tracker stood by while i went upstairs no goblin no oneeye the proprietor told me they had left soon after i had chattering about finding some women my fault i was in charge i should have foreseen it it had been a long long long time i paid for another two nights just in case then i turned animals and wagon over to the holsters boy had supper with a silent tracker and retreated to our room with several quarts of beer we shared it tracker me and toadkiller dog you going looking for them tracker asked no if they havent come back in two days or pulled the roof in on us well go ahead without them i dont want to be seen around them therell be people here who remember them we got pleasantly buzzed toadkiller dog seemed capable of drinking people under the table loved his beer that dog actually got up and moved around when he didnt have to next morning no goblin no oneeye but plenty of rumors we entered the common room late after the morning crowd and before the noontime rush the hostler had no other ears to bend you guys hear about the ruckus over in the east end last night i groaned before he got to the meat of it i knew yeah regular wahoo war party fires sorcery lynch mob excitement like this old town haint seen since that time they were after that general whatsit the lady wanted after he went to pester another customer i told tracker wed better get out now what about goblin and oneeye they can take care of themselves if they got themselves lynched tough im not going poking around and getting myself a stretched neck too if they got away they know the plan they can catch up i thought the black company didnt leave its dead behind we dont i said it but maintained my determination to let the wizards stew in what juice they had concocted i did not doubt that they had survived they had been in trouble before a thousand times a good hike might have a salutary effect on their feel for mission discipline meal finished i informed the proprietor that tracker and i were departing but that our companions would keep the room then i led a protesting tracker to the wagon put him aboard and when the boy had the hitch ready headed for the western gate it was the long way through tortuous streets over a dozen arched bridges spanning canals but it led away from yesterdays silliness as we went i told tracker how we had tricked raker into a noose he appreciated it that was the companys trademark i concluded get the enemy to do something stupid we were the best when it came to fighting but we only fought when nothing else worked but you were paid to fight things were blackandwhite to tracker sometimes i thought he had spent too much time in the woods we were paid for results if we could do the job without fighting all the better what you do is you study your enemy find a weakness then work on it darling is good at that though working on the taken is easier than you would think theyre all vulnerable through their egos what about the lady i couldnt say she doesnt seem to have a handle a touch of vanity but i dont see how to get hold of it maybe through her drive to dominate by getting her to overextend herself i dont know shes cautious and smart like when she sucked the rebel in at charm killed three birds with one stone not only did she eliminate the rebel she exposed the unreliable among the taken and squashed the dominators attempt to use them to get free what about him he isnt a problem hes probably more vulnerable than the lady though he dont seem to think hes like a bull so damned strong thats all he needs oh a little guile like at juniper but mostly just the hammerstrokes type tracker nodded thoughtfully could be something to what you say chapter twentyfive the barrowland corbie miscalculated he forgot that others beside case were interested in his fate when he failed to show for work various places people came looking for him they pounded on doors tapped on windows and got no response one tried the door it was locked now there was genuine concern some argued for kicking a breakin up the chain of command others for moving now the latter view prevailed they broke the lock and spread out inside they found a place obsessive in its neatness spartan in its furnishings the first man upstairs yelped here he is hes had a stroke or something the pack crowded into the little upstairs room corbie sat at a table on which lay an oilskin packet and a book a book someone said he was weirder than we thought a man touched corbies throat felt a feeble pulse noted that corbie was taking shallow breaths spaced far more widely than those of a man sleeping guess he did have a stroke like he was sitting here reading and it hit him had an uncle went like that someone said when i was a kid telling us a story and just went white and keeled over hes still alive we better do something maybe hell be all right a big rush downstairs men tumbling over men case heard when the group rushed into headquarters he was on duty the news put him in a quandary he had promised corbie but he could not run off sweets personal interest got the news bucked up the ladder fast the colonel came out of his office he noted case looking stricken you heard come along lets have a look you men find the barber find the vet made you reflect on the value of men when the army provided a vet but not a physician the day had begun auspiciously with a clear sky that was rare now it was cloudy a few raindrops fell spotting the wooden walks as case followed sweet and a dozen men followed him he barely noted the colonels remarks about necessary improvements a crowd surrounded corbies place bad news travels fast case said sir doesnt it make a hole here men coming through he paused inside he always this tidy yes sir he was obsessive about order and doing things by the numbers i wondered he stretched the rules a bit with his night walks case gnawed his lip and wondered if he ought to give the colonel corbies message he decided it was not yet time upstairs the colonel asked one of the men who had found corbie yes sir case was up the stairs already he spied corbies oilskin packet without thinking started to slide it inside his jacket son case turned sweet stood in the doorway frowning what are you doing the colonel was the most intimidating figure case could imagine more so than his father who had been a harsh and exacting man he did not know how to respond he stood there shaking the colonel extended a hand case handed the packet over what were you doing son uh sir one day well sweet examined corbie without touching him well out with it he asked me to deliver a letter for him if anything happened to him like he thought his time was running out he said it would be in an oilskin packet on account of the rain and everything sir i see the colonel slipped fingers under corbies chin lifted he returned the packet to the table peeled back one of corbies eyelids the pupil revealed was a pinprick hmm he felt corbies forehead hmm he flicked several reflex points with his finger or fist corbie did not respond curious doesnt look like a stroke what else could it be sir colonel sweet straightened maybe youd know better than i sir you say corbie expected something not exactly he was afraid something would happen talked like he was getting old and his time was running out maybe he had something wrong he never told nobody about maybe ah holts the horse doctor had arrived he followed the course the colonel had straightened shrugged beyond me colonel wed better move him where we can keep an eye on him your job son he told case if he doesnt come out of it soon well have to forcefeed him he poked around the room checked the titles of the dozen or so books a learned man corbie i thought so a study in contrasts ive often wondered what he really was case was nervous for corbie now sir i think that way back he was somebody in one of the jewel cities but his luck turned and he joined the army well talk about it after we move him come along case followed the colonel seemed very thoughtful maybe he should give him corbies message chapter twentysix on the road after three days during which tracker and i returned to our landing place loaded the wagon then headed north on the salient road i began to wonder if i had not erred still no goblin or oneeye i need not have been concerned they caught up near meystrikt a fortress in the salient the company once held on behalf of the lady we were off the road in some woods getting ready for supper we heard a ruckus on the road a voice undeniably goblins shouted and i insist its your fault you maggotlipped excuse for fish bait id turn your brain into pudding for getting me into it if you had one my fault my fault gods he even lies to himself i had to talk him into his own idea look there guano breath meystrikt is around that hill theyll remember us even better than they did in roses now im going to ask you once how do we get through without getting our throats cut after an initial relief i halted my rush toward the road i told tracker theyre riding where do you suppose they got horses i tried finding a bright side maybe they got into a game and got away with cheating if oneeye let goblin do it oneeye is as inept at cheating as at games of chance themselves there are times i think he has a positive death wish you and your damned amulet goblin squeaked the lady cant find him thats great but neither can we my amulet my amulet who the hell gave it to him in the first place who designed the spell thats on it now who cast it tell me that toad face tell me that i moved to the edge of the woods they had passed already tracker joined me even toadkiller dog came to watch freeze rebel i shouted first one moves is dead meat stupid croaker real stupid their response was swift and gaudy it damned near killed me they vanished in shining clouds around tracker and me insects erupted more kinds of bugs than i imagined existed every one interested only in having me for supper toadkiller dog snarled and snapped knock it off you clowns i yelled its me croaker whos croaker oneeye asked goblin you know anybody named croaker yeah but i dont think we ought to stop goblin replied after sticking his head out of the shining to check he deserves it sure oneeye agreed but tracker is innocent i cant finetune it enough to get just croaker the bugs returned to routine bug business eating each other i guess i constrained my anger and greeted oneeye and goblin both of whom had donned expressions of innocence and contrition what you got to say for yourselves guys nice horses think the people they belong to will come looking for them wait up goblin squawked dont go accusing us of i know you guys get down off those animals and come eat well decide what to do with them tomorrow i turned my back on them tracker had returned to our cook fire already he dished up supper i went to work on it my temper still frayed stupid move stealing horses what with the uproar they had caused already the lady has agents everywhere we may not be enemies of the grand sort but we are what she has someone was bound to conclude that the black company was back in the north i fell asleep contemplating turning back the least likely direction for hunters to look would be on the route to the plain of fear but i could not give the order too much depended on us though now my earlier optimism stood in serious jeopardy damned irresponsible clowns way back down the line the captain who perished at juniper must have felt the same we all gave him cause i braced for a golden dream i slept restlessly no dream came next morning i packed goblin and oneeye into the wagon beneath all the clutter we deemed necessary for our expedition abandoned the horses and took the wagon past meystrikt toadkiller dog ran point tracker strolled along beside i drove under the tucker goblin and oneeye sputtered and grumbled the garrison at the fort merely asked where we were bound in such a bored manner i knew they did not care these lands had been tamed since last i passed through this garrison could not conceive of trouble lifting its naughty head relieved i turned up the road that led to elm and oar and to the great forest beyond chapter twentyseven oar dont this weather ever let up oneeye whined for a week we had slogged northward had been victimized by daily showers the roads were bad and promised to get worse practicing my forsbergeron wayside farmers i learned that this weather had been common for years it made getting crops to town difficult and worse left the grains at risk from disease there had been an outbreak of the firedance in oar already a malady traceable to infected rye there were a lot of insects too especially mosquitos the winters though abnormal in snow and rainfall were milder than when we had been stationed here mild winters do not augur well for pest control on the other hand game species were diminished because they could not forage in the deep snows cycles just cycles the oldtimers assured me the bad winters come around after the great comet passes but even they thought this a cycle among cycles todays weather is already the most impressive of all time deal goblin said and he did not mean cards that fortress which the company took from the rebel years ago loomed ahead the road meanders beneath its scowling walls i was troubled as always i was when our path neared an imperial bastion but there was no need this time the lady was so confident of forsberg that the great fortress stood abandoned in fact close up it looked ragged its neighbors were stealing it piece by piece after the custom of peasants the world over i expect that is the only return they get on taxes though they may have to wait generations for the worm to turn oar tomorrow i said as we left the wagon outside an inn a few miles past deal and this time there will be no screwups hear oneeye had the grace to look abashed but goblin was ready to argue keep it up i said ill have tracker thrash you and tie you up we arent playing games life is a game croaker oneeye said you take it too damned serious but he behaved himself both that night and the next day when we entered oar i found a place well outside areas we frequented before it catered to smalltime traders and travelers we drew no especial attention tracker and i kept a watch on goblin and oneeye they did not seem inclined to play the fool again though next day i went looking for a smith named sand tracker accompanied me goblin and oneeye stayed behind constrained by the most terrible threats i could invent sands place was easily found he was a longtime member of his trade wellknown among his peers we followed directions they led me through familiar streets here the company had had some adventures i discussed them with tracker as we walked i noted been a lot of rebuilding since then we tore the place up good toadkiller dog was on point as often he was of late he stopped suddenly looked around suspiciously took a few tentative steps sank onto his belly trouble tracker said what kind there was nothing obvious to the eye i dont know he cant talk hes just doing his watchoutfortrouble act okay dont cost anything to be careful we turned into a place that sold and repaired harness and tack tracker yakked about needing a saddle for a hunter of large beasts i stood in the doorway watching the street i saw nothing unusual the normal run of people went about their normal business but after a while i noted that sands smithy had no custom that no smithery sounds came forth he was supposed to supervise a platoon of apprentices and journeymen hey proprietor whatever happened to the smith over there last time we were here he did us some work place looks empty grey boys is what happened he looked uncomfortable grey boys are imperials the troops in the north wear grey fool didnt learn back when was into the rebellion too bad he was a good smith what leads regular folks to get into politics anyway people like us we got trouble enough just trying to make a living i heard that brother the tackmaker shook his head tell you this you got smithery needs doing take your custom elsewhere the grey boys been hanging around taking anybody who comes around about then an imperial strolled around the side of the smithy and crossed to a pasty stall damned clumsy i said and crude the tackmaker looked at me askance tracker covered well drawing him back to business not as dumb as he appeared i noted maybe just not socially adept later after tracker expressed a desire to think on the deal the tackmaker offered and we departed tracker asked what now we could bring up goblin and oneeye after dark use their sleeping spell go in and see whats to see but it dont seem likely the imperials would leave anything interesting we could find out what they did with sand and try to reach him or we could go on to the barrowland sounds the safest on the other hand we wouldnt know what we were headed into sands being taken could mean anything we better talk it over with the others catalog our resources tracker grunted how long before that sutler gets suspicious the more he thinks about it the more hes going to realize we were interested in the smith maybe im not going to sweat it oar is a city like most of substantial size crowded filled with distractions i understood how goblin and oneeye had been seduced by roses the last major city the company dared visit was chimney six years ago since then it has been all the hard times and small towns you can imagine i battled temptations of my own i knew places of interest in oar tracker kept me on the straight line ive never met a man less interested in the traps which tempt men goblin thought we should put the imperials to sleep give them the question oneeye wanted to get out of town their solidarity had perished like frost in the sun logically i said they would get a stronger guard after dark but if we drag you down there now somebody is sure to recognize you then find that old boy who brought the first letter goblin said good idea but think about it assuming he had perfect luck hed still be a long way from here he didnt catch a ride like we did no go we get out oar is making me nervous too many temptations too many chances to be recognized and just too many people isolation had grown on me out there on the plain goblin wanted to argue he had heard the north roads were terrible i know i countered i also know the army is building a new route to the barrowland and theyve pushed its north end far enough so traders are using it no more argument they wanted out as much as i only tracker now seemed reluctant he who first thought it best to go chapter twentyeight to the barrowland oars weather was less than exciting farther north it became misery curdled though the imperial engineers had done their best to make the forest road usable much of it was corduroy of logs trimmed and tarred and laid side by side in areas where snow became obnoxious there were frameworks to support canvas coverings amazing scope oneeye said uhm there was supposed to be zero concern about the dominator since the ladys triumph at juniper this seemed a lot of effort to keep a road open the new road swung many miles west of the old because the great tragic river had shifted its bed and continued doing so the trip from oar to the barrowland was fifteen miles longer the last fortyfive were not wholly finished we endured some rough going we encountered the occasional trader headed south they all shook their heads and told us we were wasting our time the fortunes to be had had evaporated the tribes had hunted the furbearers to extinction tracker had been preoccupied since we left oar i could not draw out why maybe superstition the barrowland remains a great dread to forsbergs lower classes the dominator is the bogeyman mothers conjure to frighten children though he has been gone four hundred years his stamp remains indelible it took a week to cover the final fortyfive miles i was growing timeconcerned we might not get done and home before winter we were scarcely out of the forest into the clearing at the barrowland i stopped its changed goblin and oneeye crept up behind me yuck goblin squeaked it sure has it seemed almost abandoned a swamp now with only the highest points of the barrowland proper still identifiable when last we visited a horde of imperials was clearing repairing studying with a relentless clatter and bustle near silence reigned that bothered me more than the decayed state of the barrowland slow steady drizzle under deep grey skies cold and no sound the corduroy was completed here we rolled forward not till we entered the town buildings now for the most part paintless and dilapidated did we see a soul a voice called halt and state your business i stopped where are you toadkiller dog more than normally ambitious loped to a derelict structure and sniffed a grumbling guard stepped into the drizzle here oh you startled me name is candle of candle smith smith tailor and sons traders yeah these others smith and tailor inside here thats tracker he works for us were from roses we heard the road north was open again now you know better he chuckled i learned that he was in a good humor because of the weather it was a nice day for the barrowland whats the procedure i asked where do we put up blue willy is the only place theyll be glad for the custom get yourself settled report to headquarters by tomorrow right where is the blue willy he told me i snapped the traces the wagon rolled seem pretty lax i said where are you going to run oneeye countered they know were here theres only one way out we dont play by their book they stick the stopper in the bottle the place did have that feel it also had a feel that went with its weather down depressing smiles were scarce and those mostly commercial the hostler at blue willy didnt ask names just payment up front other traders ignored us though the fur trade traditionally is an oar monopoly next day a few locals came around to examine our goods i had loaded up with what i had heard would sell well but we got few nibbles only the liquor drew any offers i asked how to get in touch with the tribes you wait they come when they come that done i went to guard headquarters it was unchanged though the surrounding compound seemed seedier the first man i encountered was one i remembered he was the one with whom i had to do business candles the name i said of candle smith smith tailor and sons out of roses traders i was told to report here he looked at me oddly like something way back was nagging him he remembered something i did not want him worrying it like a cavity in a tooth he might come up with an answer been some changes since i was here in the army going to the dogs he grumbled the dogs worse every day you think anybody cares were going to rot out here how many in your party four and one dog wrong move he scowled no sense of humor names candle one smith tailor tracker he works for us and toadkiller dog got to call him by his whole name or he gets upset funny man eh hey no offense but this place needs some sunshine yeah can you read i nodded rules are posted over there you got two choices obey them or be dead case a soldier came from a back office yeah sarge new trader go check him out you at blue willy candle yes the list of rules had not changed it was the same paper almost too faded to read basically it said dont mess with the barrowland try it and if it dont kill you we will sir the trooper said when youre ready im ready we returned to blue willy the soldier looked our gear over the only things that intrigued him were my bow and the fact that we were well armed why so many weapons been talk about trouble with the tribesmen must have gotten exaggerated just stealing goblin and oneeye attracted no special attention i was pleased you read the rules stick to them i know them of old i said i was stationed here when i was in the army he looked at me a bit narrowly nodded departed we all sighed goblin took the spell of concealment off the gear he and oneeye had brought the empty corner behind tracker filled with clutter he might come right back i protested we dont want to hold any spell any longer than we have to oneeye said there might be somebody around who could detect it right i cracked the shutters to our one window the hinges shrieked grease i suggested i looked across the town we were on the third floor of the tallest building outside the guard compound i could see the bomanz house guys look at this they looked in damned fine shape eh when last seen it was a candidate for demolition superstitious fear had kept it unused i recalled pottering around in there several times feel like a stroll tracker whatever makes you comfortablei wondered if he had enemies hereid feel better if you were along he strapped on his sword out we went down into the streetif that expanse of mud could be so called the corduroy ran only to the compound with a branch as far as blue willy beyond there were walkways only we pretended to sightsee i told tracker stories about my last visit most cast near the truth i was trying to assume a foreign persona voluble and jolly i wondered if i was wasting my time i saw no one interested in what i might say the bomanz house had been lovingly restored it did not appear to be occupied though or guarded or set up as a monument curious come supper i asked our host he had me pegged as a nostalgic fool already he told us some old boy moved in there about five years ago cripple did scut work for the guard fixed the place up in his spare time what happened to him while back couple four months i guess he had a stroke or something they found him still alive but like a vegetable they took him over to the compound far as i know hes still there feeding him like a baby that kid that was here to inspect you is the one to ask him and corbie was friends corbie eh thanks another pitcher come on croaker oneeye said in a low voice lay off the beer the guy makes it himself its terrible he was right but i was getting adjusted for some heavy thinking we had to get into that house that meant night moves and wizards skills it also meant our greatest risks since goblin and oneeye went silly in roses oneeye asked goblin think were up against a haunt goblin sucked his lip have to look whats this i asked id have to see the man to know for sure croaker but what happened to that corbie dont sound like a stroke goblin nodded sounds like somebody pulled out of body and caught maybe we can arrange to see him what about the house first thing is to make sure there isnt a bigtime haunt like maybe bomanzs ghost that kind of talk makes me nervous i do not believe in ghosts or do not want to if he was caught out or pulled out you have to wonder how and why the fact that thats where bomanz lived has to be considered something left over from his time could have gotten this corbie could be what gets us if were not careful complications i grumbled always the complications goblin snickered you watch yourself i said or i just might sell you to the highest bidder an hour later a savage storm arrived it howled and hammered at the inn the roof leaked under the downpour when i reported that our host blew up though not at me evidently making repairs was not easy under current conditions yet repairs had to be made lest a place deteriorate entirely the damned winter firewood is the worst he complained cant leave it set out either gets buried under snow or so damned waterlogged you cant dry it out in a month this place will be loaded ceiling to floor at least filling the place up makes it less hard to heat along about midnight after the guard had changed watches and the oncoming had had time to grow bored and sleepy we slipped out goblin made sure everyone inside the inn was asleep toadkiller dog trotted ahead seeking witnesses he found only one goblin took care of him too on a night like that nobody was out i wished i was not make sure nobody can see any light i said after we slipped inside at a guess id say we start upstairs at a guess oneeye countered id say we find out if there are any haunts or booby traps first i glanced at the door i hadnt thought about that before pushing through chapter twentynine the barrowland back when the colonel summoned case he shook as he stood before sweets desk there are questions to be answered lad sweet said start by telling me what you know about corbie case swallowed yes sir he told and told much more when sweet insisted on rehashing every word that had passed between them he told everything but the part about the message and the oilskin curious sweet said very is that all case shifted nervously whats this about sir lets say what we found in the oilskin was interesting sir it appeared to be a long letter though no one could read it it was in a language nobody knows it could be the language of the jewel cities what i want to know is who was supposed to get it was it unique or part of a series our friend is in trouble lad if he recovers hes in hot water deep real bums dont write long letters to anybody well sir like i said he was trying to track down his kids and he may have come from opal i know there is circumstantial evidence on his side maybe he can satisfy me when he comes around on the other hand this being the barrowland anything remarkable becomes suspicious question son and you must answer satisfactorily or youre in hot water too why did you try to hide the packet the crux the moment from which there was no escape he had prayed it would not arrive now facing it case knew his loyalty to corbie was unequal to the test he asked me if if anything happened to him i would get a letter delivered to oar a letter in oilskin he did expect trouble then i dont know i dont know what was in the letter or why he wanted it delivered he just gave me a name and then he said to tell you something after the letter was delivered ah i dont remember his exact words he said to tell you the thing in the great barrow isnt asleep anymore sweet came out of his seat as though stung he did and how did he know never mind the name now who was the packet to go to a smith in oar named sand thats all i know sir i swear right sweet seemed distracted back to your duties lad tell major klief i want him yes sir next morning case watched major klief and a detail ride out under orders to arrest sand smith he felt terribly guilty and yet just how had he betrayed anyone he might have been betrayed himself if corbie was a spy he assuaged his guilt by tending corbie with religious devotion keeping him clean and fed chapter thirty a barrowland night it took goblin and oneeye only minutes to examine the house no traps oneeye announced no ghost either some old resonances of sorcery overlaid by more recent ones upstairs i produced a scrap of paper upon it were my notes from the bomanz letters we went upstairs confident though they were goblin and oneeye let me go first some friends i checked to make certain the window was shuttered before permitting a light then do your stuff ill poke around tracker and toadkiller dog remained in the doorway it was not a big room i examined book titles before starting a serious search the man had had eclectic tastes or had collected what was cheapest perhaps i found no papers the place did not look ransacked oneeye can you tell if this place was searched probably not why the papers arent here you looked where he hid stuff like he said all but one a spear stood in a corner sure enough when i twisted it its head came off and revealed a hollow shaft out came the map mentioned in the story we spread it on the table chills crept up my back this was real history this chart had shaped todays world despite my limited grasp of tellekurre and my even more feeble knowledge of wizardly symbols i felt the power mapped there for me at least it radiated something that left me teetering on the boundary between discomfort and true dread goblin and oneeye did not feel it or were too intrigued they put their heads together and examined the route bomanz used to reach the lady thirtyseven years of work i said what it took him thirtyseven years to accumulate that information i noticed something whats this it was something that should not have been there as i recalled the story i see our correspondent added notes of his own oneeye looked at me then he looked at the chart then he looked at me again then he bent to examine the route on the map that has to be it no other answer what i know what happened tracker stirred uncomfortably well he tried to go in there the only way you can and couldnt get out he had written me saying there was something he had to do that the risks were great was oneeye right brave man no papers unless they were hidden better than i thought i would have goblin and oneeye search i made them reroll the chart and return it to the spear shaft then said im open to suggestions about what goblin squeaked about how to get this guy away from the eternal guard and how we get his soul back inside him so we can ask him questions like that they did not look enthused oneeye said somebody will have to go in there to see whats wrong then spring him and guide him out i see too well we had to lay hands on the living body before doing that look this place over see what you can find thats hidden it took them half an hour i became a nervous wreck too much time too much time i kept saying they ignored me the search produced one scrap of paper very old which contained a cipher key it was folded into one of the books not really hidden i tucked it away it might be used on the papers back at the hole we got out we got back to blue willy without being detected we all heaved sighs of relief once we reached our room what now goblin asked sleep on it tomorrow is soon enough to start worrying i was wrong of course i was worrying already with each step forward it became more complicated chapter thirtyone night in the barrowland the thunder and lightning continued to strut about the sound and flash penetrated the walls as though they were paper i slept restlessly my nerves frazzled more than they should be the others were dead to the world why couldnt i be it started as a pinprick in a corner a mote of golden light the mote multiplied i wanted to lunge across and hammer on goblin or oneeye calling them liars the amulet was supposed to keep me invisible faintest most ghostly of whispers like the cry of a ghost down a long cold cavern physician where are you i did not respond i wanted to pull my blanket over my head but could not move she remained diffuse wavering uncertain maybe she did have trouble spotting me when her face did assume substance momentarily she did not look my way her eyes seemed blind you have gone from the plain of fear she called in that faraway voice you are in the north somewhere you left a broad trail you are foolish my friend i will find you dont you know that you cannot hide even an emptiness can be seen she had no idea where i was i did the right thing by not responding she wanted me to betray myself my patience is not unlimited croaker but you may come to the tower still make it soon though your white rose does not have long i finally managed to pull my blanket to my chin what a sight i must have made amusing in retrospect like a little boy afraid of ghosts the glow slowly faded with it went the nervousness that had plagued me since returning from the bomanz house as i settled down i glanced at toadkiller dog i caught lightning glinting off a single open eye so for the first time there was a witness to one of the visitations but a mutt i dont think anybody believed me about them ever except that what i reported always panned out true i slept goblin wakened me breakfast we ate we made a show of looking for markets for our goods of seeking a longer term connection for future loads business was not good except our host offered to purchase distilled spirits regularly there was a demand among the eternal guard the soldiers had little to do but drink lunch and while we ate and prepared our thoughts for the headbutting session to follow soldiers entered the inn they asked the landlord if any of his guests had been out last night good old landlord denied the possibility he claimed he was the lightest of sleepers he knew if anyone came or went that was good enough for the soldiers they left what was that i asked when next the proprietor passed our way somebody broke into corbies house last night he said then his eyes narrowed he remembered other questions my mistake curious i said why would anyone do that yes why he went about his business but remained thoughtful i too was thoughtful how had they detected our visit we were careful to leave no traces goblin and oneeye were disturbed too only tracker did not seem bothered his lone discomfort was being there near the barrowland what can we do i asked were surrounded and outnumbered and maybe now were suspect how do we lay hands on this corbie thats no problem oneeye said the real trouble is getting away after we do if we could call in a windwhale just in time tell me how its not so hard the middle of the night we go over to the guard compound use the sleep spell get our man and his papers call his spirit back and get him out but then what eh croaker then what where do we run i mused and how there is one answer tracker said the forest the guard couldnt find us in the forest if we could cross the great tragic wed be safe they dont have the manpower for a hunt i nibbled the edge of a fingernail something to what tracker said i assumed he knew the woodlands and tribes well enough for us to survive with the burden of an injured man but jumping past that only led to other problems there were still a thousand miles to cross to reach the plain of fear with the empire alert wait here i told everybody and left i hurried to the imperial compound entered the office i had visited before shook myself dry examined a map on the wall the kid who had checked us for contraband came over help you somehow i dont think so just wanted to check the map it pretty accurate not anymore the river has shifted more than a mile this way and most of the flood plain isnt covered with woods anymore all washed away hmm i laid fingers on making estimates what do you want to know that for business i lied heard we might be able to contact one of the bigger tribes around a place called eagle rocks thats fortyfive miles you wouldnt make it theyd kill you and take what you had the only reason they dont bother the guard and the road is that those have the ladys protection if this coming winter is as bad as the last few that wont stop them either uhm well it was an idea you the one called case yes his eyes narrowed suspiciously heard you been taking care of some guy i let it drop his reaction was not what i expected well thats what theyre saying around town thanks for the advice i got out but i feared i had goofed i soon knew i had goofed a squad commanded by a major showed up at the inn only minutes after my return they had the bunch of us under arrest before we knew what was happening goblin and oneeye barely had time to cast spells of concealment on their gear we played ignorant we cursed and grumbled and whined it did us no good our captors knew less about why we were being grabbed than we did just following orders the landlord had a look which made me certain he had reported us as suspicious i expect case said something about my visit that tipped a balance somewhere whatever we were on our way to cells ten minutes after the door clanged shut the very commander of the eternal guard turned up i sighed in relief he hadnt been here before at least he was no one we knew he shouldnt know us we had had time to rehearse using the deaf speech all but tracker but tracker seemed lost within himself they had not allowed his mutt to accompany him he had been angry about that scared the crap out of the guys who arrested us for a minute they thought they would have to fight him the commander studied us then introduced himself im colonel sweet i command the eternal guard case hovered behind him anxious i asked you men here because aspects of your behavior have been unusual have we unwittingly broken a rule not publicly posted i asked not at all not at all the matter is entirely circumstantial what you might call a question of undeclared intent youve lost me sir he began pacing up and down the passageway outside our cell up and down there is the old saw about actions speaking louder than words ive had reports on you from several sources about your excessive curiosity about matters not connected with your business i did my best to appear baffled whats unusual about asking questions in new country my associates havent been here before its been years since i was things have changed anyway this is one of the most interesting places in the empire also one of the most dangerous trader candle is it mr candle you were stationed here in service what unit that i could answer without hesitation drake crest colonel lot second battalion i was here after all yes the roses mercenary brigade what was the colonels favorite drink oh boy i was a pikeman colonel i didnt drink with the brigadier right he paced i could not tell if that answer worked or not drake crest hadnt been a flashy storied outfit like the black company who the hell would remember anything about them after a time you must understand my position with that thing buried out there paranoia becomes an occupational hazard he pointed in the direction the great barrow must lie then he stalked off what the hell was all that goblin asked i dont know and im not sure i want to find out somehow we got ourselves into big trouble that for the benefit of eavesdroppers goblin accepted his cue damnit candle i told you we shouldnt come up here i told you the oar people would have an arrangement with the guard oneeye jumped in then they really ragged me meantime we talked it over with the finger speech decided to wait the colonel out not much choice anyway without tipping our hands chapter thirtytwo imprisoned in the barrowland it was bad far worse than we suspected those guard guys were paranoid plus i mean they didnt have an inkling who we were but they did not let that slow them half a platoon showed up suddenly rattle and clang at the door no talk grim faces we had trouble i dont think theyre going to turn us loose goblin said out a sergeant told us we went out all but tracker tracker just sat there i tried a funny he misses his dog nobody laughed one of the guards punched trackers arm tracker took a long time turning looking at the man his face an emotional blank you shouldnt ought to have done that i said shut up the sergeant snapped get him moving the man who had punched tracker went to hit him again it might have been a love tap in slowed motion tracker reached around the moving fist caught the advancing wrist broke it the guardsman shrieked tracker tossed him aside his face remained a blank his gaze followed the man belatedly he seemed to begin wondering what was happening the other guards gaped then a couple jumped in with bared weapons hey take it easy i yelled tracker still in that sort of mental nowhere tracker took their weapons away tossed them into a comer and beat the crap out of both men the sergeant was torn between awe and outrage i tried to mollify him hes not very bright you cant come at him like that you have to explain things slow like two or three times ill explain he started to send the rest of his men into the cell you get him mad youre going to get somebody killed i talked fast and wondered what the hell it was with tracker and his damned pooch that mutt went away tracker became a moron with homicidal tendencies the sergeant let sense override anger you get him under control i worked on it i knew the immediate future boded no good from the attitude of the soldiers but was not overly worried goblin and oneeye could handle whatever trouble developed the thing to do now was keep our heads and lives i wanted to tend the three injured soldiers but dared not just looking at oneeye and goblin would give clues enough for the other side to figure out eventually who we were no sense giving them more i concentrated on tracker once i got him to focus on me it was no great task to get through to calm him down to explain that we were going somewhere with the soldiers he said they shouldnt ought to do me like that croaker he sounded like a child whose feelings had been hurt i grimaced but the guards did not react to the name they surrounded us all with hands upon weapons except those trying to get their injured companions to the horse doctor who served as the guards physician some of them were itching to get even i worked hard to keep tracker calm the place they took us did not encourage me it was a sodden cellar beneath the headquarters it looked like a caricature of a torture chamber i suspect it was meant to intimidate having seen real torture and real torture implements i recognized half the equipment as prop or unusually antiquated but there were some serviceable implements too i exchanged glances with goblin and oneeye tracker said i dont like it here i want to go outside i want to see toadkiller dog stand easy well be out in a little while goblin grinned his famous grin though it was a little lopsided yes we would be out soon maybe feet first but out colonel sweet was there he did not seem pleased by our reaction to his stage he said i want to talk to you men you didnt seem eager to chat earlier are these surroundings more amenable not exactly they make one wonder though is this the penalty for stepping on the heels of the gentlemen traders of oar i didnt realize they had the blessing of the guard in their monopoly games no games mr candle straight answers now or my men will make your next few hours extremely unpleasant ask but i have a bad feeling i dont have the answers you want to hear then that will be your misfortune i glanced at goblin he had gone into a sort of trance the colonel said i do not believe you when you say youre just traders the pattern of your questions indicate an inordinate interest in a man named corbie and his house corbie let it be noted is suspected of being either a rebel agent or resurrectionist tell me about him i did almost completely and truthfully i never heard of him before we got here i think he believed me but he shook his head slowly you see you wont believe me even when you know im telling the truth but how much are you telling that is the question the white rose compartments its organization you could have had no idea who corbie was and still have come looking for him has he been out of touch for a while this sucker was sharp my face must have been too studiedly blank he nodded to himself scanned the four of us zeroed in on oneeye the black man pretty old isnt he i was surprised he did not make more of oneeyes skin color black men are extremely rare north of the sea of torments chances are the colonel had not seen one before that a black man very old is one of the cornerstones of the black company is not exactly a secret i did not answer well start with him he looks least likely to stand up tracker asked you want me to kill them croaker i want you to keep your mouth shut and stand still thats what i want damn but sweet missed the name either that or i was less famous than i thought and overdue for ego deflation sweet did seem amazed that tracker was so confident take him to the rack he indicated oneeye oneeye chuckled and extended his hands to the men who approached him goblin snickered their amusement disturbed everyone me not least for i knew their senses of humor sweet looked me in the eye they find this amusing why if you dont indulge a sudden whim of civilized behavior youre going to find out he was tempted to back down but decided we were running some colossal bluff they took oneeye to the rack he grinned and climbed up himself goblin squeaked i been waiting to see you on one of those things for thirty years damned my luck if somebody else doesnt get to turn the crank when the chance finally comes well see who turns that crank on who horse apple oneeye replied they bantered back and forth tracker and i stood like posts the imperials became ever more disturbed sweet obviously wondered if he shouldnt take oneeye down and work on me they strapped oneeye down goblin cackled danced a little jig stretch him till hes ten feet tall guys he said youll still have a mental midget somebody swung a backhand goblins way he leaned only slightly when the man pulled his hand back having missed entirely and been only lightly brushed by a warding hand he looked at his own paw in astonishment ten thousand pinpricks of blood had appeared they formed a pattern almost a tattoo and that tattoo showed two serpents intertwined each with its fangs buried in the others neck if necks are what snakes have behind their heads a distraction i recognized it of course after the first moment i concentrated on oneeye he just grinned the men who were to stretch him turned back after a moment whipped by their colonels snarl sweet was damned uncomfortable now he had a suspicion he faced something extraordinary but he refused to be intimidated as the torturers stepped up to oneeye his naked belly heaved and a big nasty spider crawled out of his navel it came out in a ball dragging itself with two legs then unwrapped the others from around a body half the size of my thumb it stepped aside and another crawled forth the first ambled down oneeyes leg toward the man who held the crank to which oneeyes ankles were strapped the fellows eyes just kept getting bigger he turned to his commanding officer absolute silence filled the cellar i dont think the imperials even remembered to breathe another spider crawled out of oneeyes heaving belly and another and he seemed diminished just a bit more each time his faced changed slowly shifting toward what a spiders face looks like if you look real close most people do not have the nerve goblin giggled turn the crank sweet roared the man at oneeyes feet tried the first spider scuttled up the lever onto his hand he shrieked flung his hand around hurled the arachnid into the shadows colonel i said in as businesslike a voice as i could muster this has gone far enough lets not get someone hurt there was a whole mob of them and four of us and sweet wanted badly to rely on that but already several men were edging toward the exit most were edging away from us everyone stared at sweet damned goblin had to let his enthusiasm get away he squeaked hold on croaker this is a onceinalifetime chance let them stretch oneeye a little i saw the light dawn behind sweets eyes though he tried to conceal it damn you goblin now youve done it were going to have a talk after this is over colonel what will it be i have the edge here as you now know he elected for the better part of valor release him he told the man nearest oneeye there were spiders all over oneeye he had them popping out of his mouth and ears now getting enthusiastic he had them turning up as gaudy as you can imagine hunters webspinners jumpers all big and revolting sweets men refused to go near him i told tracker go stand in the doorway dont let anybody out he had no trouble understanding that i released oneeye i had to keep reminding myself the arachnids were illusions some illusions i felt the little creepies belatedly i realized oneeyes legions were marching on goblin damn it oneeye grow up the sonofabitch wasnt satisfied to bluff the imperials he had to play games with goblin too i wheeled on goblin if you do one damned thing to get involved in this ill see you never leave the hole again colonel sweet i cant say ive enjoyed your hospitality if you and your men will come over here well just be on our way reluctantly sweet gestured half of his men refused to move toward the spiders oneeye game time is over its getoutalive time would you mind oneeye gestured his eightlegged troops rushed into the shadows behind the rack where they vanished into that mad oblivion from which such things spring oneeye strutted over to stand by tracker he was cocky now for weeks we would hear about how he had saved us if we lived to get away tonight i shooed goblin over then joined them myself i told goblin and oneeye i want no sound to escape this room and i want that door sealed like it was part of the wall then i want to know where we find this character corbie you got it oneeye said eye twinkling he added so long colonel it was fun sweet forebore making threats sensible man fixing the room took the wizards ten minutes which i found inordinately long i became mildly suspicious but forgot that notion when they said they were done and that the man we wanted was in another building nearby i should have harkened to my suspicions five minutes later we stood in the doorway of the building where corbie was supposed to be we had encountered no difficulty getting there one second croaker oneeye said he faced the building we had vacated snapped his fingers the whole damned place fell in you bastard i whispered what did you do that for now theres nobody who knows who we are whose fault was it they did know chopped off the head of the snake too be so much confusion we could walk off with the ladys jewelry if we wanted yeah there would be those who knew we were brought in they would wonder some if they saw us wandering around tell me o genius did you locate the documents i want before you tumbled the place down jf theyre in there youre the gent whos going to dig them out his face dropped yes i expected that because that is my kind of luck and that is the way oneeye is he never thinks things through well worry about corbie first i said inside as we pushed through the door we encountered case coming to investigate the uproar chapter thirtythree missing man hi fellow oneeye said punching a finger into the soldiers chest pushing him backyeah its your old pals behind me tracker stared across the compound the collapse of the headquarters building was complete fire snapped and crackled inside toadkiller dog loped around the end of the ruin look at that i punched goblins arm hes running i faced case show us your friend corbie he did not want to do that you dont want to argue were not in the mood move it or we walk over you the compound had begun to fill with yammering soldiers none noticed us toadkiller dog loped up sniffed trackers calves made a sound deep in his throat trackers face gleamed we pushed in behind case to corbie i reminded him he led us to a room where a single oil lamp illuminated a man on a bed neatly blanketed case turned the lamp up oh holy shit i murmured i plopped my butt on the edge of the bed it aint possible oneeye but oneeye was in another universe he just stood there with his mouth open like goblin finally goblin squeaked but hes dead he died six years ago corbie was the raven who played such a grand part in the company past the raven who had set darling on her present course even i had been convinced he was dead and i was by nature suspicious of raven he had tried the same stunt before nine lives oneeye remarked should have suspected when we heard the name corbie i said what its a joke his kind corbie crow rook raven all pretty much the same thing right he waved it under our noses seeing him there illuminated mysteries that had plagued me for years now i knew why papers i had salvaged would not come together he had removed the key pieces before faking his last death even darling didnt know this time i mused the shock had begun to wear off i found myself reflecting that on several occasions after the letters began arriving i had skirted the suspicion that he was alive a raft of questions rose darling not knowing why not that did not seem like raven but more why abandon her to our mercy as he had when for so long he had tried to keep her away there was more here than met the eye more than raven just running off so he could poke into doings at the barrowland unfortunately i could question neither of my witnesses how long has he been this way oneeye asked case the soldiers eyes were wide he knew who we were now maybe my ego did not need deflating after all months there was a letter i said there were papers what became of them the colonel and what did the colonel do did he inform the taken did he contact the lady the trooper was about to get stubborn youre in trouble here kid we dont want to hurt you you did right by our friend speak up he didnt that i know of he couldnt read any of that stuff he was waiting for corbie to wake up he would have waited a long time oneeye said give us some room croaker first order of business is going to be finding raven there anyone else in this building this time of night i asked case not unless the bakers come in for flour but its stored in the cellars down to the other end they wouldnt come around here right i wondered how much his information could be trusted tracker you and toadkiller dog go stand lookout one problem oneeye said before we do anything we need bomanzs map oh boy i slipped into the hallway to the exit peeped out the headquarters building was afire sputtering halfheartedly in the rain most of the guard were fighting the fire i shuddered our documents were in there if the ladys luck held they would burn i returned to the room oneeye you have a more immediate problem my documents you better get after them ill try for the chart tracker you watch the door here keep the kid in and everybody else out all right he nodded he needed no special coaching while toadkiller dog was around i slipped out into the confusion no one paid me any heed i wondered if this was not the time to take raven out i exited the compound unchallenged dashed through the drizzle to blue willy the proprietor seemed astounded to see me i did not pause to tell him what i thought of his hospitality just went upstairs groped around inside the concealment spell till i found the spear with the hollow shaft back down one vituperous look for the landlord then into the rain again by the time i returned the fire was under control soldiers had begun to pull the rubble apart still no one challenged me i slipped into the building where raven lay handed oneeye the spear you do anything about those papers not yet damn it theyre in a box in the colonels office croaker what the hell do you want ah tracker take the kid into the hallway you guys i want a spell where he has to do what hes told whether he wants to or not what oneeye asked i want to send him after those papers can you fix it so hes got to do it and come back case was in the doorway listening bleakly sure no problem do it son you understand oneeye will put a spell on you you go help clean up that mess till you can get the box bring it back and well take the spell off he looked like getting stubborn again you have a choice of course you can die an unpleasant death instead i dont think he believes you croaker id better give him a taste cases expression told me he did believe the more he thought about who we were the more terrified he became how had we developed such a fierce reputation i guess stories grow in the retelling i think hell cooperate right son he nodded stubbornness dead he looked like a good kid too bad he had given his loyalty to the other side do it oneeye lets get on with this while oneeye worked goblin asked what do we do after we finish here croaker hell i dont know play it by ear right now dont worry about the mules just load the wagon step at a time step at a time ready oneeye said i beckoned the youth opened the outside door get out there and do it kid i patted his behind he went but with a look that could have curdled milk hes not happy with you croaker screw it get in there with raven do what you have to do time is wasting come daylight this place will see some life i watched case tracker guarded the door to the room no one interrupted us case eventually found what i wanted slipped away from the work detail good job son i told him taking the box in the room with your friend we entered moments before oneeye came out of a trance well i asked he took a moment to orient himself going to be harder than i thought but i think we can bring him out he indicated the chart goblin had spread atop ravens stomach hes about here caught just inside the inner circle he shook his head you ever hear him tell about having any background in the trade no but there were times i wondered like in roses when he tracked raker through a snowstorm he learned something somewhere werent no parlor trick what he did but it was too big for his skills for a moment he was thoughtful its weird in there croaker really weird he isnt alone by a long shot wont be able to give you any details till we go in ourselves but what wait go in yourselves whatre you talking about figured you understood goblin and i would have to follow him in in order to bring him out why both of you one to cover in case the point man gets in trouble goblin nodded they were all business now meaning they were scared crapless how long is all this going to take no telling quite a while we ought to get out of here first out in the woods i wanted to argue but did not instead i went and checked the compound they had begun bringing the bodies out of the rubble i watched a while got an idea five minutes later case and i stepped out carrying a litter a blanket covered what appeared to be a large broken body goblins face lay exposed he did a great corpse oneeyes feet stuck out the other end tracker carried raven the documents were under the blanket with goblin and oneeye i did not expect to pull it off but the grim business around the collapsed building preoccupied the guard they had reached the cellars i did get challenged at the compound gate goblin used his sleep spell i doubted we would be remembered civilians were all over helping and hindering the rescue effort that was the bad news a few down in that cellar were still alive goblin you and oneeye get our gear take the kid tracker and i will get the wagon all went well too well i thought being naturally pessimistic after the way things had been going we put raven in the wagon and headed south the moment we entered the forest oneeye said so weve made our getaway now about raven i was without a single idea you call it how close do you have to be very he saw i was thinking about getting out of the country first darling the reminder was unnecessary i wont say raven was the center of her life she will not discuss him except in the most general way but there are nights she cries herself to sleep remembering something if it is for loss of raven we could not bring him home like this it would break her heart all the way anyway we needed him now he knew better than we what the hell was going on i appealed to tracker for suggestions he had none he did not in fact appear pleased with what we planned like he expected raven to become competition or something weve got him oneeye said indicating case whom we had dragged along rather than leave dead lets use him good idea twenty minutes later we had the wagon well off the road up on rocks so it would not sink into the soggy earth oneeye and goblin wound spells of concealment around it and camouflaged it with brush we piled gear into packs placed raven on the litter case and i carried him tracker and toadkiller dog led us through the woods it could not have been more than three miles yet i ached everywhere before we finished too old too out of shape and the weather was onehundredninetyproof misery i had had enough rain to last me the rest of my life tracker led us to a place just east of the barrowland i could walk downhill a hundred yards and see its remnants i could walk a hundred yards the other way and see the great tragic only the one narrow stretch of high ground barred it from reaching the barrowland we got tents up and boughs inside so we did not have to sit on wet earth goblin and oneeye took the smaller tent the rest of us crowded into the other once reasonably free of the rain i settled down to probe the rescued documents first to catch my eye was an oilskin packet case this the letter raven wanted you to deliver he nodded sullenly he was not talking poor boy he believed he was guilty of treason i hoped he wouldnt get a case of the heroics well might as well keep busy while goblin and oneeye did their job start with the easy part first chapter thirtyfour bomanzs story croaker bomanz faced the lady from another angle he saw a ghost of fear touch her matchless features ardath he said and saw her fear become resignation ardath was my sister you had a twin you murdered her and took her name your true name is ardath you will regret this i will find your name why do you threaten me i mean you no harm you harm me by thwarting me free me come come dont be childish why force my hand that will cost us both agony and energy i only want to rediscover the knowledge interred with you teaching me will cost you nothing it wont harm you it might even prepare the world for your return the world prepares already bomanz he chuckled thats a mask like the antiquarian thats not my name ardath must we fight wise men say to accept the inevitable with grace if i must i must i will try to be gracious when pigs fly bomanz thought the ladys smile was mocking she sent something he did not catch it other voices filled his mind for an instant he thought the dominator was awakening but the voices were in his physical ears back at the house oh damn windchimes mirth clete is in position the voice was tokars its presence in the attic enraged bomanz he started running help me get him out of the chair stancil wont you wake him up glory his spirit is out in the barrowland he wont know anything unless we run into each other out there wrong bomanz thought wrong you insidious ungrateful wart your old man isnt stupid he responds to the signs even when he doesnt want to see them the dragons head swung as he hurtled past mockery pursued him the hatred of dead knights pounded him as he hurried on get him into the corner toker the amulet is under the hearthstone in the shack that damned men fu he almost blew it i want to get my hands on the fool who sent him up here that greedy idiot wasnt interested in anything but himself at least he took the monitor with him glory pure accident pure luck the time the time tokar said cletes men are hitting the barracks get out of here then glory will you do something besides stare at the old man ive got to get in there before tokar reaches the barrowland the great ones have to be told what were doing bomanz passed the barrow of moondog he felt the restlessness within he raced on a ghost danced beside him a slumpshouldered evilfaced ghost who damned him a thousand times i dont have time for it besand but you were right he crossed the old moat passed his dig strangers dotted the landscape resurrectionist strangers where had they come from out of hiding in the old forest faster got to go faster he thought that fool stance is going to try to follow me in he ran like nightmare floating through subjectively eternal steps the comet glared down it felt strong enough to cast shadows read the instructions again to make sure stancil said timing isnt critical as long as you dont do anything early shouldnt we tie him up or something just in case we dont have time dont worry about him he wont come out till way too late he makes me nervous then throw a rug over him and come on and try to keep your voice down you dont want to waken mother bomanz charged the lights of the town it occurred to him that in this state he did not have to be a stubbylegged fat man short on breath he changed his perception and his velocity increased soon he encountered tokar who was trotting toward the barrowiand with besands amulet bomanz judged his own startling swiftness by tokars apparent sluggishness he was moving fast headquarters was afire there was heavy fighting around the barracks tokars teamsters were leading the attackers a few guardsmen had broken out of the trap trouble was seeping into the town bomanz reached his shop upstairs stancil told glory begin now as bo started up the stair stancil said dumni um muji dumni bomanz smashed into his own body he seized command of his muscles surged off the floor glory shrieked bomanz hurled her toward a wall her career shattered priceless antiques bomanz squealed in agony as all the pains of an old body hit his consciousness damn his ulcer was tearing his gut apart he seized his sons throat as he turned silencing him before he finished the cantrip stancil was younger stronger he rose and glory threw herself at bomanz bomanz darted backward dont anybody move he snapped stancil rubbed his throat and croaked something you dont think i would try me i dont care who you are youre not going to free that thing out there how did you know stancil croaked youve been acting strange you have strange friends i hoped i was wrong but i dont take chances you should have remembered that stancil drew a knife his eyes hardened im sorry pop some things are more important than people bomanzs temples throbbed behave yourself i dont have time for this i have to stop tokar glory drew a knife of her own she sidled a step closer youre trying my patience son the girl jumped bomanz uttered a word of power she plunged headlong into the table slid to the floor almost inhumanly limp in seconds she was limper still she mewled like an injured kitten stancil dropped to one knee im sorry glory im sorry bomanz ignored his own emotional agony he salvaged the quicksilver spilled from the bowl that had been atop the table mouthed words which transformed its surface into a mirror of events afar tokar was two thirds of the way to the barrowland you killed her stancil said you killed her i warned you this is a cruel business and you made a bet and lost sit your butt in the corner and behave you killed her remorse smashed in even before his son forced him to act he tried to soften the impact but the melting of bones was all or nothing stancil fell across his lover his father fell to his knees beside him why did you make me do it you fools you bloody damned fools you were using me you didnt have sense enough to make sure of me and you want to deal with something like the lady i dont know i dont know what am i going to tell jasmine how can i explain he looked around wildly an animal tormented kill myself thats all i can do save her the pain of learning what her son was cant got to stop tokar there was fighting in the street outside bomanz ignored it he scrabbled after quicksilver tokar was at the edge of the moat staring into the barrowland bomanz saw the fear and uncertainty in him tokar found his courage he gripped the amulet and crossed the line bomanz began building a killing sending his glance crossed the doorway spied a frightened snoopy watching from the dark landing oh child child get out of here im scared theyre killing each other outside were killing each other in here too he thought please go away go find jasmine a horrendous crash came from the shop men cursed steel met steel bomanz heard the voice of one of tokars teamsters the man was deploying a defense of the house the guard had made a comeback snoopy whimpered stay out of here child stay out go down with jasmine im scared so am i and i wont be able to help if you get in my way please go downstairs she ground her teeth and rattled away bomanz sighed that was close if she had seen stance and glory the uproar redoubled men screamed bomanz heard corporal husky bellowing orders he turned to the bowl tokar had disappeared he could not relocate the man in passing he surveyed the land between the town and the barrowland a few resurrectionists were rushing toward the fighting apparently to help others were in headlong flight remnants of the guard were in pursuit boots pounded upstairs again bomanz interrupted the preparation of his sending husky appeared in the doorway bomanz started to order him out he was in no mood to argue he swung a great bloody sword bomanz used the word of power again a mans bones turned to jelly then again and again as huskys troopers tried to avenge him bomanz dropped four before the rush ended he tried to get back to his sending this time the interruption was nothing physical it was a reverberation along the pathway he had opened into the ladys crypt tokar was on the great barrow and in contact with the creature it contained too late he murmured too damned late but he made the sending anyway maybe tokar would die before he could release those monsters jasmine cursed snoopy screamed bomanz piled over the fallen guardsmen and charged downstairs snoopy screamed again bo entered his bedroom one of tokars men held a knife across jasmines throat a pair of guardsmen sought an opening bomanz had no patience left he killed all three the house rattled teacups clinked in the kitchen it was a gentle tremor but a harbinger strong enough to warn bomanz his sending had not arrived in time resigned he said get out of the house theres igoing to be a quake jasmine looked at him askance she held the hysterical girl ill explain later if we survive just get out of the house he whirled and dashed into the street charged toward the barrowland imagining himself tall and lean and fleet did no good now he was bomanz in the flesh a short fat old man easily winded he fell twice as tremors shook the town each was stronger than the last the fires still burned but the fighting had died away the survivors on both sides knew it was too late for a decision of the sword they stared toward the barrowland awaiting the unfolding of events bomanz joined the watchers the comet burned so brightly the barrowland was clearly illuminated a tremendous shock rattled the earth bomanz staggered out on the barrowland the mound containing soulcatcher exploded a painful glow burned from within a figure rose from the rubble stood limned against the glow people prayed or cursed according to predilection the tremors continued barrow after barrow opened one by one the ten who were taken appeared against the night tokar bomanz murmured i hope you rot in hell there was only one chance left one impossible chance it rode on the timebowed shoulders of a pudgy little man whose powers were not at their sharpest he marshaled his most potent spells his greatest magicks all the mystical tricks he had worked out during thirtyseven years worth of lonely nights and he started walking toward the barrowland hands reached out to detain him they found no purchase from the crowd an old woman called bo no please he kept walking the barrowland seethed ghosts howled among the ruins the great barrow shook its hump earth exploded upward flaming a great winged serpent rose against the night a great scream poured from its mouth torrents of dragonfire inundated the barrowland wise green eyes watched bomanzs progress the fat little man walked into the holocaust unleashing his arsenal of spells fire enveloped him chapter thirtyfive the barrowland from bad to worse returning ravens letter to the oilskin i lay back on my bough bed let my mind go blank so dramatic the way raven told it i wondered about his sources though the wife someone had to note the tales ending and had to hide what was found later what had become of the wife anyway she has no place in legend neither does the son for that matter the popular stories mention only bomanz himself something there though something i missed ah yes a congruence with personal experience the name bomanz had relied upon the one that evidently proved insufficiently powerful id heard it before in equally furious circumstances in juniper as the contest between the lady and the dominator neared its climax with her ensconced in a castle on one side of the city and the dominator trying to escape through another on the far side we discovered the taken meant to do the company evil once the crisis subsided under orders from the captain we deserted we seized a ship as we sailed away with husband and wife contesting above the burning city the struggle peaked the lady proved the stronger the voice of the dominator shook the world as he vented a last spate of frustration he had called her by the name bomanz had thought puissant apparently even the dominator could be mistaken one sister killed another and maybe or maybe not took her place soulcatcher our onetime mentor and plotter to usurp the lady it proved during the great struggle at charm was another sister three sisters then at least one named ardath but evidently not the one who became the lady maybe the beginnings of something here all those lists back in the hole and the genealogies find a woman named ardath then discover who her sisters were its a beginning i murmured feeble but a beginning what i had forgotten case he had not taken advantage i suppose he was too frightened nothing it had grown dark outside the drizzle persisted out on the barrowland ghostly lights drifted about i shuddered that did not seem right i wondered how goblin and oneeye were getting on i did not dare go ask over in a corner tracker snored softly toadkiller dog lay against his belly making sleeping dog noises but i caught a glint of eye which said he was not unalert i invested a little more attention in case he was shaking and not just with the chill he was sure we would kill him i reached over rested a hand on his shoulder its all right son you wont be harmed we owe you for looking out for raven hes really raven the raven that was the white roses father the lad knew the legends yeah fosterfather though then he didnt lie about everything he was in the forsberg campaigns that struck me as humorous i chuckled then said knowing raven he didnt lie about much just edited the truth youll really let me go when were safe oh he did not sound reassured lets say when we get to the edge of the plain of fear youll find plenty of friends out there he wanted to get into a quasipolitical discussion about why we insisted on resisting the lady i refused i am no evangelist i cant make converts i have too much trouble understanding myself and unravelling my own motives maybe raven could explain after goblin and oneeye brought him out the night seemed endless but after three eternities which took me up to midnight i heard unsteady footsteps croaker in i said it was goblin without a light i could not read him well but got the impression that his news was not good trouble yes we cant get him out what the hell are you talking about what do you mean i mean we dont have the skills we dont have the talent thiss going to take someone bigger than we are we arent much croaker showmen with a few handy spells maybe silent could do something his is a different sort of magic maybe youd better back up wheres oneeye resting it was rough on him really rocked him what he saw in there what was that i dont know i was just his lifeline and i had to pull him out before he got trapped too all i know is we cant get raven without help shit i said double damned floating sheep shit goblin we cant win this one unless we have raven to help i dont have what it takes either ill never translate half those papers not even with trackers help he reads tellekurre thats it i can do that only i take longer raven must know the dialects some of the stuff he was translating was in them also theres the question of what he was doing here why he faked his death again and took off on darling maybe i was jumping to conclusions i do that or maybe i was indulging in the human penchant for oversimplification figuring that if we just had raven back our troubles were solved what are we going to do i wondered aloud goblin rose i dont know croaker lets let oneeye get his feet under him again and find out what were up against we can go from there right he slipped out i lay down and tried to sleep whenever i dropped off i had nightmares about the thing lying in the mud and slime the barrowland had become chapter thirtysix hard times oneeye looked gruesome it was grim he said get the chart out croaker i did he indicated a point hes here and stuck looks like he went all the way to the center along bomanzs trail then got in trouble on his way out how i dont understand whats going on here i wish you could go in there a realm of terrible shadows guess i should be glad you cant youd try it whats that crack mean means youre too curious for your own good like old bomanz no be still he paused a moment croaker something that was trapped there one of the minions of the taken was situated near bomanzs path he was too strong for it but raven was an amateur i think goblin silent and i together would have trouble with this thing and were more skilled than raven could be he underestimated the dangers and overestimated himself as he was leaving this thing usurped his position and left him in its place i frowned not quite understanding oneeye explained something used him to keep the balance of the old spells so hes stuck in a net of oldtime sorcery and its out here a sinking feeling a feeling edging despair out and you dont know nothing the chart indicates nothing bomanz must have been contemptuous of the lesser evils he hasnt marked a dozen there should have been scores the literature supported that what did he tell you were you able to communicate no he was aware of a presence but hes in a sinkhole of spells i couldnt contact him without getting caught myself theres a small imbalance there like what went out might have been a hair more than what stayed in i did try to get close to him that was why goblin had to yank me out i did sense a great fear not due to his situation only anger there i think he got caught only because he was in so big a hurry he didnt pay attention to his surroundings i got the message been to the center and in flight what lay at the center you think whatever got away might try to open the great barrow it might try engineering it i had a brainstorm why not sneak darling out here she could oneeye gave me a dontbestupid look right raven was the least of the things a null would loose the big guy would love that goblin chided purely love it theres nothing we can do for raven here oneeye said someday we might find a wizard who can till then he shrugged better make a pact of silence darling might forget her mission if she finds out agreed i said then but but what i ive been thinking about that darling and raven theres something there we dont see i think i mean considering the way he always was why did he cut out and come here on the face of it to sneak around the lady and her gang but why would he leave darling in the dark you see what im saying maybe she wouldnt be as upset as we think or maybe for different reasons oneeye looked dubious goblin nodded tracker looked baffled as usual what about his body i asked a definite encumbrance oneeye replied and i cant say but what taking him to the plain might not snap the connection between flesh and spirit stop i looked at case he looked at me here we had another double bind i knew one sure way of solving ravens body problem and of getting him brought out betray him to the lady that might solve several other problems too like the escaped whatever and the threat of another escape attempt by her husband it might buy darling time too for the ladys attention would shift dramatically but what would become of raven then he could be the key to our success or failure give him up to save him play the very long odds that we could somehow get him in hand again before his knowledge could hurt us ever a quandary ever a quandary goblin suggested lets give it another look this time ill take the point oneeye will cover oneeyes sour look said they had had a knockdowndragout about this before i kept my mouth shut it was their area of expertise well goblin demanded if you think its worthwhile i do anyway theres nothing to lose different viewpoint might help too i might catch something he missed having only one eye dont blind me oneeye snarled goblin glowered this had arisen before too dont waste time i said we cant stay put forever sometimes decisions get made for you deep in the night wind in the trees chill fingering into the shelter waking me to shiver till i fell asleep again rain pattering steadily but not restfully gods was i sick of rain how could the eternal guard maintain any semblance of sanity a hand shook me tracker whispered company coming trouble toadkiller dog was at the tent flap hackles up i listened nothing but no point not taking his word better safe than dead what about goblin and oneeye not finished yet ohoh i scrambled for clothing for weapons tracker said ill go scout them and try to scare or lead them off you warn the others get ready to run he slipped out of the tent behind toadkiller dog damned beast showed some life now our whispering wakened case neither of us spoke i wondered what he would risk i covered my head with my blanket and left sufficient unto the day the evil thereof into the other tent where i found both men in trances shit now what did i dare try waking oneeye softly oneeye this is croaker weve got trouble ah his good eye opened for a moment he seemed disoriented then whatre you doing here trouble tracker says theres somebody in the woods a cry came through the rain oneeye bolted upright the power he spat what the hell what is it somebody just ripped off a spell almost like one of the taken can you get goblin out fast i can another cry ripped through the woods this one stretched out and out and seemed as much of despair as of agony ill get him he sounded like all hope had gone taken had to be sniffed out our tracks closing in but the cries first one somebody tracker ambushed second one tracker gotten didnt sound like him oneeye lay down and closed his eye in moments he was back in trance though his face betrayed the fear on his surface mind he was good to go under such tension there was a third cry from the woods baffled i moved to where i could look into the rain i saw nothing moments later goblin stirred he looked awful but his determination showed he had gotten the word he forced himself upright though it was obvious he was not ready his mouth kept opening and closing i had a feeling he wanted to tell me something oneeye came out after him but recovered more quickly whats happened he asked another yell drop everything run for it we cant we have to get some of this stuff back to the plain otherwise we might as well surrender right here right get it together ill take care here getting things together was not much of a job i had unpacked very little something roared out in the woods i froze what the hell sounded like something bigger than four lions a moment later there were screams no sense no sense at all i could see tracker raising nine kinds of hell with the guard but not if they had one of the taken with them goblin and oneeye showed up as i began knocking the tent down goblin still looked like hell oneeye carried half his stuff wheres the kid he asked i had paid no attention to his absence it hadnt surprised me gone how are we going to carry raven my answer stepped out of the woods tracker looking a little the worse for wear but still healthy toadkiller dog was covered with blood he seemed more animated than i had seen before lets get him out of here tracker said and moved to take one end of the litter your stuff no time what about the wagon i lifted the other end forget it im sure they found it march we marched letting him lead the way i asked what was all that uproar caught them by surprise but even the taken can be surprised save your breath he isnt dead for a few hours it was put one foot in front of the other and dont look back tracker set a tough pace in a corner of my mind where the observer still dwelt i noted that toadkiller dog kept the pace with ease goblin collapsed first once or twice he had tried to catch me and pass something along but he just did not have the energy when he went down tracker stopped looked back irritably toadkiller dog lay down in the wet leaves rumbling tracker shrugged set his end of the litter down that was my cue to drop like a stone and damn the rain and mud i couldnt get any wetter gods my arms and shoulders ached needles of fire drove into me where the muscles start swooping up to the neck this isnt going to work i said after i caught some breath were too old and weak tracker considered the forest toadkiller dog rose sniffed the wet wind i struggled up long enough to look back the way we had come trying to guess which direction we had run south of course north made no sense and east or west would have put us in the barrowland or river but if we kept heading south we would encounter the old oar road where it curved in beside the great tragic that stretch was sure to be patrolled with my breath partially restored and my breathing no longer roaring in my ears i could hear the river it was no more than a hundred yards away churning and grumbling as always tracker came out of a reflective mood guile then guile im hungry oneeye said and i realized i was too reckon well get a lot hungrier though he smiled feebly he now had enough strength to look goblin over croaker want to come check him out funny that they arent enemies when the pinch comes chapter thirtyseven the forest and beyond two days passed before we ate courtesy of trackers skill as a hunter two days we spent dodging patrols tracker knew those woods well we disappeared into their deeps and drifted southward at a more relaxed pace after the two days tracker felt confident enough to let us have a fire it was not much though because finding burnable wood was a pain its value was more psychological than physical misery balanced by rising hope that was the story of our two weeks in the old forest hell trekking overland off the road was as fast or faster than using the road itself we felt halfway optimistic when we neared the southern verge i am tempted to dwell on the misery and the arguments about raven oneeye and goblin were convinced we were doing him no good yet they could come up with no alternative to dragging him along i carried another weight in my belly like a big stone goblin got to me that second night while tracker and toadkiller dog were hunting he whispered i got farther in than oneeye did almost to the center i know why raven didnt get out yeah he saw too much what he went to see probably the dominator is not asleep i he shuddered it took him a moment to get hold of himself i saw him croaker looking back at me and laughing if it hadnt been for oneeye id have been caught just like raven oh my i said softly mind abuzz with the implications awake and working yes dont talk about it not to anybody till you can tell darling there was a hint of fatalism in him then he doubted he would be around long scary oneeye know ill tell him got to make sure word gets back why not just tell us all not tracker theres something wrong with tracker croaker another thing the oldtime wizard hes in there too bomanz yes alive like hes frozen or something not dead but not able to do anything the dragon he shut up tracker arrived carrying a brace of squirrels we barely let them warm before we attacked them we rested a day before tackling the tamed lands henceforth it would be scurry from one smidgen of cover to the next mouselike by night i wondered what the hell the point might be the plain of fear might as well be in another world that night i had a golden dream i do not recall anything except that she touched me and somehow tried to warn me i think exhaustion more than my amulet blocked the message nothing stuck i wakened retaining only a vague sense of having missed something critical end of the line end of the game two hours out of the great forest i knew our time was approaching darkness was inadequate insulation nor were my amulets sufficient the taken were in the air i felt them on the prowl once it was too late to turn back and they knew their quarry was afoot we could hear the distant clamor of battalions moving to bar retreat into the forest my amulet warned me of the near passage of taken repeatedly when it did not as it seemed not always to doperhaps because the new taken did not affect it toadkiller dog gave warning he could smell the bastards coming a league away the other amulet did help that and trackers genius for laying a crooked trail but the circle closed and closed and we knew that it would not be long before there were no gaps through which we could slide what do we do croaker oneeye asked his voice was shaky he knew but he wanted to be told and i could neither give the order nor do it myself these men were my friends we had been together all my adult life i could not tell them to kill themselves i could not cut them down but i could not allow them to be captured either a vague notion formed a foolish one really at first i thought it simple desperation silliness what good then something touched me i gasped the others felt it too even tracker and his mutt they jumped as if stung i gasped again its her shes here oh damn but that made up my mind i might be able to buy time before i could reflect and thus chicken out i shucked my amulets shoved them into goblins hands pushed our precious documents at oneeye thanks guys take care maybe ill see you what the hell you doing bow in handthe bow she had given me so long agoi leaped into darkness soft protests pursued me i caught the edge of tracker asking what the hell was going on then i was away there was a road not far off and a little sliver of moon up top i got onto the one and trotted by the light of the other pushing my tired old body to its limit trying to build as big a margin as possible before the inevitable befell me she would protect me for a time i hoped and once caught i might stall on behalf of the others i felt sorry for them though neither goblin nor oneeye was strong enough to help carry raven tracker could not manage alone if they made it to the plain of fear they would not be able to evade the unenviable duty of explaining everything to darling i wondered if any of them would have what it took to finish ravenbile rose my legs were going watery i tried to fill my mind with nothingness stared at the road three steps ahead of my feet puffed hard kept on count steps by hundreds over and over a horse i could steal a horse i kept telling myself that concentrated on that damning the stitch in my side till shadows loomed before me and imperials began to shout and i hared off into a wheat field with the ladys hounds abay behind me i nearly gave them the slip nearly but then the shadow descended from the heavens air whistled past a carpet and a moment later darkness devoured me i welcomed it as the end of my miseries hoping it was permanent it was light when i regained consciousness i was in a cold place but all places are cold in the north countries i was dry for the first time in weeks i was dry i harkened back to my run and recalled the sliver of moon a sky clear enough for a moon amazing i cracked one eye i was in a room with walls of stone it had the look of a cell beneath me a surface neither hard nor wet how long since i had lain on a dry bed blue willy i became aware of an odor food hot food on a platter just inches from my head atop a small stand some mess that looked like overcooked stew gods did it smell good i rose so swiftly my head spun i almost passed out food the hell with anything else i ate like the starved animal i was i had not quite finished when the door slammed inward exploded inward ringing off the wall a huge dark form stamped through for a moment i sat with spoon halfway between bowl and mouth this thing was human it stepped to one side weapon ready four imperials followed but i hardly noticed so taken was i with the giant man all right but bigger than any id ever seen and looking lithe and spritely as an elf for all his size the imperials paired to either side of the doorway presented arms what i demanded determined to go down with a defiant grin no drumrolls no trumpets i presumed i was about to meet my captor i can call them when i call them whisper came through the doorway i was more startled by seeing her than by the dramatic advent of her giant thug she was supposed to be holding the western boundary of the plain unless i could not think it but the worm of doubt gnawed anyway i had been out of touch a long time where are the documents she demanded without preamble a grin smeared my face i had succeeded they had not caught the others but elation faded swiftly there were more imperials behind whisper and they bore a litter raven they dumped him roughly onto a cot opposite mine their hospitality was not niggardly it was a grand cell plenty of room for the prisoner to stretch his legs i found my grin now you shouldnt ask questions like that mama wouldnt like it remember how angry she became last time whisper was always a cool one even when she led the rebel she never let emotion get in the way she did remind me your death can be an unpleasant one physician dead is dead a slow smile spread upon her colorless lips she was not a lovely woman that nasty smile did not improve her looks i got the message down in the dark inside me something howled and gibbered like a monkey getting roasted i resisted its call to terror now if ever there was one was a time to act as a brother of the black company i had to buy time had to give the others the longest head start possible she might have read my mind as she stood there staring smiling they wont get far they can hide from witchery but they cannot hide from the hounds my heart sank as if cued a messenger arrived he whispered to whisper she nodded then she turned to me i go to collect them now think on the limper in my absence for once i have drained you of knowledge i may deliver you to him smile again you never were a nice lady i said but it came feebly and got said to her departing back her menagerie went with her i checked raven he seemed unchanged i lay on my cot closed my eyes tried to push everything out of my mind it had worked once before when i needed contact with the lady where was she i knew she was near enough to sense last night but now was she playing some game but she had said no special consideration still there is consideration and consideration chapter thirtyeight the fortress at deal bam the old door trick this time i had heard the manmountain stomping down the hall so i did not react except to ask dont you ever knock bruno no response till whisper stepped inside get up physician i would have made a crude remark but something in her voice chilled me beyond the chill due my straits i rose she looked terrible not that she was much different physically but something inside had gone dead and cold and frightened what was that thing she demanded i was baffled what thing the thing you were traveling with speak i could not for i hadnt the slightest notion what she was blathering about we caught up or my men did i arrived only in time to count the bodies what shreds twenty hounds and a hundred men in armor in minutes then disappears from mortal ken gods oneeye and goblin must have outdone themselves still i did not speak you came from the barrowland where you were tampering did you call something forth she sounded as though she were musing its time we found out its time we found out how tough you really are soldier she faced the giant bring him i gave it my best shot by playing my dirtiest i pretended meek for just long enough to let him relax then i stomped his foot running the side of my boot down his shin then i spun away and kicked at his crotch guess im getting old and slow course he was a lot faster than a man his size should be he leaned back caught my foot and threw me across the room two imperials got me up and started dragging me i went with the satisfaction of seeing the big man limp i tried a few more tricks just to slow things up they did little more than get me knocked around the imperials strapped me down in a highbacked wooden chair in a room where whisper had set up to practice her magicks i saw nothing especially villainous that only made the anticipation worse they got two or three good screams out of me and were working themselves up to get unpleasant when the tableau suddenly broke up the imperials ripped me out of the chair hustled me toward my cell i was too foggy to wonder till in the hallway a few yards short of that cell we encountered the lady yes so my message had gotten through id thought the brief touch id made a response in wishful thinking at the time but here she was the imperials ran is she that terrible to her own people whisper stood her ground whatever passed between them did so unspoken whisper helped me to my feet pushed me into the cell her face was stone but her eyes were asmoulder curses foiled again i croaked and fell onto my cot it was plain daylight when the door closed it was night when i wakened and she was standing over me wearing her guise of beauty she said i warned you yes i tried to sit up i had aches everywhere both from maltreatment and from pushing an old body beyond its limits before my capture stay i would not have come had my own interests not demanded it i would not have called otherwise again you do me a favor only in the interest of selfpreservation you may as they say have jumped from the frying pan into the fire whisper lost many men today to what i dont know goblin and oneeye i shut up damn groggy head damn sympathetic voice said too much already it wasnt them they havent the skill to raise anything like that i saw the bodies i dont know then i believe you even so ive seen wounds like those before ill show you before we leave for the tower was there ever any doubt about that when you make your examination reflect on the fact that the last time men died in such fashion my husband ruled the world none of this added up but i was not worried about it i was worried about my own future he has begun to move already long before i expected will he never lie quietly and let me get on with my work some sums started toting oneeye saying something had gotten out raven having been caught because of it dumb shit raven you did it again on his own trying to care for darling he had damned near let the dominator break through at juniper what did you do this time why would it follow and protect oneeye and them this is raven then screwup number two for croaker why cant i keep my big damned mouth shut she bent over him rested a hand on his forehead i watched from beneath my brows unfocused i could not look at her direct she did have the power to sway stone i will return soon she said heading for the door fear not you will be safe in my absence the door closed sure i murmured safe from whisper maybe but how safe from you i looked around the room wondering if i might end my life whisper took me out to look at the carnage where hounds and imperials had overhauled oneeye and goblin not pleasant ill tell you the last i saw the like was when we went up against the forvalaka in beryl ere we joined the lady i wondered if that monster was back and tracking oneeye again but he had slain it during the battle at charm hadnt he but the limper survived hell yes he did and two days after the lady took offi was imprisoned in the old fortress at deal id learnedhe made an appearance a little friendly visit just for old times sake i sensed his presence before i actually saw him and terror nearly unmanned me how had he known whisper almost certainly whisper he came to my cell buoyed on a miniature carpet his name no longer really described him he could not get around without that carpet he was but the shadow of a being human wreckage animated by sorcery and a mad burning will he floated into my cell hovered there considering me i did my best to appear unintimidated failed a ghost of a voice stirred the air your time has come it will be a prolonged and painful ending to your tale and i will enjoy every moment i doubt it had to keep up the show mama wont like you messing with her prisoner she is not here physician he began to drift backward we will begin soon after time for reflection a snatch of insane chuckle drifted in behind him i am not sure if he or whisper was the source she was in the hallway watching a voice said but she is here they froze whisper went pallid limper sort of folded in upon himself the lady materialized out of nowhere appearing first as golden sparkles she said nothing more the taken did not speak either for there was nothing they could say i wanted to interject one of my remarks but the better part of valor prevailed instead i tried to make myself small a roach beneath notice but roaches get squished beneath the uncaring foot the lady finally spoke limper you were given an assignment nowhere in your brief is there an allowance for you to leave your command yet you have done so again and the results are the same as when you slipped off to roses to sabotage soulcatcher limper wilted even more that was one damned long time ago one of our sneaky tricks on the rebel of the day what happened was the rebel attacked limpers headquarters while he was away from his demense trying to undermine soulcatcher so darling was whooping it up on the plain my spirits rose it was the confirmation id had that the movement had not collapsed go the lady said and know this there will be no more understanding henceforth we live by the iron rules as my husband made them next time will be the last time for you or anyone else who serves me do you understand whisper limper they understood they were careful to say so in so many words there was communication there beneath the level of mere words not accessible to me for they went away absolutely convinced their continued existence depended upon unquestioning and unswerving obedience not only to the letter but the spirit of their orders they went with a crushed air the lady faded the moment my cell door closed she appeared in the flesh shortly before nightfall her anger still simmered i gathered from hearing guards gossip that whisper had been ordered back to the plain too things had turned bad out there the taken on the scene could not cope give them hell darling i murmured give them hell i was working hard on resigning myself to whatever fates horror shop stocked for me guards brought me out of the cell soon after nightfall they brought raven too i asked no questions they would not have answered the ladys carpet rested in the fortress main court the soldiers placed raven upon it tied him down a glum sergeant gestured for me to board i did so surprising him by knowing what to do my heart was in my heels i knew my destination the tower i waited half an hour finally she came she looked thoughtful even a little disturbed and uncertain she took her place at the leading edge of the carpet we rose riding a windwhale is more comfortable and much less trying to the nerves a windwhale has substance has scale we rose perhaps a thousand feet and began running south i doubt we were making more than thirty miles per hour it would be a long flight then unless she chose to break it after an hour she faced me i could barely discern her features she said i visited the barrowland croaker i did not respond not knowing what was expected what have you done what have you people set free nothing she looked at raven perhaps there is a way after a time i know the thing that is loose sleep physician well talk another time and i went to sleep and when i wakened i was in another cell and knew by the uniforms that my new prison was the tower at charm chapter thirtynine a guest at charm a colonel of the ladys household force came for me he was almost polite even back when her troops never were sure of my status poor babies i had no niche in their ordered and hierarchical universe the colonel said she wants you now he had a dozen men with him they did not look like an honor guard neither did they act like executioners not that it mattered i would go if they had to carry me i left with a backward glance raven was holding his own the colonel left me at a doorway into the inner tower the tower inside the tower into which few men pass and from which fewer return march he said i hear youve done this before you know the drill i stepped through the doorway when i looked back i saw only stone wall for a moment i became disoriented that passed and i was in another place and she was there framed by what appeared to be a window though her parts of the tower are completely ensheathed within the rest come here i went she pointed i looked out that nonwindow on a burning city taken soared above it hurling magicks that died their target was a phalanx of windwhales that were devastating the city darling was riding one of the whales they were staying within her null where they were invulnerable they are not though the lady said reading my thoughts mortal weapons will reach them and your bandit girl but it does not matter ive decided to suspend operations i laughed then weve won i do believe that was the first time i ever saw her piqued with me a mistake mocking her it could make her reassess emotionally a decision made strategically you have won nothing if that is the perception a shift of focus will generate then i will not break off i will adjust the campaigns focus instead damn you croaker leam to keep your big goddamn mouth shut around people like this you will jackjaw your way right into a meat grinder after regaining her selfcontrol she faced me the lady from just two feet away be sarcastic in your writing if you like but when you speak be prepared to pay a price i understand i thought you would she faced the scene again in that far cityit looked like frosta flaming windwhale fell after being caught in a storm of shafts hurled by ballistae bigger than any id ever seen two could play the suckin game how well did your translations go what the documents you found in the forest of cloud gave to my late sister soulcatcher took from her again gave to your friend raven and took from him in turn the papers you thought would give you the tool of victory those documents ha not well at all you couldnt have what you sought isnt there but you were misled yes i know bomanz put them together so they must hold my true name yes but that has been eradicatedexcept perhaps in the mind of my husband she became remote suddenly the victory at juniper cost he learned the lesson bomanz did too late so you noticed he has information enough to pry an answer from what happened no my name isnt there his is that was why they so excited my sister she saw an opportunity to supplant us both she knew me we were children together after all and protected from one another only by the most tangled web that could be woven when she enlisted you in beryl she had no greater ambition than to undermine me but when you delivered those documents she was thinking aloud as much as explaining i was stricken by a sudden insight you dont know his name it was never a love match physician it was the shakiest of alliances tell me how do i get those papers you dont then we all lose this is true croaker while we argue and while our respective allies strive to slash one anothers throats the enemy of us all is shedding his chains all this dying will be for naught if the dominator wins free destroy him thats impossible in the town where i was born there is a folk tale about a man so mighty he dared mock the gods in the end his might proved sheer hubris for there is one against whom even the gods are powerless whats the point to twist an old saw death conquers all not even the dominator can wrestle death and win every time there are ways she admitted but not without those papers you will return to your quarters now and reflect i will speak to you again i was dismissed that suddenly she faced the dying city suddenly i knew my way out a powerful impulse drove me toward the door a moment of dizziness and i was outside the colonel came puffing along the corridor he returned me to my cell i planted myself on my bunk and reflected as ordered there was evidence enough that the dominator was stirring but the business about the documents not holding the lever we had counted onthat was the shocker that i had to swallow or reject and my choice might have critical repercussions she was leading me for her own ends of course i conceived numerous possibilities none pleasant but all making a sort of sense shed said it if the dominator broke out we were all in the soup good guys and bad i fell asleep there were dreams but i do not recall them i awakened to find a hot meal freshly delivered sitting atop a desk that had not been there before on that desk was a generous supply of writing materials she expected me to resume my annals i devoured half the food before noting ravens absence the old nerves began to rattle why was he gone where to what use did she have for him leverage time is funny inside the tower the usual colonel arrived as i finished eating the usual soldiers accompanied him he announced she wants you again already i just came back from there four days ago i touched my cheek i have been affecting only a partial beard of late my face was brushy so one long sleep any chance i could get a razor the colonel smiled thinly what do you think a barber can come in will you come along i got a vote of course not i followed rather than be dragged the drill was the same i found her at a window again the scene showed some corner of the plain where one of whispers fortifications was besieged it had no heavy ballistae a windwhale hovered overhead keeping the garrison in hiding walking trees were dismantling the outer wall by the simple mechanism of growing it to death the way a jungle destroys an abandoned city though ten thousand times faster than the unthinking forest the entire desert has risen against me she said whispers outposts have suffered an annoying variety of attacks i suspect your intrusions are resented i thought you were going to disengage i tried your deaf peasant isnt cooperating have you been thinking ive been sleeping is what ive been doing as you know yes so there were matters which demanded attention now i can devote myself to the problem at hand the look in her eye made me want to run she gestured i froze she told me to back up to sit in a nearby chair i sat unable to shake the spell though i knew what was coming she stood before me one eye closed the open eye grew bigger and bigger reached out devoured me i think i screamed the moment had been inevitable since my capture though i had held a foolish hope otherwise now she would drain my mind like a spider drains a fly i recovered in my cell feeling as though i had been to hell and back my head throbbed it was a major undertaking to rise and stagger to my medical kit which had been returned after my captors removed the lethals i prepared an infusion of willow inner bark which took forever because i had no fire over which to heat the water someone came in as i nursed and cursed the first weak bitter cup i did not recognize him he seemed surprised to see me up hello he said quick recovery who the hell are you physician supposed to check you once an hour you werent expected to recover for a long time headache goddamn well right cranky good he placed his bag next to my kit which he glanced through as he opened his what did you take i told him asked what do you mean good sometimes they come out listless never recover yeah i thought about whipping him just for the hell of it just to vent my spleen but what was the point some guard would come bouncing in and make my pains the worse too much like work anyway are you something special i think so a flicker of a smile drink this better than the bark tea i downed the drink he offered she is most concerned never before have i seen her care what became of one subjected to the deep probe how about that i was having trouble keeping my foul mood the drink hed given me was good stuff and fast what was that concoction i could use it by the barrel its addictive rendered from the juice of the top four leaves of the parsifal plant never heard of it rather scarce he was examining me at the time grows in some place called the hollow hills the natives use it as a narcotic the company had been through those terrible hills once upon a time didnt know there were natives theyre as scarce as the plant theres been talk in council of growing it commercially after the fighting ends as a medicinal he clucked his tongue which reminded me of the toothless ancient who had taught me medicine funny i hadnt thought of him in ages funnier still all sorts of old odd memories were streaking to the surface like bottom fish scared toward the light the lady had stirred my mind good i did not pursue his remark about raising the weed commercially though that was at odds with my notion of the lady the black hearts dont worry about relieving pain how do you feel about her the lady right now not very charitable how about you he ignored that she expects to see you as soon as you recover does a bear shit in the woods i countered i get the idea im not exactly a prisoner how about i get some air on the roof cant hardly run away from there ill see if its permitted meantime take some exercise here hah the only exercise i get is jumping to conclusions i just wanted to get somewhere outside four walls am i still among the living i asked when he finished examining me for the time being though with your attitude i am amazed you survived in an outfit like yours they love me worship me wouldnt harm a hair on my head his mention of the outfit put my mood on the downswing i asked you know how long its been since i was captured no i think youve been here more than a week could be longer so guess at least ten days since my capture give the boys the benefit of the doubt have them moving light and hard and they had maybe covered four hundred miles just one giant step out of many crap stalling was pointless now the lady knew everything i did i wondered if any of it had been of any use or much of a surprise how is my friend i asked suffering a sudden guilt i dont know he was moved north because his connection with his spirit was becoming attenuated im sure the subject will arise when next you visit the lady im finished have a nice stay sarky bastard he grinned as he left must run in the profession the colonel stepped in a few minutes later i hear you want to go to the roof yeah inform the sentry when you would like to go he had something else on his mind after a pause he asked isnt there any military discipline in your outfit he was irked because i had not been sirring him various smart remarks occurred i stifled them my status might not remain enigmatic yes though not so much as in earlier days not enough of us left since juniper to make that stuff worth the trouble sly shot croaker put them on the defensive tell them the company fell to its current pitiful state laboring for the lady remind them that it was the empires satraps who turned first that must be common knowledge by now among the officer corps something they should think about occasionally pity that the colonel said you my personal watchdog yes she sets great store by you for some reason i wrote her a poem once i lied i also got the goods on her he frowned decided i was bullshitting thanks i said by way of extending an olive branch ill write for a while before i go i was way behind except for a bit at blue willy i had done nothing but jot an occasional note since leaving the plain i wrote till cramps compelled me to stop then i ate for a guard brought a meal as i sanded my last sheet done gobbling i went to the door told the lad there i was ready to go topside when he opened up i discovered i was not locked in but where the hell could i go if i got out silly even thinking of escape i had a feeling i was about to take on the official historian job like it or no it would be the least of many evils some tough decisions stared me in the eye i wanted time to think them over the lady understood certainly she had the power and talent to be more foresighted than a physician who had spent six years out of touch sunset fire in the west clouds in raging flame the sky a wealth of unusual colors a chill breeze from the north just enough to shiver and refresh my guardian stayed well away permitting the illusion of freedom i walked to the northern parapet there was little evidence of the great battle fought below where once trenches palisades earthworks and siege engines had stood and burned and tens of thousands had died there was parkland a single black stone stella marked the site five hundred yards from the tower the crash and roar returned i remembered the rebel horde relentless like the sea wave after wave smashing upon unyielding cliffs of defenders i recalled the feuding taken their fey and fell deaths the wild and terrible sorceries it was a battle of battles was it not i did not turn as she joined me it was i never did it justice they will sing of it she glanced up stars had begun to appear in the twilight her face seemed pale and strained never before had i seen her in any but the most selfpossessed mood what is it now i did turn and saw a group of soldiers some distance away watching either awed or aghast i have performed a divination several in fact for i did not get satisfactory results and perhaps i got no results at all i waited you do not press the most powerful being in the world that she was on the verge of confiding in a mortal was stunning enough all is flux i divined three possible futures we are headed for a crisis a historyshaping hour i turned slightly toward her violet light shaded her face dark hair tumbled down over one cheek it was not artifice for once and the impulse to touch to hold perhaps to comfort was powerful three futures three i could not find my place in any what do you say at a moment like that that maybe there was an error you accuse the lady of making a mistake in one your deaf child triumphs but it is the least likely chance and she and all hers perish gaining the victory in another my husband breaks the grasp of the grave and reestablishes his domination that darkness lasts ten thousand years in the third vision he is destroyed forever and all it is the strongest vision the demanding vision but the price is great are there gods croaker i never believed in gods i dont know lady no religion i ever encountered made any sense none are consistent most gods are megalomaniacs and paranoid psychotics by their worshipers description i dont see how they could survive their own insanity but its not impossible that human beings are incapable of interpreting a power so much greater than themselves maybe religions are twisted and perverted shadows of truth maybe there are forces which shape the world i myself have never understood why in a universe so vast a god would care about something so trivial as worship or human destiny when i was a child my sisters and i had a teacher did i pay attention you bet your sweet ass i did i was ears from my toenails to the top of my pointy head a teacher yes he argued that we are the gods that we create our own destiny that what we are determines what will become of us in a peasantlike vernacular we all paint ourselves into corners from which there is no escape simply by being ourselves and interacting with other selves interesting well yes there is a god of sorts croaker do you know not a mover and shaker though simply a negator an ender of tales he has a hunger than cannot be sated the universe itself will slide down his maw death i do not want to die croaker all that i am shrieks against the unrighteousness of death all that i am was and probably will be is shaped by my passion to evade the end of me she laughed quietly but there was a thread of hysteria there she gestured indicating the shadowed killing ground below i would have built a world in which i was safe and the cornerstone of my citadel would have been death the end of the dream was drawing close i could not imagine a world without me in it either and the inner me was outraged is outraged i have no trouble imagining someone becoming obsessed with escaping death i understand maybe were all equals at the dark gate no the sands run for us all life is but a flicker shouting into the jaws of eternity but it seems so damned unfair old father tree entered my thoughts he would perish in time yes death is insatiable and cruel have you reflected she asked i think so im no necromancer but ive seen roads i dont want to walk yes youre free to go croaker shock even my heels tingled with disbelief say what youre free the tower gate is open you need but walk out it but youre also free to remain to reenter the lists in the struggle that envelopes us all there was almost no light left except for some sun hitting very high clouds against the deep indigo in the east a squadron of bright pinpricks moved westward they seemed headed toward the tower i gabbled something that made no sense will she nihil she the lady of charm is at war with her husband once more she said and till that struggle is lost or won there is no other you see the taken returning the armies of the east are marching toward the barrowland those beyond the plain have been ordered to withdraw to garrisons farther east your deaf child is in no danger unless she comes looking for it there is an armistice perhaps eternally weak smile if there is no lady there is no one for the white rose to battle she left me then in total confusion and went to greet her champions the carpets came down out of the darkness settling like autumn leaves i moved a little nearer till my personal guardian indicated that my relationship with the lady was insufficiently close to permit eavesdropping the wind grew more chill blowing out of the north and i wondered if it might not be autumn for us all chapter forty making up my mind she never once demanded anything even her hints were so oblique they left everything to me to work out two days after our evening on the ramparts i asked the colonel if i might see her he said he would ask i suspect he was under instructions otherwise there would have been arguments another day passed before he came to say the lady had time for me i closed my inkwell cleaned my quill and rose thank you he looked at me oddly is something wrong no just i understood i dont know either im sure she has some special use for me that brightened the colonels day that he could comprehend the usual routine this time i entered her demense as she stood at a window opening on a world of wet gloom grey rain choppy brown water and hulking to the left shapes barely discernible trees clinging precariously to a high river bank cold and misery leaked out of that portraiture it had a too familiar smell the great tragic river she said in full flood but its always in flood isnt it she beckoned i followed since my last visit a large table had been added atop it was a miniature of the barrowland a representation so good it was spooky you almost expected to see little guards scurrying around the compound you see she asked no though ive been there twice im not familiar with much but the town and the compound what am i supposed to see the river your friend raven evidently recognized its import with one delicate finger she sketched a loop well to the east of the rivers course which curved into the ridge where we had camped at the time of my triumph in juniper the rivers bed lay here a year later the weather turned the river flooded continuously and crept this way today its devouring this ridge i examined it myself the ridge is entirely earthen without bones of stone it wont last once it goes the river will cut into the barrowland all the spells of the white rose wont keep it from opening the great barrow each fetish swept away will make it that much easier for my husband to rise i grunted against nature there is no defense there is if one foresees the white rose did not i did not when i attempted to bind him more securely now its too late so you wanted to speak to me yes i have to leave the tower so you didnt have to come to me about that youre free to stay or go im going because therere things i have to do as you well know if i walk ill probably get them done too late its a long hike to the plain not to mention risky i want to beg transportation she smiled and this smile was genuine radiant subtly different from previous smiles good i thought you would see where the future lies how soon can you be ready five minutes there is one question raven raven has been hospitalized at the compound at the barrowland nothing can be done for him right now every effort will be made when an opportunity arises sufficient i could not argue of course good transport will be available you will have a unique chauffeur the lady herself i i too have been thinking my best next step is to meet your white rose im going with you after gulping quarts of air i managed theyd jump all over you not if they dont know me they wouldnt unless they were told well no one was likely to recognize her i am unique in having met her and lived to brag on it but gods the heaps and bales of buts if you entered the null all your spells would fall apart no new spells wouldnt work spells in place would be safe i did not understand and said so a simple glamor will fade on entering the null it is being actively maintained a spell which changes and leaves changed but which isnt active on entering the null wont be affected something off in the badlands of my mind tickled me i could not run it down if you turned into a frog and hopped in there youd stay a frog if the transformation was actual and not just an illusion i see i hung a red flag on that told me to worry it later i will become a companion acquired along the way say someone who can help with your documents there had to be levels of deceit or something i could not imagine her putting her life into my hands i do believe i gawked she nodded you begin to understand you trust me too much i know you better than you know yourself youre an honorable man by your own lights with enough cynicism to believe there can be a lesser of two evils you have been under the eye i shuddered she did not apologize we both knew an apology would be false well she asked im not sure why you want to do this it makes no sense there is a new situation in the world once there were only two poles your peasant girl and i with a line of conflict drawn between but that which stirs in the north adds another point it can be seen as a lengthening of the line with my point near the middle or as a triangle the point that is my husband intends destroying both your white rose and myself i submit that she and i ought to eliminate the greater danger before enough i see but i dont see darling being that pragmatic theres a lot of hatred in her perhaps but its worth a try will you help having been within a stones throw of the old darkness and seen the ghosts astalk on the barrowland yes i would do most anything to keep that dread spook from shedding his grave but how how how trust her she did that trick they all have of seeming to read my mind you will have me within the null right ill need to think some more take your time i cant leave for some time i suspect she wanted to establish safeguards against a palace revolution chapter fortyone a town called horse fourteen days passed before we took air for horse a modest town lying between the windy country and the plain of fear about a hundred miles west of the latter horse is a caravan stage for those traders mad enough to traipse through those two wildernesses of late the city has been the logistical headquarters for whispers operations what skeleton forces were not on the road to the barrowland were in garrison there damned northbound fools were going to get wet we drifted in after an eventless passage me with eyes agog despite the removal of vast armies whispers base was an anthive swirling around newly created carpets they came in a dozen varieties in one field i saw a w formation of five monsters each a hundred yards long and forty wide a wood and metal jungle topped each elsewhere other carpets in unusual shapes sat upon ground that looked to have been graded most were far longer than they were wide and bigger than the traditional all had a variety of appurtenances and all were enveloped in a light copper cage what is all that i asked adaptation to enemy tactics your peasant girl isnt the only one who can change methods she stepped down stretched i did the same those hours in the air leave you stiff we may get the chance to test them despite my having backed off the plain what a large rebel force is headed for horse several thousand men and everything the desert has to offer several thousand men where did they come from had things changed that much they have that damned mindreading trick again the cities i abandoned poured men into her forces what did you mean test im willing to stop fighting but i wont run away from a fight if she persists in heading west ill show her that null or no null she can be crushed we were near one of the new carpets i ambled over in shape it was like a boat about fifty feet long it had real seats two faced forward one aft in front there was a small ballista aft there was a much heavier engine clamped to the carpets sides and underbelly were eight spears thirty feet long each had a bulge the size of a nail keg five feet behind its head everything was painted blacker than the dominators heart this boatcarpet had fins like a fish some humorist had painted eyes and teeth up front others nearby followed similar designs though different artisans had followed different muses in grafting the flying boats one instead of fish fins had what looked like round translucent whisper thin dried seed pods fifteen feet across the lady had no time to let me inspect her equipment and no inclination to let me wander around unchaperoned not as a matter of trust but of protection i might suffer a fatal accident if i did not stay in her shadow all the taken were in horse even my oldest friends bold bold darling audacity becoming her signature that she had the entire strength of the plain just twenty miles from horse and she was closing in her advance was ponderous though limited to the speed of the walking trees we went out onto the field where the carpets waited arranged in formal array around the monsters i had spotted first the lady said i planned a small demonstration raid on your headquarters but this will be more convincing i think men were busy around the carpets the big ones they were loading with huge pieces of pottery which looked like those big urnplanters with the little cupholes in the upper half for small plants they were fifteen feet tall the planter sites were sealed with paraffin and the bottom boasted a twenty foot pole with a crossbar on its end scores were being mounted in racks i did a fast count more carpets than taken all these are going up how benefice will handle the big ones like the howler before him he has an outstanding capacity for managing a large carpet the other four bigs will be slaved to his come this one is ours i said something intelligent like urk i want you to see it we might be recognized taken circled the long skinny boatcarpets soldiers were aboard them in the second and third seats the men facing aft checked their ballistae munitions cranked a springpowered device apparently meant to help restretch bowstrings after missiles were discharged i could see no apparent task assigned the men in the middle seats whats the cagework for youll learn soon enough but come to it fresh croaker without preconceptions i followed her around our carpet i do not know what she checked but she seemed satisfied the men who had prepared it were pleased by her nod up croaker into the second seat fasten yourself securely itll get exciting before its over oh yeah were the pathfinders she said as she buckled into the front seat a grizzled old sergeant took the rear position he looked at me doubtfully but said nothing the taken assumed the front seat aboard every carpet the bigs as the lady called them had crews of four benefice rode the carpet at the center point of the w ready the lady shouted right aye the sergeant said our carpet began to move lumbering is the only word to describe the first few seconds the carpet was heavy and till it managed some forward motion did not want to lift the lady looked back and grinned as the earth dropped away she was enjoying herself she began shouting instructions which explained the bewildering bunch of pedals and levers surrounding me push and pull on these two in combination and the carpet began to roll around its long axis twist those and it turned right or left the idea was to use combinations somehow to guide the craft what for i shouted into the wind the words ripped away we had donned goggles which protected our eyes but did nothing for the rest of our faces i expected a case of windburn before the game was played out we were two thousand feet up five miles from horse well ahead of the taken i could see traces of dust raised by darlings army again i shouted what for the bottom fell out the lady had extinguished the spells which made the carpet go thats why youll fly the boat when we hit the null what the hell she gave me a half dozen shots at getting the hang of it and i did see the theory before she whipped toward the rebel army we circled once at screaming speed well outside the null i was astounded at what darling had put together about fifty windwhales including some monsters over a thousand feet long manias by the hundred a vast wedge of walking trees battalions of human soldiers menhirs by the hundred flickering around the walking trees shielding them thousands of things that leaped and hopped and glided and flopped and flew so gruesome and wondrous a sight on the westward leg of our circle i spied the imperial force two thousand men in a phalanx on the foreslope of a ridge a mile ahead of the rebel a joke them standing against darling a few bold mantas cruised the edge of the null sniping with bolts that fell short or just missed i judged darling herself to be aboard a wind whale about a thousand feet up she had grown stronger for her nulls diameter had expanded since my departure from the plain all that bewildering rebel array marched within its protection the lady had called us pathfinders our carpet was not equipped like the others but i did not know what she meant till she did it we climbed straight up little black balls trailing streamers of red or blue smoke scattered behind us shoveled overboard hastily by the old sergeant must have been three hundred the smoke balls scattered hovered just feet short of the null so markers by which the taken could navigate and here they came way up the smaller surrounding the w formation of bigs the men on the bigs began releasing the giant pots down down down went a score we followed sliding along outside the smudge pots as they plummeted the flowerpots turned poledownward mantas and whales slid out of their way when the pole hit ground it drove a plunger the paraffin seals burst liquid squirted the plunger hit a striker the fluid ignited gouts of fire and when that fire reached something inside the pots they exploded shards cut down men and monsters i watched the blooming of those flowers of fire aghast above the taken wheeled for a second pass there was no magic in this the null was useless the second fall drew lightning from whales and mantas their first few successes cured them though for the pots they hit exploded in the air mantas went down one whale was in grave trouble till others maneuvered overhead and sprayed it with ballast water the taken made a third pass again dropping pots they would hammer darlings troops into slime unless she did something she went up after the taken the smoke pots slid around the flanks of the null outlining it completely the lady climbed at shrieking speed the w of bigs went away the smaller carpets took on more altitude the lady brought us into position behind whisper and the limper clearly she had anticipated darlings response my emotions were mixed to say the least whispers carpet tipped its nose downward limper followed then the lady others of the taken followed us whisper dove toward one especially monstrous windwhale faster and faster she flew three hundred yards from the null two thirtyfoot spears ripped away from her carpet impelled by sorcery when they hit the null they continued on in a normal ballistic trajectory whisper made no effort to avoid the null into it she plunged the man in her second seal guiding the carpels fall wilh those fish fins whispers spears struck near the windwhales head both burst into flames fire is anathema to those monsters for the gas that lifts them is violently explosive the limper trailed whisper with elan he loosed two spears outside the null and another two inside just dropped as his secondseat man took the carpet within inches of the windwhale only one lance failed to strike home the whale had five fires burning upon its back storms of lightning crackled round whisper and limper then we hit the null our buoying spells failed panic snatched at me up to me we were headed for the burning whale i jerked and banged and kicked levers not so violently the lady yelled smoothly gently i got it in hand as the whale roared upward past us lightning crackled we passed between two smaller whales they missed us the lady discharged her little ballista its bolt struck one of those monsters what the hell was the point i wondered that was not a bee sting to one of them but that quarrel had a wire attached running off a reel wham i was blinded momenlarily my hair crackled direct hit from a manta bolt were dead i thought the metal cage surrounding us absorbed the lightnings energy and passed it along the unwinding wire a manta was on our tail only yards behind the sergeant ripped off a shaft it look our pursuer under the wing the beast began to slide and flutter like a onewinged butterfly watch where were going the lady yelled i turned around a windwhale back rushed toward us fledgling mantas scurried in panic rebel bowmen threw up a barrage of arrows i hit and yanked every damned lever and pedal and pissed my pants maybe that did it we scraped the things flank but did not crash now the damned carpet began spinning and tumbling earth sky windwhales swirled around us in one glimpse way up i saw a windwhales side explode saw the monster fold in the middle raining gobbets of fire two more whales trailed smoke but it was a picture there and gone in a moment i could find none of it when the carpel again rolled to where i could see the sky we began our plunge from high enough that i had time to calm down i fiddled with levers and pedals got some of the wild spin off then it did not matter we were out of the null and it was the ladys craft again i looked back to see how the sergeant was he gave me a dirty look shook his head pityingly the look the lady gave me was not encouraging either we climbed and moved westward the taken assembled observed the results of their attack only the one windwhale was destroyed the other two managed to get under friends who doused them with ballast water even so the survivors were demoralized they had done the taken no injury at all still they came on this time the taken dropped to the surface and attacked from below building speed from several miles away then curving up through the null i maneuvered between whales with a more delicate hand but still fell dangerously near the ground what are we doing this for i yelled we were not attacking we were just following whisper and limper for the hell of it for the sheer hell of it and so you can write about it ill fake it she laughed we went high and circled darling took the whales back down that second pass slew two more down low the taken could not throw themselves all the way through the null none but limper that is he played the daredevil he backed off five miles and built a tremendous velocity before hitting the null he made that pass while the bigs were dropping the last of their pots ive never heard darling called stupid she did not do the stupid thing this time despite all the flash and excitement it was clear that she could if she wanted press on to horse the taken had expended most of their munitions limper and the bigs were headed back to rearm the others circled horse was darlings if she was willing to pay the price she decided it was too dear wise choice my guess is it would have cost her half her force and windwhales are too rare to give up for a prize so insignificant she turned back the lady broke away and let her go though she could have maintained the attacks almost indefinitely we touched down i scrambled over the side even before the lady and in a calculated melodramatic gesture kissed the ground she laughed she had had a great time you let them go i made my point shell shift tactics of course she will but for the moment the hammer is in my hand by not using it ive told her something shell have thought it over by the time we get there i suppose you didnt do badly for a novice go get drunk or something and stay out of limpers way yeah what i did was go to the quarters assigned me and try to stop shaking chapter fortytwo homecoming the lady and i entered the plain of fear twelve days after the aerial skirmish near horse we traveled on horseback on secondgrade nags along the old trade trail the denizens of the plain respect with free passage most of the time clad in castoffs for the trail the lady was no longer a beauty no kickoutofbed dog but no eyecatcher we entered the plain aware that by a pessimistic estimate we had about three months before the great tragic river opened the great barrow the menhirs noted our presence immediately i sensed them out there observing i had to point it out for this venture the lady had schooled herself to eschew anything but the most direct and raw sensory input she would train herself to mortal ways during our ride so she would make no mistake once we reached the hole the woman has guts i guess anyone willing to play headsup power games with the dominator has to have them i ignored the lurking menhirs and concentrated on explaining the ways of the plain revealing the thousand little traps that at the least might betray the lady it was what a man would do on bringing a newcomer to the land it would not seem unusual three days into the plain we narrowly missed being caught in a change storm she was awed what was that she asked i explained the best i could along with all the speculations she of course had heard it all before but seeing is believing as they say not long after that we came on the first of the coral reefs which meant we were in the deep plain among the great strangenesses what name will you use i asked i better get used to it i think ardath she grinned you have a cruel sense of humor perhaps i do believe she was having fun at pretending to be ordinary like some great lords lady slumming she even took her turns at the cook fire to my stomachs despair i wondered what the menhirs made of our relationship no matter the pretense there was a brittleness a formality that was hard to overcome and the best we could fake was a partnership which i am certain they found strange when did man and woman travel together thus without sharing bedroll and such the question of pursuing verisimilitude that far never arose and just as well my panic my terror at the suggestion would have been such that nothing else would have arisen ten miles from the hole we breasted a hill and encountered a menhir it stood beside the way twenty feet of weird stone doing nothing the lady asked in touristy fashion is that one of the talking stones yep hi rock im home old rock didnt have anything to say we passed on when i looked back it was gone little had changed as we crested the last ridge though we saw a forest of walking trees crowding the creek a stand of menhirs both living and dead guarded the crossing the backwards camelcentaurs gamboled among them old father tree stood by himself tinkling though there was not a breath of wind up high a single buzzardlike avian soared against shattered clouds watching one or another of its kind had followed us for days of a human presence there was no sign what did darling do with her army she could not pack those men into the hole for a moment i was frightened that i had returned to an untenanted keep then as we splashed across the creek elmo and silent stepped out of the coral i dove off my animal and gathered them into a monster hug they returned it and in best black company tradition did not ask a single question goddamn i said goddamn its good to see you i heard you guys was wiped out out west somewhere elmo looked at the lady with just the slightest hint of curiosity oh elmo silent this is ardath she smiled so pleased to meet you croaker has said so much about you i had not said a word but she had read the annals she dismounted and offered her hand each took it baffled for only darling in their experience expected treatment as an equal well lets go down i said lets go down ive got a thousand things to report yeah elmo said and that said a lot for he looked up our backtrail as he said it some people who had gone away with me had not come back i dont know we had half the taken after us we got separated i couldnt find them again but i never heard anything about them being captured lets go down see darling ive got incredible news and get me something to eat weve been eating each others cooking forever and shes a worse cook than i am guck elmo said and slapped me across the back and you lived im one tough old buzzard elmo you ought to know shit man i i realized i was chattering like a whacko i grinned silent signed welcome home croaker welcome home come i told the lady as we reached the entrance to the hole and took her hand itll seem like the pit till your eyes get used to it and brace yourself for the smell gods the stench gag a maggot all kinds of excitement down below it faded into studied indifference as we passed then resumed behind us silent led straight to the conference room elmo split off to order us up something to eat as we entered i realized that i still held the ladys hand she gave me half a smile in which there was a hell of a lot of nervousness talk about strutting into the dragons lair bold old croaker gave her hand a squeeze darling looked ragged so did the lieutenant a dozen others were there few of whom i knew they must have come aboard after the imperials evacuated the perimeter of the plain darling hugged me for a long time so long i became flustered we are not touchy people she and i she finally backed off and gave the lady a look in which there was a hint of jealousy i signed this is ardath she will help me translate she knows the old languages well darling nodded she asked no questions so much was i trusted the food arrived elmo dragged in a table and chairs and shooed out everyone but myself the lieutenant himself silent and the lady he might have sent her away too but remained unsure of her standing with me we ate and as we did i related my tale in snatches when my hands and mouth were not full there were some rough moments especially when i told darling that raven was alive in retrospect i think it was harder on me than on her i was afraid she would get all excited and hysterical she did nothing of the sort first she flat refused to believe me and i could understand that for till he disappeared raven had been the cornerstone of her universe emotionally she could not see him not including her in his biggest lie ever just so he could slip away to go poke around the barrowland that made no sense to her raven never lied to her before made no sense to me either but then as i have noted before i suspected there was more in the shadows than anyone was admitting i sniffed the faintest whiff that maybe raven was running from instead of to darlings denials did not last long she is not one to disdain truth indefinitely only because it is unpleasant she handled the pain far better than i anticipated and that suggested maybe she had had a chance to bleed off some of the worst in the past still ravens present circumstances did nothing for darlings emotional health already doing poorly after her defeat at horse that harbinger of grander defeats to come already she suspected she might have to face the imperials without benefit of the information i had been sent to acquire i conjured universal despair when i announced my failure and added i have it on high authority that what we sought isnt in those papers anyway though i cant be sure till ardath and i finish what we have here i did sketch what i learned from ravens documents before losing them i did not lie outright that would not be forgiven later when the truth came out as inevitably it must i just overlooked a few details i even admitted having been captured questioned and imprisoned what the hell are you doing here then elmo demanded how come youre even alive they turned us loose ardath and me after that business you had near horse that was a message im supposed to deliver another such as unless youre blind and stupid youll have noticed that youre not under attack the lady has ordered all operations against the rebellion ceased why you havent been paying attention because the dominator is stirring come on croaker we finished that business in juniper i went to the barrowland i saw for myself lieutenant that thing is going to break loose one of its creatures is out already maybe dogging oneeye and them im convinced the dominator is a step from breaking out and not halfassed like in juniper i turned to the lady ardath what was that i figured i lost track of how long weve been in the plain it was about ninety days when we came in it took you eight days to get here elmo said i lifted an eyebrow the menhirs of course eight days then away from ninety for a worstcase scenario eightytwo days till the great barrow opens i went into more detail about the great tragic river floods the lieutenant was not convinced neither was elmo and you cannot blame them the lady weaves crafty intricate plots and they were sneaky guys who judged others by themselves i did not proselytize i was not wholeheartedly bornagain myself it was of little consequence whether or not those two believed anyway darling makes the decisions she signed for everyone to leave but me i asked elmo to show ardath around and find her a place to bunk he looked at me oddly like everyone else he figured id brought me home a girlfriend i had trouble keeping a straight face all those years they have ridden me because of a few romances written when first we entered the ladys service and now id brought her home i figured darling wanted to talk about raven i was not wrong but she surprised me by signing she has sent you to propose an alliance has she not quick little devil not exactly though in practice it would amount to that i went into the details known and reasoned of the situation signing is not quick work but darling remained attentive and patient not at all distracted by whatever was going on inside her she took me over the value or lack thereof of my document cache not once did she ask about raven nor about ardath though my friend was on her mind too she signed she is correct in saying that our feud becomes inconsequential if the dominator rises my question must be is the threat genuine or a ploy we know just how convoluted a scheme she can manage i am sure i signed in reply because raven was sure he had made up his mind before the ladys people began to suspect in factas far as i can tell he developed the evidence that convinced them goblin and oneeye are they safe as far as i know i never heard of them being captured they should be getting close those documents they are the crux still even if they do not contain the secret of her name but only that of her husband she wants access i would assume so i was released for some reason though i cannot say what the reason behind the reason was darling nodded so i thought yet i am convinced that she is honest in this that we must consider the dominator the more dangerous and immediate peril it should not be too difficult to anticipate most of the ways she could become treacherous and there is raven here it comes i thought yes i will reflect croaker there is not much time there is all the time in the world in a way i will reflect you and your lady friend translate i felt i had been dismissed before we got to why she wanted to see me privately the woman has a face like stone you cant tell much about what is going on inside i moved toward the door slowly croaker she signed wait i stopped this was it what is she croaker damn ducked around it again chills on my part guilt i did not want to lie outright just a woman not a special woman a special friend i guess she is special in her way i see ask silent to come in again i went slowly nodding but it was not till i actually started to open the door that she beckoned me back in accordance with instructions i sat she did not she paced she signed you think i am cold toward great news you think ill of me because i am not excited that raven is alive no i thought it would shock you that it would cause you great distress shock no i am not entirely surprised distressed yes it opens old wounds and makes them more painful puzzled i watched as she continued to prowl our raven he never grew up fearless as a stone utterly without the handicap of a conscience tough smart hard fierce all those things yes yes and a coward what how can you he runs away there were machinations around the limper which pulled his wife in years ago did he try to discover the truth and work it out he killed people and ran away with the black company to kill more people he abandoned two babies without a word of goodbye she was hot now she was opening the doors on secrets and spilling stuff of which i had seen only the vaguest glimmering reflections do not defend him i have had the power to investigate and i did she signed he fled the black company for my sake as much excuse to avoid entanglement as reason why did he salvage me in that village because of guilt over children he had abandoned i was a safe child and while a child i remained a safe emotional investment but i did not remain a child croaker and i knew no other man in all those years in hiding i should have known better i saw how he pushed people away if they tried to get close in any way that was not completely onesided and under his control but after the horrible things he did in juniper i thought i could be the one to redeem him on the road south when we were running from the dark danger of the lady and light danger of the company i betrayed my true feelings i opened the lid on a chest of dreams nurtured from a time before i was old enough to think about men he became a changed man a frightened animal caught in a cage he was relieved when news came that the lieutenant had appeared with some of the company it was not but a matter of hours before he was dead i suspected then i think a part of me always knew and that is why i am not so devastated now as you want yes i know you know i cry myself to sleep sometimes i cry for a little girls dreams i cry because the dreams will not die though i am powerless to make them come true i cry because the one thing i truly want i cannot have do you understand i thought about lady and ladys situation and nodded i signed nothing back i am going to cry again go out please tell silent to come i did not have to look for him he was waiting in the conference room i watched him go inside wondering if i was seeing things or seeing things shed certainly given me something to think about chapter fortythree picnic put on any deadline and time accelerates the clockwork of the universe runs off an overwound mainspring four days went down the jakes zip and i did not waste much time sleeping ardath and i translated and translated and translated she read translating aloud i wrote till my hands cramped occasionally silent took over for me i spotchecked by slipping in documents already done especially those both tracker and i had worked not once did i catch a misinterpretation that fourth morning i did catch something we were doing one of those lists this soiree must have been so big that if held today wed call it a war or at least a riot on and on soandso of suchandsuch with lady whosis sixteen titles four of which made sense by the time the heralds finished proclaiming everyone the party must have died or encroaching senility anyway along about the middle of the list i heard a little catch in her breath aha i said to myself a bolt strikes close my ears pricked up she went on smoothly moments later i was not sure i had not imagined it reason told me the name that startled her would not be the one she was speaking she was toddling along at my writing pace her eyes would be well ahead of my hand not one of the names that followed clanged any bell i would go over the list later just in case hoping she had deleted something no such luck come afternoon she said break croaker im going for tea you want some sure maybe a hunk of bread too i scribbled another half minute before realizing what had happened what the lady herself offering to fetch me putting in an order without thinking i got a case of the nerves how much was she roleplaying how much pretending for fun it must be centuries since she got her own tea if ever i rose started to follow halted outside my cell door fifteen steps down the tunnel in the grungy feeble lamplight otto had cornered her against the wall he was talking some shit why i had not foreseen the problem i do not know i doubted that she had surely it was not one she faced normally otto got pushy i started to go break it up then vacillated she might be angered by my interference a light step from the other direction elmo he paused otto was too singleminded to notice us better do something elmo said we dont need that kind of trouble she did not appear frightened or upset i think maybe she can handle it otto got a no that could not be misinterpreted but he did not accept it he tried to lay hands on he got a ladylike slap for his trouble which angered him he decided to take what he wanted as elmo and i moved forward he disappeared in a flurry of kicks and punches that set him down in the muck on the floor holding his belly with one arm and that arm with the other ardath went on as though nothing had happened i said i told you she could handle it remind me not to overstep myself elmo said then he grinned and tapped my arm bet shes mean on the horizontal eh damned if i did not blush i gave him a foolish grin it only confirmed his suspicions what the hell anything would have that is the way those things go we lugged otto to my room i thought he would puke up his guts but he controlled himself i checked for broken bones he was just bruised all yours elmo i said for i knew the old sergeant was rehearsing a few choice words he took otto by the elbow and said step down to my office soldier he started dirt tumbling from the tunnel overheads when he explained the facts of life when ardath returned she behaved as if nothing had happened perhaps she missed us watching but after half an hour she asked can we take a break go outside walk you want me to come she nodded we need to talk privately all right to tell the truth whenever i lifted my nose from my work i got a little claustrophobic myself my venture westward reminded me how good it is to stretch ones legs hungry i asked too serious to make a picnic she looked startled then charmed by the idea good lets do that so we went to the cook and baker and filled a bucket and went topside though she did not notice everyone smirking i did there is but one door in the hole to the conference room behind which darlings personal quarters lie neither my quarters nor ardaths had so much as a curtain closure folks figured we were off for the privacy of the wide open spaces dream on up there there would be more spectators than down below they just would not be human the sun was maybe three hours short of setting when we stepped outside and it smacked us right in the eyes rough but i expected it should have warned her we strolled up the creek breathing slightly sagey air and saying nothing the desert was silent not even father tree stirred the breeze was insufficient to sigh in the coral after a while i said well i needed to get out the walls were closing in the null made it worse i feel helpless down there it preys on the mind oh we rounded a coral head and encountered a menhir one of my old buddies i guess for he reported there are strangers on the plain croaker no lie then which strangers rock but it had nothing more to say theyre always like that or worse well the null begins to fade feel better i felt better the moment i stepped outside thats the gate to hell how can you people live like that it isnt much but its home we came to bare earth she halted whats this old father tree you know what they think were up to down there i know let them think it call it protective coloration that is your father tree she indicated himself thats him i walked on how you doing today oldtimer must be fifty times i have asked that i mean the old guy is remarkable but just a tree right i did not expect a response but father trees leaves started tinkling the moment i spoke come back here croaker the ladys voice was commanding hard a little shaken i turned and marched back to your old self from the corner of my eye i caught a shadow in motion off toward the hole i concentrated on a bit of coral and nearby brush keep your voice down we have an eavesdropper thats no surprise she spread the ragged blanket she had brought sat down with her toes right at the edge of the barren she removed the rag covering the bucket i settled beside her positioned so i could watch that shadow do you know what that is she asked nodding at the tree nobody does its just old father tree the desert clans call him a god weve seen no evidence of that oneeye and goblin were impressed with the fact that he stands almost exactly on the geographical center of the plain though yes i suppose so much was lost in the fall i should have suspected my husband was not the first of his kind croaker nor the white rose the first of hers it is a grand cycle i believe youve lost me a very long time ago even as i measure time there was another war like that between the dominator and the white rose the light overcame the shadow but as always the shadow left its taint on the victors in order to end the struggle they summoned a thing from another world plane dimension whathaveyou the way goblin might conjure a demon only this thing was an adolescent god of sorts in a sapling avatar these events were legendary only in my youth when much more of the past survived so details are open to question but it was a summoning of such scope and such price that thousands perished and counties were devastated but they planted their captive god over the grave of their great enemy where it would keep him enchained this treegod would live a million years you mean old father is sitting on something like the great barrow i did not connect the legends and the plain till i saw that tree yes this earth constrains something as virulent as my husband so much suddenly makes sense it all fits the beasts the impossible talking rocks coral reefs a thousand miles from the sea it all leaked through from that other world the change storms are the trees dreams she rattled on not so much explaining as putting things together for herself i gaped and remembered the change storm that caught me on the way west was i accursed to be caught in a gods nightmare this is crazy i said and at the same instant decrypted the shape i had been trying to pry from the shadows bushes and coral silent squatting on his hams motionless as a snake awaiting prey silent who had been everywhere i went the last three days like an extra shadow seldom noticed because he was silent well so much for my confidence that my return with a companion had tickled no suspicions this is a bad place to be croaker very bad tell that deaf peasant wench to move if i did that i would have to explain why and reveal who gave me the advice i doubt she would be impressed i suppose youre right well it wont matter much longer lets eat she opened a packet and set out what looked like fried rabbit but there are no rabbits on the plain for all they got kicked around their adventure toward horse improved the larder i dug in silent remained motionless in the comer of my eye you bastard i thought i hope youre drooling three pieces of rabbit later i slowed enough to ask that about the oldtimer is interesting but does it have any relevance father tree was raising a ruckus i wondered why are you afraid of him she did not answer i chucked bones down the creek bank rose back in a minute i stomped over to father tree oldtimer you got any seeds any sprouts a little something we could take to the barrowland to plant on top of our own villain talking to that tree all those times heading past was a game i was possessed of an almost religious awe of its age but of no conscious belief in it as anything like either the nomads or the lady claimed just a gnarly old tree with weird leaves and a bad temper temper when i touched it to lean against it while looking up among its bizarre leaves for nuts or seeds it bit me well not with teeth but sparks flew the tips of my fingers stung when i took them out of my mouth they looked burned damn i muttered and backed off a few steps nothing personal tree thought you might want to help out vaguely i was aware that a menhir now stood near silents lurking place more appeared around the barren area something hit me with the force of windwhale ballast dumped from a hundred feet up i went down waves of power of thought beat upon me i whimpered tried to crawl toward the lady she extended a hand but would not cross that boundary some of that power began to hint at comprehensibility but it was like being inside fifty minds at once with them scattered across the world no the plain and more than fifty minds as it became more melded more meshed i was touching the menhir minds that all faded the sledge of power ceased hammering the anvil that was me i scrambled for the edge of the barren though i knew that line demarked no true safety i reached the blanket caught my breath finally turned to face the tree its leaves tinkled in exasperation what happened basically he told me hes doing what he can not for our sake but for that of his creatures that i should go to hell leave him alone quit aggravating him or find my ass in deep shit oh my i had looked back to see how silent had taken my encounter i warned she glanced back too i think we maybe got trouble maybe they recognized you almost everyone from the hole had appeared they were lining up across the trail the menhirs were more numerous walking trees were forming a circle with us at its center and we were unarmed for darling was there we were inside the null again she had on her white linen she stepped past elmo and the lieutenant and came toward me silent joined her behind her came oneeye goblin tracker and toadkiller dog those four still had the dust of the trail upon them they had been on the plain for days and i had been given no word you talk about your trapdoor on your gallows dropping unexpectedly for fifteen seconds i stood there with my mouth open then i asked what do we do in a soft squeak she startled me by taking my hand i bet and lost i dont know theyre your people bluff oh her eyes narrowed her stare fixed became intense then a thin smile stretched her lips i see what some answers the shadow of what my husband is about you have been manipulated more than you know he anticipated being found out with his weather once he had your raven he decided to bring your peasant girl to him yes i think come my old comrades did not appear hostile only puzzled the circle continued to close the lady caught my hand again led me to the base of old father tree she whispered let there be peace between us while you observe ancient one one comes whom you will remember of old and to me there are many old shadows in the world some reach back to the dawn not big enough they seldom draw attention like my husband or the taken soulcatcher had minions who antedated the tree they were interred with her i told you i recognized the way those bodies were torn i stood there in the bloody light of the fading sun baffled all to hell she might as well have been speaking uchitelle darling silent oneeye and goblin came right to us elmo and the lieutenant halted within a rocks throw but tracker and toadkiller dog sort of melted into the crowd what is going on i signed at darling obviously frightened that is what we want to find out we have been getting disjointed nonsensical reports from the menhirs since goblin oneeye and tracker reached the plain on one hand goblin and oneeye confirm everything you told metill you parted ways i glanced at my two friendsand saw no friendship there their eyes were cold and glassy like somebody else had moved in behind them company elmo called without shouting a pair of taken aboard boatcarpets cruised some distance away they came no closer the ladys hand twitched she controlled herself otherwise they remained far enough out not to be recognizable more than one pair of hands is stirring this stew i said silent get to the point right now youre scaring the crap out of me he signed the rumor is strong in the empire that you have sold out that you have brought someone highup here to assassinate darling maybe even one of the new taken i could not help grinning the planters of rumors had not dared tell the whole tale the grin convinced silent he knew me well which i guess was why he was watching me darling too relaxed but neither oneeye nor goblin softened whats wrong with these guys silent they look like zombies they say you sold them out that tracker saw you that if bullshit where the hell is tracker get that big stupid sonofabitch out here and let him say that to my face the light was weakening the fat tomato of a sun had slipped behind the hills soon it would be dark i felt a creepy tingle against my back was the damned tree going to act up once i thought of him i sensed an intense interest upon old father trees part also a sort of dreamy rage coalescing suddenly menhirs flickered around all over the place even across the creek where the brush was dense a dog yelped silent signed something to elmo i did not catch it because his back was turned elmo trotted toward the turmoil the menhirs worked our way forming a wall herding something well tracker and toadkiller dog tracker looked vacuously puzzled the mutt kept trying to scoot between the menhirs they would not let him our people had to stay light on their feet to keep from getting their toes squashed the menhirs pushed toadkiller dog and tracker into the barren circle the mongrel let out one long despairing howl tucked his tail between his legs and slunk into trackers shadow they stood about ten feet from darling oh gods the lady murmured and squeezed my hand so hard i almost yelled the kernel of a change storm exploded in old father trees tinkly hair it was huge it was horrible it was violent it devoured us all with such ferocity we could do nothing but endure it shapes shifted ran changed yet those nearest darling stayed exactly the same tracker screamed toadkiller dog unleashed a howl that spread terror like a cancer and they changed the most into the identical vile and violent monsters i saw while westward bound the lady shouted something lost in the rage of the storm but i caught its triumphal note she did know those shapes i stared at her she had not changed that seemed impossible this creature about whom i had been silly for fifteen years could not be the real woman toadkiller dog flung himself into the jaws of the storm hideous fangs bared trying to reach the lady he knew her too he meant to finish her while she was helpless inside the null tracker shambled after just as puzzled as the tracker that looked human had been one of father trees great branches whipped down it batted toadkiller dog the way a man might bat an attack bunny three times toadkiller dog gave it the valiant try three times he failed the fourth time what might have been the grandfather of all lightning bolts met him squarely and hurled him all the way to the creek where he smouldered and twitched for a minute before rising and howling away into the enemy desert at the same time trackerbeast went for darling he gathered her up and headed west when toadkiller dogbeast went out of the game tracker got all the attention old father tree may not be a god but when he talks he has the voice coral reefs crumbled when he spoke everyone outside the barren grabbed their ears and screamed for us who were closer it was less tormenting i do not know what he said the language was none i knew and it sounded like none i had ever heard but it got through to tracker he put darling down and came back into the teeth of the storm to stand before the god while that great voice hammered him and violent violet echoed round his misshapen bones he bowed and did homage to the tree and then he did change the storm died as swiftly as it had began everyone collapsed even the lady but unconsciousness did not come with collapse by the wan light remaining i saw the circling taken decide their hour had come they fell back gathered velocity cut a ballistic chord through the null each loosing four of those thirtyfoot spears meant for shattering windwhales and i sat on the hard ground drooling hand in hand with their target through sheer will i guess the lady managed to murmur they can read the future as well as i which made no sense at the time i overlooked that eight shafts arced down father tree responded two carpets disintegrated beneath their riders the shafts exploded so high that none of their fiery charge reached the ground the taken did though they plunged in neat arcs into a dense coral reef east of us then the sleepiness came the last thing i recall was that the glaze had left the three eyes of goblin and oneeye chapter fortyfour the quickening there were dreams endless horrible dreams someday if i live so long if i survive what is yet to come i may record them for they were the story of a god that is a tree and of the thing his roots bind no i think not one life of struggle and horror is enough to report and this one goes on the lady stirred first she reached over pinched me the pain wakened my nerves she gasped in a voice so soft i barely heard it get up help me we have to move your white rose made no sense the null i was shivering i thought it was reaction to whatever struck me down the thing below is of this world the tree is not wasnt me shivering it was the ground ever so gently and rapidly and now i became aware of a sound something far away deep down i began to get the idea fear is one hell of a motivator i got my feet under me above the tinkle of old father tree beat maddeningly there was panic in his windchimes song the lady rose too we staggered toward darling supporting one another each groggy step spiced more life into my sluggish blood i looked into darlings eyes she was aware yet paralyzed her face was frozen halfway between fear and disbelief we hoisted her up each slipping an arm around her the lady began counting steps i remember no other labor so damnably great i do not recall another time when i ran so much on will alone the shaking of the earth waxed rapidly into the shudder of passing horsemen then to a landslides uproar then to an earthquake the ground around father tree began to writhe and buckle a gout of flame and dust blasted upward the tree tinkled a shriek blue lightning rioted in his hair we pressed even harder in our flight down and across the creek something behind us began to scream images in mind that which was rising was in agony father tree subjected it to the torments of hell but it came on determined to be free i no longer looked back my terror was too great i did not want to see what an ancient dominator looked like we made it gods somehow the lady and i got darling sufficiently far away for father tree to regain his full otherworldly power the shriek rose rapidly in pitch and fury i fell down grasping my ears and then it went away after a time the lady said croaker go see if you can help the others its safe the tree won that quickly out of that much fury getting my feet under me seemed an allnight job a blue nimbus still shimmered among father trees branches you could feel his aggravation from two hundred yards its weight grew as i moved nearer the ground around the trees feet hardly seemed disturbed considering the violence of moments ago it looked freshly plowed and harrowed was all some of my friends were partially buried but no one appeared injured everyone was moving at least a little faces looked wholly stunned except truckers that ugly character had not resumed his fake human form he was up early placidly helping the others dusting their clothing with hearty friendly slaps you would not have known that a short time before he had been a deadly enemy weird nobody needed any help except the walking trees and menhirs the trees had been overturned the menhirs many of them were down too and unable to right themselves that gave me a chill i got me another shudder when i neared the old tree reaching out of the ground fumbling at the bark of a root was a human hand and forearm long leathery greenish with nails grown to claws then broken and bleeding upon father tree it did not belong to anyone from the hole it twitched feebly now blue sparks continued to crackle above something about that hand stirred the old beast within me i wanted to run away shrieking or seize an axe and mutilate it i took neither course for i got the distinct feeling that father tree was watching me and glowering more than a little and maybe blaming me personallike for wakening the thing to which the hand belonged im going i said know how you feel got my own old monster to keep down and i backed away bowing some each three or four steps what the hell was that i whirled oneeye was staring at me he had a croakerisuptoanotherofhiscrazies look just chatting with the tree i looked around people seemed to be finding their sea legs some of the less flustered were starting to right the walking trees for the fallen menhirs though there seemed no hope those had gone to whatever reward a sentient stone may expect later they would be discovered righted standing among the other dead menhirs near the creek ford i returned to darling and the lady darling was slow to come around too groggy to communicate yet the lady asked everyone all right except the guy in the ground and he came close to making himself well i described the hand she nodded thats a mistake not likely to be made again soon silent and several others had gathered around so we could say little that would not sound suspect i did murmur what now in the background i heard the lieutenant and elmo hollering about getting some torches out to shed a little light she shrugged what about the taken you want to go after them hell no but we cant have them running around loose in our backyard either no telling the menhirs will watch them wont they that depends on how pissed the old tree is maybe hes ready to let us go to hell in a bucket after this you might find out ill go goblin queaked he wanted an excuse to put a lot of yards between him and the tree dont take all night i said why dont the rest of you help elmo and the lieutenant that got rid of some folks but not silent there was no way i was going to get silent out of sight of darling he had some reservations still i chaffed darlings wrists and did other silly things when time was the only cure after some minutes i mumbled seventyeight days and the lady before long it will be too late i lifted an eyebrow he cant be beaten without her it wont be long before the hardest ride wont get her there in time i do not know what silent made of that exchange i do know that the lady looked up at him and smiled thinly with that look she gets when she knows your thoughts we need the tree and we didnt get to finish our picnic huh she went away for a few minutes when she returned she had the blanket dirtier than ever and the bucket she snagged my hand and headed for the dark you watch for the traps she told me what the hell was this game chapter fortyfive bargain struck later a broken boat of a moon arose we did not go far before it did for there was not enough starlight to risk much movement once the moon did rise the lady guided me in a slow circle toward where the taken had come down we halted in a clear area sandy but not dangerous she spread the blanket we were outside the null sit i sat she sat i asked what be quiet she closed her eyes and went inside herself i wondered if silent had torn himself away from darling to stalk us wondered if my comrades were making crude jokes about us as they labored over the walking trees wondered what the hell kind of game had me caught in its toils you learned something out of it anyway croaker after a while i realized she was back from wherever she had gone i am amazed she whispered who would have thought they had the guts eh our skyborne friends i expected limper and whisper up to their old crimes but i got scorn and blister though i might have suspected her had i thought necromancy is her great talent another round of her thinking aloud i wondered if she did that often i am sure she was unaccustomed to having witnesses around if she did what do you mean she ignored me i wonder if they told the others i harkened back put a few things together the ladys divinations about three possible futures and no place in any of them maybe that meant there was no place in them for taken either and maybe they figured they could take their futures into their own hands by ridding themselves of their mistress a light step startled me but i did not get excited i just figured silent had chosen to follow so i was very surprised when darling sat down with us unchaperoned how had i overlooked the return of the null distracted of course the lady said as though darling had not appeared they havent yet gotten out of the coral its very slow going and theyre both injured and though the coral cant kill them it can cause a lot of pain right now theyre lying up waiting for first light so so maybe they wont get out at all darling can read lips she knows already well i have said a thousand times that the girl is not stupid i think darlings knowledge was implicit in the position she took she placed me squarely in the gap between them oh yeah i found myself playing interpreter trouble is i cannot record what went back and forth because someone tampered with my memories later i got only one chance to make notes and those now make no sense some sort of negotiation took place i can still conjure a sense of profound astonishment at darlings willingness to deal also an amazement at the lady for the same reason they reached an accommodation an uneasy one to be sure for the lady henceforth stuck very close and kept me between her and anyone else while she was within the null great feeling knowing youre a human shield and darling kept near the lady to prevent her calling on her power but she did turn her loose once that is getting ahead slightly first we all sneaked back not letting anyone know there had been summit the lady and i returned after darling trying to look like we had had an energetic and thorough encounter i could not help chuckling at some envious looks the lady and i went outside the null again next morning after darling distracted silent oneeye and goblin by sending them to dicker with the menhirs father tree could not make up his mind we went the other direction and tracked taken actually there was little tracking to do they were not yet free of the coral the lady called upon that power she held over them and they ceased to be taken her patience was exhausted maybe she wanted them to serve as an object lesson in any event buzzardsreal buzzardswere circling before we returned to the hole that easy i thought for her and for me when i tried to kill the limper with every damned thing going my way impossible she and i went back to translating so busy did we stay that i did not remain abreast of the news from outside i was a little vacant anyway because she had expunged my memories of the meeting with darling anyhow somehow the white rose got right with father tree the shaky alliance survived one thing i did notice the menhirs stopped ragging me about strangers on the plain they meant tracker and toadkiller dog all the time and the lady two of three were no longer strangers no one knew what had become of toadkiller dog even the menhirs could not trace him i tried to get tracker to explain the name he could not remember not even toadkiller dog himself weird he was the trees creature now chapter fortysix son of the tree i was nervous i had trouble sleeping days were slipping away out west the great tragic was gnawing its banks a fourlegged monster was running to its overlord with news that it had been found out darling and the lady were doing nothing raven remained trapped bomanz remained trapped in the long fires he had called down on his own head the end of the world tramped ever closer and nobody was doing anything i completed my translations and was no wiser than before it seemed though silent goblin and oneeye kept fooling with charts of names crossindexing seeking patterns the lady watched over their shoulders more than did i i fiddled with these annals i bothered myself with how to phrase a request for the return of those i had lost at queens bridge i fussed i grew ever more antsy people became irritated with me i began taking moonlight walks to work off my nervous energy one night the moon was full a fat orange bladder just scaling the hills to the east a grand sight especially with patrolling manias crossing its face for some reason the desert had a lilac luminescence upon all its edges the air was chill there was a dust of powder swirling on the breeze fallen that afternoon a change storm flickered far away to the north a menhir appeared beside me i jumped three feet strangers on the plain rock i asked none stranger than you croaker i get a comedian you want something no the father of trees wants you yeah see you heart pounding i headed toward the hole another menhir blocked the path well since you put it that way faking bravery i headed upstream they would have herded me best accept the inevitable less humiliation the wind was bitter around the barren but when i crossed the boundary it was like stepping into summer no wind at all though the old tree was tinkling and heat like a furnace the moon had risen enough to flood the barren with light now argent i approached the tree my gaze fixed on that hand and forearm still protruding still gripping a root still it seemed betraying the occasional feeble twitch the root had grown though and seemed to be enveloping the hand as a tree used for a line post will envelope a wire tacked to it i stopped five feet from the tree come closer it said in plain voice in conversational tone and volume i said yipe and looked for the exits about two skillion menhirs surrounded the barren so much for running away stand still ephemeral my feet froze to the ground ephemeral eh you asked help you demanded help you whined and pleaded and begged for help stand still and accept it come closer make up your mind i took two steps another would have me climbing him i have considered this thing you ephemera fear in the ground so far from here would be a peril to my creatures if it rose i sense no significant strength in those who resist it therefore i hated to interrupt but i just had to scream you see something had me by the ankle it was squeezing so hard i felt the bones grinding crushing sorry about that oldtimer the universe turned blue i rolled in a hurricane of anger lightning roared in father trees branches thunder rolled across the desert i yelled some more bolts of blue hammered around me crisping me almost as much as my tormentor but at last the hand turned me loose i tried to run away one step and down i went i kept on crawling while father tree apologized and tried to call me back like hell i would crawl through the menhirs if i had to my mind filled with a waking dream father tree delivering a message direct then the earth got quiet except for the wish as menhirs vanished big hoopla from the direction of the hole a whole gang charged out to find the cause of the uproar silent reached me first oneeye i said i need oneeye he is the only one beside me with medical training and contrary though he is i could count on him to take medical instructions oneeye showed up in a moment along with twenty others the watch had reacted quickly ankle i told him maybe crushed somebody get some light up here and a damned shovel a shovel are you off your gourd oneeye demanded just get it and do something for the pain elmo materialized still buckling buckles what happened croaker old tree wanted to talk had the rocks bring me over says he wants to help us only while i was listening that hand got ahold of me like to ripped my foot off the racket was the tree saying now stop that thats not polite cut his tongue out after you fix his leg elmo told oneeye what did it want croaker your ears gone to help with the dominator said he thought it over decided it was in his own best interest to keep the dominator down give me a hand up oneeyes efforts were paying dividends he had sponged one of his wild jungle glops onto my ankleit had swollen three times normal size alreadyand the pain was fading elmo shook his head i said ill break your damned leg if you dont get me up so he and silent hoisted me but supported me bring them shovels i said a half dozen had appeared they were entrenching tools not real ditchdiggers you guys insist on helping get me back over to the tree elmo growled for a moment i thought silent might say something i eyed him expectantly smiling i had been waiting twentysome years no luck whatever vow he had taken whatever it was that had driven him to abstain from speech it had put a steel lock on silents jaw i have seen him so pissed he could chew nails so excited he lost sphincter control but nothing has shaken his resolution against talking blue still sparkled in the trees branches leaves tinkled moonlight and torchlight mixed into weird shadows the sparks sent dancing around him i told my body slaves i had not seen it myself so it must be beyond that trunk yep there it was out twenty feet from the base of the tree a sapling it stood about eight feet tall oneeye silent goblin those guys gobbled and gaped like startled apes but not old elmo get a few buckets of water and soak the ground good he said and find an old blanket we can wrap around the roots and the dirt that comes up with them he caught right on damned farmer get me back downstairs i said i want to see this ankle myself in better light going back with elmo and silent carrying me we encountered the lady she put on a suitably solicitous act fussing all over me i had to endure a lot of knowing grins only darling knew the truth even then with maybe a little suspicion on silents part chapter fortyseven shadows in shadowland there was no time inside the barrowland only shadow and fire light without source and endless fear and frustration from where he stood snared in the web of his own device raven could discern a score of domination monsters he could see men and beasts put down in the time of the white rose to prevent those evils from escaping he could see the silhouette of the sorcerer bomanz limned against frozen dragon fire the old wizard still struggled to take one more step toward the heart of the great barrow didnt he know that he had failed generations ago raven wondered how long he had been caught had his messages gotten through would help come was he just marking time till the darkness exploded if there was a clock to count the time it was the growing distress of those set to guard against the darkness the river gnawed ever closer there was nothing they could do no way for them to summon the wrath of the world raven thought he would have done things differently had he been in charge back when vaguely raven recalled some things passing nearby shades like himself but he knew not how long ago or even what they were things moved at times and one could tell nothing certain the world had a whole different look from this perspective never had he been so helpless so frightened he did not like the feeling always he had been master of his destiny dependent upon no one there was in that world nothing to do but think too much too often his thoughts came back to what it meant to be raven to things raven had done and not done and should have done differently there was time to identify and at least confront all the fears and pains and weaknesses of the inside man all of which had created the ice and iron and fearless mask he had presented to the world all those things which had cost him everything he had valued and which had driven him into the fangs of death again and again in selfpunishment too late far too late when his thoughts cleared and coagulated and he reached this point he sent shrieks of anger echoing through the spirit world and those who surrounded him and hated him for what he might have triggered laughed and reveled in his torment chapter fortyeight flight west despite my exoneration by the tree i never quite regained my former status with my comrades always there was a certain reserve perhaps as much from envy of my apparent sudden female wealth as from trust slow to heal i cannot deny the pain it caused me i had been with those guys since i was a boy they were my family i did take some ribbing about getting onto crutches in order to get out of work but my work would have gone on had i had no legs at all those damned papers i had them committed to memory set to music and still i did not have the key we sought nor what the lady hoped to find the crossreferencing was taking forever the spelling of names in predomination and domination times had been freeform kurretelle is one of those languages where various letter combinations can represent identical sounds pain in the damned fundament i do not know how much darling told the others i was not at the big meeting neither was the lady but word came out the company was moving out one day to get ready topside near nightfall on my crutches i watched the windwhales arrive there were eighteen of them all summoned by father tree they came with their mantas and a whole panoply of plain sentient forms three dropped to the ground the hole puked up its contents we began boarding i got a ration because i had to be lifted along with my papers gear and crutches the whale was a small one i would share it with just a few people the lady of course we could not be separated now and goblin and oneeye and silent after a bloody sign battle for he did not want to be separated from darling and tracker and the child of the tree for whom tracker was guardian and i was in loco parentis i think the wizards were supposed to keep an eye on the rest of us though little they could have done had a situation presented itself darling the lieutenant elmo and the other old hands boarded a second windwhale the third carried a handful of troops and a lot of gear we lifted off joined the formation above a sunset from five thousand feet is unlike anything you will see from the ground unless you are atop a very lonely mountain magnificent with darkness came sleep oneeye spelled me under i still had a good deal of swelling and pain yes we were outside the null our whale flew the far flank from darling specifically for the ladys benefit even then she did not give herself away the winds were favorable and we had the blessing of father tree dawn found us passing over horse it was there the truth finally surfaced taken came up all in their fishcarpets armed to the gills panic noises wakened me i got tracker to help me stand after one glance at the fire of the rising sun i spied the taken drifting into guardian positions around our whale goblin and them expected an attack they howled their hearts out somehow oneeye found a way for it all to be goblins fault they went at it but nothing happened almost to my surprise too the taken merely maintained station i glanced at the lady she startled me with a wink then we all have to cooperate whatever our differences goblin heard that he ignored oneeyes ranting for a moment stared at the taken after a bit he looked at the lady really looked i saw the light dawn in a more than normally squeaky voice and with a truly goofy look he said i remember you he remembered the one time he had had a sort of direct contact with her many years ago when he tried to contact soulcatcher he had caught her in the tower in the ladys presence she smiled her most charming smile the one that melts statues goblin threw a hand in front of his eyes turned away from her he looked at me with the most awful expression i could not help laughing you always accused me you didnt have to go and do it croaker his voice climbed the scale till it became inaudible he sat down abruptly no lightning bolt splattered him across the sky after a time he looked up and said elmo is going to crap he giggled elmo was the most unremitting of them all when it came to reminding me of my romances about the lady after the humor went out of it after oneeye had been through it too and silent had had his worst fears confirmed i began to wonder about my friends one and all they were westward bound on darlings sayso they had not been informed in so many words that we were allied with our former enemies fools or was darling what happened once the dominator was down and we were ready to go after each other again whoa croaker darling learned to play cards from raven raven was a cutthroat player it was the forest of cloud by nightfall i wonder what they made of us in lords we passed right over the streets filled with gawkers roses passed in the night then the other old cities of our early years in the north there was little talk the lady and i kept our heads together growing more tense as our strange fleet neared its destination and we drew no nearer unearthing the nuggets we sought how long i asked i had lost track of time fortytwo days she said we were in the desert that long time flies when youre having fun i gave her a startled look a joke even an old cliche from her i hate it when they go human on you enemies are not supposed to do that she had been crawling all over me with it for a couple months how can you hate the weather stayed halfway decent till we got to forsberg then it became clabbered misery it was solid winter up there good briskly refreshing winds loaded up with pellets of powder snow a nice abrasive for a tender face like mine a bombardment to clear out the lice on the backs of the whales too everybody cussed and fussed and grumbled and huddled for warmth that dared not be provided by mans traditional ally fire only tracker seemed untouched dont anything bother that thing i asked in the oddest voice i ever heard her use the lady replied loneliness if you want to kill tracker the easy way lock him up alone and go away i felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather whom did i know who had been alone a long time who maybe just maybe had begun to wonder if absolute power were worth the absolute price i knew beyond the glimmer of doubt that she had enjoyed every second of pretend on the plain even the moments of danger i knew that had i had the hair on my ass there in the last days i could have become more than a pretend boyfriend there was a growing and quiet desperation to her in that time as going back to being the lady approached some of that i might have appropriated out of ego for a very critical time faced her she was under a lot of stress she knew the enemy we faced but not all was ego i think she actually did like me as a person i got a request i said softly in the middle of the huddle banishing thoughts caused by a woman pressed against me what the annals theyre all thats left of the black company depression had set in fast there was an obligation undertaken ages ago when the free companies of khatovar were formed if any of us get through this alive someone should take them back i do not know if she understood but theyre yours she said i wanted to explain but could not why take them back i am not sure where they are supposed to go four hundred years the company drifted slowly north waxing waning turning over its constituents i have no idea if khatovar still exists or if it is a city country a person or a god the annals from the earliest years either did not survive or went home already i have seen nothing but digests and excerpts from the earliest century no matter part of the annalists undertaking has always been to return the annals to khatovar should the company disband the weather worsened by oar it seemed actively inimical and may have been that thing in the earth would know we were coming just north of oar all the taken suddenly dropped away like rocks what the hell toadkiller dog the lady said weve caught up with him he hasnt reached his master yet can they stop him yes i crutched over to the side of the whale i do not know what i expected to see we were up in the snow clouds there were a few flashes below then the taken came back the lady looked displeased what happened i asked the monster got crafty ran into the null where it brushes the ground the visibility is too poor to go after him will it make much difference no but she did not sound entirely confident the weather worsened but the whales remained undaunted we reached the barrowland my group went to the guards compound darlings put up at blue willy the boundary of the null fell just outside the compound wall colonel sweet himself greeted us good old sweet who i thought was dead for sure he had a gimp leg now i cannot say he was convivial but then it was a time when nobody was the orderly assigned us was our old friend case chapter fortynine the invisible maze the first time case appeared he rode the edge of panic me doing a kindly uncle act did not soothe him the lady doing her bit almost kicked him over the edge into hysteria having tracker lurking around in natural form was no help either oneeye of all people calmed him down got him onto the subject of raven and how raven was doing and that did the job i had my own near case of hysteria hours after we put down before i even got set up for it the lady brought whisper and limper to doublecheck our translations whisper was supposed to see if any papers were missing limper was supposed to plumb his memory of olden times for connections we may have missed he it seems was much into the social whirl of the early domination amazing i could not imagine that hunk of hatred and human wreckage ever having been anything but nastiness personified i got goblin to keep an eyeball on those two while i broke away to look in on raven everyone else had given him a looksee already she was there leaning against a wall gnawing a fingernail not looking anything like the great bitch who had tormented the world for lo so many years like i said before i hate it when they go human and she was human and then some flatassed scared how is he i asked and when i saw her mood whats the matter hes unchanged theyve taken good care of him nothing is the matter that a few miracles wont cure i dared raise a questioning eyebrow all the exits are closed croaker im headed down a tunnel my choices grow ever more narrow and each is worse than the other i settled on the chair case used while watching over raven began playing doctor needlessly but i liked to see for myself halfdistracted i said i expect its lonely being queen of the world slight gasp you grow too bold didnt i im sorry thinking out loud an unhealthy habit known to be the cause of bruises and major hemorrhaging he does look sound you think limper or whisper will help no but every angle has to be tried what about bomanz bomanz i looked at her she seemed honestly puzzled the wizard who sprung you oh what about him what could a dead man contribute i disposed of my necromancer you know something i dont not bloody likely she had me under the eye nevertheless i debated for half a minute not wanting to give up what might be a whisker of advantage then i had it from goblin and oneeye that hes perfectly healthy that hes caught in the barrowland like raven only body and all how could that be was it possible she had overlooked this while interrogating me i guess if you do not ask the right questions you will not get the right answers i reflected on all we had done together i had sketched ravens reports for her but she had not read those letters in fact the originals from which raven drew his story were in my quarters goblin and oneeye lugged them all the way to the plain only to see them hauled right back nobody had plumbed them because they repeated a story already told sit i said rising back in two shakes goblin fisheyed me when i breezed in be a few minutes more something came up i scrounged up the case in which ravens documents had traveled only the original bomanz manuscript resided there now i fluttered back out ignored by the taken nice feeling ill tell you being beneath their notice too bad it was just because they were fighting for their existence like the rest of us here this is the original manuscript i went over it once lightly to check ravens translation it looked good to me though he did dramatize and invent dialog but the facts and characterizations are pure bomanz she read with incredible swiftness get ravens version out and back under goblins scowl and growl at my departing back how long is a few minutes these days croaker she went through those swiftly too and looked thoughtful when she finished well i asked there may be something here actually something thats not here two questions who wrote this in the first place and where is the stone in oar that the son mentioned i assume bomanz did most of the original and his wife finished it wouldnt he have used first person not necessarily its possible the literary conventions of the time forbade it raven often chided me for interjecting too much of myself into the annals he came of a different tradition well accept that as a hypothesis next question what became of the wife she came of a family from oar i would expect her to go back when she was known as the wife of the man responsible for loosing me was she bomanz was an assumed name she brushed my objection aside whisper acquired those documents in lords as a lot nothing connects bomanz with them except his story my feeling is that they were accumulated at a later date but his papers what were they doing between the time they left here and the time whisper found them have some ancillary items been lost its time we consulted whisper we however included me out whatever a fire was ignited before long taken were roaring off to faraway places within two days benefice delivered the stone mentioned by bomanzs son it proved useless some guards appropriated it and used it for a doorstep to their barracks i caught occasional hints of a search progressing from oar south along the route jasmine had taken after fleeing from the barrowland widowed and shamed hard to find tracks that old but the taken have remarkable skills another search progressed from lords i had the dubious pleasure of hanging around with the limper while he pointed out all the mistakes we made transliterating uchitelle and kurretelle names seems not only were spellings not uniform in those days but neither were alphabets and some of the folks mentioned were not of uchitelle or kurretelle stock but outsiders who had adapted their names to local usage limper busied himself doing things backwards one afternoon silent gave me the high sign he had been spying over the limpers shoulder off and on with more devotion than i he had found a pattern chapter fifty gnomen darling has a selfdiscipline that amazes me all that time she was over there at blue willy and not once did she surrender to her desire to see raven you could see the ache in her whenever his name came up but she held off for a month but she came as inevitably we knew she must with the ladys permission i tried to ignore her visit entirely and i made silent goblin and oneeye stay away too though with silent it was a tight thing eventually he did agree it was a private thing for her alone and his interests would not be served by sticking his nose in if i would not go to her she would come to me for a while while everyone else was busy elsewhere for a hug to remind her there were those of us who cared to have some moral support there while she worked out something in her mind she signed i cannot deny it now can i and a few minutes later i still have the soft place for him but he will have to earn his way back in which was her equivalent of our thinking aloud i felt more for silent at that moment than for raven raven id always respected for his toughness and fearlessness but id never really grown to like him silent i did like and did wish well i signed do not be brokenhearted if you find he is too old to change wan smile my heart was broken a long time ago no i have no expectations this is not a fairytale world that was all she had to say i did not take it to heart till it began to illuminate later events she came and she went in sorrow for the death of dreams and she came no more in moments when his needs called him away we copied everything the limper left behind and compared it with our own charts oh hey i breathed once oh hey here was a lord from a far western kingdom a baron senjak who had four daughters said to vie with one another in their loveliness one wore the name ardath she lied goblin whispered maybe i admitted more likely she didnt know in fact she couldnt have known nor could anyone else have really i still dont see how soulcatcher could have been convinced that the dominators true name was in here wishful thinking maybe oneeye guessed no i said you could tell she knew what she had she just didnt know how to dig it out just like us ardath is dead i said that leaves three possibilities but if push comes to shove we only get one shot catalog what else we know soulcatcher was one sister name not yet known ardath may have been the ladys twin i think she was older than catcher though they were children together and not separated by many years of the fourth sister we know nothing silent signed you have four names given and family consult the genealogies find who married whom i groaned the genealogies were over at blue willy darling had had them loaded onto the cargo whale with everything else time was short the work daunted me you do not go into those genealogies with a womans name and find anything easily you have to look for a man who married the woman you are seeking and hope the recorder thought enough of her to mention her name how are we going to manage all this i wondered with me the only one who can decipher these chicken tracks then a brilliant idea if i say so myself tracker well put tracker on it he dont have nothing to do but watch that sapling he can do that over at blue willy and read old books at the same time easier said than done tracker was far from his new master getting the message into his pea brain was a major undertaking but once that had been accomplished there was no stopping him one night as i snuggled down under the covers she appeared in my quarters up croaker huh were going flying uh no disrespect but its the middle of the night i had a hard day up so you dont argue when the lady commands chapter fiftyone the sign a freezing rain was falling everything was glazed with crystal ice looks like a warm snap i said she was without a sense of humor that night it took an effort to overlook my remark she led me to a carpet it had a crystal dome covering the forward seats that was a feature recently added to limpers craft the lady used some small magic to melt the ice off make sure its sealed tightly she told me looks good to me we lifted off suddenly i was on my back the nose of the fish pointed at unseen stars we climbed at a dreadful rate i expected momentarily to be so high i could not breathe we got that high and higher we broke through the clouds and i understood the significance of the dome it kept in breathable air meaning the windwhales could no longer climb higher than the taken always chipping away the lady and her gang but what the hell was this all about there a sigh of disappointment a confirmation that a shadow darkened hope she pointed i saw it i knew it for i had seen it before in the days of the long retreat that ended in the battle before the tower the great comet small but no denying its unique silver scimitar shape it cant be it isnt due for twenty years celestial bodies dont change their cycles they dont thats axiomatic so maybe the axiom makers are wrong shetilted the carpet down note it in your writings but dont mention it otherwise our peoples are troubled enough right that comet has a hold on mens minds back down into the yuck of a barrowland night we came in over the great barrow itself only forty feet up the damned river was close the ghosts were dancing in the rain i sloshed into the barracks in a numb state checked the calendar twelve days to go the old bastard was probably out there laughing it up with his favorite hound toadkiller dog chapter fiftytwo no surprise something that lies down in that mind below the mind would not let me be i tossed and turned wakened fell asleep and finally in the wee hours it surfaced i got up and shuffled through papers i found that piece that made the lady gasp once ploughed through that interminable guest list till i found a lord senjak and his daughters ardath credence and sylith the youngest one dorotea the scribbler noted could not attend ha i crowed the search narrows there was no more information but that was a triumph assuming the lady was indeed a twin and dorotea was the youngest and ardath dead the odds were now fiftyfifty a woman named sylith or a woman named credence credence that is how it translated i was so excited i got no more sleep even that damned offschedule comet fled my thoughts but excitement perished between the grinding stones of time nothing came from those taken tracing bomanzs wife and papers i suggested the lady go to the source himself she was not prepared for the risk not yet our old and stupid friend tracker produced another gem four days after i eliminated sister dorotea the big goof had been reading genealogies day and night silent came back from blue willy wearing such a look i knew something good had happened he dragged me outside toward town into the null he gave me a slip of damp paper in trackers simple style it said three sisters were married ardath married twice first a baron kaden ofdartstone who died in battle six years later she married erin nofather an unlanded priest of the god vancer from a town called slinger in the kingdom of vye credence married barthelme of jaunt a renowned sorcerer it is in my memory that barthelme of jaunt became one of the taken but my memory is not trustworthy no lie dorotea married raft princeinwaiting of start sylith never married tracker then proved that slow though he might be an occasional idea did perk through his murk of a mind the death rolls reveal that ardath and her husband erin nofather an unlanded priest of the god vancer from a town called slinger in the kingdom of vye were slain by bandits while traveling between lathe and ova my untrustworthy memory recalls that this took place just months before the dominator proclaimed himself sylith drowned in a flood of the river dream some years earlier swept away before countless witnesses but no body was found we had an eyewitness it never occurred to me to think of tracker that way though the knowledge had been there for the recognition maybe we could figure some way to get at his memories credence perished in the fighting when the dominator and lady took jaunt in the early days of their conquests there is no record of doroteas death damn i said old tracker is worth something after all silent signed it sounds confused but reason should provide something more than something without drawing charts connecting all those women i felt confident enough to say we knew dorotea as soulcatcher we know ardath wasnt the lady odds are the sister who engineered the ambush that killed her there was something missing still if i just knew which were twins in response to my question silent signed tracker is looking for birth records but he was unlikely to score again lord senjak was not kurretelle one of the purported dead didnt die id put my money on sylith assuming credence was killed because she recognized a sister who was supposed to be dead when the dominator and lady took jaunt bomanz mentions a legend about the lady killing her twin is that this ambush or something more public who knows i said it really did get confusing for a moment i wondered if it mattered the lady called an assembly our original estimate of time available now appeared overly optimistic she told us we appear to have been misled there is nothing in catchers documents to betray my husbands name how she reached that assumption is beyond us now if documents are missing we cannot be sure unless news comes from lords or oar soon we can forget that avenue its time to consider alternatives i scribbled a note asked whisper to pass it to the lady the lady read it then looked at me with narrowed thoughtful eyes erin nofather she read aloud an unlanded priest of the god vancer from slinger in the kingdom of vye this from our amateur historian what you found is less interesting than the fact that you found it croaker that news is five hundred years old it was worthless then whoever erin nofather was before he left vye he did an absolute job of eliminating traces by the time he became interesting enough to have his antecedents investigated he had obliterated not only slinger but every person to have lived in that village during his lifetime in later years he went even farther wasting all vye which is why the notion that those papers might contain his true name constituted such a surprise i felt about halfsize and stupid i should have known they would have tried to unmask the dominator before i had surrendered some small advantage for nothing so much for the spirit of cooperation one of the new takeni cannot keep them straight for they all dress the samearrived soon afterward he or she gave the lady a small carved chest the lady smiled when she opened it there were no papers that survived but there were these she dumped some odd bracelets tomorrow we go after bomanz everyone else knew i had to ask what are they the amulets made for the eternal guard in the time of the white rose so they could enter the barrowland without hazard the resulting excitement surpassed my understanding the wife must have carried them away though how she laid hands on them is a mystery break this up now i need time to think she shooed us like a farm wife shooes chickens i returned to my room the limper floated in behind me he said nary a word but ducked into the documents again puzzled i looked over his shoulder he had lists of all the names we had unearthed written in the alphabets of the languages whence they sprang he seemed to be playing with both substitution codes and numerology baffled i went to my bed turned my back on him faked sleep as long as he was there i knew sleep would evade me chapter fiftythree the recovery it resumed snowing that night real snow half a foot an hour and no letup the racket raised by the guards as they strove to clear it from doorways and the carpets wakened me i had slept despite the limper an instant of terror i sat bolt upright he remained at his task the barracks was overly warm holding the heat because it was all but buried there was a bustle despite the weather taken had arrived while i slept guards not only dug but hurried about other tasks oneeye joined me for a rude breakfast i said so shes going ahead despite the weather it wont get any better croaker that guy out there knows whats going on he looked grim whats the matter i can count croaker what do you expect from a guy with a week to live my stomach tightened yes i had been able to avoid thoughts of the sort so far but weve been in tight places before stair of tear juniper beryl we made it i keep telling myself hows darling worried what do you think shes a bug between hammer and anvil the lady has forgotten her he snorted dont let your special dispensation erode your common sense croaker sound advice i admitted but unnecessary a hawk couldnt watch her more closely you going out i wouldnt miss it know where i can get some snowshoes he grinned for an instant the devil of years past peeped forth some guys i knowmentioning no names you know how it isswiped a half dozen pairs from the guard armory last night duty man fell asleep on post i grinned and winked so i was not seeing enough of them to keep up but they were not just sitting around and waiting couple pairs went off to darling just in case got four pair left and just a smidgen of a plan yeah yeah youll see brilliant if i do say so myself where are the shoes when are you going meet us in the smokehouse after the taken get off the ground several guards came in to eat looking exhausted grumbling oneeye departed leaving me in deep thought what were they plotting the most carefully laid plans like that the lady marched into the mess hall get your gloves and coats croaker its time i gaped are you coming but i flailed around for an excuse if we go somebody will have to do without a carpet she gave me an odd look limper is staying here come get your clothing i did so in a daze passing goblin as we went outside i gave him a baffled little headshake a moment before we lifted off the lady reached back offering me something whats this better wear it unless you want to go in without an amulet oh it did not look like much some cheap jaspar and jade on brittle leather yet when i secured the buckle around my wrist i felt the power in it we passed over the rooftops very low they were the only visual guides available out on the cleared land there was nothing but being the lady she had other resources we took a turn around the bounds of the barrowland on the river side we descended till the water lay but a yard beneath us lot of ice i said she did not reply she was studying the shoreline now within the barrowland itself a sodden section of bank collapsed revealing a dozen skeletons i grimaced in moments they were covered with snow or swept away just about on schedule id guess i said uhm she moved on around the perimeter a couple times i glimpsed other carpets circling something below caught my eye down there what thought i saw tracks maybe toadkiller dog is nearby oh my time she said and turned toward the great barrow we put down at the mounds base she piled out i joined her other carpets descended soon there were four taken the lady and one scared old physician standing just yards from the despair of the world one of the taken brought shovels snow began to fly we took turns nobody exempt it was a bitch of a job and became more so when we reached the buried scrub growth it got worse when we reached frozen earth we had to go slow the lady said bomanz was barely covered it went on it seemed forever dig and dig and dig we uncovered a withered humanoid thing the lady assured us was bomanz my shovel clicked against something my last turn i bent to examine it thinking it a rock i brushed frosty earth away and dived out of that hole whirled pointed the lady went down laughter drifted upward croaker found the dragon his jaw anyway i kept on retreating toward our carpet something huge vaulted it trailing a basso snarl i flung myself to one side into snow that swallowed me there were cries growls when i emerged it was over i glimpsed toadkiller dog clearing the carpet in retreat more than a little scarred the lady and taken had been ready for him why didnt somebody warn me i whined he could have read you im just sorry we didnt cripple him two taken probably of the male vice lifted bomanz he was stiff as a statue yet there was that about him which even i could sense a spark or something no one could have mistaken him for dead into a carpet he went the anger in the mound had been a trickle barely sensed like the buzzing of a fly across a room it smacked us now one hard hammer stroke reeking madness not an iota of fear informed it that thing had an absolute confidence in its ultimate victory we were but delays and irritants the carpet carrying bomanz departed then another i settled into my place and willed the lady to hurry me away a spate of snarling and yelling broke out toward town brilliant light slashed through the snowfall i knew it i growled one fear realized toadkiller dog had found oneeye and goblin another carpet lifted the lady boarded ours closed the dome fools she said what were they doing i said nothing she did not see her attention was on the carpet which was not behaving as it should something seemed to pull it toward the great barrow but i saw trackers ugly face passed at eye level he carried the son of the tree then toadkiller dog reappeared stalking tracker half the monsters face was gone he ran on three legs but he was plenty enough to take tracker apart the lady saw toadkiller dog she spun the carpet systematically she loosed its eight thirty foot shafts she did not miss and yet dragging the missiles engulfed in flame toadkiller dog crawled into the great tragic river he went under and did not come up thatll keep him out of the way for a while not ten yards away oblivious tracker was clearing the peak of the great barrow so he could plant his sapling idiots the lady murmured im surrounded by idiots even the tree is a dolt she would not explain neither did she interfere i sought traces of oneeye and goblin as we flew homeward i saw nothing they were not in the compound of course there had not yet been time for them to snowshoe back but when they had not appeared an hour later i began having trouble concentrating on the reanimation of bomanz that started with repeated hot baths both to warm his flesh and to cleanse him i did not get to see the preliminaries the lady kept me with her she did not look in till the taken were ready for the final quickening and that was unimpressive the lady made a few gestures around bomanzwho looked pretty motheatenand said a few words in a language i did not understand why do sorcerers always use languages nobody understands even goblin and oneeye do it each has confided that he cannot follow the tongue the other uses maybe they make it up her words worked that old wreck came to life grittily determined to push forward against a savage wind he marched three steps before registering his altered circumstances he froze he turned slowly face collapsing into despair his gaze locked on the lady maybe two minutes passed then he looked the rest of us over and considered his surroundings you explain croaker does he speak forsberger hasnt changed i faced bomanz a legend come to life i am croaker a military physician by profession you are bomanz his name is seth chalk croaker let us establish that immediately you are bomanz whose true name may be seth chalk a sorcerer of oar nearly a century has passed since you attempted to contact the lady give him the whole story the lady used a jewel cities dialect likely to be outside bomanzs capacity i talked till i was hoarse the rise of the ladys empire the threat defeated at the battle at charm the threat defeated at juniper the present threat he said not a word in all that time not once did i see in him the fat almost obsequious shopkeeper of the story his first words were so i did not entirely fail he faced the lady and you remain tainted by the light notardath he faced me again you will take me to the white rose as soon as i have eaten nary a protest from the lady he ate like a fat little shopkeeper the lady herself helped me back into my wet winter coat dont dawdle she cautioned hardly had we departed when bomanz seemed to diminish he said im too old dont let that back there fool you an act going to play with the big boys you have to act whatll i do a hundred years less than a week to redeem myself how will i get a handle on things that quickly the only principal i know is the lady why did you think she was ardath why not one of the other sisters there was more than one four i named them from your papers ive established that soulcatcher was the one named dorotea my papers so called because the story of you wakening the lady was prominent among them its always been assumed till a few days ago that you assembled them and your wife carried them away when she thought you had died bears investigation i collected nothing i risked nothing but a map of the barrowland i know the map well i must see those papers but first your white rose meanwhile tell me about the lady i had trouble staying with him he zigged and zagged spraying ideas what about her there is a detectable tension between you of enemies who are friends perhaps lovers who are enemies opponents who know one another well and respect one another if you respect her its with reason its impossible to respect total evil it cannot respect itself wow he was right i did respect her so i talked a bit and my theme was when i noticed it that she did remain tainted by the light she tried hard to be a villain but when faced by real darknessthe thing under the moundher weakness started to show it is only slightly less difficult for us to extinguish the light within us than it is for us to conquer the darkness a dominator occurs once in a hundred generations the others like the taken are but imitations can you stand against the lady hardly i suspect my fate is to become one of the taken when she finds time hed landed on his feet this old boy he halted lords shes strong who your darling an incredible absorption i feel helpless as a child we stamped into blue willy entering through a secondfloor window the snow was banked that high oneeye goblin and silent were down in the common room with darling the first two looked a bit shopworn so i said you guys made it i thought toadkiller dog had you for lunch no problem at all oneeye said we what do you mean we goblin demanded you were worthless as tits on a boar hog silent shut up this is bomanz he wants to meet darling the bomanz goblin squeaked the very one their meeting was about a threequestion interview darling took charge immediately when he realized darling was leading him bomanz broke it off he told me next step i read my alleged autobiography its not yours unlikely unless my memory serves me worse than i suppose we returned to the compound in silence he seemed reflective darling has that impact on those who meet her for the first time she is just darling to those of us who have known her all along bomanz worked his way through the original manuscript occasionally asking about specific passages he was unfamiliar with the uchitelle dialect you had nothing to do with that then no but my wife was the primary source question was the girl snoopy traced no she is the one to follow up she is the only survivor of significance ill tell the lady but there isnt time for it in a few days hell is going to break loose out there i wondered if tracker had gotten the sapling planted much good it would do when the great tragic reached the mound brave move but dumb tracker the effects of his effort were apparent soon though when i got around to relaying bomanzs suggestion about snoopy the lady asked have you noted the weather no its getting better the sapling stilled my husbands ability to shape it too late of course it will be months before the river falls she was depressed she merely nodded when i told her what bomanz had to say is it that bad are we defeated before we enter the lists no but the price of victory escalates i do not want to pay that price i dont know if i can i stood there perplexed awaiting an expansion upon the subject none was forthcoming after a time she said sit croaker i sat in the chair she indicated next to a roaring fire diligently tended by the soldier case after a time she sent case away but still nothing was forthcoming time tightens the noose she murmured at one point and at another im afraid to unravel the knot chapter fiftyfour an evening at home days passed no one of any especial allegiance gained any apparent ground the lady canceled all investigations she and the taken conferred often i was excluded so was bomanz the limper participated only when ordered out of my quarters i gave up trying to sleep there i moved in with goblin and oneeye which shows how much the taken distressed me sharing a room with those two is like living amidst an ongoing riot raven as ever changed not the least and remained mostly forgotten by all but his loyal case silent did look in occasionally on darlings behalf but without enthusiasm only then did i realize that silent felt more toward darling than loyalty and protectiveness and he was without means of expressing those feelings silence was enforced upon him by more than a vow i could not learn which sisters were twins as i anticipated tracker found nothing in the genealogies a miracle he found what he did the way sorcerers cover their back trails goblin and oneeye tried hypnotizing him hoping to plumb his ancient memories it was like stalking ghosts in a heavy fog the taken moved to stall the great tragic ice collected along the western bank turning the force of the current but they overtinkered and a gorge developed it threatened to raise the river level a twoday effort won us maybe ten hours occasionally large tracks appeared around the barrowland soon vanished beneath drifting snow though the skies cleared the air grew colder the snow neither melted nor crusted the taken engineered that a wind from the east stirred the snow continuously case stopped by to tell me the lady wants you sir right away i broke off playing threehanded tonk with goblin and oneeye so far had things slowedexcept the flow of time there was nothing more we could do sir said case as we stepped out of hearing of the others be careful uhm shes in a dark mood thanks i dallied my own mood was dark enough it did not need to feed on hers her quarters had been refurnished carpets had been brought in hangings covered the walls a settee of sorts stood before the fireplace where a fire burned with a comforting crackle the atmosphere seemed calculated home as we dream it to be rather than as it is she was seated on the couch come sit with me she said without glancing back to see who had come in i started to take one of the chairs no here by me so i settled on the couch what is it her eyes were fixed on something far away her face said she was in pain i have decided yes i waited nervously not sure what she meant less sure i belonged there the choices have narrowed down i can surrender and become another of the taken that was a jess dire penalty than i had expected or or i can fight a battle that cant be won or won only in its losing if you cant win why fight i would not have asked that of one of the company with my own i would have known the answer hers was not ours because the outcome can be shaped i cant win but i can decide who does or at least make sure it isnt him a slow nod her bleak mood began to make sense i have seen it on the battlefield with men about to undertake a task likely to be fatal but which must be hazarded so others will not perish to cover my reaction i slipped off the couch and added three small logs to the fire but for our moods it would have been nice there in the crispy heat watching the dancing flames we did that for a while i sensed that i was not expected to talk it begins at sunup she said at last what the final conflict laugh at me croaker im going to try to kill a shadow with no hope of surviving myself laugh never admire respect my enemy still in the end unable to extinguish that last spark of light and so die in yet another way all this while she sat there primly hands folded in her lap she stared into the fire as if certain that eventually it would reveal the answer to some mystery she began to shiver this woman for whom death held such devouring terror had chosen death over surrender what did that do for my confidence nothing good nothing good at all i might have felt better had i seen the picture she did but she did not talk about it in a very very soft tentative voice she asked croaker will you hold me what i didnt say it but i sure as hell thought it i didnt say anything clumsily uncertainly i did as she asked she began crying on my shoulder softly quietly shaking like a captive baby rabbit it was a long time before she said anything i did not presume no one has done this since i was a baby my nurse another long silence ive never had a friend another long gap im scared croaker and alone no well all be with you not for the same reasons she fell silent for good then i held her a long time the fire burned down and its light faded from the room outside the wind began to howl when i finally thought she had fallen asleep and started to disengage myself she clung more tightly so i stilled and continued to hold her though half the muscles in my body ached eventually she peeled herself away rose built up the fire i sat she stood behind me a while staring at the flames then she rested a hand on my shoulder a moment in a faraway voice she said good night she went into another room i sat for ten or fifteen minutes before putting on a last log and shuffling back into the real world i must have worn an odd look neither goblin nor oneeye aggravated me i rolled into my bedroll back to them but did not fall asleep for a long time chapter fiftyfive opening rounds i wakened startled the null i had been out of it so much it disturbed me by its presence i rolled out hurriedly discovered i was alone in the room not only there but in the barracks practically there were a few guards in the mess hall the sun was not yet up the wind still howled around the building there was a marked chill in the air though the fires were burning high i shoveled boiled oats in and wondered what i was missing the lady entered as i finished there you are i thought id have to leave without you whatever her problems the night before she was brisk and confident and ready for business now the null faded while i got my coat i dropped by my own room momentarily the limper was there still i left frowning thoughtfully into the carpet full crew today every carpet was fully crewed and armed but i was more interested in the absence of snow between town and the barrowland that howling wind had blown it away we went up as it became light enough to see the lady took the carpet up till the barrowland resembled a map taking shape as shadows vaporized she set us to cruising in a tight circle the wind i noted had faded the great barrow looked ready to collapse into the river one hundred hours she said as though divining my thoughts so we were reduced to counting hours i looked around the horizon there the comet they cant see it from the ground but tonight itll have to cloud up below tiny figures scurried around one quarter of the cleared area the lady unrolled a map similar to bpmanzs raven i said today if were lucky whatre they doing down there surveying more than that was happening the guards were out in full battle regalia forming an arc around the barrowland light siege machines were being assembled but some men were indeed surveying and setting up rows of lances flying colored pennons i did not ask why she would not explain a dozen windwhales hovered to the east beyond the river i had thought them long departed the sky there burned with dawns conflagration first test the lady said a feeble monster she frowned in concentration our carpet began to glow a white horse and white rider came from the town darling accompanied by silent and the lieutenant darling rode into an aisle marked by pennons she halted beside the last the earth erupted something that might have been first cousin to toadkiller dog and even more closely related to an octopus burst into the light it raced over the barrowland toward the river away from the null darling galloped toward town wizards fury rained from the carpets the monster was a cinder in seconds one the lady said below men began another aisle of pennons and so it went slowly and deliberately all the day long most of the dominators creatures broke for the river the few that charged the other way encountered a barricade of missile fire before succumbing to the taken is there time to eliminate them all i asked as the sun was setting i had been itchy for hours sitting in one place more than enough but it wont stay this easy i probed but she would not expand upon what she had said it looked slick to me just pick them off and keep picking them off and go for the big guy when they were all gone tough he might be but what could he do enveloped in the null when i staggered into the barracks to my room i found the limper still at work the taken need less rest than we mortals but he had to be on the edge of collapse what the hell was he doing then there was bomanz he had not appeared today what was he trying to slip up his sleeve i was eating a supper very much like breakfast when silent materialized he settled opposite me clutching a bowl of mush as if it were an alms bowl he looked pale how was it for darling i asked he signed she almost enjoyed it she took chances she should not have one of those things almost got to her otto was hurt fending it off he need me oneeye managed whatre you doing here it is the night to bring raven out oh again i had forgotten raven how could i number myself among his friends when i seemed so indifferent to his fate silent followed me to where i was staying with oneeye and goblin those two joined us shortly they were subdued they had been assigned major roles in the recovery of our old friend i worried more about silent the shadow had passed over him he was fighting it would he be strong enough to win part of him did not want raven rescued part of me did not either a very tired lady came to ask will you participate in this i shook my head id just get in the way let me know when its done she gave me a hard look then shrugged and went away very late a feeble oneeye wakened me i bolted up well we managed i dont know how well but hes back how was it rough he crawled into his bedroll goblin was in his already snoring silent had come with them he was against the wall wrapped in a borrowed blanket cutting logs by the time i wakened fully oneeye was sawing with the rest in ravens room there was nothing to see but raven snoring and case looking worried the crowd had cleared out leaving a ripe stench behind he seem all right i asked case shrugged im no doctor i am let me look him over pulse strong enough breathing a little fast for a sleeper but not disturbingly so pupils dilated muscles tense sweatydont look like much to worry about keep feeding him broth and get hold of me as soon as hes talking dont let him get up his muscles will be clay he might hurt himself case nodded and nodded i returned to my bedroll lay there a long time alternately wondering about raven and about the limper a lamp still burned in my former quarters the last of the old taken still pursued his monomaniacal quest raven became the greater worry he was going to demand an accounting of our care for darling and i was in a mood to challenge his right chapter fiftysix time fading dawn comes early when you wish it would not the hours flash when you want them to drag the following day was another of executions the only thing unusual was that the limper came out to watch he seemed satisfied we were doing things right he returned to my quarterswhere he sacked out in my bed my evening check on raven showed little change case reported that he had come near wakening several times and was mumbling in his sleep keep pouring soup down him and dont be afraid to yell if you need me i could not sleep i tried roaming the barracks but near silence reigned a few sleepless guards haunted the mess hall they fell silent at my arrival i thought about going over to blue willy but i would find no better reception there i was on everybodys list it could do nothing but get worse i knew what the lady meant about lonely i wished i had the nerve to visit her now that i needed a hug i returned to my bedroll i did fall asleep this time they had to threaten mayhem to get me up we polished off the last of the dominators pets before noon the lady ordered a holiday for the remainder of the day come next morning we were to rehearse for the big show she guessed we had about fortyeight hours before the river opened the tomb time to rest time to practice and ample time to get in the first whack that afternoon limper went out and flew around a while he was in high spirits i seized the opportunity to visit my quarters and poke around but all i could find were a few black wood shavings and a hint of silver dust and barely enough of either to leave traces he had cleaned up hastily i did not touch no telling what curiosities might occur if i did otherwise i learned nothing the practice for the event was tense everyone turned out including limper and bomanz who had kept so low most everyone had forgotten him the wind whales ranged above the river their manias soared and swooped darling charged the great barrow down a prepared aisle stopping just short of far enough the taken and guards stood to their respective weapons it looked good looked like it would work so why was i convinced we were in for big trouble the moment our carpet touched down case was beside it i need your help he told me ignoring the lady he wont listen to me he keeps trying to get up he fell on his face already twice i glanced at the lady she gave me a goahead nod raven was seated on the edge of his bed when i arrived i hear youre being a pain in the ass whats the point of pulling your butt out of the barrowland if youre going to commit suicide his gaze rose slowly he did not appear to recognize me oh damn i thought his mind is gone he talked any case some he dont always make sense he dont realize how long its been i think maybe we should restrain him no startled we looked at raven he knew me now no restraints croaker ill behave he flopped onto his back smiling how long case tell him the story i said im going to go whip up some medicine i just wanted away from raven he looked worse with his soul restored cadaverous too much a reminder of my mortality and that was one thing i did not need on my mind more than it was i whipped up a couple potions one would settle ravens shakes the other would knock him out if he gave case too much trouble raven gave me a dark look when i returned i do not know how far case had gotten stay off your high horse i told him you got no idea whats happened since juniper in fact not a whole lot since the battle at charm you being the brave and rugged loner hasnt helped drink this its for the shakes i gave case the other mixture with whispered instructions in a voice little above a whisper raven asked is it true darling and the lady are going after the dominator tomorrow together yes doordie time for everybody i want to youll stay put you too case we dont want darling distracted i had managed to abolish worries about the tangled ramifications inherent in tomorrows confrontations now they rushed in on me again the dominator would not be the end of it unless we lost if he fell the war with the lady would resume instantly i wanted to see darling badly wanted in on her plans i dared not go the lady was keeping me on the leash she might interrogate me any time lonely work lonely work case went on taletelling then goblin and oneeye dropped in to tell stories from their perspectives the lady even looked in she beckoned me yes i asked come i followed her to her quarters outside night had fallen in about eighteen hours the great barrow would open of its own accord sooner if we followed plan sit i sat i said im getting fixated on it butterflies the size of horses cant think about anything else i know i considered you as a distraction but i cared too much well that distracted me perhaps one of your potions i shook my head there is no specific for fear in my arsenal ive heard of wizards those antidotes cost too dearly well need our wits about us it wont go like it did in rehearsal i raised an eyebrow she did not expand i suppose she expected a lot of improvisational behavior from her allies the mess sergeant appeared his crew rolled in a grand meal they set out on a table brought in special a last feast for the condemned after the crowd dispersed the lady said i ordered the best for everyone your friends in town included breakfast likewise she seemed calm enough but she was more accustomed to highrisk confrontations i snorted at myself i recalled being asked for a hug she was as scared as anybody she saw but did not asktip enough that she was focused inward the meal was a miracle considering what the cooks had to work with but it was nothing grand we exchanged no words during its course i finished first rested my elbows on the table retreated into thought she followed suit she had eaten very little after a few minutes she went to her bedroom she returned with three black arrows each had silver inlays in kurre telle script i had seen their like before soulcatcher gave raven one the time we ambushed limper and whisper she said use the bow i gave you and stay close the arrows appeared identical who my husband they cant kill him they lack his true name but theyll slow him down you dont think the rest of the plan will work anything is possible but all eventualities should be considered her eyes met mine there was something there we looked away she said youd better go sleep well i want you alert tomorrow i laughed how its been arranged for all but the duty section oh sorcery one of the taken would put everyone to sleep i rose i dithered for a few seconds putting logs on the fire i thanked her for the meal finally i managed to say what was on my mind i want to wish you luck but i cant put my whole heart into it her smile was wan i know she followed me to the door before i went out i yielded to the final impulse turned found her right there hoping i hugged her for half a minute damn her for being human but i needed that too chapter fiftyseven the last day we were permitted to sleep in then given an hour to breakfast make peace with our gods or whatever we had to do before entering battle the great barrow was supposed to hold till noon there was no rush i wondered what the thing in the earth was doing battle muster came about eight there were no absences the limper drifted around on his little carpet his path seeming to intersect that of whisper more often than was necessary they had their heads together about something bomanz skulked around the edges of things trying to remain invisible i did not blame him in his shoes i might have made a run for oar in his shoes were mine more comfortable the man was a victim of his sense of honor he believed he had a debt to repay a drumbeat announced time to take positions i followed the lady noting that the remaining civilians were headed down the road to oar with what possessions they could carry it was going to be a crazy road the troops the lady had summoned were reported our side of oar coming in their thousands they would arrive too late nobody thought to tell them to hold up attentions had narrowed the outside world no longer existed i watched the civilians and for a moment wondered what difficulties faced us if we had to flee but my concern did not persist i could not worry past the dominator windwhales took station over the river mantas searched for updrafts taken carpets rose but today my feet remained on the ground the lady intended meeting her husband toe to toe thanks a bunch friend there was croaker in her shadow with his puny bow and arrows guards all in position entrenched behind low palisades ditches and artillery pennons all in place to guide darlings carefully surveyed ride tension mounting what more was there to do stay behind me the lady reminded keep your arrows ready yeah good luck if we win ill buy you dinner at the gardens in opal i dont know what possessed me to say that frenzied attempt at selfdistraction it was a chilly morning but i was sweating she seemed startled then she smiled if we win ill hold you to that the smile was feeble she had no cause to believe she would survive another hour she started walking toward the great barrow faithful pup i dogged her the last spark of light would not die she would not save herself through surrender bomanz gave us a head start then followed likewise the limper neithers action was in the master plan the lady did not react perforce i let it go too taken carpets began to spiral down the windwhales seemed a little bouncy the manias a little frenetic in their search for favorable air edge of the barrowland my amulet did not tingle all the old fetishes outside the barrowlands heart had been removed the dead now lay in peace moist earth sucked at my boots i had trouble maintaining my balance keeping an arrow across my bow i had one black shaft set to string the other two gripped in the hand that held the bow the lady halted a few feet from the pit whence we had dragged bomanz she became oblivious to the world almost as if she were communing with the thing underground i glanced back bomanz had halted a little to the north about fifty feet from me he had his hands in his pockets and wore a look that dared me to protest his presence the limper had set down about where the moat was when a moat surrounded the barrowland he did not want to fall when the null swept over him i glanced at the sun about nine three hours margin if we wanted to use it my heart was setting records for carrying on my hands shook so much it seemed the bones ought to rattle i doubted i could put an arrow into an elephant from five feet how come i got lucky and got picked to be her buttboy i reviewed my life what had i done to deserve this so many choices i might have made differently what ready she asked never i pasted on a sickly grin she tried to smile back but she was more scared than i was she knew what she faced she believed she had only moments to live she had guts that woman going on when there was nothing she could win but perhaps some small redemption in the eyes of the world names flashed through my mind sylith credence which in a moment a choice might be critical i am not a religious man but i sped a silent prayer to the gods of my youth asking that it not be me required to complete the ritual of her naming she faced the town and raised an arm trumpets winded as though anyone were not paying attention her arm dropped hoofbeats darling in her white with elmo silent and the lieutenant all three dogging her galloped the lane defined by the pennons the null was to come sudden then freeze the dominator was to be allowed to break out but not with his power intact i felt the null it hit me hard so unaccustomed to it was i the lady staggered too a mewl of fear fled her lips she did not want to be disarmed not now but it was the only way the ground shuddered once gently then geysered upward i retreated a step shivering i watched the fountain of muck disperse and was amazed to see not a man but the dragon the damned dragon i hadnt thought about that it reared fifty feet high flames boiling around its head it roared what now in the null the lady could not shield us the dominator fled my mind entirely i drew a shaft to its head aimed for the beasts open mouth a shout restrained me i turned bomanz pranced and shrieked calling insults in kurretelle the dragon eyeballed him and recalled that they had unfinished business it struck like a snake flames surged ahead of it fire masked bomanz but did not harm him he had taken his stand beyond the null the lady moved a few steps to her right to look past the dragon whose forelegs were now free and scrabbling to drag the rest of its immense body loose i could see nothing of our quarry but the flying taken were into their attack runs heavy firecarrying spears were in flight already they roared down burst a thunderous voice announced headed for the river the lady hurried forward darling resumed moving carrying the null toward the water ghosts cursed and pranced around me i was too distracted to respond mantas dropped in swift dark pairs dancing between bolts of lightning loosed by windwhales the air went crackly smelled dry and strange suddenly tracker was with us muttering about having to save the tree i heard a rising bray of horns i dodged a flailing dragon leg ducked a hammering wing looked back scores of illclad human skeletons poured from the forest in the wake of a limping toadkiller dog i knew we hadnt seen the last of that bastard i tried to get the ladys attention the forest tribes theyre attacking the guard the dominator had had at least one ace in the hole the lady paid me no heed what the tribesmen and guard did were of no consequence to us at the moment we had prey on the run and dared concern ourselves with nothing else in the water that voice thundered from above darling moved some more the lady and i scrambled over earth still rippling with the dragons efforts to break free it ignored us bomanz had its entire attention a windwhale dropped its tentacles probed the river it caught something dropped ballast water a human figure writhed in the whales grasp screaming my spirits rose we had done it the whale lifted too high for a moment it raised the dominator out of the null deadly mistake thunder lightning terror on hot hooves half the town and a swath to the edge of the null shattered scattered burned and blackened the whale exploded the dominator fell as he plunged toward both water and null he bellowed sylith i name your name i loosed an arrow deadeye one of the best wing shots i have ever made it got him in the side he shrieked and clawed at the shaft then he hit water manta lightning made the river boil another whale dropped and shoved tentacles beneath the surface for a long moment i was terrified the dominator would stay under and escape but up he came again in a monsters grasp this whale too went too high and paid the price though the dominators magic was much enfeebled probably by my arrow he got off one wild spell which went astray and started fires in the guards compound the guards and tribesmen were closely engaged nearby the spell slew scores from both forces i did not get another arrow off i was frozen i had been assured that the naming of a name once suitable rituals had been observed could not be stilled by the null but the lady had not faltered she stood a step short of the edge of land staring at the thing that had been her husband the naming of the name sylith had not disturbed her at all not sylith twice the dominator had named her wrong only one left to try but my grin was hollow i would have named her sylith a third windwhale caught the dominator this one made no mistake it carried him to shore toward darling and her escort he struggled furiously gods the vitality of that man behind us men screamed arms clashed the guards had not been as surprised as i they were holding their ground the airborne taken hastened to support them flinging a storm of deadly sorceries toadkiller dog was the center of their attention elmo the lieutenant and silent jumped the dominator the moment the windwhale dropped him that was like jumping a tiger he threw elmo thirty feet i heard the crack as he broke the lieutenants spine silent danced away i put another arrow into him he staggered but did not go down dazed he started toward the lady and me tracker met him halfway he set the son of the tree aside grabbed hold of his man started a wrestling match of epic scale he and the dominator shrieked like souls in torment i wanted to rush down and tend to elmo and the lieutenant but the lady gestured for me to stay her gaze roved everywhere she expected something more a great shriek shook the earth a ball of oily fire rolled skyward the dragon flopped like an injured worm screaming bomanz had disappeared to be seen was the limper somehow he had dragged himself to within a dozen feet of me without my noticing my fear was so great i nearly voided my bowels his mask was gone the devasted wasteland of his bare face glowered with malice in a moment he was thinking he would even all scores with me my legs turned to jelly he pointed a small crossbow grinned then his aim drifted aside i saw that his quarrel was close cousin to the arrow across my bow that electrified me finally i drew to the head he squealed credence the rite is complete i name your name and then he let fly i loosed at the same instant i could get the shaft off no faster damn me my arrow slammed into his black heart knocked him over but too late too late the lady cried out terror turned into unreasoning rage i flung myself at the limper abandoning my bow for my sword he did not turn to face my assault he just held himself up on one elbow and gaped at the lady i really went crazy i guess we all can in the right circumstances but i had been a soldier for ages id long ago learned you dont do that sort of thing and stay alive long the limper was inside the null which meant he was barely clinging to life barely able to sustain himself wholly unable to defend himself i made him pay for all the years of fear my first stroke half severed his neck i kept hacking till i finished the job then i scattered a few limbs about blunting my steel and madness on ancient bone sanity began to return i whirled to see what had become of the lady she was down on one knee the weight of her body resting upon the other she was trying to draw limpers bolt i charged over pulled her hand away no let me later this time i was less startled that the naming had not worked this time convinced me that nothing could disarm her she should have been gone damn it i gave myself up to a long fit of the shakes the taken pounding on the forest people were having an effect some of the savages had begun fleeing toadkiller dog was enveloped by painful sorceries hang on i told the lady were over the hump were going to do it i dont know that i believed that but it was what she needed to hear tracker and the dominator continued to roll around grunting and cursing silent pranced around them with a broadbladed spear when chance presented itself he cut our great enemy nothing could survive that forever darling watched stayed close stayed out of the dominators way i scooted back to the wreck of the limper and dug out the shaft id put into his chest he glared at me there was life in his brain still i booted his head into the trench left by the dragons rising that beast had ceased thrashing still no sign of bomanz never any sign of bomanz he found the fate he feared second try he slew the monster from within do not think bomanz peripheral because he kept his head down i believe the dominator expected the dragon to preoccupy darling and the lady those few moments he needed to get shut of the null bomanz took that away with the same determination and distinction as the lady facing her inescapable fate i returned to the lady my hands had attained their battlefield steadiness i wished for my kit my knife would have to do i laid her back started digging that quarrel would chew on her till i got it out for all the pain she managed a grateful smile a dozen men surrounded tracker and the dominator now every one stabbing some did not seem particular as to whom they hit the sands were about gone for the old evil i packed and bound the ladys wound with material from her own clothing well change this as soon as we can the tribesmen were whipped toadkiller dog was dragging himself toward the high country that old mutt had as much staying power as his boss guards freed of the fighting hurried our way they carried wood for the old dooms funeral pyre chapter fiftyeight end of the game then i spotted raven the damned fool he was leaning on case hobbling he carried a bare sword his face was set trouble for sure his step was not quite as feeble as he pretended it took no genius to guess what he had in mind in his simple way of seeing things he was going to make everything right with darling by finishing off her big enemy the shakes came back but this time not from fear if somebody did not do something i was going to be right in the middle right where i would have to make a choice to act and nothing i did would make anyone happy i tried distracting myself by testing the ladys dressing shadows fell upon us i looked up into silents cold eyes into darlings more compassionate face silent cast a subtle glance ravens way he was in the middle too the lady clawed at my arm lift me she said i did she was as weak as water i had to support her not yet she told darling as though darling could hear he is not yet finished they had gotten a leg and an arm off the dominator those they threw into the woodpile tracker hung on so they could carve on the dominators neck goblin and oneeye stood by waiting for the head ready to run like hell some guards planted the son of the tree windwhales and manias hovered overhead others with the taken were harassing toadkiller dog and the savages through the forest raven was getting closer and i was no closer to knowing where i stood that sonofabitching dominator was tough he killed a dozen men before they finished carving him up even then he was not dead like limpers his head lived on time for goblin and oneeye goblin grabbed the stillliving head sat down held it tightly between his knees oneeye hammered a sixinch silver spike through its forehead into its brain the dominators lips kept forming curses the nail would capture his blighted soul the head would go into the fire when that burned out the spike would be recovered and driven into the trunk of the son of the tree meaning one dark spirit would be bound for a million years guards brought limper parts to the fire too they did not find his head though the sodden walls of the trench whence the dragon had risen had collapsed upon it goblin and oneeye torched the woodpile the fire leapt up as if eager to fulfill its mission the limpers bolt had struck the lady four inches from the heart midway between her left breast and collarbone i confess to a certain pride in having drawn it under such terrible circumstances without killing her i should have incapacitated her left arm though she now lifted that arm reached out to darling silent and i were puzzled but only for a moment the lady pulled darling to her she had no strength so it must be that in a way darling allowed herself to be pulled then she whispered the rite is complete i name your true name tonie fisk darling screamed soundlessly the null began to fray silents face blackened for what seemed an eternity he stood there in obvious torment torn between a vow a love a hatred perhaps the concept of an obligation to a higher duty tears began coursing down his cheeks i got an old wish and was ready to cry myself when i did he spoke the ritual is closed he had trouble shaping his words i name your true name dorotea senjak i name your true name dorotea senjak i thought he would collapse in a faint then but he did not the women did raven was getting closer so i had a pain atop all the other pains silent and i stared at one another i suspect my face was as tormented as his then he nodded through his tears there was peace between us we knelt untangled the women he looked worried while i felt darlings neck shell be all right i told him the lady too but he did not care about that i wonder still how much each of the women expected in that moment how much each yielded to destiny it marked their end as powers of the world darling had no null the lady had no magic they had canceled one another out i heard screaming carpets were raining all those taken had been taken by the lady herself and after what had happened on the plain she had made certain her fate would be their fate so now they were undone and soon dead not much magic left on that field tracker too was a goner mauled to death by the dominator i believe he died happy but there was no end yet no there was raven fifty feet away he let go of case and bore down like nemesis itself his gaze was fixed on the lady though you could tell by his very step that he was on stage that he was going to do a deed to win back darling well croaker can you let it happen the ladys hand shivered in mine her pulse was feeble but it was there maybe maybe he would bluff i picked up my bow and the arrow recovered from limper stop raven he did not i do not think he heard me oh damn if he didnt it was going to get out of hand raven i bent the bow he stopped he stared at me as if trying to recall who i was that whole battleground fell into silence every eye fixed upon us silent stopped moving darling away took up a sword made certain he was between her and potential danger it was almost amusing the two of us there like twins standing guard over women whose hearts we could never have oneeye and goblin began drifting our way i had no idea where they stood wherever i did not want them involved this had to be made into raven against croaker damn damn damn why couldnt he just go away its over raven there aint going to be no more killing i think my voice began to rise in pitch you hear its lost and won he looked at silent and darling not at me and took a step you want to be the next guy dead damn it nobody could ever bluff him could i do it i might have to oneeye stopped a careful ten feet to one side what are you doing croaker i was shaking everything but my hands and arms though my shoulders had begun to ache with the strain of keeping my arrow drawn what about elmo i asked my throat tight with emotion what about the lieutenant no good he replied telling me what i already knew in my heart gone why dont you put the bow down when he drops the sword elmo had been my best friend for more years than i cared to count tears began to blur my vision theyre gone that leaves me in charge right senior officer surviving right my first order is peace breaks out right now she made this possible she gave herself up for this nobody touches her now not while im alive then well change that raven said he started moving damned stubborn fool oneeye shrieked he flung himself toward raven i heard goblin pattering up behind me too late both too late raven had a lot more fire in him than anyone suspected and he was more than a little crazy i yelled no and let fly the arrow took raven in the hip in the very side he had been pretending was crippled he wore a look of amazement as he stumbled lying there on the ground his sword eight feet away he looked up at me still unable to believe that in the end i was not bluffing i had trouble believing it myself case yelled and tried to jump me hardly looking at him i whacked him up side the head with my bow he went away and fussed over raven silence and stillness again everyone looking at me i slung rny bow fix him up oneeye i limped over to the lady knelt lifted her she seemed awfully light and fragile for one who had been so terrible i followed silent toward what was left of the town the barrackswere still burning we made an odd parade the two of us lugging women company meeting tonight i threw outat the company survivors you all be there i would not have believed myself capable before i did it i carried her all the way to blue willy and my ankle never hurt till i put her down chapter fiftynine last vote i limped into the common room at what was left of blue willy the lady supported under one arm bow used as a crutch the ankle was killing me i had thought it almost healed i deposited the lady in a chair she was weak and pale and only about half conscious despite the best oneeye and i could do i was determined not to let her out of my sight our situation was still fraught with peril her people no longer had any reason to be nice and she was at risk herself probably more from herself than from raven or my comrades she had fallen into a state of complete despair is this all i asked silent goblin and oneeye were there and otto the immortal wounded as always after a company action with his eternal sidekick hagop a youngster named murgen our standardbearer three others from the company and darling of course seated beside silent she ignored the lady completely raven and case were back by the bar present without having been invited raven wore a dark look but seemed to have himself under control his gaze was fixed on darling she looked grim she had rebounded better than the lady but she had won she ignored raven more assiduously than she did the lady there had been a showdown between them and i had overheard his half darling had made very clear her displeasure with his inability to handle emotional commitment she had not cut him off she had not banished him from her heart but he was not redeemed in her eyes he then had said some very unkind things about silent whom it was obvious she held in affection but nothing deeper and that had gotten her really angry i had peeped then and she had gone on in great length and fury about not being a prize in some mens game like a princess in some dopey fairy tale where a gang of suitors ride around doing stupid and dangerous things vying for her hand like the lady she had been in charge too long to accept a standard female role now she was still the white rose inside so raven was not so happy he had not been shut out but he had been told he had a long way to go if he wanted to lay any claims the first task she had given him was righting himself with his children i halfway felt sorry for the guy he knew only one role hard guy and it had been stripped away oneeye interrupted my thoughts this is it croaker this is all going to be a big funeral it would shall i preside as senior officer surviving or do you want to exercise your prerogative as oldest brother you do it he was in no mood to do anything but brood neither was i but there were ten of us still alive surrounded by potential enemies we had decisions to make all right this is an official convocation of the black company last of the free companies of khatovar weve lost our captain first business is to elect a new commander then we have to decide how were going to get out of here any nominations you otto said im a physician youre the only real officer left raven started to rise i told him you sit down and keep quiet you dont even belong here you walked out on us fifteen years ago remember come on you guys who else nobody spoke nobody volunteered nobody met my eye either they all knew i did not want it goblin squeaked is anybody against croaker nobody blackballed me its wonderful to be loved grand to be the least of evils i wanted to turn it down the option was not there all right next order of business getting the hell out of here were surrounded guys and the guard will get its balance pretty soon weve got to get gone before they start looking around for somebody to whip on but once we get clear then what nobody offered an opinion these men were as much in shock as the guards all right i know what i want to do since time immemorial one of the jobs of the annalist has been to return the annals to khatovar should the company disband or be demolished weve been demolished i propose a vote to disband some of us have assumed obligations that are going to put us at odds as soon as we dont have anybody more dangerous to fuss at i looked at silent he met my gaze hed just moved his seat so he was more into the gap between darling and raven a gesture understood by everyone but raven himself i had nominated myself guardian for the lady for the time being there was no way we could keep those two women in one anothers company for long i hoped we could hold the group together as far as oar i would be satisfied with getting to the edge of the forest we needed every hand our tactical situation could not have been worse shall we disband i asked that caused a stir everyone but silent argued the negative i interjected this is a formal proposition i want those with special interests to go their own ways without the stigma of desertion that dont mean we have to split what im saying is we formally shed the name the black company ill head south with the annals looking for khatovar anyone who wants can come under the usual rules nobody wanted to give up the name that would be like renouncing a patronym thirty generations old so we dont give it up who would rather not go look for khatovar three hands rose all belonged to troopers who had enlisted north of the sea of torments silent abstained though he wanted to go his own way in pursuit of his own impossible dream then another hand shot up belatedly goblin had noted that oneeye was not opposed they started one of their arguments i cut it short i wont insist on the majority dragging everybody along as commander i can discharge anyone who wants to follow another path silent he had been a brother of the black company longer than i we were his friends his family his heart was torn finally he nodded he would go his own road even without promises from darling the three who had opposed heading for khatovar nodded too i entered their discharges in the annals youre out i told them ill deal out your shares of money and equipment when we clear the south edge of the forest till then we stick together i did not pursue it further or in a moment i would have been hanging all over silent bawling my eyes out we had been through a lot he and i i wheeled on goblin pen poised well do i strike your name go on oneeye said hurry do it get rid of him we dont need his kind hes never been anything but trouble goblin scowled at him just for that im not leaving im going to stay and outlive you and make your remaining days examples of misery and i hope you live another hundred years i had not thought they would split fine i said stifling a grin hagop take a couple men and round up some animals the rest of you collect whatever might be useful like money if you see any laying around they looked at me with eyes still dull with the impact of what had happened were getting out guys as soon as we can ride before any more trouble finds us hagop dont stint on pack animals i want to carry off everything that isnt nailed down there was talk argument whatnot but i closed the official debate at that point cunning devil that i am i got the guards to do our burying i stood over the company graves with silent and shed more than a few tears i never thought elmo he was my best friend it had hit me at last hard now i had done all the duties there was nothing to hold it at bay he was my sponsor when i came in silent lifted a hand gently squeezed my arm it was as much of a gesture as i could expect the guards were paying their last respects to their own their daze was fading soon they would begin thinking about getting on with business about asking the lady what they should do in a sense they had been rendered unemployed they did not know their mistress had been disarmed i prayed they did not learn for i meant to use her as our ticket out i dreaded what might happen should her loss become general knowledge on the broad canvas civil wars to torment the world on the fine attempts at revenge upon her person someday someone would begin to suspect i just wanted the secret kept till we had a good run at getting out of the empire silent took my arm again he wanted to go one second i said i drew my sword saluted our graves repeated the ancient formula of parting then i followed him to where the others waited silents party would ride with us a while as id wished our ways would part when we felt safe from the guards i did not look forward to that moment inevitable though it was how keep two such as darling and the lady in company when there was no survival imperative i swung into the saddle cursing my wretched aching ankle the lady gave me a dirty look well i said youre showing some spirit are you kidnapping me you want to be alone with all your folks with maybe nothing better than a knife to keep order then i forced a grin weve got a date remember dinner at the gardens in opal for just a moment there was a spark of mischief behind her despair and a look from a moment by a fire when we had come close then the shadow returned i leaned closer trembling with the thought i whispered and i need your help to get the annals out of the tower i had not told anyone that i did not have them in my possession yet the shadow went dinner thats a promise the witch could promise a lot just with a look and her tone i croaked in the gardens yes i gave the timehonored signal hagop started off on point goblin and oneeye followed bickering as usual then murgen with the standard then the lady and i then most of the others with the pack animals silent and darling brought up the rear well separated from the lady and i as i urged my mount forward i glanced back raven stood leaning on his cane looking more forlorn and abandoned than he should case was still trying to explain it to him the kid had no trouble understanding i figured raven would once he got over the shock of not having everyone jump to do things his way the shock of discovering that old croaker could fill his bluff if he had to im sorry i murmured his way not quite sure why then i faced the forest and did not look back again i had a feeling he would be on the road himself soon enough if darling really meant as much to him as he wanted us to think
