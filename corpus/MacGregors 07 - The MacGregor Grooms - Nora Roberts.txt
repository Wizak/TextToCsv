at my stage of life the years pass quickly with season rushing into season every moment should be savored and lived to the fullest of course i felt the same way when i was thirty now in the last handful of years ive watched four of my beloved grandchildren find love marry and start families laura then gwen julia then mac happiness beams out of their eyes contentment shines in their voices each has built a home and a life with the mate of their heart so why i ask you did it take them so damn long hah if it hadnt been for me theyd still be floundering around and there wouldnt be a single greatgrandchild for anna to cuddle and spoil would there but do i ask for gratitude no indeed as long as im head of this family ill do my duty without the need for thankyous its my duty and my pleasure to see that my chicks are comfortably and properly roosted it would seem with all this marital bliss going on that the other grandchildren would get the hint and follow the fine example of their siblings and cousins but no no the macgregors are a stubborn and independent lot and god bless them for it thankfully im still around to see that things get done i saw three of my girls to the altar and gave my first grandson his nudge some say its interference bah i say its wisdom ive decided its time to apply a little wisdom to my namesake daniel campbell macgregor now hes a fine boy sharp as a whiplash if a mite temperamental handsome too looks a bit like i did at his age so he doesnt lack for female companionship thats part of the problem as i see it too much quantity and not enough quality weve found a way to fix that dcs an artist which he comes by naturally enough though for the life of me i dont understand half the things he paints hes made a fine success out of his work now what the boy needs is a woman to share that success his life and give him children to center it not just any woman mind a woman with backbone a woman with brains and ambitions and breeding the woman i picked out for him while they were both still children ive been patient bided my time i know my boy and just how to handle him a bit perverse is my d c the type of man who too often goes left if you tell him hed be better off turning right comes i suppose from the eight years of childhood when his father was president and there were so many rules that had to be obeyed well now with a little help from an old and dear friend well get young daniel campbell turned in the right direction and let him think he did it all by himself a wise man doesnt need thanks just results part one dc chapter contents next the light poured through the tall windows and splashed on the violent slashes of sapphire and ruby it washed over the man who stood before the canvas like a warrior at battle wielding a paintbrush like a claymore he had the face of a warrior tough intense with knifeedged cheekbones adding hollows a mouth that was full but firmed in concentration eyes brilliant blue and icy cold beneath knitted brows the color of old mahogany his hair waved over his ears curled over the collar of the splattered denim shirt he wore in lieu of a smock hed rolled the sleeves up and the welltoned muscles of his arms rippled as he slashed the brush on canvas he was built like a warrior broad of shoulder narrow of hip and long of leg his feet were bare his wide and clever hands smeared with paint in his mind he saw explosions of emotion passion and lust greed and hunger and all of this he fought onto the canvas while meanedged rock pumped out of the stereo and thumped against the air painting was a war to him one he was determined to win battle after battle when the mood was on him he would work until his arms ached and his fingers cramped when his mood was otherwise he could and did ignore his canvases for days even weeks there were those who said d c macgregor lacked discipline to those he said who the devil wanted it as he clamped the brush between his teeth switched to a palette knife to smear on a bold emerald his eyes glittered in triumph he had it now the hours of waging this battle were nearly done a thin line of sweat slid down the center of his back the sun beating through the windows was fierce now and the studio was viciously hot because hed forgotten to turn on the airconditioning or open a window to the warm spring air hed forgotten to eat as well or check his mail answer the phone or so much as glance out any of the wonderfully tall windows in his apartment the energy swirled through him as potent as primitive as john mellencamps edgy streetwise vocals blasting through the room when dc stepped back the brush still clenched like a pirates blade in his teeth the palette knife like a dagger in his hand that firm somewhat forbidding mouth curved thats it he murmured he put the brush in a jar of solution began to absently clean the knife as he studied his work need he decided he would call it simply need for the first time in hours he realized the room was stuffy the clashing and familiar scents of turpentine and paint thick in the air he crossed the unpolished hardwood floor and shoved open one of the tall windows took a deep gulp of fresh air it had been the windows and this view of the c o canal that had sold him on this apartment when hed decided to come back to washington hed grown up here with eight years of his life spent in the white house as first son for a space of time hed lived and worked in new york and enjoyed it hed also lived and worked in san francisco and enjoyed that as well but all through his restless twenties something had tugged at him hed finally given in to it this was home he stood by the window with his hands shoved in the back pockets of ragged jeans the cherry blossoms were in full glorious bloom the canal sparkled in the afternoon light joggers plugged away along the towpath dc wondered idly what day it was then realizing he was starving to death he left the music blaring and headed to the kitchen the penthouse was two levels with the top designed for a master bedroom suite dc had made it his studio and slept on a mattress tossed on the floor in the spare room he hadnt gotten around to dealing with bed frames most of his clothes were still in the packing boxes theyd been shipped in nearly two months before he figured they worked efficiently enough as dressers until he found time to buy the real thing the main floor had a spacious living area ringed by more windows still undraped in it there was a single sofa the tags still on a glorious duncan phyfe table with a half inch of dust coating its surface and a floor lamp with a dented metal shade the randomwidth pine floor was bare and desperately needed vacuuming the dining alcove off the kitchen was empty the kitchen itself in shambles what dishes and pots werent heaped in the sink were still in boxes he went directly to the refrigerator and was bitterly surprised to find it empty but for three beers a bottle of white wine and two eggs he could have sworn hed gone shopping rummaging through the cupboards he came up with a few slices of very moldy bread a bag of coffee six boxes of cornflakes and a single can of soup resigned he ripped open a box of cereal and ate a handful while debating which he wanted more coffee or a shower hed just decided to make the coffee and take it with him into the shower when the phone rang he noted without much interest that his message light was blinking and munching dry cereal he answered hello theres my boy and those ice blue eyes went warm that hard mouth went soft dc leaned against the counter and grinned hey grandpa what are you up to some would say no good daniels voice boomed out dont you return your messages ive talked to your bloody machine half a dozen times in the last few days your grandmother wanted to fly down to make sure you werent dead in your bed dc only lifted a brow it was well known that daniel used his serene wife whenever he wanted to nag the children ive been working good thats good but you can take a breath now and then cant you im taking one now ive a favor to ask you dc i dont like to do it daniel let out a heavy sigh and had his grandsons brow knitting what do you need you wont like it god knows i cant blame you but im in a bit of a fix your aunt myra is she all right dc straightened from the counter myra dittmeyer was his grandmothers oldest and dearest friend his own godmother and an honorary member of the clan macgregor dc adored her and remembered guiltily that he hadnt been to see her since he returned to washington six weeks before oh shes fit and fine boy dont you worry about that the womans just as feisty as ever but well she has another godchild i doubt you remember the girl youd have met her a time or two when you were a lad layna drake concentrating dc got a vague image of a spindly little girl with hair like dandelion fluff what about her shes back in washington you know drakes the department stores thats her family shes working in their flagship store there now and myra well im just going to say it straight out theres a charity ball tomorrow night and myras fussing because the girl doesnt have an escort shes been at me to ask you damn it grandpa i know i know daniel used his most longsuffering sigh women boy what else can i say theyll peck away at us like ducks until we just give in i told her i would ask you it would be a big favor to me if youd see your way clear for this one night if you and aunt myra are trying to set me up daniel interrupted with a hearty laugh that had dc frowning not this time boy this girl isnt for you take my word shes pretty enough and well mannered but shed never do for you too cool to my way of thinking and a bit of the noseintheair sort no no i wouldnt like to see you looking in that direction and if you cant spare the evening ill just tell myra i reached you too late and you already had plans tomorrow night dc scooped his fingers through his hair he hated charity functions is it black tie im afraid so at the muttered oath in response daniel made sympathetic noises tell you what ill just call myra back and tell her you cant make it no use wasting your evening with a girl whos likely to bore you to tears is there i doubt the two of you have a single thing in common better you start looking for a wife its time you were married and settled daniel campbell past time your grandmother worries youll end up starving in your studio a lonely old man without a single chick or child ive got another girl in mind shes ill do it dc interrupted purely in reflex if daniel didnt think much of myras goddaughter it meant he wouldnt be on the phone constantly asking for relationship updates perhaps after this favor his grandfather might ease off his relentless dynasty building and though dc didnt hold out much hope for that outcome it was worth a try what time tomorrow and where do i pick whatshername up oh bless you i owe you for this one the affairs at eight at the shoreham hotel laynas taken over her parents town house on o street examining his nails daniel rattled off the address i appreciate you getting me out of this little fix dc dc shrugged upending the cereal box into his mouth as he traded family gossip with daniel and he wondered fleetingly where the hell he might have packed his tux oh aunt myra really layna drake stood in her underwear a waterfall of white silk over her arm and a mortified expression on her face a blind date not really sweetheart myra smiled youve met before when you were children i know its an imposition but daniel rarely asks me for anything its just one evening and you were going anyway i was going with you ill still be there hes a very nice young man darling a bit prickly but still very nice she beamed of course all my godchildren are wonderful people myra continued to smile as she sat and studied her goddaughter myra was a small woman with hair as white and soft as snow and with a mind as sharp and quick as a switchblade when the moment called for it as it did now she could adopt a fragile and helpless air the aged widow dittmeyer she thought with an inner chuckle daniel worries about him she continued and so do i the man keeps too much to himself but honestly who would have thought when i was just casually mentioning tonights affair and how youd come back to washington that daniel would get this idea in his head i was just myra fluttered her hands helplessly i didnt know how to say no i realize what an imposition it is because her adored godmother suddenly looked so unhappy layna relented it doesnt matter as you said im going anyway gracefully she stepped into her gown are we meeting him there ah gauging the timing myra rose actually hell be here shortly to pick you up ill meet you there goodness look at the time my driver must be wondering what happened to me but ill see you in an hour or so darling myra called out moving with surprising speed for a woman of her age you look gorgeous she said once she was safely halfway down the stairs layna stood in the unzipped column of white silk and heaved out a breath typical she thought it was just typical her godmother was forever shoving men into her path which left her with the sometimes irritating job of having to push them out again marriage was something shed firmly crossed off her life plan after growing up in a house where manners took precedence over love and casual affairs were politely ignored layna had no intention of finding herself in the same sort of relationship men were fine as decoration as long as she ran the show and at the moment her career was much more important than having someone to dine with on saturday night she intended to continue her steady climb up the familys corporate ladder at drakes in ten years according to her calculations she would take over as ceo it was another show she intended to run drakes wasnt just a department store it was an institution being single and remaining that way insured she could devote all her time and energies to maintaining its reputation and its style she wasnt her mother layna thought with a faint frown marring her brow who thought of drakes as her personal closet or her father who had always been more concerned with bottomline profits than innovations or traditions she was layna thought herself and to her drakes was both a responsibility and a joy it was she supposed her true family some she mused might find that sad but she found it comforting with a quick move she zipped the dress part of her responsibilities to drakes was to mingle to attend social functions to her it was simply a matter of changing gears from one kind of work to another the afterhours work called on training shed received throughout her childhood and was second nature to her now and the job often meant being linked with the proper escort at least this time her aunt myra didnt appear to have any real interest in making a match it would just be a matter of making small talk with a virtual stranger for an evening and god knew she was an expert at such matters she turned and picked up the pearlanddiamond drops shed already set out on her dresser the room reflected her taste simple elegance with a dash of flash the antique headboard of carved cherry the highly polished surfaces of lovingly tended occasional tables topped with vases of fresh flowers or carefully chosen accessories her home now she thought with quiet pride shed made it her own there was a cozy seating area in front of a small marble fireplace and a dainty ladies vanity displaying a collection of boldly colored perfume bottles she selected her scent absently dabbing it on while she allowed herself to wish just for a moment that she could spend the evening quietly at home shed put in a tenhour day at drakes her feet hurt her brain was tired and her stomach was empty pushing all that aside she turned to the cheval glass to check the line and fit of her gown it was cut straight at the bodice and flowed without fuss to the ankles leaving her shoulders bare she added the short jacket slipped into her shoes and checked the contents of her evening bag when the doorbell rang she only sighed once at least he was prompt she remembered dc vaguely from childhood shed been much too nervous and impressed from meeting the president to notice much else but shed heard of him off and on over the years an artist she reminded herself as she started downstairs of the modern school which she didnt pretend to understand layna preferred the classics in all things had there been some scandal about him and a ballet dancer a few years back or had it been an actress ah well she thought she supposed the son of a former president would make news over trivialities and being the grandson of daniel macgregor would only intensify the spotlight layna was much happier working backstage herself and obviously the man couldnt be such a hit with the ladies if he couldnt even get his own date on a saturday night putting on her company smile she opened the door only years of education by swiss nuns and the discipline theyd instilled kept her mouth from dropping open this man this very dangerous looking man in black tie with hair the color of her prized diningroom table and eyes so blue they burned needed his grandfather to find him a date layna drake he had to have the wrong house was all dc could think this shimmering willow stem in white silk was nothing like the spindly little girl he remembered rather than dandelion fluff her hair was spun gold curved sleekly around a face that might have been carved from ivory her eyes were a soft and misty green she recovered her howdoyoudo smile never faltering as she offered a hand yes daniel macgregor dc daniels my grandfather dc then normally she would have invited him in played hostess for a short time and given them both an opportunity to get somewhat comfortable with each other but there was something not quite safe about him she decided he was too big too male and those eyes were far too bold well deliberately she stepped out and closed the door behind her shall we go sure cool his grandfather had said and dc decided the old man had hit the mark definitely an ice princess for all her glamorous looks it was going to be a very long evening layna took one look at the ancient and tiny sports car at the curb and wondered how the hell she was supposed to fold herself into it wearing this gown aunt myra she thought what have you gotten me into chapter contents prev next she felt as if she were locked inside a mechanical shoe box with a giant the man had to be sixfour if he was an inch but he seemed perfectly content to drive the toy car at high rates of speed through the swirling washington traffic layna clamped a hand on the padded handle of her door checked the fit of her seat belt and prayed she wouldnt be crushed like a bug on the windshield before the evening even started small talk she decided would keep her mind off that particular image aunt myra tells me we met some years ago when your father was president the last word came out in a squeak as he threaded the little car between a bus and a limo then careened around a circle thats what i hear you just relocated in washington yes realizing shed squeezed her eyes shut layna lifted her chin and courageously opened them again me too she smelled fabulous dc thought it was mildly distracting so he opened his window and let the air whip through the car really her heart was in her throat now didnt he see that light was turning red wasnt he going to slow down she bit back a gasp nearly strangled on it as he zoomed through the yellow just as it blinked to red are we late for what you seem to be in a hurry not particularly you ran a red light he cocked a brow it was yellow he said downshifting then screaming past a slowmoving compact i was under the impression one slowed for a yellow light in preparation for stopping not if you want to get where youre going i see do you always drive like this like what like youre at the wheel of a getaway car after a bank robbery he thought about it smiling at her description yeah he made the turn to the hotel and pulled in with a cocky squeal of brakes saves time he said easily then unfolded those long legs and climbed out of the car layna sat where she was catching her breath offering up her gratitude that shed arrived in one piece she hadnt moved a muscle by the time dc rounded the hood passed the keys to the valet and opened her door youre going to want to unhook your seat belt he waited while she did so then took her hand to help her out it brought them close made him aware of her scent again the texture and shape of her hand she was a looker all right he mused seasiren eyes in a cameo face an intriguing contrast though portraiture wasnt the heart of his work he sometimes sketched faces that interested him he imagined hed be compelled to sketch hers her legs were still weak but she was alive layna drew one deep steadying breath people like you shouldnt be issued a drivers license and should never be allowed behind the wheel of a car for any reason particularly that soup can on wheels its a porsche because she didnt seem inclined to move on her own he kept her hand and pulled her into the hotel lobby if youd wanted me to slow down why didnt you just ask i was too busy praying he grinned at that a quick flash of humor it didnt detract from the danger of his face by a whit layna would have said it only added to it looks like your prayers were answered where the hell are we going here setting her teeth layna turned to the bank of elevators and jabbed the button then she stepped in ahead of him and jabbed the proper button for the proper ballroom simmering behind her back dc rolled his eyes you know what the hell was her name layna if youre going to sulk this is going to be a very long tedious evening she kept her eyes trained straight ahead and kept a choke hold on her temper she knew it was a bad one tending toward blasts of sarcasm if she didnt maintain control i dont sulk her voice had as much warmth as winter in winnipeg only deeply ingrained manners prevented her from stalking off the elevator the minute the doors slid open instead she stepped off turned gracefully and waited for him to stand beside her temper put color in her cheeks dc noted as he took her arm added passion to a cool and classic face if hed had any interest in her he thought hed make it his business to put that color there that snap in her eyes as often as possible but since he didnt and he wanted to get through the evening as smoothly and painlessly as possible he would placate sorry sorry she thought as he guided her into the ballroom that was it that was all obviously he hadnt inherited any of his fathers diplomatic skills or his mothers charm at least the room was full of people and sound layna wouldnt be stuck making conversation with a graceless oaf all night as soon as manners permitted she intended to separate and find someone sensible to chat with wine he asked her white yes thank you hed pegged her there dc mused as he got her a glass and selected a beer for himself he could only be grateful that his adored meddler of a grandfather wasnt playing matchmaker this time around there you are myra hurried over both hands extended oh didnt they make a handsome couple she couldnt wait to tell daniel how striking their babies looked together dc youre sinfully handsome she tilted her head as he bent down to kiss her cheek did you save a dance for me of course your parents are here why dont you come sit with us awhile she stepped between them sliding an arm around each and making them a unit i know you have to mingle and of course youll want to dance glorious music tonight but im entitled to be selfish with you for a few minutes with the skill and style of long practice myra steered them through the crowd around groups that had gathered to chat winding among tables spread with white cloths and decked with bouquets of sunny spring flowers she was dying for a chance to watch them together to study the little details of body language to see how they behaved in her head she was already working on the guest list for the wedding look who i brought us myra announced dc shelby campbell macgregor sprang to her feet her gown of citrine silk rustled as she opened her arms to her son the russet curls piled on top of her head brushed his cheek i didnt know you were coming neither did i he held her close a moment then turned to catch his father in a bear hug alan macgregors silver hair glinted under the lights a grin spread over his strong face as he looked at his son god you look more like your grandfather every day even an oaf could love his family layna supposed but a part of her had softened because the love between them and their enjoyment of it was so obvious if shed met her parents under similar circumstances there would have been impersonal air kisses and a polite how are you then shelby turned her gray eyes warm the slim brows over them lifting curiously hello shelby macgregor my goddaughter myra said with a lilt of pride layna drake its wonderful to meet you mrs macgregor shelby accepted the hand pleased that it felt strong and capable youd be donna and matthews daughter yes theyre in miami now give them my best when you speak to them again alan this is layna drake donna and matthews daughter and myras goddaughter myras told us a great deal about you alan took her hand held it warmly youve moved back to washington yes sir its good to be back its an honor to meet you again i was introduced to you when i was a child i was terrified he grinned as he pulled out a chair for her was i frightening no sir you were presidential id just lost my two front teeth and was feeling miserably gawky you talked to me about the tooth fairy she smiled i fell in love with you really alan winked at his wife when shelby chuckled you were my first crush it took at least two years before you were replaced by dennis riley and that was only because he looked so very stalwart in his boy scout uniform fascinating dc thought as he watched layna chat with his parents suddenly all this warmth and animation oh the coolness was still there a light sheen on the surface but the charm and vivacity bloomed under it like the blush on a new rose when she laughed it was like a murmur through fog sexy but discreet he had to admit it was a pleasure to watch her those smooth economical gestures the sleek sweep of gilded hair the slow curve of soft shapely lips it was entertaining to listen to her that low cultured voice especially if he didnt have to actually talk to her dc for heavens sake myra gave him a subtle elbow jab and kept her voice in a whisper you havent even asked her to dance what ask layna to dance she hissed fighting impatience where are your manners oh sorry hell he thought but obligingly touched a hand to laynas shoulder she nearly jolted and her head whipped around her eyes meeting his shed all but forgotten he was there ignoring her duties she realized with an inward wince she fixed a smile on her face and prepared to shift her attention from the delightful parents to the oafish son would you like to dance her heart dropped to her toes if he danced the way he drove shed be lucky to leave the dance floor with all of her limbs intact yes of course feeling like a woman approaching a firing squad she rose and allowed him to lead her toward the dance floor at least the music was lovely she mused slow dreamy heavy on the brass a number of couples were taking advantage of it so the dance floor was crowded crowded enough that layna had hope her partner wouldnt feel compelled to plow through it stumbling over her feet and wrenching her arms out of their sockets then he stopped near the edge of the dance floor and turned her into his arms it was surprise she decided sheer surprise that had her mind fogging who would have believed that such a big man could move so well the large hand at her waist wasnt rough or awkward but it was very very male it made her outrageously aware there was only a thin barrier of silk between it and her skin the lights twinkled down dancing over his face over that notquitetamed mane of richly colored hair his shoulders were so broad she thought numbly his eyes so blue she struggled to clear such ridiculous thoughts out of her mind and behave your parents are wonderful people i like them she was slim as a willow he thought a longstemmed rose he watched the lights play over her face hardly aware hed drawn her closer their bodies fit like two pieces of a complicated puzzle her pulse quickened without thinking she slid her hand over his shoulder so her fingers brushed the back of his neck um what had they been talking about id forgotten how lovely washington can be in the spring uhhuh desire snaked up his spine circled in his gut where the hell had it come from i want to sketch your face of course she hadnt heard a word he was saying she could only think that a woman could blissfully drown in those eyes i believe theyre calling for rain tomorrow a little sigh escaped when his fingers splayed over her back fine if he dipped his head he could have that mouth find out if the taste of it would soothe the edges on this sudden clawing need or sharpen it then the music ended someone bumped them and shattered the thin glass bubble that seemed to have surrounded them both of them stepped back both of them frowned thank you layna said and her voice was carefully controlled again that was very nice yeah he took her arm keeping the contact very light very impersonal he wanted to get her back to the table dump her and escape until his mind cleared more than willing to cooperate layna let herself be guided through she wanted to sit down quickly before her legs gave way chapter contents prev next dcs big plan for sunday was to sleep late eat an enormous breakfast which hed specifically shopped for and spend a couple hours at his health club after that his most knotty decision would be whether to while away the afternoon in solitude or to wander down to m street to the blues festival the plan broke apart when he found himself awake and restless just after sunrise annoyed he tried to sink back into the fitful sleep that had plagued him through the night but every time he began to drift he started to think of her that was more irritating than getting up there was no reason for layna drake to be on his mind that one moment of physical connection of awareness had been a short side trip in a long and uneventful evening theyd been scrupulously polite to each other had mingled socialized and made tedious small talk together and separately hed driven her home deliberately keeping his speed under the limit signaling for every turn and braking gently they had exchanged lukewarm handshakes and goodbyes at her door and he was certain had each been desperately relieved to have parted company so it was ridiculous for her to keep chasing through his brain for him to remember exactly the way it had felt to hold her to smell her to watch her eyes go soft and dreamy in the dance it was her face that was all he was intrigued by it in an artistic sense of course so he went to the gym early and spent a couple hours trying to sweat out the restlessness he told himself he felt better more alert more clearheaded by the time he got back to his apartment he was ready for that big breakfast he turned the stereo up to blast pushed up the sleeves of his black sweatshirt then put bacon on to fry feeling a great deal more cheerful and in control he sang along with john foggerty and mixed eggs for scrambling when the phone rang he answered onehanded as he scooped crisp bacon out of the pan so youre up and about daniel boomed out at him turn that music down boy youll have no hearing left hold on dc spent a few seconds looking for the remote control he could never find the damn thing when he needed it then jogged into the living area to turn down the music manually on his way back through the kitchen he snagged a piece of bacon yeah im up and about he said into the phone ive already been to the gym and im about to clog my arteries bacon and eggs daniel sighed wistfully i remember when i used to sit down to a sunday breakfast like that your grandmother shes so strict frets about my cholesterol so im lucky if im allowed to look at a picture of bacon these days im eating some now with a wicked grin dc crunched loud and deliberate fabulous youre a sadistic young man daniel sighed again and to think i called you up to thank you for doing me such a favor now i hope you had a miserable evening entertaining myras goddaughter i got through it well i appreciate it i know youve better things to do with your time not that shes not a sweetenough girl but just not the type whod interest you were looking for a livelier lass for you dc frowned at what was left of his slice of bacon i can do my own looking well why arent you locked away in that place with your paints and canvases hah ought to be out romancing some suitable woman do you know how your grandmother frets picturing you there by yourself in that stuffy apartment with all those paint fumes umhmm so accustomed to the lecture he could recite it himself dc grabbed another slice of bacon its a fire trap is what it is that place you live in at your age you need a nice house a good woman noisy children but i didnt call to remind you of a duty you should already have seen to daniel rushed on i appreciate what you did i remember before i found your grandmother the evenings i spent crosseyed with boredom with some girl who didnt have a single interesting thing to say what you need is common ground and a spark cant waste your time with someone without those things you wouldnt have them with little linda layna dc muttered irritated for no good reason her names layna oh yes there you are odd name dont you think well its neither here nor there its done now and you wont have to waste any more of your evenings on her when are you going to come up and see your grandmother shes pining for you ill come visit soon scowling dc tossed the rest of the bacon back on the platter whats wrong with layna who in his office in his fortress in hyannis port daniel had to cover the mouthpiece on the phone until he was certain hed controlled the bark of laughter layna dc repeated through his teeth whats wrong with layna oh nothing nothing at alls wrong with her pretty young woman fine manners as i recall shes just not for you chilly sort of thing isnt she her parents are cold fish and stiff as two boards if i remember right well you eat your breakfast lad and make time to come see your grandmother before she nags me to distraction okay yeah give her my love oh that ill do and daniel hung up wondering how long it would take his grandson to pay a call on pretty layna drake it took under an hour particularly since dc found hed lost his appetite and had poured his egg batter down the sink he put his sketchbook and his pencils and charcoals in a battered leather bag and slung it over his shoulder he decided to walk to give himself time to think his grandfather was right of course that grated a bit the idea that the old man would so confidently eliminate her it grated just as much dc discovered as it did when daniel tossed selections of proper candidates for marriage at his feet hed damn well make his own choices he certainly wasnt thinking about layna in that manner he just wanted to sketch her face and since theyd more or less agreed he could come by and do so that day he might as well get it done she didnt answer his knock vaguely peeved he shifted his bag and told himself hed be smarter to walk down to m street after all and do some sketching there but he could hear the light and liquid notes of a chopin concerto drifting through the open windows with a shrug he tried the door found it unlocked and stepped inside layna he glanced around interested as she hadnt let him over the threshold the night before the foyer had polished wood floors and walls the tone of lightly toasted bread an antique gateleg table held a vase of white tulips two pencil sketches on the wall caught his eye street scenes cleverly done with a fine eye for detail and movement he moved to the steps laid a hand on the glossy newel post and called up he considered going up and searching her out then decided it was wiser to look through the main floor first she wasnt in the parlor with its dignified furnishings or the booklined library which smelled of leather and roses by the time hed poked into the sitting room the dining room and the kitchen he had a solid grip on her taste and lifestyle elegant traditional tidy with occasional and surprising touches of splash a conservative woman who liked beautiful things preferred classics in furnishings reading and music and kept everything in its logical place he saw her through the kitchen window the postagestamp patio beyond was outlined with flowers layna was underplanting more white tulips with sunnyfaced yellow pansies she wore buffcolored garden gloves a widebrimmed straw hat and a brown gardening apron over simple beige slacks and a thin summer sweater she looked he thought like a picture in some country style magazine article on the proper attire for casual morning gardening competent elegance the light was good dc determined filtering nicely through branches just starting to green with new leaves he stood where he was and did three quick sketches it amused and intrigued him how precisely she worked turn the earth with the spade mix in fertilizer carefully tap out the plant place it exactly in the center of the prepared hole gently fill in the hole tamp she was lining them up like little soldiers he was grinning when he stepped outside because all her concentration had been focused on making a success of her first attempt at gardening the sound of the screen door slamming was like a bullet in the heart the spade went one way the pansies another as she jerked up and spun startled you sorry what how did you get out here she had a fist pressed against her racing heart as she stared at him i walked through the house you didnt answer the door he set his bag on the wroughtiron table centered on the patio noted the thick gardening book set there and open to instructions on the planting of annuals then walked over to pick up the pansies that had gone flying you cant just walk into someones house yes you can he crouched beside her offered the plants when the doors unlocked i told you i was coming by he smelled of soap she thought fleetingly and he moved like a big sleek leopard you certainly did not last night you ought to plant these in a sweep instead of a line and crowd them some more pizzazz with his eyes narrowed he took her chin turned her head to the left i said i wanted to sketch your face she jerked free as irritated with his touch as with his critique of her novice gardening attempts i dont remember anything about that when we were dancing its a nice light out here thisll be fine he rose to get his pad just keep gardening if you want when they were dancing layna sat back on her heels and tried to think she couldnt remember anything that happened when they were dancing except that shed gone momentarily insane now he was sitting there dwarfing the curvy little patio chair his long legs kicked out and a pencil in his hand you dont have to pose he told her shooting her a smile that went straight to her gut just pretend im not here it would be like ignoring a big sleek panther crouched in the drawing room she thought i cant work while youre staring at me i want to get these planted theyre calling for some rain this afternoon you dont have more than a dozen left so take a break he nudged the other chair away from the table with his foot sit down and talk to me she got to her feet dragging at her gloves didnt we establish that we have nothing to say to each other did we he knew how to charm a reluctant model and used his smile ruthlessly you like music so do i lets talk music chopin suits your style she shoved the gloves into the pocket of her apron i suppose wailing bagpipes suit yours he cocked a brow you have something against bagpipes she only huffed out a breath then gave in enough to sit look dc i dont mean to be rude but youd never be rude unless you meant to youre too well bred nice smile he commented drawing quickly as he spoke too bad youre so stingy with it im not when i like someone he only grinned see you meant to be rude she couldnt help it she laughed but the laughter ended on a stutter of annoyance when he leaned over and plucked off her hat its shading your eyes he said as he dropped it on the table that was the idea puzzling over him she leaned back correct me if im wrong but in my opinion you and i didnt hit it off in any particular fashion last night so she opened her mouth shut it again ridiculous she told herself to feel insulted because he agreed with her so what are you doing here sketching me i like your face its strong allfemale sexy eyes and classy bones i dont have to be attracted to you on a personal level to want to draw you i appreciate your honesty she said coldly no you dont it ticked you off hed flipped over a page and started a fresh study thats female too why get irked because we agree were not each others type it doesnt mean youre not beautiful you are turn your head to the left a little you need to tuck your hair back he leaned forward to take care of it himself skimming his fingers over her cheek as he did both of them went very still her heart fluttered in her chest continued to dance no matter how firmly she told herself it was a foolish kneejerk reaction the gilded filtered sunlight was suddenly too hot her throat was abruptly too dry youve got great skin he said it softly slowly as if the words were foreign to him he trailed his fingers down to her chin along her jaw then down so that he felt the pulse in her throat beat hard and erratic he wanted his mouth there just there tasting that wild beat simple keep it simple he ordered himself and picked up his pencil again though he wondered how the devil he was supposed to sketch when his fingers seemed to have gone numb i thought she had to clear her throat i thought you painted shapes the modern school i paint what appeals to me his eyes stayed on hers as his pencil began to move again apparently you do on some level relax she ordered herself and unballed the hands shed fisted under the table you had a show in new york a couple of years ago i didnt see it but one of my friends did thats all right i dont do a lot of shopping in drakes but my mother does layna chuckled and the smile stayed in place long enough to make his mouth water well i suppose weve exchanged subtle insults now what next we could try a conversation how do you like being back in washington very much ive always loved this house this area she glanced back toward the pansies shed planted im going to enjoy making a home here her brow creased what did you mean plant them in a sweep hmm oh the flowers more of a flow less rigid lines something like what monet did in giverney yes youre right and her eyes went soft her lips curved again as she imagined it i tend to follow directions exactly when im learning you make fewer mistakes that way she angled her head and the dappled sunlight flickered over her face turned it dreamy again soft again but then youd look at things with an artists eye and i dont imagine you worry overmuch about making mistakes not usually but he realized he was worried about making one now with her here where the light was lovely the music soaring and the air carrying just a shimmer of scent that was her turned earth and young flowers i do so i plan things carefully and very rarely deviate something about him tempted her to make an impulsive turn almost demanded it and she imagined the trip would be just as wild and fast as the ride theyd taken the night before the kind of ride layna reminded herself where a woman could end up crashing very abruptly and very hard i guess thats enough for now he shoved his pad in the bag he had to go before he did something stupid like touch her again i appreciate it youre welcome she got to her feet when he did intending to see him out but they only stood there a bit too close for comfort i know the way out he took the first step back he had a feeling if she walked inside with him hed be unable to stop himself from doing that stupid thing like pulling her against him taking a good long taste of that mouth then dragging her to the floor to take a great deal more of her while chopin crashed around them all right well goodbye right he picked up his bag turned hed nearly made it into the house and away before he was compelled to turn back she was still standing there the sunlight on her hair those misty green eyes watching him theres a dali exhibit at the smithsonian opens wednesday ill pick you up at seven no absolutely not all right she heard herself say with some surprise thatll be fine he merely nodded and strode into the house he made it to the front door before he started cursing himself chapter contents prev next he thought of a dozen reasons to break the date hed have preferred to go alone enjoy and absorb the exhibit then perhaps find an interesting woman to discuss it with over coffee or a late supper that was dc reminded himself the way he operated but he didnt break the date or the next one he found himself making with her it baffled him that he enjoyed her company it made absolutely no sense she liked art to express something specific in tangible terms she preferred her music subdued and her movies with subtitles they ended up debating half the time sitting over steaming cups of espresso or glasses of wine somehow theyd managed to have three fairly civilized dates he wondered if she was as surprised as he that theyd enjoyed themselves they were about to have a fourth four dates in two weeks dc mused it was bizarre he stepped back from the canvas frowned at it he often worked in watercolors for a change of pace he hadnt intended to do a portrait the sketches hed done of layna had simply been an exercise but theyd nagged at him until hed given in and begun to commit the image to paper watercolors would suit her cool tones soft lines he hadnt selected a sketch of her smiling again and again hed been drawn to his quick study of her looking straight ahead mouth soft and serious eyes aloof frosty sex he thought now it was the expression of a woman who challenged a man to chip through the ice to the heat and if he did what then would it be a flash or a simmer a slow burn or an explosion the wondering was maddening dc decided and erotic painting her this way was both intriguing and frustrating he had to know hed never bring that face to life until he knew what went on behind it when that realization struck him his shoulders relaxed his mouth curved up of course that was it that was why he kept going back he wanted to paint her and he couldnt until he knew her pleased that the puzzle had been solved he set his brush aside he picked up his coffee drinking deeply before he realized it had gone stone cold with a grimace he started downstairs to brew a fresh pot when his buzzer sounded he switched directions and found his mother on the doorstep ive caught you at work shelby said instantly no on a break he gave her a hard onearmed hug and now you can make the coffee fair enough i promised myself when you moved back i wouldnt start popping in unannounced she smiled up at him as they walked back to the kitchen but julia sent me new pictures of travis and your fathers not home i had to share them with someone lets see he shoved unopened mail a few dirty dishes and a sketch pad into a pile on the table shelby dug a pack of snapshots out of her purse and handed them over as she turned to hunt up coffee beans her son she thought with an eye roll at the state of his kitchen lived like the clichéd starving artist but if it suited him it was fine with her damn hes great isnt he he looks very much like you did at that age yeah foolishly pleased dc glanced up from his nephews grinning face those macgregor genes good blood she said in a fair imitation of daniel strong stock and speaking of the macgregor have you heard from him lately mmm just a few days ago he wanted to thank me for doing him a favor then nag me to come up for a visit grandmas pining again shelby laughed as she ground fresh beans youd think hed come up with a new one to hear him say it youd think anna sat around moping all day angling so that she could see dc as she measured out coffee she cocked her head what favor did you do for him layna drake dc answered absently as he studied the snapshots aunt myra was badgering him about her asked him to have me escort her to that deal the other night shelby tucked her tongue in her cheek oh really and you bought that did you foolish foolish boy huh he blinked then shrugged no its not his usual marrythegirlandmakebabiesforyourgrandmother deal he doesnt think shes my type told me straightout it was a oneshot to get myra off his back shelby opened her mouth shut it again very very foolish boy she thought amused i see and what did you think of her shes all right great face i want to paint her you shelby nearly bobbled the clean cup shed found in the cupboard you dont do portraits now and then in fact he was debating which snapshot hed use to paint little travis as a gift for his sister once again shelby decided to keep her mouth closed her son had indeed done some portraits of the family she thought now of people who mattered most to him just what she wondered did layna drake mean to him youve asked her to sit for you no im working from sketches then youve been seeing each other off and on a few times he glanced up why just curious shelby said lightly i know her parents slightly she doesnt seem a great deal like them and is that a good thing or a bad thing he moved his shoulders restlessly she doesnt have much to say about her family well shelby turned leaned back on the counter i suppose id call them surface people lots of gloss she has the polish but there seems to be more under it i prefer undertones dont you yeah appreciating the fact that his mother could always put her finger on the pulse he grinned im working on getting down to them with her i like her havent figured out why yet but i do she isnt your usual that wasnt a complaint she added with a laugh when dcs grin turned into a typical macgregor scowl or a criticism just a comment that your usual choice of women lean toward the bohemian or the flamboyant and shes neither i didnt say she was my choice i said i liked her now he grinned again and im told my mother was a flamboyant bohemian shelby lifted her eyebrows i heard that somewhere what ever happened to her she made it fashionable and shes still the most important woman in my heart oh touched and delighted she moved over to fold her arms around him to rest her cheek on the top of his head im so glad you moved back so glad dc that youre here where i can pretend im not going to drop in on you dad pretended not to drop by yesterday he wrapped his arms around her waist and squeezed dont stop cant she sighed but we wont hover you never did you were both just always there even when you werent thats our job she kissed the top of his head then turned back to pour the coffee can i keep this one he asked holding up a shot of travis showing off his two teeth in a grin sure sketches in here casually she flipped open the book on the table browsing through until she came to several studies of layna drake shes lovely shelby murmured and a little part of her heart sighed youre very attracted to her shes got a great face when his mothers gaze shifted to his held he shrugged its no big deal grandpas right shes not my type yes the macgregor rarely misses a step cagey old goat she thought as she sat down to enjoy her coffee he was probably already planning the wedding reception she decided then and there it was time to go shopping shed take a look at what drakes was showing in the new spring lines laynas assistant was all awed eyes and reverent whispers as she popped her head into laynas office ms drake theres a mrs macgregor to see you macgregor layna glanced up from her sample book shelby macgregor yes the former first lady shes right out there i couldnt believe it oh flustered layna ran a hand over her hair scanned her office to be certain everything was in place show her right in layna rose quickly smoothed her skirt hitched at the line of her jacket then rubbed her lips together to see if shed chewed off her lipstick again the answer was yes but she didnt have time to dive for her bag and repair the damage she moved forward with a smile as shelby came in mrs macgregor what a pleasure i know im interrupting your work but i was shopping and thought id just drop in for a moment im delighted you did please sit down can i get you anything coffee tea no no dont fuss shelby smiled easily as she surveyed the woman and her office tasteful she decided choosing a highbacked chair with a petit point seat cool but not cold controlled but not rigid i wont keep you long i was just browsing through casual wear you have a lovely selection thank you of course im already focused on next fall though puzzled layna smiled as she sat plaids the big news that will delight my fatherinlaw you havent met daniel have you yes actually my godmother wanted to visit and didnt feel up to making the trip to hyannis alone i went up with her for a couple days last fall its an amazing house and your inlaws are delightful people yes indeed and the plot thickens shelby thought of all the grandchildren dc most resembles daniel and she saw it that flicker in the eye the faint rise in color oh my shelby thought shes hooked yes i suppose so theyre both a bit larger than life arent they the macgregors are all a bit larger than life theyre demanding charming frustrating generous being married to one i can say that boredom ceases to be part of my vocabulary and very often chaos becomes the key word you must handle chaos very well oh layna i adore chaos with a laugh shelby rose id love to have lunch sometime id like that very much then ill check my calendar and well set it up shelby took her hand held it a moment when the man is larger than life she began the woman has to be smart and clever you strike me as a smart and clever woman layna ah thank you ill call you shelby said as she breezed out but first she decided she was going to call daniel after shed blistered his ears for meddling in her sons life shed tell him she very much approved of his choice that she mused would throw the old devil off balance a little long enough she hoped for dc and layna to figure out they were falling in love crowded noisy clubs were stimulating that was why dc enjoyed dropping into one occasionally he could listen to the music the chatter watch the movement most of all he could see the shapes of thoughts and emotions when he sketched in a place like blues corner he didnt sketch faces or bodies but feelings layna watched him studied the slashes and splots and squiggles he drew on his pad she didnt understand them but they were fascinating just the same just like the man who created them he had kicked back and was lounging at their tiny table shoulders braced against the wall behind them he wore jeans and a black tshirt and had yanked his hair back with some thin string of leather the lights were a dim hazy blue the tables around them jammed with bodies on the stingy slice of stage a man with hair down to his shoulders plunked deep notes from a bass guitar while another wearing tiny sunglasses blew aching tenor notes from a sax a painfully thin young man caressed the keys of a scarred piano seated on a stool was an old black woman with a face as wrinkled as a raisin she sang in a voice like whiskey and cream about the miseries of love layna didnt understand the music either though it pulled and stroked at something deep inside her it made her sad it made her want for somehow the singer made the idea of love worth all the misery that came with it layna sipped her wine or what the club pretended was wine and slanted a look toward dc hed barely spoken to her since hed brought her into this place he looked like some kind of bohemian god the tumble of rich hair the ripple of muscle against black cotton and denim what was she doing there what was she doing with him this was definitely the last time she told herself absolutely the last she couldnt have been more out of place under the table her foot tapped time with the bass and her heart was being torn to pieces by the slow and liquid voice of the singer shes great isnt she yes layna waved absently as smoke drifted in front of her face from the next table but why does it have to be so sad the blues reach inside you grab ahold of whats sinking your heart most times it leaves it lighter for it or shatters it she murmured he looked over then let his pad slide onto the table musics supposed to touch you affect you bring on a mood or end one is that what youre drawing moods yeah and the music he tilted his head shed swept her hair back tonight twisting it into some sort of clip in the back it changed her look he noted added a hint of fragility what mood are you in layna a fairly relaxed one you never look really relaxed you know what you look no but im sure youll tell me perfect just a little too perfect ive never seen you mussed on impulse he reached out and in one quick move nipped the clip out of her hair there not quite perfect now for heavens sake she skimmed her fingers through her hair in an attempt to smooth it then made a grab for the clip give me that no i like it down better anyway grinning he raked his fingers through it to disorder it again thats a good look for you just a little tumbled very sexy especially with that bite of temper in your eyes and a pout on your mouth i dont pout youre not the one looking at your mouth his gaze lowered to it lingered there for one long moment in one long moment her pulse began to shimmy i really like your mouth he murmured in fact wait she pressed a hand to his chest it was foolish she knew hadnt she wondered why hed yet to kiss her hadnt she wondered what it would be like when he did yet she found herself almost frightened taking this minute to draw her defenses together certain she would need them to survive intact weve already done the waiting part he closed a hand around hers then cupped his other around the back of her neck we have to get to this sooner or later see whats there or what isnt he lowered his head just enough to catch her bottom lip lightly between his teeth to feel her breath shudder out lets see what mood we make he took her mouth slowly wanting to savor and absorb the tastes the textures the movement dark tastes with a hint of cool light wine smooth textures fluid movements more her lips parted in a quiet moan that vibrated under the weeping of the sax he slipped his tongue between them taking his time and when she began to tremble he shifted angles and lazily took the kiss deeper god why had he waited so long for this was all he could think and drawing her closer he steeped himself in her she was drowning sliding down where the air was too thick to breathe and the music seeped into the blood and pulsed she hadnt expected this not this gathering her defenses had done nothing to protect her from this endless and dreamy onslaught her mind clouded and her body took over a sweet and steady ache her heart tripped once then fell with barely a sound it cost him to draw back to force himself to remember where they were her hand was still caught in his now what layna do we finish this or do we stop it i dont know how could she be expected to make a rational decision when her head was spinning if youre going to leave it up to me his smile flickered wicked around the edges before he rubbed his lips over hers again no no im not she said quickly pulling away we need to step back and look at the overall picture what i see are two unattached adults who have a basic attraction for each other im not sure what i see yet more than a little panicked she snatched up her purse shoved back from the table and rushed outside chapter contents prev next he caught up with her on the sidewalk and was just churned up enough to grab her arm and spin her around look whats the problem all you have to do is say no thanks pal not interested she tossed her hair back suddenly furious that it was messy no thanks pal not interested liar jerk she turned on her heel and strode down the sidewalk it didnt surprise her when he fell into step beside her it irritated but didnt surprise you werent exactly fighting me off in there baby she inhaled sharply had to remind herself the sidewalk cafes were full of people she would not absolutely not be pushed into creating a scene i was mildly curious she said in a voice like january frost now my curiosity is satisfied pardon me but i believe i was involved in that same little experiment you melted like butter it was a simple kiss had to be she told herself with a new sense of rising panic she didnt want to feel what shed felt want what shed wanted a simple kiss is what you give your grandmother on her birthday he hitched his bag to his other shoulder and asked himself why he was pursuing this a lady put up a stop sign you put on the brakes end of story but damn it he could still taste her layna this time she shook off the hand he put on her arm then sharply turned toward home i will not be backed into a corner this way youre making your own corners if youd just stand still a minute he swore when she only lengthened her stride just hold it he took both her arms this time held her in place and got a good look at her face her cheeks were too pale her eyes too dark and there was more jittering in them than temper youre scared it scared you he knew realizing it should make him feel sorry but it didnt it made him want to grin i figured you for more spine than that she jerked back and for the first time in her life found herself actually tempted to strike another human being i have absolutely no interest in continuing the conversation now if youll excuse me im going in we can end the conversation lets try this instead she saw his intention thrill wrapped in fear pounded at her heart i dont want but his mouth was already on hers no lazy exploration this time no slow smooth seduction he possessed then conquered then devoured lights exploded in her head heat swam through her blood all she could do was hold on and ride that high and savage wave he hadnt realized hed lifted her off her feet that hed lost himself in the taste of her until he felt his heart ram brutally against his chest he was always always aware of his size of the strength of his hands now realizing he hadnt been appalled him he dropped her back on her feet took two steps back balls in your court he turned strode away he cursed himself for days slept poorly at night he talked himself into apologizing a dozen times then talked himself out of it again it was best to stay away from her he told himself to let it go let her go before they tangled themselves up again every time he came to that decision he felt better hed work like a demon for hours then somehow shed sneak into his brain again and leave him miserable itchy and angry nothing could have pleased him more than the call from his father telling him his grandparents had come down for a quick visit it would do him good to have an easy family dinner he thought to spend an evening with people he loved and understood in fact he could go back north with them spend some time with julia and cullum and little travis see some of his cousins he could toss a few clothes in a bag pack up some canvases and paints and be on the road whenever he wanted to that he assured himself as he walked to his parents home was the beauty of his lifestyle it was simple it was basic it was his the last thing he needed was a woman clogging up the works god knew women like layna drake were major complications high maintenance he decided as the breeze fluttered and sent a shower of fading cherry blossoms flying across the street a leggy brunette in bicycle shorts jogged along with a sleek black lab on a silver leash the dog barked happily the woman gave dc a long slow smile he watched her long enough to note she tossed a look over her shoulder that radiated invitation and he cursed himself for not having the slightest interest in following up on it leggy brunettes with slow hot smiles had always been his style hadnt they so why the hell was he hung up on a cool blonde who never had a hair out of place a change of scene he told himself was definitely in order hed spend a couple of weeks in boston and hyannis port play with the kids do some work and get rid of this ridiculous obsession over a woman he climbed the short set of stairs to the walkway vivid red impatiens were spreading on either side of the doorway his mother would have planted them he knew she liked strong colors they added a touch of flash to the dignity of the town house dignity and flash it was a perfect description of his parents it made him smile to think of it the potter and the politician together theyd made marriage home and family mean something mean everything dc mused then smiled again when he heard his grandfathers laugh boom through the open windows he didnt knock but walked in he smelled flowers and lemon oil heard more laughter and the murmur of voices from the parlor his uncertain mood lifted and steadied so when he stepped in he was totally unprepared to see layna sitting kneetoknee with daniel or the two of them grinning at each other theres the lad daniel surged out of his chair moving with a speed that laughed at more than ninety years of living his shoulders were broad his hair a snowy mane that matched his beard his eyes as they met dcs twinkled blue with delight daniel hugged him like a bear trap thumped him on the back with sledgehammer blows and noted with pleasure that dc had yet to stop staring at the lass daniel had picked out for him about time you got here these women have been pouring tea down my throat when any fool can see i need a whiskey the lad wants a whiskey shelby and ill join him two fingers shelby no more anna macgregors quiet voice held authority smiling as her husband complained bitterly about a bairn being able to handle two fingers she opened her arms to dc grandma he folded himself down until their cheeks rubbed as always he found both softness and strength and closing his eyes breathed her in layna looked away before it undid her there was complete unquestioning unconditional love in that welcoming embrace so much love it sparked both envy and need she didnt want to see it didnt want to feel it you look tired anna murmured when she cupped dcs face in her hands been working he kissed her again then deliberately looked past layna nice to see you aunt myra when he kissed her cheek myra made certain she had a good strong grip on his hand you remember layna dont you yeah he looked at her now straight on measuring hows it going very well her hands wanted to tremble so she kept them neatly folded in her lap sit down and keep layna company darling myra was up and nudging him to the chair i need to ask daniel about an investment she improvised im terribly sorry keeping her voice low layna struggled to fix a casual smile on her face i didnt realize youd be here aunt myra asked if id bring her to see your grandparents were supposed to stay for dinner but i can make an excuse what for he leaned back and wished to god hed gotten the damn whiskey before hed sat beside her it doesnt bother me that stung shed been suffering for days i dont want to spoil your evening with your family i realize the last time we were angry with each other i got over it he lifted a brow in challenge didnt you of course she lifted her chin cloaked with dignity i simply thought since you stalked off like an irritable child you might be uncomfortable having me here as i recall youre the one who ran out of the club like a scared rabbit his lips curled in a sneer you dont make me uncomfortable layna just look at them daniel myra spoke out of the corner of her mouth as she pretended not to watch the couple across the room you can practically see the air sizzle around them dont know whats taking them so long daniel complained boys just scowling at her i tell you i worry about him oh theyve just had a tiff thats all its just as i told you laynas been sulking for days im just glad you decided to come see for yourself this might give them the next little nudge ive got my work cut out for me daniel sighed and sipped lovingly at his whiskey dont you worry myra well have the two of them wedded and bedded by summer he tapped his glass against her teacup you have my word on it and being a man of his word daniel didnt loiter he got to work on dc the minute myra lured layna out of the room to look at shelbys studio pretty young thing daniel said casually and pricking his ears for his wifes voice pulled out a cigar could be sturdier though needs some meat on her bones her bones look fine to me dc cocked his head if grandma comes back in while youre smoking that shell scalp you bald she wont catch me content daniel puffed out smoke and wiggled his eyebrows at his son alan ill have a real glass of whiskey this time its not worth my head coward daniel muttered but settled back with his cigar myras telling me the girls too buried in her work just now no social life her choice dc shrugged and catching daniels sorrowful look sighed and handed over what was left in his own whiskey glass youre a fine respectful lad daniel sent his son a beetlebrowed look that made alan laugh at least weve got one here who isnt afraid of his poor old granny now as i was saying that young lass has myra fretting day and night glad i got down to get a good look at her again see what shes made of girl needs the right man beside her a banker im thinking or an upandcoming executive what dc stopped sulking long enough to tune in a banker what the devil are you talking about why seeing that layna has some proper companionship happens i know a young man right here in washington hes already worked his way up to department manager good head on his shoulders has henry daniel continued pulling a name out of his hat got a future ahead of him ill just give him a call hold on just hold the hell on lurching out of his chair dc stared at his grandfather youre going to call some stiffnecked banker named henry and try to fix him up with layna hes a good lad comes from a nice family daniel blinked innocent blue eyes its the least i can do for myra the least you can do is stay out of it laynas not interested in being bartered off to some banker what a thing to say bartered indeed as glee danced in his heart daniel scowled at his grandson im speaking of arranging a perfectly acceptable social connection between two young people he jabbed the air with his cigar and if youd concentrate on finding the proper woman for yourself you wouldnt have time to get on your high horse about someone elses business whats layna drake to you id like to know nothing dc threw up his hands and shouted it pleasing his grandfather enormously shes nothing to me glad to hear it the boys hooked good and proper daniel decided and thought hed just reel him in a bit more couldnt be more ill suited to each other you dont want to be casting your eyes in that direction lad what you need is a fine sturdy girl one wholl give you lusty babies and wont be worrying if her nail polish chips that lass is too elegant for you when youre needing more the earthy sort i think im the best judge of what i need dc said coolly daniel got to his feet shot dc a narroweyed stare youd do best to listen to the wisdom and experience of your elders hah was dcs response to that and it took all daniels willpower not to laugh out loud and kiss his grandson with soaring pride he watched steelyeyed as dc stalked into the hall and shouted for layna what are you up to macgregor alan murmured watch see and learn boy he remained standing and stonefaced as layna came down the hall the ice in her voice could have frosted glass at fifty paces what in the world are you shouting about come on dc grabbed her hand pulling her down the hall what let go of me were leaving im not leaving he solved the problem in a way that made daniels heart swell with family pride dc scooped her off her feet and carried her out the door now thats a macgregor hes sweet lord here comes your mother daniel shoved whiskey and cigar into his sons hands and bolted for the side door tell her ive gone to take a turn around the garden he ordered and escaped shelby came in first pushing a hand through her hair whats all the shouting she demanded then scanned the room wheres dc wheres layna and her eyes narrowed wheres your father well alan contemplated the cigar decided he might as well enjoy it the best i can tell you is he smiled puffed on the cigar as his mother and myra came into the room my father told dc that layna wasnt suitable which naturally put dcs back up as intended after snarling at the macgregor he carried a very annoyed layna out of the house carried her out myra put her hand over her heart as her eyes filled with romantic tears oh im so sorry i didnt see i just knew one more little push would she trailed off as she caught the bland stares of her companions what i mean to say is hmm myra anna puffed out a sigh i cant believe after all these years youd actually encourage daniel this way and you she said to her son who do you think youre fooling with that cigar go get your father she sat and serenely folded her hands and then lets hear the whole story chapter contents prev next youve lost your mind shock prevented layna from struggling until they were out the door and heading down the sidewalk even when she snapped back the best she could do was gape at him put me down she spoke calmly certain that a raised voice would make things worse put me down dc get a hold of yourself its for your own good he muttered striding down the sidewalk and staring straight ahead with grim eyes if i hadnt gotten you out of there the next thing you know youd be married to some banker named henry shed never heard a whisper of a rumor about insanity in the macgregor family then again she supposed such things could be hushed up all right thats enough children were starting to point at them and giggle a woman watering the petunias in her window box stopped to stare i told you to put me down and i mean it youre not going back there you have no idea what that old schemers got in store for you first itll be id like you to meet my young banker friend henry and next youll be picking out china patterns hes ruthless i will not be carted down the street like a parcel which she realized was exactly what it felt like hed marched down two blocks and wasnt so much as breathing heavily he had arms she realized reluctantly like steel beams put me down and ill forget this ever happened forget you embarrassed me in front of your family and aunt myra forget the inconvenience and the mortification most of all ill forget you you dunderhead hes a sly one dc continued as if she hadnt spoken sly and sneaky and hes taken an interest in you now god save you her temper and she felt shed been admirably restrained in that area up to this point snapped she punched his shoulder which did no more than give her sore knuckles what the hell are you talking about he did the same thing to my sister and shes married with a son already and my cousins too three of them now hes got delusions of grandeur thinks hes some supermatchmaker and hes got his eye on you baby she hit him again flat handed this time on the side of the head as expected it was like slapping granite who are you talking about damn it if you dont put me down the macgregor of course here well talk about it inside inside shed barely blinked before he shouldered open a door inside where i want you to put me down its my place obviously you dont see what hes up to thousands wouldnt youll thank me when we straighten this out thank you oh ill thank you all right daniel campbell macgregor the roaring in her head nearly blocked out the fact that he carried her onto an elevator an occupied elevator hot color spread up her neck as the tidy middleaged couple beamed at them hello dc how are you well enough he tossed a smile at the woman as the couple stepped out into the lobby and you just fine such a beautiful day layna simply closed her eyes as the elevator door slid closed obviously she decided the man made a habit of hauling women bodily up to his apartment his neighbors were used to it why be embarrassed when she was just one of a crowd i think its clear that your lifestyle and mine are dramatically opposed she heard herself speak in a calm clear voice and blocked out the thunderous beat of her heart and though we have some family connections and live in the same neighborhood i dont think it should be a problem to avoid each other from this point to the end of our lives she drew in a cleansing breath let it out slowly now i realize im repeating myself but i want you to put me down his temper had cleared just enough for him to become distracted by the way she smelled coolly quietly sexy and turning her head so that their faces were close so that their mouths nearly brushed was her mistake after all what was a man supposed to do but take a good long taste so he did easily fitting his mouth over hers patiently waiting out her first jolt of shock greedily absorbing her quick hot burst of response missed you he muttered it or perhaps only thought it she turned into him her hands fisting in his hair as her mouth moved under his a low purr sounded in her throat and shot fire straight to his loins the doors opened remained wide then started to close again before he managed to think clearly enough to block the movement with his shoulder she dragged her hands through his hair fisted them again to keep his mouth on hers her heart had gone wild pounding some primitive beat through her blood need outrageous need clawed after it when he swore tore his mouth from hers her lusthazed mind tried to clear what trying to get the damn key if he didnt unlock the bloody door get her inside he thought he might very well end up taking her in the hall what she said again then pressed her hands to her face as reason struggled to surface wait this is there he shoved the door open then simply turned and kicked it shut with his foot as he crushed his mouth to hers again no wait well talk later he drew back barely an inch and his eyes burning blue stared into hers now well finish this no well she couldnt get her breath couldnt quite get a grip on that slippery edge of reason so for the first time in her life she let it go it looked as if she was going to take that wild fast ride after all well talk later she said breathlessly and dragged his mouth back to hers he had to get his hands on her he set her on her feet braced her back against the door and moved those widepalmed artists hands over her she was willow slim graceful extraordinary then tugging the sweater over her head he traced the same path with his lips fast and greedy as if a part of him feared she would vanish or slip away he wanted it all the balletic curve of her shoulders the lovely female swell of her breasts the long slender torso her skin smooth as satin went hot under his mouth he took her hips hitched her off her feet again and began to steadily devour she cried out her hands braced on his shoulders somehow her legs had wound themselves around his waist wild fists of need battered at her pushing her into a narrow world where the heat was brutal and there was only one answer now right now the raw words burned her throat her fingers trembled as she yanked at his shirt desperate she used her teeth on his neck then they were on the floor grappling fighting with clothes panting like animals as they groped for flesh and flesh was damp dewed with desire in a fierce and sudden move he twisted shifting her until they were facetoface torsototorso his eyes were wildly blue as he lifted her hips now he said watching her face right now he filled her she surrounded him time spun out no movement all sensation light poured through the windows wide beams where dust motes danced his heart pounded against hers beat to beat she tried to hold herself there just there on that dangerous and delicious edge but her body craved more she began to move she arched back lost in the flood of fresh pleasure moaning when he leaned in to lick at her skin shuddering when his mouth closed hungrily over her breast as the pace quickened she rode with him and gloried in it he couldnt get enough his hands raced up her back then down again the taste of her exploded inside him and only heightened a craving for more every moan or ragged gasp brought him a fresh thrill then her nails bit into his back her body arched back like a drawn bow he was helpless to stop himself from tumbling over the edge with her he could have slept for a week the thought slipped into his mind as he lay back cushioning her i with his eyes closed his body blissfully relaxed he stroked a lazy hand over her hair who would have thought he mused that there had been a wildcat pacing around inside the coolly composed ms drake he was delighted to have broken the lock on the cage door she was appalled or she badly wanted to be she was naked lying on the floor where her clothes were scattered she had just had crazed and mindless sex with a man she wasnt entirely sure she liked mindless was precisely what it had been she admitted her mind simply shut off whenever he touched her shed never in her life behaved that way torn at a mans clothes used nails and teeth on his flesh let him touch and take and take again until she was biting back screams and she felt fabulous just a physical reaction she told herself she kept her eyes closed struggling to find her common sense somewhere inside the glow that seemed to surround her shed been celibate for well a very long time she thought her body had simply betrayed her convictions she was human after all and susceptible to certain basic needs and this experience had certainly been as basic as basic could get now it was time to put things back in some kind of order she cleared her throat and sat up well it was the best her muddled brain could think of as she reached for her sweater where in gods name she wondered was her bra dc slitted his eyes open to study her her hair was tumbled her skin rosily flushed whatre you doing getting dressed why the hell with the bra she thought she would not go crawling around the floor hunting for it ive never i havent ever this was just sex this was really great sex she drew a breath braced herself and looked at him shed known hed be grinning at her and there he was a huge fabulously built male with a disordered mop of rich hair impossibly blue eyes and a smug grin her treacherous system yearned the fascinating idea of crawling onto him and nibbling away flashed brilliantly in her mind i dont do things like this she snapped it out and yanked the sweater over her head cocking a brow he sat up ever or as a rule ever this was just spontaneous combustion so to speak as you said were single unattached adults so no harm done but she started to turn to find her slacks and his hands slipped slyly under the sweater im leaving but her voice had gone weak okay he scraped his teeth gently along her jawline felt her tremble we dont understand each other we cant this was a mistake and you dont like to make mistakes so we should try it again he drew the sweater over her head gathered her closer until we get it right and just how she asked herself had she ended up in his bed if you could call a mattress on the floor of a room stuffed with boxes a bed stupefied layna stared up at the ceiling shed let it happen she was responsible for her own actions even for allowing herself to be seduced shed certainly been a willing participant and had no one to blame for the current situation but herself and what the hell was her current situation she had no real experience with this kind of irresponsible impromptu and reckless behavior she was a sensible woman with a wellconceived sensible life plan mapped out this kind of detour could only lead to sheer curves and sudden drops i have to go beside her dc groaned baby youre killing me every time she claimed she had to leave he was compelled to convince her otherwise no i mean it she slapped a hand on his chest as he rolled on top of her this has to stop lets call it an intermission cheerfully he kissed the tip of her nose im starving you want chinese i said i have to go okay lets have pasta more energy how could he make her want to tear out her hair and laugh at the same time youre not listening to me layna he sat up rolled his shoulders it crossed his mind that he hadnt felt so relaxed and content in weeks we both know by now were good in bed and on the floor and in the shower if you leave now were both going to wish you were right back here in an hour so lets just get something to eat because the sheets were on the floor she grabbed a pillow and pressed it to her as she sat up this isnt going to happen again fettucini with red sauce okay with you yes thats fine good he picked up the phone punched in some numbers then gave the order to a local italian place that delivered be about a half hour he told her ive got a bottle of merlot downstairs he got up tugged on a pair of jeans and strolled out she sat where she was for a full minute shed let it happen again she realized with a sigh she pushed back her hair all right she would do the sensible thing shed go down have a civilized meal with him and discuss the status then she would leave and never see him again chapter contents prev next you live like a pig layna sat in the kitchen sipping merlot and sampling pasta dc merely grunted broke a hunk of garlic bread in two and passed her half i keep thinking about getting a housekeeper but i dont like people around when i work you dont need a housekeeper you need heavy equipment how long have you lived in this apartment couple months you still have things in packing boxes he jerked a shoulder ill get to them sooner or later but how can you think with all this mess how can you work he flashed that quick grin at her my sister says its because i was forced to accept order throughout a large chunk of my childhood somebody was always tidying things up in the white house she arched an elegant brow dont you think you should be over that rebellious period by now apparently not you like things in their place dont you things were always in place when i was growing up it makes life simpler simple isnt always satisfying i think we can agree that we have little to no common ground which is why this situation is a mistake being lovers isnt a situation its a fact and just because you like tidy and i dont doesnt have much to do with the fact that i want the bloody hell out of you we cant possibly develop a relationship baby we have a relationship sex isnt a relationship brows knitted she wound more pasta around her fork seems to me we had something next door to a relationship going before we had sex no but it worried her because it was uncomfortably true i dont want a relationship not a serious one i dont like what they do to people oh he might have cocked a brow casually but his eyes had sharpened some underlayer here he thought that made her soft green eyes cool again such as people dont stick and because they cant they deceive each other or ignore the deceptions she hesitated then decided the circumstances called for simple honestly my family isnt good at maintaining healthy relationships my parents have an arrangement that suits them but its not the kind of thing im looking for the drakes tend to be selfish she decided for lack of a better term being with someone on a serious level requires a certain amount of compromise and unselfishness you had a rough childhood he murmured no no she let out a breath it was boggy ground trying to explain to someone else what youd never fully understood yourself i had a very good childhood i had a wonderful home opportunities to travel advantages access to an excellent education dc shook his head if anyone had asked him the same question those items would have been bottom of the list even being raised in the fishbowl of world politics hed had love warmth attention and understanding from his family did they love you your parents of course but because shed often asked herself the same question she picked up her wine to wet her throat were not like you your family we dont have that openness of heart or that ease with displaying affection its a different way of being thats all very different she added looking at him again i remember seeing pictures of your family you with your sister your parents on the news you could see the devotion thats admirable dc its lovely but its not where i come from she would wonder later if the wine had loosened her tongue or if it had simply been the fact that he listened as well as he watched my parents marriage suits them they lead their lives together and separately and they keep their affairs discreet drakes dont court or tolerate scandal i understand that and i prefer avoiding entanglements he wondered if she knew that her family made her sad or if she actually believed that what she was saying what she was feeling was inevitable you didnt avoid this one thats exactly what im trying to do and she wasnt doing a particularly good job of it layna admitted not when she was sitting in his ridiculously messy kitchen wearing his ridiculously ragged robe its like the flowers she began what flowers the pansies my instinct was to plant them precisely just so she used her hands to demonstrate because it was ordered it was logical yours was to sweep them out crowd them together tangle them up maybe you were right they look better your way more creative but i deal with things better if i have a specific plan she was he thought so earnest just then it made him want to snuggle her on his lap but you can change plans when you see the advantage of a different direction and i avoid changing them if i see as many disadvantages my plan is to concentrate on my career without distractions i like being single i like being solo so do i i also like being with you i dont have a clue why youre not my type really frost edged her voice and what would your type be amused he watched her as he enjoyed his meal youre cultured sophisticated controlled opinionated with tendencies toward snobbery and aloofness he continued to smile as her eyes flashed you could say my types the opposite youre controlling sloppy arrogant with tendencies toward irrational behavior and selfishness you could say my types the opposite see we cleared that up unoffended he topped off her wine but i still want you i even like you for some odd reason and i damn well know i have to paint you if you think that flatters me it wasnt meant to flatter you i could flatter you he said thoughtfully youd have heard it all before though and i dont like to waste my time youre a beautiful woman and that restrained sexuality is compelling its damn near brutal now that i know whats under it were both free healthy adults with a basic attraction for each other were acting on it it doesnt have to be any more or less than that unless we want it to be she said nothing for a moment what hed outlined was perfectly sensible she couldnt have said why it made her feel afraid and a little sad and if we continue to act on it wed both have to recognize the limitations i dont like the word limitations it irritated him to have her use it just then when she was sitting across from him in his kitchen wearing the ancient and ratty robe his mother had given him for christmas years ago when the scent of the shower and the sex theyd shared was still haunting his senses while were sleeping together we dont sleep with anyone else both of her eyebrows arched now at the edgy tone of his voice i wouldnt call that a limitation but common courtesy call it whatever you like nobody puts his hands on you but me just one damn minute and if the macgregor pushes henry the banker at you you just toss him right back i dont know anyone named henry frustration began to surface again and i have no idea why you think your grandfather would push a banker on me i dont need a new banker its a husband hed be pushing on you she choked grabbed her wine and drank hastily i beg your pardon it gave him some dark satisfaction to see the baffled shock on her face i was going to explain it to you before we got distracted hes taken to you henry no for gods sake you havent met henry have you my grandfather layna set down her wine lifted both hands im confused your grandfather is a happily married man in his nineties dc narrowed his eyes youre not being deliberately softheaded lets try again the macgregor likes you he thinks youre a fine young woman and that alone is enough for him to decide you need to have a fine young man beside you you need to be married and having babies its all the man thinks about i tell you hes obsessed well he never mentioned anything of the sort to me he did say something in passing about your grandmother fretting because you had yet to settle down and raise a family hah she jolted a little as dc slammed down his glass then jabbed a finger at her hah he said again there you have it my grandmother has nothing to do with it its him he uses that to guilt us into doing just what he wants us to do and before you know it youre buying diapers ive seen it happen before he focuses in on one of us at a time like a project then he drops the perfect match into our laps pretends he had nothing to do with it my cousins are dropping like flies into wedding bliss but its not enough for him as long as theres one of us left unmarried hell be at it the mans relentless she waited for the tirade to pass all right i wont argue with you youd know him best though i really cant see that he could maneuver intelligent adults into making a commitment like marriage but be that as it may she continued as dc sputtered i have no intention of marrying anyone ever so it has nothing to do with me theres where youre wrong and thats just how hell get you dc picked up his fork wagging it at her before he scooped up more pasta hes taken an interest in you layna its a relief to me as hes shifted his focus for a bit but its only fair to warn you hell be sly just casually mention to you that he knows this bright young man then hell find a way to arrange for the two of you to meet and this would be henry it would so you just tell the old meddler youre not interested in any henrys she couldnt resist and smiled sweetly a banker you say i wonder if hes tidy did your grandfather mention what he looked like oh go ahead and joke see if youre still laughing when youre talking to wedding coordinators i think i can handle a little attempt at matchmaking and im flattered that your grandfather would be interested in my future and thats another way he wraps you up in a bow dc muttered layna considered for a moment then pushed her plate aside leaned forward so this is the reason you went berserk dragged me out of your parents home and carted me down the street all because your grandfather said he was going to introduce me to a banker that sounds suspiciously like jealousy to me jealousy his eyes flashed to hers thats the thanks i get for looking out for you insults coolly she rose took her plate to the already overburdened sink just an observation then you need to have your eyes checked whatever you say she waved a hand in dismissal tell me have you ever actually run this dishwasher i wasnt jealous i was concerned umhmm she slid her plate neatly into the rack of the empty dishwasher if id been jealous id have threatened to break henry into several small pieces i see since she was there and so were they layna began to load the mountain of dishes into the washer then i would have hunted him down and followed through well how exciting are you done with your plate she knew it was ridiculous but she enjoyed the quick wild thrill that whipped through her when he shoved back from the table and spun her around im not jealous im territorial fine you use your term ill use mine he snarled lifted her up to her toes then caught the glint of amused challenge in her eyes he felt his lips twitch then let out a laugh the hell with it he muttered and was grinning when he kissed her but he wasnt jealous he told himself later much later when he lay in the dark with layna sleeping beside him he was simply protecting what hed decided to take as his temporarily as his he liked having her around even though shed browbeaten him into cleaning the kitchen before shed let him talk her back into bed he liked those cool measured glances she gave him when they talked and the hot greedy stares she sent him when they were tangled up in sex he liked the sound of her voice cool again while they were discussing some point of art or music husky when she said his name in the dark and he was touched and sorry for the young girl shed been whod had so little affection and fun in her life advantages shed said but to his mind shed had very few of those and that lack of stability and love had made her cross off the possibility of one day having a family of her own he found that terribly sad not that he was in a hurry for such things himself he thought quickly but one day certainly when the time was right the woman was right hed want a family children a house filled with noise and color he couldnt imagine not wanting all those things and he thought that somewhere inside the woman who could smile dreamily over pansies lived a heart that wanted to open and share and be treasured he could still see the way shed looked in his old robe the ragged sleeves neatly rolled up her feet bare her hair brushed smooth her mouth full and naked and that earnest look in her eyes as shed explained to him why nothing could really begin between them now she was curled beside him wearing one of his tshirts against the chilly spring night theyd discovered at least one point of common ground they both preferred sleeping with the windows open no he wasnt jealous he assured himself as he wrapped a proprietary arm around her and drew her close he was simply enjoying her for as long as it lasted chapter contents prev next dc stepped back from the portrait and stared stunned at what had come out of him onto the canvas he had no false modesty about his work in fact more than once hed been told that he carried an oftenannoying confidence when it came to his art he painted what he felt what he saw what he knew or wanted to know it was a rare thing for him to turn away disappointed from a completed painting it was rarer still for him to be overwhelmed with something hed created with his own heart and hands but layna overwhelmed him he hadnt worked from a sketch but from memory a moment in time that had lodged in his head settled there and had refused to be shifted aside until hed recreated it hed intended to work on another watercolor keeping the colors cool the tone reserved that was her image after all her style her type but hed found himself prepping the canvas for oil choosing vivid tones bold hues sweeping strokes hed painted her in bed her bed theyd spent more than a dozen nights together now some in hers some in his and most usually in a frenzy of hunger hed come to acknowledge baffled them both she looked back at him now the eyes hed painted were heavy the mouth soft and faintly curved in female awareness her hair was smooth and sleek he remembered how shed combed her fingers through it to straighten it a habit of hers as shed sat up with the tangled sheets pooled around her and shed turned her head why that single instant still lived so vividly in his mind he couldnt say that simple turn of the head that hint of a smile the way the lamplight had slanted across her shoulder and shed crossed an arm over her breast not so much in modesty he thought but again in habit that moment of sexual punch of quiet reserve of casual intimacy refused to leave him out of it hed created something more than hed ever done before it lived it knew him and even as he looked into it it looked into him who the hell are you he murmured shaken because he thought hed known and was no longer sure with something close to fury he tossed his brush down and stalked to the window when had she gotten inside him this way how had he let it happen and what the hell was he going to do about the fact that he was falling in love with a woman he wasnt even sure existed how much of what hed painted was layna and how much was what he wanted from her he wasnt entirely sure of what he wanted from her but he knew it wasnt just a body in the night it had never been no matter how hot the need she was already a part of his life and he of hers though neither of them seemed able to admit it shed nudged him into unpacking boxes hed bought her a flat of snapdragons and had pushed her into planting them willynilly along the border of her patio then theyd sat in the fragile light of dusk and admired the results hed bought a bed a real one then had let her convince him to go with the twisty brass headboard though hed feared it would look too feminine shed been right it had suited the room perfectly and hed enjoyed thanking her for her perception the minute the bed had been in place they went to the opera a street fair a ball game and the ballet for some reason those mix of styles and tastes seemed to slide into a perfect union impossible he reminded himself it wasnt the right time and she wasnt the right woman then he saw her walking down the sidewalk in long graceful strides shed changed from work he noted she habitually wore some trim and stylish business suit during working hours now she was in slim linencolored trousers and a tailored shirt the color of ripe limes she carried an enormous shopping bag with the drakes logo and looked both ways he saw with reluctant amusement before she crossed the street even as he told himself he wanted to be alone he pushed open the window and leaned out the sound had her glancing up stopping she lifted a hand to shield her eyes from the sun and though she knew it was ridiculous suffered a sharp sensory shock from the sight of him his shoulders all but filled the opening hello she smiled and tried not to squirm he was staring at her so intensely are you still working he hesitated knowing if he said yes shed politely go back the way shed come they didnt tread on each others working hours no come on up she had a key that was something else he suddenly realized had happened without either of them planning it like a man whod just managed to reach the surface of a dream he dragged his hands through his hair rubbed them over his face he walked out to the head of the stairs just as she came in the door below they stood staring at each other god i want you was all he could think when is this going to stop i took a chance youd be home and not busy her palms had gone damp and made her want to shift the bag from hand to hand i was just going to drop this off for you oh help her mind screamed i dont know what to do about you what is it a new bedspread she worked to perk up her smile very simple and masculine enough not to disturb the general ambiance of army surplus meets the east village he lifted his brows shed already taken to ordering the place it didnt bother him he didnt mind living with tidy as long as he wasnt required to do the tidying thats domestic of you bring it on up it was on sale she said stiffly now if you dont care for it you can use it for a drop cloth either way its better than that rag youve been using though of course you never bother to make the bed when she reached the top of the steps she shoved the bag at his chest youre welcome i havent thanked you yet i would have if you hadnt been so busy lecturing me that wasnt a lecture it was a comment he dropped the bag and grabbed her hand before she could turn and march back down the steps where are you going home and the next time i have an impulse to do you a favor believe me ill resist it no one asked you to buy me bed linens or wash my dishes or pick up fresh fruit at the market fury and embarrassment waged a quick and bitter war with fury edging out on top point taken she said with deadly calm and ill be sure not to do so again or to drop by without calling as im obviously unwelcome unless youre ready to jump into bed his eyes flamed temper clawed so viciously at his gut that he forced himself to take a step back this isnt about sex unable to trust himself he turned on his heel and stalked back into his studio oh isnt it the hurt and anger were huge pushing her forward and over the threshold of an area of his life where shed yet to be invited what then she demanded striding into the studio behind him i dont know what then he rounded on her ready to fight then found himself staring at her as hed stared at her portrait a short time before i dont know he said with a sigh then turned back to the window you walked in on a mood layna wanting to clear his head he braced his hands on the sill and leaned out i have a lot of them and this one she thought had suddenly shifted from irritable to unhappy she resented the fact that she wanted to walk to him and soothe it wasnt her job to soothe him nor to tolerate his capricious tempers she told herself to go to walk out and cross the last few weeks off her list as a learning experience but instead she turned slowly and looked around the room he was everywhere in it she thought from the canvases leaning against the walls to the absurd disorder of paints and brushes and jars the scents in here were sharp foreign and familiar his scent that combination of male animal and soap others that were turpentine and mixers and fresh paints it was a large room filled with light filled with him she studied canvases streaks of color here clashing shapes and textures another that was brooding shadows and yet another that was bright and foolish and joyful she couldnt understand them not really but they made her feel that she supposed mirrored exactly her reaction to the artist moods yes i see she wandered to an easel you have a number of them that would be part of what makes you what you are he turned back to study her studying his work and you stable balanced that makes you what you are what the hell are we doing together layna this was expected she reminded herself as she continued to stare at the canvas that he would come to that conclusion after she had convinced herself it didnt have to matter after all i often ask myself the same thing five minutes after were not she shrugged a shoulder determined to be practical its just what we said from the beginning basic attraction physical is it this is she gestured toward the canvas hed completed only hours before shed come into his life and changed everything this is all feeling all passion its raw and dangerous and not entirely comfortable its need he murmured yes needs are met and then they change even when youd prefer it otherwise come over here he held out a hand and tell me what you see she crossed the room but didnt take the hand he offered touching him would be a mistake she was certain when they were coming to the end and the ache in her heart was like a burning tell me what you see he said again and because she wouldnt touch him he put a hand on her shoulder to turn her toward the canvas and herself shock came first causing her to lift her arm cross it over her body in a near reflection of the pose in the painting her heart stumbled her throat closed it wasnt what i expected to paint he said quickly or to see or to feel id just finished it then i looked out the window and watched you walk down the street you youve made me beautiful you are beautiful it was too intimate layna thought with a flutter of panic the woman in the portrait had no shield no mask and the woman he had painted knew things she didnt im not like that thats how i saw you in that moment full of power and pleasure it isnt what i meant to paint he said again but its what came out of me he touched her cheek then slid his fingers down until he cupped her chin lifted it it staggers me why havent we burned each other out layna why cant i get enough of you and move on was that the plan damn right it was its not working youre starting to worry me he murmured as he lowered his mouth to hers gently softly barely a whisper of a kiss it rocked her down to the bone we should take a break from each other youre absolutely right his other hand lifted until hed framed her face weve been seeing each other constantly for weeks she leaned into him circled his waist we should ease back a little take stock makes sense she sighed rested her head on his shoulder thats not what i want me either i dont want to fall in love with you dc im not equipped for it for you it would be a disaster i know it with his eyes closed he rubbed his cheek over her hair how close are you awfully close me too oh god we cant let this happen itll ruin everything just when and his mouth was on hers taking her away from reason muddling her thoughts driving feelings to the surface where she couldnt escape them just be with me layna this time it wasnt a wild ride but a dreamy one there were no fierce bursts of heat but shimmering warmth that trembled straight to the center of her heart not a seduction or demand but a joining as he carried her from the studio and to the bed theyd chosen together sweetly patiently with the afternoon sun beaming through the open windows he touched her and shattered any hope of defense pleasure was quiet natural as breath gentle as the breeze that fluttered over her skin as he undressed her she reached for him wanting more of this slow and sumptuous sensation finding it as she drew him closer as she lifted her mouth and opened it to his his warriors body was familiar to her now the bold muscles the big hands the wide strong shoulders but there was a change in the way he moved to her moved over her that had her pulses beating thick and slow and it was more he wanted as well more of this silky surrender those lazy sighs those long long shudders as she gave it he took care sliding her slowly to the peak watching her face in the light as she trembled up then glided down again he slipped into her staggered by the depth of his own desire to give his need to see those seamist eyes cloud and darken to hear his name whispered he watched her watched her until his vision blurred then he covered her mouth with his once again as body and heart shattered it wasnt the answer she told herself and stopped before she could follow instinct and curl up against him if she allowed herself to feel this way shed be lost if she didnt pull back enough to think to plan to remember what she wanted she would make a mistake that couldnt be rectified she rose quickly and began to dress his eyes still hazed from what theyd brought each other dc watched her why are you doing that she trembled once fumbled with buttons we need to think this through im going home layna stay no this is just confusing the issue and its all moving too quickly he rose himself tugged on his jeans you matter to me her head jerked up at that her eyes swimming with emotions i know i think thats just it she said with rising panic i cant think im going to take a few days this could very well be just a matter of mixing emotions into what was supposed to be a simple affair of course it is he shoved his hands in his pockets otherwise he was going to grab her again and that wouldnt solve anything but his own frustrated need isnt that the problem i dont know what the problem is that she realized was what frightened her the most when she looked at him she forgot things like her plans her wellordered sensible plans but we both have some thinking to do before this situation becomes any more complicated well just stay away from each other for a few days and cool off he leaned back against the wall arched his brows and what if we dont well deal with that when whenever i want you layna i know and her pulse leaped hearing it knowing it if that was all we wouldnt have a problem that doesnt have to be a problem wanting more doesnt have to be a problem it is for me i have to go i have to think she was nearly to the door when he said her name just her name and stopped her in her tracks she didnt turn around didnt dare and with a quick shake of her head ran down the stairs and away he thought about going after her he could catch her before she got outside talk her back into his apartment drag her back if necessary then take her to bed again they didnt have any complications in bed and then what he swore pushed away from the wall and stalked back to his studio he avoided the window he didnt want to watch her walk away instead he studied the two canvases layna and need and wondered how they had come to be the same thing to him chapter contents prev next she didnt go home it was odd when she was so content there that it was the last place she wanted to be damn it shed been happy on her own thrilled with her life and her work her ambitions had been simple and straightforward she would make drakes washington a showplace cement its reputation for the finest and most glamorous store on the east coast by doing so she would cement her own reputation not simply another drake not just the daughter but layna drake in her own right a savvy businesswoman with a sharp eye for fashion she loved the travel milan paris london she adored attending the top shows and working out the fine details of buying just the right lines discovering new designers and she was good at it over the past few years shed honed her skills developed her own style and had learned the business well business made sense to her people simply didnt sighing she slowed her pace how would she know if she were in love shed never had to face anything like this before the men shed allowed into her life were suitable they were easy they were safe she admitted not one of them had ever tempted her to change her direction to make compromises to alter her plans and not one of them had ever touched her heart it was better that way she assured herself it had worked for her parents hadnt it oh god she didnt want the hollow marriage shed sprung from she didnt want marriage at all wasnt that the point of course it was she decided drawing a deep breath that was exactly the point all she needed to do was distance herself from him steady her emotions and then she could slide right back into her life again shed arrange for a few days off work take a short trip to anywhere anywhere she thought finally turning for home far enough away to prevent her from backtracking to his apartment why the devil had fate put her only a few short blocks away from him there you are laynas head snapped up and she forced a smile into place as she saw myra strolling up the sidewalk toward her automatically she closed the distance and kissed her godmothers cheek i was just out for my evening walk myra began and thought id take a chance and stop by she angled her head her sharp eyes scanning laynas face noting the pale cheeks and unhappy eyes oh darling whats the matter nothing i dont know nothing she said again more firmly come in well have some tea id love some myra slid her arm through laynas as they climbed the short stairs to the trim walkway and while were having it you can tell me whats made you unhappy or should i say who im not unhappy i just have a lot on my mind layna unlocked the door make yourself comfortable in the parlor while i start the tea no indeed ill make myself comfortable in the kitchen and watch you brew the tea cozier and it would give layna less time to fortify her defenses myra thought were you out for a walk yourself no well yes as it happens in the kitchen layna put the kettle on to boil then chose a pretty dresden teapot she heated the pot first as shed been taught carefully measured out earl grey its a beautiful evening it certainly is myra agreed before much longer well be sweltering in the usual washington summer but may is a gentle month romantic are you having a romance layna i dont know what im having layna kept herself busy setting out cups pouring cream into a small pitcher i didnt want a romance i dont want a romance why ever not im not equipped for them drakes dont deal in romance they deal in business what a ridiculous thing to say why suddenly angry layna whirled around you know my parents you know my grandparents can you sit there and tell me they had romantic loving marriages no myra sighed and leaned back against the cushions of the pretty breakfast nook no i cant your mother was a disappointment to me in that area layna she married your father because she found him compatible because she believed their lifestyles meshed and because she knew she would enjoy being mrs drake i wont criticize her myra continued she got what she wanted and made a life that satisfies her and she made you im not criticizing her layna said wearily i dont want what she has i like being single i like being in charge of my own life she turned back to deal with the tea marriage and children arent in my plans i like things as they are then why are you unhappy im just confused but im straightening everything out now are you in love i dont understand love aunt myra its not meant to be understood its meant to be felt and celebrated i dont want to feel it panic threatened forcing layna to level her voice her hands were steady enough as she carried the tea tray to the table it frightens you why shouldnt it dont you think my mother felt something like love when she had an affair with her tennis pro or my father felt something like it when he went off on pseudo business trips with his administrative assistant myra puffed out her cheeks so you knew of course i knew about those about the others children arent nearly as stupid as adults want them to be i wont put myself in the position of making a marriage then cheating or being cheated on not all marriages are like that darling herbert and i had over fifty years of happiness of love of faithfulness i still think of him every day miss him every day i know touched layna reached out and closed her hand over myras but youre the exception not the rule i see it all the time on my buying trips the little flings and quick deceptions the carelessness of it or ill watch a perfectly intelligent woman lose her direction her sense of worth because shes fallen in love it so rarely works fear of failure blocks any hope of success caution and practicality insure it oh irritated myra waved a hand youre too young to close yourself off this way im old enough to recognize my limitations layna chuckled soothed by her godmothers scowl and to be practical im going to take a few days off find a change of scene and when i come back i imagine both myself and the man involved will have realized weve taken this situation as far as it goes well see about that myra mused and smiled into her tea well thats handy for me as it happens i was coming by to see if you had any free time i wanted to take a short trip up north but im just not able to go on my own anymore which was of course a lie myra dittmeyer traveled as she pleased and traveled often actually i was thinking i always hate to impose but since you were planning on taking a trip anyway myra smiled and struggled to look frail i get so tired and confused in airports these days then id have to hire a car and a driver its so simple when youre young she sighed wearily of course ill go with you ill arrange for the time off tomorrow we can leave the next day if you want youre so sweet to me i dont know what id do without you oh and youll love spending a few days in hyannis port daniel and anna will love seeing you again the macgregors it took all laynas control not to choke on her tea oh aunt myra i wouldnt want to impose on them nonsense theyll adore having you for a few days ill take care of the tickets she started to scoot out reminding herself to move slowly i can still use a phone after all im so pleased you can help me with this darling at my age one never knows how much time one will have with their friends and loved ones she patted laynas hand ill just see myself out she continued to move slowly until she was out of the house out of sight then she quickened her pace her face was set in a determined smile her eyes were bright with challenge twentyfour hours to set things up she thought more than time enough once she called daniel and got him working on his end daniel peeked out the window of his tower office and scowled what the devil was taking them so long he only had a handful of days to settle this matter and he couldnt begin until the first of the players were on stage oh it was going to work out fine no doubt about it better yet now that his grandson duncan had flown up for an impromptu visit bless the boy he was just the hammer needed to nail dc into place the fates were smiling on this particular scheme and why shouldnt they hed like to know it was a fine scheme a loving one not that he intended to take a bit of credit for it and if things went well hed just keep his part in it nice and quiet his family tended to become irritated at the oddest things grandpa you up there daniel rubbed his hands together in anticipation and turned to smile as his daughters second son strolled in a fine looking boy daniel thought tall and dark like his father with his grandmothers deep brown eyes and his mothers sassiness and he thought with pride his grandfathers knack for gambling he had plans for young duncan oh indeed he did but one thing at a time duncan angled his head and flashed his quick and cocky smile as he sniffed the air what no cigar instantly daniel pokered up i dont know what youre talking about no wise to the ways of the macgregor duncan sat in the deep chair across from the desk stretched out his long legs and slipped a cigar out of his pocket watching daniel he ran it under his nose drawing in the scent now then daniels face glowed with a delighted smile theres a lad its mine duncan clamped the cigar between his teeth his shrewd dark eyes dancing but i might share if you tell me what the hell youre up to im not up to a thing just waiting to greet my oldest and dearest friend and her goddaughter the goddaughter duncan took the cigar out of his mouth and pointed with it who im sure is single of marriageable age strong stock grandpa good blood and if she is im not interested better and better daniel thought and smiled slyly shes a fine lass duncan pretty as a picture youd make fine babies between you which is something you should be seeing to boy of your age just put it out of that canny mind of yours macgregor duncan popped the cigar back in his mouth pleased to have seen through his grandfather so quickly and easily im happy just as i am and im having a fine time sampling pretty ladies i can find my own woman and youve been finding too many of them puttering around on that gambling boat up and down the river going nowhere have you seen the latest accounts the comanche princess is a very profitable lady and the only one who holds my heart aye ive seen them you know what youre about duncan blade but what you need is a wife beside you and babies at your feet now this lass whos coming to visit has a good head for business herself i expect to see he trailed off as a movement outside caught his eye ah he said as he turned back to the window here they are now you go down and make your howdoyoudos daniel wiggled his brows and see if i havent picked out a fine one for you ill go down duncan unfolded himself lazily but dont buy the orange blossoms he held out the cigar then grinning wiggled his fingers twisted his wrist and made it vanish before daniel could take it smart aleck daniel muttered then grinned fiercely as duncan walked out youre just what we need to get your cousin moving humming the wedding march he went down to greet his guests it couldnt have been more perfect daniel decided a few hours later duncan fell easily into pattern and flirted charmingly with layna made her laugh it was a fine thing too that they were easy together as theyd be cousins before much more time had passed he expected his family to be a loving and happy one duncan take the girl out in the gardens you like flowers dont you lass weve fine ones daniel continued beaming at layna they show off particularly well at sunset hes right about that duncan rose sparing one withering look for daniel before turning to smile at layna want to walk id love to thanks anna waited until theyd gone out the side door then leaned forward in her chair you can get that smug look off your face daniel those children arent the least bit interested in each other in the way youd like and they couldnt be less suited he barely resisted winking at myra when his old friend muffled a chuckle they look fine together of course they do exasperated anna threw up her hands theyre both attractive young people but your meddlings doomed to failure this time and if you try to push those two together daniel ill stop you she lifted a finger before he could bluster theyre not right for each other any fool can see that poor girl isnt happy well shed be happy enough if she wasnt so stubborn daniel sniffed needs to think with her heart for a change like someone else i knew more than sixty years ago and well see if she isnt smiling when she leaves here in a few days after those sixty plus years anna knew when to stop beating her head against the stone wall of daniels determination she turned to her friend myra surely you can see that this is a mistake for layna i just want her happy anna the child is just waiting to open her heart not to duncan anna said firmly you saw for yourself the way she and dc looked at each other if shes not in love with him shes well on the way and the two of you shoved them together hardly more than a month ago putting duncan who can charm the stars from the sky in her way just now is a disaster waiting to happen at myras burst of laughter annas eyes narrowed she took a deep breath and shifted her gaze from her husband to her friend oh what have the two of you done just set a stage so to speak daniel told her and dc will be walking onto it tomorrow dcs coming anna shut her mouth sat back considered then she nodded good good having braced for a lecture daniel goggled at her good you say yes i do for once i agree with you though i dont approve of your tactics daniel and well discuss that later a smile tugged at her lips its going to be a very interesting couple of days chapter contents prev next the last thing dc expected to see when he stepped out of his car in front of the fortress the macgregor had built on the cliffs over the restless sea was his cousin with his arm slung companionably around laynas shoulders the misery that had dogged him all along the trip north turned abruptly and viciously to bright green fury laynas hair was windblown her cheeks flushed he imagined theyd just come from a walk on the cliffs and the image infuriated him even as he watched them layna stopped stared and that pretty color that had glowed in her cheeks drained hey delighted duncan grinned and moved forward to give dc a hard hug and a slap on the back i didnt know you were heading up obviously what the hell is this his eyes sparking with blue fire stayed on layna i i came up with aunt myra for a few days i had no idea youd be here you left town without a word i said i was going to take a few days i didnt know where the hell you were it was a quick decision she straightened her shoulders my decision i take it you two know each other duncan put in shut up this is between me and layna theres nothing between us she shot back excuse me duncan she turned and rushed up the steps got a minute duncan asked neatly stepping into dcs path before his cousin could bolt after layna the picture had snapped clear in his mind grandpa you wily old bastard he thought with amused affection and decided the least he could do was play out his part get out of my way dcs hands fisted at his sides and keep your hands off her or ill break you in two duncan lifted a brow and his smile turned sharp oh we can go around dc weve been there before but why dont we make sure we know why were pounding on each other first shes mine he jabbed a finger into duncans chest thats all you have to know and that dc realized was all hed had to know himself she was his that was that really didnt look to me like she knew that i guess grandpa doesnt know it either since hes picked her out for me it would be worth a sore jaw duncan thought as he watched dcs teeth clench to see his cousin on the hot seat for a while the hell he did he thinks well suit duncan said easily he could even be right shes gorgeous smart easy to talk with then theres that sexy laugh he barely blinked when dc grabbed him by the shirtfront and hauled him to his toes it would be wise duncan supposed to remember his cousin outweighed him by a good thirty pounds have you touched her i dont generally paw women ive known less than a day but if you want to put up the boundaries cousin youd better do it fast you want to put the moves on her fine just he had the rest of the words shaken back down his throat and wondered if playing his grandfathers game was going to land him in the hospital im not putting moves on her you stupid son of a bitch im in love with her why the hell didnt you say so duncan shouted back at him and noting that his cousin looked as though hed just suffered a blow to the head he shoved his way free i just figured it out youd be smarter to tell her than to stand here fighting with me over it duncan brushed a hand down his shirt to smooth it im a damn innocent bystander fighting with you is easier jamming his hands in his pockets dc stalked into the house he found them in what the family called the throne room in honor of the huge chair where daniel sat to preside over gatherings it appeared this gathering was a very civilized afternoon tea the moment he strode in fury still vibrating around him his grandmother rose and hurried toward him dc what a lovely surprise its so good to see you i told grandpa i was coming up to paint for a few days that you did daniel beamed fiercely from his chair forgot to tell you anna all this excitement well come in come in maybe now that youre here these women will let me have some whiskey in my tea wheres your cousin outside layna id like to talk to you she had her composure back barely certainly she said and continued to sip her tea privately he said between his teeth its not convenient now mrs macgregor these scones are marvelous thank you theyre one of our cooks specialties anna rolled her eyes at daniel before she took her seat again dc theyre your favorite shall i fix you a plate no i dont want anything thats wrong i do i want something very much layna will you come outside with me or am i going to have to carry you out she sent him a level look over the rim of her cup the bite dc loved was back in her seasiren eyes i suggest you sit down and have some tea when were finished if you have something to say to me ill be happy to listen you want me to sit down and have tea you want me to sit down and have a nice cup after i come across you hanging all over my cousin she set her cup down with a snap i was not hanging all over anyone im forced to agree duncan said in cheerful tones as he strolled in but i had hopes scones delighted he pounced on the tea tray and helped himself i told you to keep out of it or ill break that pretty face of yours shocked layna gaped then surged to her feet as anna calmly poured more tea how dare you cause a hideous scene threaten duncan embarrass me and upset your family this way let him have it lass daniel shouted thumping a fist on the arm of his chair i wouldnt have caused a scene threatened embarrassed or upset anyone if youd come outside when i asked you to its your hard head thats put us here in the first place now well add insults eyes slitted dangerously layna stepped forward i wouldnt be here if id known you were coming and since this is your family home ill be the one to leave youre not going anywhere until we finish this there we agree excuse us she said grandly then stalked out of the room outside dc muttered grabbing her arm to steer her to the door take your hands off me i can get there on my own she jerked free then yanked the door open herself i thought youd already humiliated me as much as anyone could be humiliated now i see i was wrong youve topped it she kept going stalking over the long slope of yard unaware that inside the house four people had made a beeline for the windows youre humiliated you how do you think i felt when i come to visit my grandparents and find you snuggled up with my cousin she whirled on him in the first place i was not snuggled up with anyone i was having a perfectly innocent walk with a very nice man and its none of your business what i do and with whom i do it think again baby he said much too quietly i have thought which is exactly what i told you i intended to do and ive decided that whatever wed started between us is going to stop in a pigs eye he snatched her up fisted a hand in her hair to yank her head back and took out his frustration on her mouth we shouldnt be watching this anna murmured even as she shifted at the window for a better view ah but look at them anna with a tear in the corner of his eye daniel draped an arm over her shoulder it couldnt be more right hes hooked duncan muttered and bit into another scone pitiful your times coming laddie daniel warned not if i can help it confident in his evasive skills duncan polished off the scone and watched his cousin take the fall the kiss changed heat sliding into warmth a warmth that undid her dont even as she murmured it layna skimmed her hands over his face dont do this its not the answer it is when my hearts in it layna he rubbed his cheek against hers cant you see youre holding my heart because suddenly she could see it right there in his eyes her own heart stuttered i cant do this i dont know how it changes everything let me go dc i thought i could i wanted to be able to he did release her so that they could stand facing each other the wind whipped through his hair sent it dancing do you think youre the only one who had plans who thought they knew exactly where they wanted to go and how to get there i didnt want this i didnt want you now theres nothing else but you it cant work it was fine as long as we just wanted each other as long as it was that simple theres nothing simple about the way i want you and if you felt that way why are you crying he reached out his big hand painfully gentle to brush a tear from her cheek im holding your heart too i wont hurt it you can say that you can believe that because of what you come from your family is so lovely so loving mines empty its a name its a way of living youre not your parents no but and neither of us are exactly the same people we were when we met are we she crossed her arms over her chest gripped her forearms no no were not weve already started to make compromises to build something together weve already let each other in layna we didnt notice it right off because it was right it was just right i love you he cupped her face gently you can look at me and see that yes it thrilled and it terrified i want you too so much but what if it doesnt work if i cant make it work what if you walk away now and we never try id be back where i thought i wanted to be she drew a deep breath let it out slowly and id be incredibly unhappy i dont want to walk away from you or from us joy shimmered just under his heart and his lips curved then take that walk with me he closed his hand over hers linked fingers we wont always want to go in the same direction or at the same pace but we can end up where we both need to be she looked down at their hands so different she thought hers narrow his wide hers almost delicate his so strong but look how they fit together ive never been in love she lifted her gaze looked into his eyes i could always stop it it never interfered because i wouldnt let it but i couldnt stop it with you it made me so angry so unsettled that i wasnt able to just step back and say thats far enough but its not far enough her fingers tightened on his i want to go a lot farther he lifted their joined hands to his lips no one mattered before you marry me lets make a life together i think weve already started to she brought her free hand to his cheek it just took a while for me to realize its exactly the one i want id say thats a yes her smile bloomed id say youre right she laughed when he scooped her off her feet and spun her in circles lets tell the family dc kissed her hard and long then spun her around again itll do the macgregor good to see he cant maneuver all his grandchildren into taking the matches he picks out for them not my type dc said hah and kissed her again inside daniel wiped a tear from his eye from the private memoirs of daniel duncan macgregor seasons come and go more quickly after a man reaches an age spring moving to summer so fast you hardly see the tulips bloom before they fade away again without family without the love of them the passing of time would be a kind of loneliness im a man whos never lonely im grateful for that fact every day of my life for the fine woman whos spent all these passing seasons with me for the children we raised the babies those children gave us and i realized better than most i think that when a mans been given such gifts hes responsible for caring for them just yesterday i stood in the church where my oldest son married and watched his son meet his bride seasons pass and generations with them almost as quickly i know what my boy felt watching his boy take that next step in life the pride the bittersweet loss the hopes for the future well i could have told my alan hes no need to worry about the future of dc and layna id chosen them for each other hadnt i not that well mention that outside the hearing of a few select ears my grandson can have his smug belief that he did the deed all on his own hell be a better man for it i imagine a fine couple they made the prettiest of pictures as they exchanged their rings in candlelight d c looking more than a bit im thinking like his grandfather did sixty years back and layna elegant with the macgregor tartan on her dress and the macgregor veil over her golden hair the babies theyll make for me well for their grandmother of course shes already making noises about it the woman has no patience now that weve seen them off on their honeymoon and seen the bond between them well leave them to start to build their life together today i walked on the cliffs with my anna below us the sea tossed as restless as ever and above the sky was a clear summer blue i felt the wind on my face and annas hand in mine manys the time weve walked that walk together from the cliffs i could see the house wed built some call it a fortress or a castle and its some of both those things a bold place it is made of good native stone with proud towers and strong lines and the crest of my clan over the front door a man doesnt forget his roots but most of what it is is home the place anna and i fought our battles made love and our children where we raised them and watched them grow its a home we share still though the children have children and some of them have children of their own thanks to me of course im happy to have set those who belong to me on the right path home and family whatever a man or a woman makes in this life that is the base the foundation of everything else so where are the rest of my greatgrandchildren id like to know not that we havent made some progress there but a man cant live forever not even a macgregor ive seen five of the children of my children wedded now and the babies i that is anna frets for are coming along we have four bairns to fuss over and two more on the way and a joy they are to us if only theyd visit more often but children must have their own lives after all thats what im seeing to in my own fashion im arranging for young duncan the second son of my lovely serena and our handsome justin to make his life oh the lad thinks he has one and just the way he wants it too sailing up and down the mississippi on his gambling boat free as a bird oh a clever boy is duncan blade and a charmer as well he runs the comanche princess with a steady hand for theres good business sense behind that quick sly smile and woe to the man who sees only a pretty face and crosses him by god the boy carries macgregor blood after all no prim shy miss would do for him he needs a woman with grit someone with sass and ive just the one all ive done to respond to those who would call me a meddler is put them together for a time just as i did the boys mother and father so many years back makes me sentimental to think of it and its like a circle closing isnt it to give my daughters son the same opportunity well see what he does with it and if he doesnt do it fast enough why i believe anna and i might enjoy a few days on the river im a gambling man myself part two duncan chapter contents prev next duncan blade played the odds whether they were long or short didnt matter as long as he knew them and the pot was rich enough and he was a man who liked to win gambling was in his blood both from the macgregor scot and the comanche blade nothing suited him better than running the comanche princess that in itself had been a gamble his parents had dealt in hotels of the stationary sort all of his life atlantic city vegas reno and more the riverboat had been duncans dream one hed conceived planned and nurtured he understood his family trusted him to make it work he had no intention of disappointing them from the docks in saint louis he stood hands tucked in his back pockets and studied his true love the princess was a beauty he mused with long graceful lines wide decks and fussily fashioned railings she had been built to replicate the traditional riverboats that had once steamed up and down the river carrying passengers supplies and gamblers her paint was fresh and blindingly white her trim a hot and sassy red beneath the charm was power and along with the power was luxury duncan wanted his passengers relaxed and happy the food would be plentiful and first class the entertainment top of the line cabins ran from cozy to sumptuous each of the three lounges provided stunning views of the river and the casino well the casino was after all the heart of it all passengers paid for the ride and for the chance to win the princess would sail from saint louis to new orleans with stops along the way in memphis and natchez those who chose to stay on board for the full two weeks from north to south and back again wouldnt be bored and whether or not they disembarked as winners duncan knew theyd have gotten their moneys worth for now he had the anticipation of another run around him crew worked to load cargo and supplies in the blistering july heat he had paperwork to do details to check but he wanted to take this moment to watch the action on board more crew members were swabbing decks freshening paint polishing brass and cleaning glass the princess would sparkle by late afternoon delighting the passengers who streamed up the gangplank everything was in place almost behind the amber lenses of his shaded glasses his deep brown eyes narrowed the new headliner hed contracted had yet to show she was now nearly twentyfour hours late and if she didnt make it within another four hours theyd be preparing to sail without her annoyed with having his enjoyment of the moment spoiled duncan pulled the flip phone out of his pocket and once again called cat farrells agent he paced the docks as he waited for the connection his strides long and loose his looks bespoke his heritage tall and dark with dark gold skin eyes of deep brown heavily lashed and lidded and the straight black hair of his comanche ancestors his face was narrow sculpted with high sharp cheekbones and a long straight nose the mouth was firm and full and given to quick smiles but he wasnt smiling now cicero blade where the hell is my talent brooklyn jangled through the receiver as cicero whined an answer she aint there yet hey im telling you the kids reliable something slowed her up thats all shell be there and shell knock you out i guarantee pal you guaranteed me shed be here yesterday at noon shes got her first performance tonight dont you keep in touch with your clients sure sure but cat well she goes her own way worth every penny youre paying her though more you got her while shes climbing give her another year and i dont give a damn about next year cicero i deal in the now and right now i dont see your client shell get there shell get there look your brother liked her fine she blew them away in vegas my brothers a lot more tolerant than i am you get her here in one hour or i start by suing your butt off for breach of contract and then ill get nasty duncan disconnected on the resulting sputters slipped the phone back into his pocket and started across the docks toward the boat his brother mac had indeed approved of cat farrell duncan thought and he trusted macs judgment without question otherwise he wouldnt have been so quick to take his grandfathers additional glowing recommendation of her and hire her without an audition she looked good damned good he thought bringing the image of her photo to his mind sleek and sexy and the demo tape cicero had sent him proved she had a voice to match but that wasnt doing him any good if the bloody woman didnt show the teenager striding toward the gangplank caught his attention battered jeans lopsided backpack scarred tennis shoes a zebraprint baseball cap was pulled low over her forehead and roundlensed dark glasses were perched on her nose he let out a sigh it was a pity he thought that kids didnt have more of a sense of fashion he lengthened his stride to cut her off before she could board sorry honey you cant go on there no passengers until after three and youll need your parents with you to get on she shifted stood hip cocked and tipped down the little sunglasses with one finger he felt a quick jolt seeing the eyes behind them they were a pure and piercing green with a thin shimmer of gold circling the pupils put a few years on her duncan thought fleetingly and the eyes alone would drop men to their knees to his amusement those eyes skimmed up down then up again before latching on to his with a bold arrogance he couldnt help but admire and who would you be it should be illegal for a female to have a voice like that before she turned twentyone duncan decided all that husky promise belonged in a ripe and experienced woman im blade shes mine he said with a jerk of his head toward the boat and youre welcome to come back when youre legal darling her lips curved with the same easy arrogance she carried in her eyes want to card me blade ive got my id in here somewhere she reached around to pat her backpack but since were running a little behind why dont we skip it im your headliner sugar she stuck out her hand as his eyes narrowed cat farrell and i was twentyfive last month he could see it now he supposed if he used his imagination the eyes should have tipped him off but there hadnt been a dusting of freckles across her nose in the photo and there had been a wild waterfall of deep red hair he couldnt see a trace of it now and wondered how shed managed to stuff it all up under the ugly cap she wore youre late got hung up she flashed a smile i shouldnt have let cicero talk me into that gig in bakersfield missed my flight had to reroute pain in the butt listen ive got a cab back there full of my stuff you want to take care of that for me ill go take a look at the setup hold it he took a firm grip on her arm before she could turn away stay he had the satisfaction of seeing annoyance flicker in those remarkable eyes before he strode over to one of the crew and gave instructions for cats luggage to be transferred on board well take a look at the setup he told her then took her arm again and walked her up the gangway and afterwards well have a short lesson on how to operate this new and amazing device called the telephone nobody told me how witty you were she said dryly but because she wanted the job badly she bit back another sarcastic remark look im sorry sometimes you run into obstacles when you travel and i ran into a few i got here as soon as i could and damn cicero she thought for not giving her more of a window of time to get from california to missouri missing her flight had meant shed had to settle for puddle jumpers and delays all the way across the country she hadnt slept except in snatches in the last twentyfour hours hadnt eaten except what she could grab and swallow in a few minutes and now she had this cover of gentlemans quarterly razzing her for being a little late but he was a blade and he was a macgregor between the two names was enough power to give her career the exposure and the boost shed worked for for her entire life it would be a good gig the decks were spotless she noted the rails romantically reminiscent of balconies in the french quarter shed seen in pictures and movies glass gleamed obviously duncan blade ran a tight and tidy ship he pushed open one of a set of double doors painted a glossy red and gestured cat stepped in ahead of him fisted her hands on her hips and scanned the room like the exterior of the boat it radiated charm and tradition round tables were set close enough for coziness but with enough room to keep elbows from bumping the lights in the audience area were dripping chandeliers and the carpet was that same vivid red the bar in the far rear corner was fluidly curved stylish cat thought with the added benefit of opening a traffic pattern stools gleamed with brass fittings and the mirror behind the bar glittered she walked toward the stage approving of the polished parquet flooring noting with a quick shiver of delight her picture on the bill poster set on an easel to the side in front of a gorgeous steinway hitting center stage she turned shut her eyes drew breath and belted out the first two bars of stormy weather still in the rear duncan had to fight to keep his mouth from dropping open she had a voice that went straight to the gut and managed to fill the room without benefit of a mike youve got good acoustics in here she told him he had to take a breath himself youve got good pipes in there she grinned she knew exactly what she had her voice was all shed ever had and she intended to ride it to the top thanks sugar my little claim to fame ill need to run a sound check a short rehearsal you point me to my dressing room my cabin and a sandwich and ill get to work youve got a performance in he glanced at his watch eight hours i never miss a cue she slipped off her glasses hooked the earpiece in the neck of her tshirt ill do my job blade he intended to make sure of it dressing rooms backstage between the main lounge and the casino smart she said as he came toward her get people buying drinks in here then wandering out and dumping bucks at the tables suckers he arched a brow i take it you dont drink or gamble not as a rule drinking dulls the brain and gambling when the house holds the edge means losing i dont like to lose neither do i he showed her through another swinging door turned to the left down a short corridor this is yours hers she thought it had only been a little more than a year since shed had her first personal dressing room it still gave her a secret thrill no more days of sharing space with strippers or chorus dancers no more fighting for a place at the mirror or pawing through a jungle of costumes for her own hers she thought again and studied the small organized space lighted mirror long counter padded stool clothes rack and god bless america a neat sofa a little cramped she said with a shrug because she wanted to dance but ill manage i could use some help getting my wardrobe in here youll get it but lets give you the lay of the land first she went reluctantly shed have enjoyed sitting on that sofa locking the door and just grinning for a while instead she followed him out through the casino with its tables of green baize its colorful wheels and glittering slots this cat imagined was his stage however casually he was dressed and she imagined he thought of the tailored slacks and white silk shirt as casual he was the perfect image of the traditional riverboat gambler and she didnt imagine he often walked away lighter in the pocket two performances a night duncan told her as they wound their way through and back out on deck into the brilliant sun your days are pretty much your own though we encourage staff to socialize and mingle with the passengers youll take your meals belowdecks with the crew breakfast from six to eight lunch eleven to one dinner five to seven i promise you wont go hungry thats good to know ive got a big appetite he glanced down at her she was wand slim though the photos had shown off some very attractive curves duncan knew and appreciated the engineering of female undergarments and what they could do to augment a figure you can use the health club also belowdecks you pay for your drinks and since you dont drink as a rule i shouldnt have to tell you that you get drunk on board you get one warning next time youre off he took stairs leading down and turned into another corridor passenger cabins we can hold a hundred twenty full bookings and another hundred fifty day stops when were in port he stopped by a door opened it first class cabin he explained and let her wander in well well it was more spacious than shed imagined with a generous bed plush seating area the furnishings looked antique genuine stuff she imagined the flowers were fresh and a neat balcony curved out behind a pair of french doors and offered a view of the river must cost a bundle you get what you pay for people come here to relax to be entertained and we give them their moneys worth i bet you do one day she thought one fine day shed stay in a room like this and when she did shed stretch out on the bed naked as a baby and laugh until her ribs cracked and shed forget all the twobit motels the cramped rooms and fleabag hotels that had come before well sugar since i dont think employees get such jazzy digs wheres mine down one level he stepped back but as she passed through the door their shoulders bumped he even smelled rich she thought with mild irritation she imagined she smelled just the way she felt like tired rags if she didnt get that sandwich soon she was going to pitch forward on her face and humiliate herself been hungry before she thought as she once again followed duncan down a flight of steps just think about something else anything else like what a very fine butt blade has definitely first class all the way her quick snort of laughter had him glancing back what nothing since i keep ending up behind you im just enjoying the view his left eyebrow winged up a skill shed always admired then like lightning his grin flashed whoa cat thought secret weapon very effective next time well switch places he said easily then opened a door this is yours it was less than half the size of the cabin hed just shown her and the tiny window afforded light but little else still it delighted her to see the space the single narrow bed the spotless floor her trunk sat there filling most of the room well have that stowed for you when you unpack it wont seem as crowded its fine more than fine she thought it smelled clean there would be no drunks hollering at each other in the next room no need to shove a chair under the doorknob so she could sleep with both eyes shut she glanced into the tiny bathroom and found no problem with the dollsize sink or the skinny shower stall everything there no matter how small gleamed from fresh scrubbing for the next six weeks she thought it was all hers ill manage okay now about that sandwich ill have something sent down he was already an hour behind schedule take an hour get yourself settled ill arrange for your sound check well keep the main lounge closed until four thats all the time i can give you to rehearse so be on time ill be there sugar she walked to the opened door leaned on it in a silent invitation for him to leave and ill need some bottled water no bubbles no flavors just straight mineral water he cocked that brow again anything else well her lips curved slowly as she skimmed a finger down the front of his shirt time will tell thanks for the tour if she wanted to play he mused he was good at games he flicked a finger under her chin leaned down just close enough to see her eyes sharpen sweetheart you aint seen nothing yet he strolled away grinning chapter contents prev next he loved the night best and the approach of it july meant long steamy days with sun blasting off the wide dark waters of the mississippi and it meant hot nights with teasing breezes it meant action the passengers had boarded and the castoff party had set the tone for a fantasy period of enjoyment of pleasure of reliving those adventurous times when sternwheel boats ruled the river hed done his meetandgreet gauging faces from the blissful honeymooners to the sharpeyed hopefuls who dreamed of beating the odds as twilight approached duncan felt that canny little thrill of beginnings a large chunk of his life had been spent in hotels stationary buildings in cities and resorts hed been content and hed learned the family business discovered a knack for it but hed also discovered that he preferred freedom of movement change and the unexpected his mother often laughed and said hed been born a century too late hed been born to ride the river he rode it now as the comanche princess glided south cruising lazily through the water and leaving the restrictions of land behind he could have piloted the grand boat himself another thing hed learned he wasnt a man to put control in other hands without knowing how to take it back if it became necessary but hed handpicked his captain himself and his crew now he could enjoy the moment satisfied that what was his ran well he passed through the casino with a winking nod to his casino manager gloria beene had a sharp eye a nimble brain and a dreamy southern accent that disguised her ruthless efficiency and she filled out her trim tuxedo just fine duncan had stolen her from savannah hiked her salary and had considered pursuing a more personal relationship until both of them discovered theyd begun to think of each other more as family than lovers nice crowd tonight gloria commented heavy on the slots the cruise packages like to play their complimentary tokens in the machines to start weve got two honeymoon couples youll spot them if they breeze in see they get a free bottle of house champagne will do im going to check out the new talent next door but ill be round and about for the next few hours he wandered through appreciating the music of the slots the ruffle of cards the clink of dice circling he finished his early evening sweep then stepped through to head for the main lounge he stopped checked his watch then frowned at cats dressing room door he hadnt heard a peep out of her since hed left her hours before and her track record didnt inspire him to trust shed be ready on time he gave a quick one knuckle rap on the door five minutes miss farrell got it shoot give me a hand will you duncan pushed open the door and discovered exactly how it must feel to take two barrels of a shotgun straight to the gut she stood in the center of the room in what he supposed some generous soul might call a dress what there was of it was the same vibrant green as her eyes it left her shoulders bare in a kind of frame for a waterfall of smoky red hair baggy ragged jeans hadnt warned him that she had silky legs that must end somewhere in the vicinity of her ears but the short tight skirt and milehigh heels showed them off to marvelous advantage well he murmured dont you clean up nice cat stopped tugging on the zipper and turned to give him a delicious view of bare back you bought the package sugar now help me tie the bow this damn things stuck lets see what we can do about that he stepped toward her noting that with those glamorous eyes expertly highlighted that mouth slickly painted she no longer looked like a teenager and she smelled exotic stunningly sexual what was a man to do duncan asked himself but enjoy the moment sometimes you have to go down his knuckles skimmed over her skin as he slid the zipper low before you go up she didnt shiver and was more surprised than annoyed that for one slippery moment she wanted to reminding herself she knew just how to handle his type she turned her head and shot him a sultry smile oh ive been down and i like up a lot better maybe youve never been down in just the right place unable to resist he trailed a fingertip along her spine nice back farrell thanks oh yeah she wanted to shiver damn it nice face blade now you want to get me into this dress before i miss my cue my boss gets bitchy if im late ill have to put in a good word for you it amazed him just how much he wanted to peel the dress away to discover what other miracles had been hidden under the dumpy streeturchin clothes shed traveled in he was close enough focused enough to see the awareness of that in her eyes and unless his ego was skewing his vision a glint of curiosity she kept her gaze level though the skim of those fingertips on her back made her want to turn and find out just how clever they could be it would be a mistake she said evenly yeah with some regret he slid the zipper smoothly into place it would he stepped back took a good long survey looks like it might be worth it from where im standing but he turned and opened the door break a leg i always try to break both she started by him then followed impulse and stopped with their bodies close and framed in the doorway very slowly she trailed a finger over his mouth then smiled too damn bad she walked away counting her heartbeats stopping behind the turn of the stage waiting instead of blocking out those low liquid pulls the encounter with duncan had caused she used them focused on them when the stage went black she moved onto it hit her center mark counting still counting and closing her eyes began to sing a cappella in the dark she started soft and dreamy just her alone her voice stroking the words her heart breaking on them then the music slipped in to join her the key light winked on spotlighting her face holding holding then spreading to cover her as her voice built seduction duncan thought as he watched her her voice might have been wistful achingly sad as she sang of wanting someone to watch over her but it was all seduction and the audience was caught in it he imagined the women would weep and the men would want god she could make a man want he rubbed the side of his finger over his mouth where she had stroked that little flick had gone straight to his loins dangerous woman he decided edgy woman it was his bad luck he had a weakness for edgy dangerous women he listened until the last notes died away until the audience exploded with applause then he turned and walked back into the casino where he knew the odds were in his favor cat didnt surface until noon after the second show shed stripped out of costume and creamed off her makeup as the adrenaline rush performing gave her drained shed stumbled to her cabin and had fallen facedown on her bed and had slept like a stone she woke to the shimmer of sunlight through her window the gentle rhythm of the boat and the desperate demands of an empty stomach by twelvethirty she was showered alert and down in the kitchens shed already made friends with one of the cooks in every hotel nightclub or dive shed worked cat had made it a policy to get chummy with the person in charge of food you ate better that way charlie from new orleans was a ridiculously skinny cajun with a huge mustache snapping black eyes and three exwives cat heard all about them as she shoveled in the inspired shrimp etouffee hed heaped on a plate for her she chased it down with mineral water caffeine made her jumpy she chatted and ate in the bustling confusion of the kitchen barely noticing the wait people rushing in and out lunch she imagined was being served on the promenade deck in the dining room and in the staff lounge she preferred the kitchen and helped herself to a warm roll so charlie tell me about the boss duncan charlie eyed one of his line cooks to be certain the mushrooms were being sliced appropriately good man smart he says to me charlie i want food dreams are made on amused by the memory charlie gave a cackling laugh he wants food like poetry so thats what i give he pays for it cause he wants the best he dont settle for less than that chere not duncan blade i bet cat munched on the roll got an eye for the ladies charlie wiggled his eyebrows smooth moves slick they dont catch him no not like me me i look at the lady too long i get a ring in my nose she laughed but not duncan nosiree he gives them a tickle then slips away while theyre still sighing not everyones ticklish oh everybody they got a spot little girl always a weak spot me i got too many but she didnt cat assured herself as she left the kitchen to stroll out on deck when a woman had reason enough she could cover over those weak spots until they hardened like rock then she could be the one to slip away when you had only yourself to depend on you had to be quick on your feet leaning on the rail she watched the flow of the river it was good to be out of the crowds she thought away from the city and the noise to breathe thick fragrant air to feel the drowsy heat of deep summer she could use a few more gigs like this with the benefits of a smooth ride and lazy afternoons and charlie was right duncan blade wasnt stingy the salary shed earn over the next six weeks would nicely augment her savings a little more of a cushion a little more distance from those days of scrambling for a few dollars more to make the rent on some dingy little room shed never be poor again she promised herself or desperate again or afraid again catherine mary farrell was on her way up from the deck above duncan watched her she had her arms folded on the rail her hip cocked her feet crossed at the ankles she looked as lazy and contented as a cat in a sunbeam so why was it that just looking at her made him tense she didnt resemble the sultry seductress of the night before not with that ridiculous cap on her head her long flow of hair tugged ponytail style through the back loop her tshirt bagged over her hips what there was of them and her feet were bare of course those ragged hemmed shorts showed off a great deal of leg but it wasnt how she looked he decided it was the attitude she stood there radiating absolute confidence a woman who didnt give a single damn who looked at her or how and he supposed that kind of attitude equaled style hey cat farrell she turned and despite the bill of the cap and the sunglasses lifted a hand to block the laser beam of the sun she saw him above his dark mane of hair ruffling in the breeze the khaki slacks and light blue shirt showed off a slim and agile build doesnt the man ever look less than perfect she wondered hey duncan blade come on up why i want to talk to you she smiled cocked her elbows on the rail and leaned back come on down it was he supposed one of those times when surrendering a little battle could lead to losing the entire war up he said simply my office he had time to see her shrug before he stepped away from the rail he waited knowing shed take her time he knew he would have behind him passengers lounged on the deck or escaped to the cool lounge for the afternoon talk on the history of the river others many others he knew were huddled in the casino listening to the music of the slots when she swaggered up the steps he simply gestured her up the next flight there a problem boss nope how was your morning i dont know i slept through it when she reached the top she looked around good thing i like heights come on in he opened a door waited for her to pass through first obviously he didnt like to be closed in cat thought the office wasnt particularly large but it was ringed by windows that brought the sky inside she walked across the room passed the lovely old mahogany desk through the small sitting area with its curvebacked chairs and glossy tables and took in the view its a killer she murmured keeps me from getting cranky over paperwork want something cold water with a shake of his head he opened a minifridge selected a bottle is that all you drink mostly she turned back when she heard water hitting glass so whats the deal i looked over your press kit and materials again this morning he walked to her offered the glass so so theyre very professional well written and they dont say a lot he sat down kicked out his legs slipped a slim cigar from his pocket tell me more why why not she sat kicked out her legs in turn you hired me i delivered what else he flicked on his lighter watched her through the haze of smoke doesnt say where youre from chicago south side the projects he lifted a brow rough neighborhood how would you know she said with a slow sharp smile macgregors dont cruise in their limos through rough neighborhoods ah sore spot he mused and casually blew out smoke the macgregor worked in coal mines and spent a good part of his youth in neighborhoods as rough as the south side my fathers blade part comanche and he fought his way out of places that make your projects look like paradise i come from people who dont forget their roots thats you duncan ive ripped mine clean out she watched him from behind the shield of her dark glasses as she sipped water what are you looking for here more he said simply wheres your family my fathers dead drunk driver killed him i was eight he was twentynine my mothers in chicago she waits tables and what does that have to do with my job rather than answer he leaned forward quick as a snake and pulled off her glasses hey i like to see who im talking to he set them aside leaned back again pleased to have put that gleam of temper in her eyes ive got a contract with you for six weeks with an option for six more before i decide whether or not to exercise that option i want to know who im dealing with another six weeks she thought steady work steady income with room and board for three full months she could nearly double her savings certainly double the check she sent to her mother every month and it could very well lead to another contract with another macgregorblade arena not a flicker of the thrill it brought to her of the hope it had burning like a torch in her heart showed on her face as she slowly smiled well in that case sugar my lifes an open book what do you want to know chapter contents prev next hed pushed the right button he decided money was for some the sweetest of talk with another woman hed have waltzed around the objective led her gradually to the point he wanted and done it all with charm finesse and a good deal of canniness he didnt think any of those would work with cat is there a man her brows lifted in mild amusement well you get right to it dont you just a matter of adjusting my stride to the person im walking with darling is there theres no man unless i want there to be she sipped again taking her time and making him certain she spoke no less than the truth no man at the moment he continued you dont drink as a rule dont gamble no vices cat now her eyes danced over the rim of her glass is that what i said you drink gamble and i imagine theres a woman when you want there to be does that mean youre riddled with vices duncan good point absently he picked up a coin from the table and began to fiddle with it you impressed me last night in the dressing room his grin flashed in sheer appreciation oh yeah and on stage youve got a hell of a talent i know he inclined his head the fact that you do know and use it is in your favor where do you want to take it as far as i can go and then some why arent you recording she caught a drop of water from her top lip with her tongue record producers have been beating down my door she said dryly i just ignore them you need a new agent she snorted out a laugh tell me something i dont know i can help you slowly she lowered her glass set it aside those marvelous green eyes had gone cold and brittle and just what do you want for your percentage the fingers that had been casually manipulating the coin went still i dont barter for sex i dont pay for it and i dont play for it she said nothing for a moment a little surprised at how that smooth voice could so suddenly cut like a razor then she let out a sigh because when she was wrong she believed in admitting it even when it stung sorry my mistake lets just say i havent had a lot of people offering to help me without some very sticky strings attached sex is for pleasure business is for a different kind of pleasure i dont tie one to the other clear crystal satisfied he began to flip the coin through his fingers again i have some contacts in entertainment put together a tape in the next few weeks ill pass it on just like that why because i like your voice i like the package she hesitated looking for the strings the dropoffs the hidden traps but couldnt find any i appreciate it a lot to seal the bargain she held out a hand then grinned in pure delight as the coin in his vanished cool got any more tricks too many to count amused by her reaction he brought the coin back flipping it between the tips of two fingers clamping the cigar between his teeth he held up two fists then flashed his hands open and the coin was gone her laugh was quick rusty and low as she leaned forward do it again ill figure it out wanna bet her gaze shifted to his briefly ive got a very sharp eye gorgeous eyes they had my mouth watering when i still thought you were a teenage delinquent then theres this hair his voice had softened as he reached out to run a hand down the stream of her ponytail with his eyes on hers he slipped the cap off dropped it into her lap fabulous wheres the coin darling what progress he thought and smiled he leaned back lifted both hands again palms out nothing up my sleeve when she realized her mind had simply clicked off for a very dangerous moment she let out a long breath youre good damn right he picked up her cap hold out your hand he told her then turning the cap over spilled out the coin the instant before it dropped into her palm he snatched it out of the air and it was gone she couldnt help it she laughed again really good well this has been fun but i want to run through a couple of new numbers im hoping to work in she rose but found her wrists caught in those quick and clever hands something bumped inside her hard but she tipped her head back met his gaze straight on feel that he murmured what the connection maybe let go he held on just long enough to worry and irritate then his fingers loosened his hands dropped away no strings cat no strings she agreed and i like my hands free so saying she reached up cupped the back of his neck and pulled his mouth down to hers she expected the jolt she liked a good hard jolt or what was the point of a kiss shed already concluded there would be heat and she enjoyed a solid blast of heat but it was more than a jolt when it knocked you flat it was more than heat when it singed and sizzled through the blood she wanted to crawl right into it until her bones dissolved until this fist of unexpected need loosened inside her but her survival instinct was strong and keen and had her pulling back well she managed more than a little shaken when she couldnt quite clear her head well duncan echoed than clamped his hands on her hips before she could escape my turn he lowered his head kept his mouth an inch from hers just long enough to hear her quick intake of breath to see the gold ring around her pupils shimmer then he rubbed his lips over hers slow and easy shed taken him by surprise before and he was afraid it could become a habit if he didnt stay on his toes didnt stay in control shed be leading him around by the nose before the first week was up he didnt intend to let that happen he knew how to pleasure a woman how to give and how to take his hands slid up skimming her torso the sides of her breasts then curved around her back to bring her closer slowly inch by inch until their bodies bumped brushed held oh hell her oath was next door to a moan accepting the inevitable she wound her arms around his neck still his mouth did no more than play with hers tormenting with nibbles inciting with lazy strokes of the tongue torturing with gentle nips along her jaw and finally finally she trembled against him his mouth took hers then hot and hard strangling the air in her lungs misting the reason still struggling to surface in her brain with a low purr of pleasure she opened for him she flooded his senses tastes scents textures when his hands fisted in her hair her head arched back welcoming him to take them both deeper but there was no surrender they met flash for flash now mouths bodies needs fused into one she strained against him moved against him sliding pressing arousal to arousal he felt himself begin to slip heard the animal inside him snarl and fight against its chain he clawed his way back forcing himself to gentle the kiss to stroke his hands quietly over her before framing her face with them he waited for one more delicious tremor then eased back his pulse was wild a dozen hammers slammed against anvils inside him need tore like claws through his gut but his hands remained gentle on her face as those gorgeous eyes of hers opened heavily she ran her tongue around her lips as if to absorb just a bit more of his flavor and her breath came quickly i guess we could call that a connection she said it made him smile works for me come to my cabin after the show tonight well connect she let out a sigh because there wasnt anything she wanted more or could risk less sugar you are suicide and ive got too much at stake to jump off a cliff right now his fingers tightened just enough to hold her in place this doesnt have anything to do with business cat i got that part she lifted her hands to his wrists and maybe we could even make that stick thats not what i mean she gave his wrists a quick squeeze before stepping back reaching down for her cap and glasses youre a heartbreaker duncan and i cant afford any cracks in mine i dont break hearts dont even bruise them she laughed slipped her glasses back in place i bet you believe that she tapped a finger to her lips tossed the sassy kiss at him and got the hell out before she let herself believe it too he started to go after her then stopped himself it would be he realized entirely too much like begging the fact that he could almost picture himself doing so made his palms sweat he had to figure the odds here pacing he slipped his hands into his pockets and fingered the coin wanting a woman was easy it was natural it was enjoyable seducing one was all that and more he didnt doubt he could seduce her there was too much sizzling between them for either one of them to walk away without seeing it through and she was wrong he thought with a frown he wasnt a heartbreaker hed never hurt a woman inevitably he began to ease away before emotions became tangled and messy and led to hurt on either side there was no reason for that to change at this stage of the game she was more of a challenge than most certainly more intriguing than any and that raw inyourface sex appeal was like a slim feminine finger beckoning in the dark he was more than willing to answer the call as long as it was on his terms all he had to do duncan mused was convince her his terms were acceptable considering he pulled the coin out of his pocket flipped it high caught it nimbly heads i win he murmured and turning the coin between his two fingers grinned at the twin faces on either side he was still grinning when the phone rang easing a hip onto the desk he picked up the receiver blade say hello when you answer the phone where are your manners the grin widened hello grandpa thats better hows the boat shes a princess were heading toward memphis and its hot as three hells hah ive got a nice breeze coming off the ocean here and im enjoying a fine cuban which means grandmas out womans off at some tea party shes nagging me about missing you anna macgregor had never nagged a day in her life but duncan let that pass ill come up for a couple days in the fall i was thinking she might like a little ride on the river on your boat thatd be great you let me know and well roll out the red carpet your brother was telling her about that new singer youve got there got your grandmother all fired up to hear her cat farrell duncan pressed his lips together and tasted her shes worth the price of a ticket dont i know that i heard her myself didnt i told you shed do i appreciate it she was a hit last night i heard some of the passengers talking about her show this morning good good sharp looks too she makes a package duncan murmured the irish are sturdy stock catherine mary farrell irish as they come duncans eyes narrowed and he shifted as a thought as uncomfortable as a tack in the seat pricked his brain catherine mary all i have on her paperwork here is cat farrell how do you know her full name ah your brother daniel said cursing himself mac mentioned it to me and it stuck with me as its a pretty name catherine mary duncan drummed his fingers on his knee so it is i imagine shell keep it even after she marries the piano player what what piano player the one shes engaged to duncan said easily got you you meddling old fox dabny pentwhistle pentwhistle pentwhistle what kind of a name is that for a smart woman to stick herself with where the devil did he come from she wasnt engaged last week wasnt she and how would you know because i sensing a trap daniel backtracked it pays me to know details ive got an interest in that boat of yours dont i means i have an interest in who works on it and what theyre about doesnt it girl wants to marry some pianoplaying pentwhistle thats her business but it pays me to know whats what now you know dont you so if you had any halfbaked ideas about setting me up with catherine mary farrell you can put them to rest halfbaked halfbaked is that any way to talk to your grandfather why i ought to take a strap to you so youve said before grinning now duncan reached for his own cigar and relit it when are you going to next time youre within arms reach laddie see if i dont boy your age sitting on some boat letting a pentwhistle slip a woman like that out from under you why its a sin girls got grit got guts and dont you mistake it she deserves the best and im the best hah a scoundrel is what you are youll break your poor old grannys heart whiling away your time on that river when you should be settling down and seeing to the future and making her babies to bounce on her knee i know the drill macgregor even as daniel blustered duncan laughed i love you grandpa and so you should with a warm chuckle daniel shifted tactics duncan laddie im only looking out for you i want to see my favorite grandchild happy and settled before i die duncan was fully aware every one of the grandchildren was daniels favorite youll never die and if you do youll come back and haunt the greatgrandchildren until theyre paired up and procreating now go pick on ian or one of the others im on to you all right all right but daniel grinned fiercely at the phone go play with your boat exactly what i had in mind give my love to grandma that ill do pentwhistle hah daniel muttered as he hung up which made duncan roar with laughter chapter contents prev next duncan blade believed in romance in the power and the beauty of it in its small details and sweeping gestures his brother often said romance was duncans religion and though he himself wouldnt go quite that far he did have absolute faith in its powers and in his experience women were suckers for it he sent flowers to her cabin when they docked in memphis perfume when they stopped in natchez a heartshaped trinket box when they turned into baton rouge and while theyd glided down the river toward all those places hed sought her out at odd moments to invite her to dinner on his private balcony for a moonlit walk on deck for a quiet supper after her show her answer was always the same forget it sugar cat farrell duncan decided was one tough nut and she wasnt cracking it wasnt just maddening duncan thought as he studied the docks of new orleans out his window it was unreasonable theyd sparked something in each other that was impossible to ignore for him anyway since the moment shed walked out of his office nearly a week before she hadnt given him a single opportunity to get his hands on her again not that she had avoided him he mused she wasnt the type to shut herself in her cabin or duck into crowds she was there always there wandering around the boat chatting with passengers or crew rehearsing in the lounge she didnt stutter or look away when they came across each other but would give him one of those slow feline smiles looking him dead in the eye she didnt seem the least affected even when he got close enough to smell the perfume she wore perfume hed given her for gods sake it was driving him crazy she was driving him crazy but he was far from ready to call it a day if the combination of duncan blade and new orleans couldnt soften a woman up there was no hope for humanity in her narrow bed in her cabin with the thin shade pulled over the tiny window cat stretched luxuriously she knew from the rhythm of the boat that theyd docked after a week on board shed grown accustomed to the movements the sounds the feel of the comanche princess new orleans was outside the window she thought lazily beignets tumbling flowers cool jazz and drunken tourists what more could a woman ask for she had hours to explore it to wander the narrow streets to poke into charming shops to sample the food the city was famous for and listen to streetcorner musicians to get off the boat and away from dangerous duncan her lips quirked that was how she was thinking of him these days a man who paid that much attention to a woman who was that charming that gorgeous that sexy was every bit as dangerous as a loaded gun and she had no intention of taking a stray bullet but lord she thought as she padded into her tiny bath to shower the man had a way about him a way of looking at a woman out of those fabulous dark chocolate eyes as if she were the sole focus of his world a way of talking to her with that smoothly sexy allmale voice as if hed waited his whole life to speak to her a way of touching her with those clever hands so that a simple brush on the shoulder sent echoes of anticipation straight to the core the charming son of a bitch was making her crazy she couldnt afford even a short side trip into insanity sending her flowers she thought as she toweled off it was so clichéd but she was smart enough to know there was a reason clichés worked hadnt she mooned over the blossoms buried her face in them hadnt she thought of him every damn time her gaze had landed on them and perfume never in her life had she owned real perfume the kind that came in gorgeous bottles cost the earth and made a woman feel like a queen worse hed known exactly what kind of scent would appeal to her would make that glamorous bottle of fragrance irresistible shed decided hed been born knowing how to get to a woman but the trinket box had nearly done her in it was so foolish so useless so pretty shed never had the time or opportunity to indulge in the foolish and useless hadnt realized such things would give her such pleasure wrapped in a towel she crossed the tiny cabin and picked up the box from where it sat on her little dresser it was glossy white on white with a little pink bow at the tip of the heart and it was empty as she had no trinkets to put inside but it made her smile still she set it down and began to dress for a day of steamy summer heat she knew what dangerous duncan was up to it was a kind of campaign she thought carefully strategically planned and she was the hill he intended to take once hed won her and planted his flag so to speak hed move on to the next campaign the next hill thats what heartbreakers do she murmured she shrugged tucking the hem of a simple white tshirt into simple black shorts it was fortunate she knew just how to handle him she slipped on sandals stuffed some cash in her pocket then grabbed her cap and sunglasses when she pulled open her door duncan was just raising a hand to knock good youre up it jolted her coming facetoface with him when hed been so heavily on her mind and that was irritating but she swung her glasses casually by the earpiece and cocked her head why wouldnt i be because you rarely climb out of bed until after noon she only smiled then why would you be knocking on my door at nine in the morning to wake you up but since youre up dressed and ready well have more time lets go where ever been to new orleans in a subtle move he reached behind her and pulled the door closed no but thats my current plan great well start with beignets at cafe du monde like proper tourists are those shoes comfortable yeah my current plans were solo sugar adjust them he suggested as he nudged her along to the steps ive spent a lot of time in new orleans one of my favorite places he kept right on talking as he steered her up on deck toward the gangplank it shows best at night but theres a lot to be said for it on a sultry summer day its all atmosphere you like seafood i like food good i know a great place for lunch look duncan he stopped turned slid his hands up her arms to her shoulders and pinned her with one of those long focused looks spend the day with me oh yeah she thought with an inward sigh the man had a way why not but youre buying it was like walking through a hot river and she loved it every steamy step in the french quarter the buildings were grand elegant feminine with their fussy balconies and tumbling flowers the smells were rich undertoned with the warm smell of decay the streets were narrow the parks green the pace sleepy and slow shed eaten three beignets and had sampled a sip of duncans cafe au lait shed listened to the patter of cajun french and the clipclop of horses pulling carriages around jackson square with him shed wandered along studying the sidewalk artists and their wares and had laughed delightedly at a charcoal caricature of elvis because the day called for it they strolled handinhand under huge shady trees along blistering sidewalks she stopped to watch three young boys tapdancing in a square their faces gleaming with sweat their feet fast and clever and she noted that duncan dropped bills into their cardboard box instead of coins generous she thought carelessly and sweetly so those kids probably make a killing every afternoon she commented they earn it ready for lunch she laughed sugar im always ready shed expected him to take her to some fancy restaurant where the tables were draped in linen and the waiters were discreetly efficient shed been completely prepared to be unimpressed instead he steered her into a dimly lit crowded cafe where the tables were bare scarred wood shoved up against one another family style the napkins were paper and the menu was scrawled on a chalkboard it was cat thought two steps up from a dive and exactly her style the woman behind the counter was enormous three feet wide if she was an inch the apron she wore was big as a tent and stained with splashes of color and shapes that reminded cat of an abstract painting her moonsize ebony face was smooth as satin and creased into a huge smile when her eyes lit on duncan theres that handsome boy come give mama a kiss he grinned leaned over and gave her a hard smacking one on the mouth bonjour mama ca va oui oui it comes it goes whos this skinny girl you bring me cat this is mama shes the best there is cat well she looks like a cat we gonna feed you up here chere im counting on it cat took a deep sniff smells like paradise paradise mama slapped a hand on her belly as if to hold it in place as she let out a rolling laugh go take your skinny girl and sit i fix you up she waved them away you dont order cat asked as she sat across from duncan at one of the wobbly tables i take what she gives me he flashed a smile and i like it so will you he couldnt have been more right cat decided as she plowed her way through barbecued shrimp a mountain of dirty rice and corn bread her only comment when duncan slid two of his shrimp from his plate to hers was a muffled grunt of assent nursing his beer he watched her eat hed watched her before and marveled she had the appetite of a starving trucker why arent you as big as mama um nothing sticks she said with her mouth full but i keep trying he laughed sipped his beer better save room for dessert she makes a killer pecan pie pecan pie cat swallowed and glanced over at the glassfronted display of desserts ice cream on the side he shook his head in amazed admiration sure if you want do when her plate was all but licked clean she sat back and blew out a breath good stuff i never miss a trip to mamas if i can help it he leaned forward here youve got a little sauce he rubbed his thumb at the corner of her mouth then stayed as he was looking at her touching her wanting her and a great mouth he murmured let me just help you out with it he kept leaning forward easing off the chair until he could fit his mouth over hers his hand slid around skimming her ear then cupping her neck with those long fingers gently kneading her heart dropped down to her toes then bounced into her throat he was doing it to her again making her mind fuzz her skin shiver the clatter from the late lunch crowd dimmed away and her system was suddenly full of the scent of him instead of the spices the sauces but she could handle him she told herself as her lips parted later boy you let that girl alone till she eats her pie mama gave duncan an affectionate whack on the butt wanting to take just a bit more of cats taste with him duncan scraped his teeth lightly over her bottom lip before he broke the kiss he kept his eyes on cats as he sat again she wants ice cream with her pie mama well dont i got it right here chuckling she dumped the plates in front of them and scooped up the dirty dishes then she winked at cat him he got a fine mouth for kissing eh yeah determined not to sigh cat picked up her fresh fork its not bad she said then took the first bite of pie but this she added closing her eyes this is a miracle she eats good mama gave duncan a bat on the shoulder be smart keep this one i really ought to introduce mama to my grandfather duncan commented when mama glided away they think alike really cat ate more pie and wondered what a black cook from new orleans and a staggeringly wealthy scot from hyannis port could have in common yeah they both think i should be married and raising a small herd of children one or the other is always trying to fix me up cat swirled ice cream in pie and lifted her eyebrows as she studied his sharply handsome face you dont look like you need help in that area sugar tell them he gestured with his beer sipped then decided it would be entertaining to see her reaction to his grandfathers latest scheme the macgregor handpicked you for me she blinked and for the first time since hed met her appeared completely at sea huh my grandfather he wants me to marry you now she laughed and went back to her pie get out im serious girls got grit he said dramatically rolling his rs guts good blood strong stock how would he know i barely met him youd be surprised how much he knows the mans uncanny and tenacious i figured it was only fair to let you know what he has in mind she drummed her fingers on the table trying to figure the angle and simply couldnt find it do you do everything your granddaddy tells you nope so rest easy darling that wasnt a marriage proposal i didnt figure it out until he called a few days ago checking up grinning now duncan settled into his own dessert i got the drift and needled him told him you were engaged to a piano player dabny pentwhistle pentwhistle what the hell kind of name is that exactly what the macgregor wanted to know he was pretty disappointed in you sweetheart he added with a wag of his fork wasting your time on some piano player but he didnt buy it for long the old mans damn sharp he just married off my cousin dc married off what is this medieval scotland its macgregor land duncan said with a grin trouble is theyre perfect together dc and layna i mean the macgregor hit a bullseye with them and hes done it before starting with my parents makes him cocky she wondered idly if duncan was going to eat all of his pie he arranged your parents marriage no just finagled it so that theyd meet bump into each other the rest was up to them hes been working on the second generation the last few years and hes batting a thousand up to me she was far from understanding it but she nodded and you intend to ruin his batting average i intend to live my own life make my own choices his fingers slid over the table to toy with hers but i do admire his taste hmm weird then she shrugged it off and worked on polishing off her pie youve got yourself a very strange family sugar darling you dont know the half of it later they walked off the meal in the high heat and moist air ducking into shops now and then to court the chill of airconditioning and browse when he caught her eyeing a tin of pralines he roared with laughter you cant possibly be hungry again not now she said with a gleam in her eye but i will be so why not be prepared he bought them for her not the little tin shed looked at but one big enough to feed a greedy family of four and made her laugh she liked him she thought really really liked him and that combined with the sneaky animal lust she was experiencing made for a difficult combination to resist the first was bound to nudge her into acting on the second be prepared cat warned herself as he pulled her into yet another shop and get out alive this shop was full of trinkets and jewelry colored stones and crystals winked in glass cases or were draped artfully over walls and shelves lining the side were three curtained alcoves where the curious and to cats mind the gullible could have their fortunes told she wandered idly toying with pretty dust catchers while duncan perused one of the cases she heard a sale ring up and shook her head without much interest the man shed come to note just loved tossing his money away when he tapped her on the shoulder she turned and he slipped a thin gold chain over her head whats this frowning she scooped up the swordshaped yellow gem dangling from the chain it was lovely polished to a gleam and slim as a running tear citrine stimulates communication and voice projection he smiled at her excellent stone for performers get out but her fingers had closed around it you dont believe stuff like that darling im celt and comanche i know stuff like that besides it suits you catherine mary he had the pleasure of seeing surprise consternation and vague annoyance flicker over her face before she controlled it how do you know my full name just one of the many other things i know want your palm read now thats really bunk then it wont hurt you he drew her to the counter to arrange payment for a reading fine you got money to burn go ahead shed never considered herself superstitious never traveling without her lucky cap was just a tradition after all so she sat in the little alcove smirked at the pretty young woman who took her hand and waited to be told shed be taking a long voyage and meeting a tall dark stranger you have a strong hand the woman said with a sweet smile an old soul cat rolled her eyes toward duncan who leaned against the wall yeah im ancient youve suffered loss sorrow and struggle who hasnt cat muttered but the woman only stroked her palm with a fingertip you use them and theyve made you strong you chose your direction at a young age and its rare for you to look back instead of forward passions ambitions you take care to make decisions with your head do you think your heart is unreliable this time cat looked into the womans eyes whose isnt she said flippantly yours can be trusted its a steady one talent it runs deep very powerful and it feeds you what you give of it it gives back it will take you where you want to go she frowned a minute studying cats face rather than her hand do you sing the quick tremor came first making her want to jerk her hand free but she shrugged figuring the con my pal here must have prompted you pretty good you can trust him too the woman said by way of answer his hearts as steady as yours though as closely guarded changes and decisions risks and rewards it will be up to you you dont have to be alone unless you turn away family centers you its an anchor no matter how far you drift you have so many places to go so many doors opening she said with a beaming smile that were locked or seemed to be her fingers played over cats hand skimmed settled you arent afraid to work and work hard but you expect to be paid in kind youre thrifty and wish you didnt have to be generous with those who matter one will more than others theres only one wholl fit you body head and heart and hes already in your mind cat tossed her hair back as they stepped back out into the thick air that was pretty lame blade how much did it cost you to set her up with what to say i didnt he was vaguely disturbed over what hed expected to be a passing amusement for both of them get out i didnt he repeated and stuck his hands in his pockets rather than taking hers i just stopped in there on impulse figured wed get a kick out of it hold it she put a hand on his arm narrowed her eyes and studied his face either he was a hell of an actor she concluded or he was as baffled as she well that was weird she decided yeah weird they walked back toward the river in silence chapter contents prev next they stayed two days in new orleans slipping away from the docks on the second evening the celebrational mardi grasstyle party to celebrate the journey was populated with fresh faces and familiar ones the music was loud the drinks colorful the mood high duncan circulated strolling the decks passing through lounges greeting new passengers chatting with those whod remained for the weeks voyage back north but he couldnt find her until he couldnt he didnt realize that throughout his routine tour of the boat hed been looking for cat following instinct he headed down to the kitchen dinner preparations were well underway pots steamed pans sizzled cleavers hacked idly he snagged a carrot stick from a military line on a cutting board crunching it as charlie saluted him hey bossman were busy round here you come to stir a pot just passing through hows the redfish tonight fresh and fine want me to blacken up a piece for you got garlictaters too less you got you a hot date he cackled over his pots i hear tell we got some fine ladies this trip up group a sisters each one pretty as the next the kingston group yep four longstemmed blondes he winked and nibbled the carrot i checked them out for you charlie looking for wife number four aint gonna be no number four im swearing offa matrimony heard that before you seen cat around she passing through too girls got her one healthy appetite he wiggled his eyebrows at duncan you hoping she take a bite outta you wouldnt hurt my feelings she been passing through this evening got her some dinner before the show like usual she likes her redfish black and spicy too she took her some strawberry shortcake on up to her cabin you maybe catch her if you got a long stride ive got one duncan began then felt his beeper vibrate in his pocket he pulled it out checked the code and saw he was needed in the casino but ill just have to catch her later he didnt manage any free time until midway through the second show his pit boss was down with a migraine and two of his best dealers were suffering from a mild case of food poisoning after splitting a bushel of crayfish the casino was woefully shorthanded duncan filled in at a blackjack table taking on the duties of dealer and entertaining his table one that consisted of the kingston sisters they were lookers he thought goodnatured women with deep pockets and a lot of family affection and not one of them could play worth spit honey you dont want to hold on fourteen when the dealers got ten showing the name of the game is beat the house you want to take me down love to she giggled cheerfully while her sisters hooted okay handsome hit me he dealt her a six causing her sisters to applaud then went on down the line coaching each one he paid off two raked in chips from the other pair then dealt the next hand under usual circumstances hed have enjoyed nothing better than playing flirtandgamble with a quartet of attractive blondes but his mind kept wandering out of the casino and into the lounge beyond shed be singing standing center stage with the mike in her hand and some sexy little dress barely covering her her voice would be filling the room radiating through it deep and rich and smooth he realized he didnt want to just see her he wanted to hear her he wanted to find a table in the back of the room in the dark and just listen ive got twelve the sister on the end batted enormous baby blues and demanded attention what should i do duncan take a chance im showing nine so you have to figure nineteen okay but be gentle with me he clobbered her with a king and smiled sympathetically oh pooh she pouted prettily maybe im just better at other games signal received he thought loud and clear and what the hell was wrong with him he didnt feel the least bit tempted to bounce back with a signal of his own and felt nothing but relief when gloria stepped beside him changing dealers ladies she said cheerfully their responding chorus of awws had gloria chuckling say goodnight duncan good night ladies youve got the floor from here he murmured to his manager yeah under control why dont you go on into the lounge and take in the rest of the show since thats where your minds been for the last hour anyway might just he gave her a quick flick on her nose gloria will take good care of you he said to the table and four pairs of big blue eyes followed him out the door so is he taken gloria arched her brows at the blonde across from her then grinned yeah he is he just doesnt know it yet ladies place your bets i have she thought and laughed to herself duncan slipped quietly into the lounge adjusting to the dim lights and the heat of cats voice she was singing about loving the wrong man but there was as much defiance as sorrow in the vocals hed meant to ease down the side and toward the back order a brandy and sit sipping while he listened to her but he stayed where he was in the shadows just to stage left she knew he was there would have sworn thered been a change in the air the moment hed stepped in something charged and edgy that had her skin prickling as if to test them both she shifted her gaze met his held it let the song pour out of her and into him it wasnt until the applause sounded that she realized shed yet to break the connection she lowered the mike so her shaky expulsion of breath wouldnt carry then turned a sparkling smile to the audience she had a pattern some that was scripted in her head more that came as suited the mood hers and theirs but she knew how to play the audience and enjoyed it because she enjoyed them so she would concentrate on them instead of the dangerous man standing in the shadows he had yet to recover his breath when she began talking sliding into an intimate conversation with those who sat at the tables she charmed them he noted calling for the lights to spot on a couple near the front who were celebrating their twentyfifth anniversary she made a few jokes just bawdy enough to have the room roaring then cuing the music she began to sing a suggestive version of big spender directly to the man she stroked his cheek skimmed her fingers through his hair slid into his lap as his wife giggled helplessly and he turned a deep pink accented with a foolish grin duncan found himself grinning too damn she was good he thought shed wrap them around her finger and keep them right there until she was done and she was doing exactly the same to him but the difference was he told himself he intended to do some wrapping himself leaning back against the wall he watched and kept watching until the end of the show it made her jumpy to know he was still there right where hed been since hed come in where shed have no choice but to pass him on the way to her dressing room and because she was jumpy she was all the more determined to pretend she couldnt care less you dont usually stay so long she commented unscrewing the top of the bottle of water she always kept close by the stage spot checking the talent i wanted to see you he said it simply because it was true and because he knew it would throw her off well you did she started past pausing when he took her wrist lets go outside no thanks i need to change no you dont i like looking at you in that delightful excuse for a dress it was black tonight plunging deep front and back im tired duncan no youre not youre revved he could feel the energy pouring out of her wanted to capture it watching her eyes he lifted the hand he held to his mouth its warm on deck and theres a moon take a walk with me i wont touch you unless you want me to that was the trouble she thought she did want him to maybe it was time to stop pretending otherwise all right well walk i could use some air nice crowd tonight he guided her through the tables and out the doors you made anniversary boys night possibly his year she laughed at that shook back her hair and drew in the deep dark scent of the water his wife set it up with me before the show gave me fifty bucks to pour it on she got her moneys worth lets go up closer to the moon i hear youre a big hit with the kingston sisters she commented as they climbed the stairs did you they were in the lounge earlier giggling and sighing over you nothing more rewarding to a man than to make the ladies giggle and sigh he climbed steadily up to the third deck pleased to find it deserted i bet she walked to the rail leaned out god this is fabulous really fabulous i love the night on the river my personal favorite ive been hoping to wear you down enough to get you out here with me he turned her slowly at night on the river thats not where you want me duncan just one of the many places he ran his hands up her arms but didnt draw her against him you sang to me her heart began to flutter an uncomfortable and she thought idiotic feeling i sing to everyone its my job you sang to me he repeated his voice quiet and smooth it made me want you so much my bones ached his fingers skimmed over her shoulders up the side of her throat and it made me see you wanted me right back he lowered his head keeping his mouth a whisper from hers youll have to ask me since i promised i wouldnt do you always keep your word duncan yeah his breath fluttered over her lips i do and i never ask she told him and fisting her hands in his hair dragged his mouth to hers she cut him off at the knees with that wild and sudden slap of lust her mouth was like a flame branding and burning and making him desperate for more he knew if he didnt take control hed simply snap and take her where they stood he broke the kiss ordered himself to gentle the hands that had clamped on her shoulders my cabins right behind us she angled her head smiled slowly desire was a slow and steady burning in the blood i know he backed up sliding his hands down to hers drawing her with him then he circled her freeing one hand to dig for his key watching her face as he slipped it into the lock why dont we go inside why dont we she murmured and turned to walk into the room hed left a light burning by the bed and the wide window undraped and open to the moon though her blood continued to pump hot and hard she took a careless turn around the room there was an antique table graced with pictures framed in gleaming silver deepcushioned chairs in a vivid shade of blue brass lamps with glass globes a gracefully arched niche filled with books and more photos the bed was brass as well with fluid lines and of generous size nice digs she glanced over her shoulder as she heard the scrape of a match and watched with both pleasure and surprise as he lit a group of slender white candles youre quite the romantic arent you he blew out the match then walked over to switch off the bedside lamp so they stood in the soft glow of shifting light and shadows you have a problem with that no not particularly but it made her just a little shaky to counter it she curved her lips and reached back to unzip her dress dont he stepped forward ran a single fingertip from the base of her throat to the edge of the plunge of black silk i want to undress you she let her arms fall back to her sides whats stopping you nothing he lowered his head nibbled gently at her neck not a thing you smell like you look she fought the urge to shake her head clear you bought the perfume big spender he chuckled and lapped at her taste like you look her breath was going ragged despite her efforts to control it youve had a sample or two before not enough not nearly he worked his way back up to her mouth but barely skimmed it should i tell you what i want to do with you or should i just surprise you oh dear was all she could think i dont surprise easy then lets see what i can do his lips brushed hers again once then twice teasing hers apart his tongue seduced hers into a lazy dance lulling her into mists that thickened slowly sweetly no one had ever kissed her like this spent so much time shown so much patience and when he began to inch down the zipper at her back she shivered in delicious anticipation but he didnt peel the dress away simply spread it apart stroking his hands over her back he wanted time to enjoy every inch of her every moment of this first time even when her hands clutched at him her nails raked down his shirt he took his time it built slowly this pleasure layer over layer of heat tangling with layer over layer of need so when he slipped the dress from her shoulders listened to it rustle as it fell in a pool he was ready to take them both to the next stage thoughtfully he traced a fingertip along the swell of her breasts over the top of her strapless black bra very nice he said softly then trailed that fingertip down over her midriff down to flick over the slim matching garter belt very very nice lets see if i can say the same struggling to keep her hands steady she slipped off his jacket and began unbuttoning his shirt the candlelight flickered over his skin that lovely dusky gold shimmered over the lean torso the long muscles she ran her tongue between her teeth slid her gaze up yes very very nice he swept her up making her heart flop in her chest its about to get better chapter contents prev next she expected speed now fast hands and would have welcomed them but when he lay her on the bed when he covered her when he slid down her body those hands were slow thorough and devastating he heard her moan felt her arch and in one blind moment dug teeth into her thigh just above the top of her stocking when she shuddered he ran his tongue up over then into her shocked by the sudden change staggered by the sharp lance of pleasure she bowed up opening for him and felt herself fly like a pebble out of a slingshot greedy he took then greedy still he worked his way up using hands and mouth teeth and tongue he flicked open the front clasp of her bra and feasted delirious desperate for more she wrapped herself around him her hands as busy as his her mouth seeking the taste of him everywhere the breath tore through her lungs when their lips met again i want you inside me she tugged at his slacks fighting them down his hips now right now her eyes glinted in the shifting light her hair tumbled like wildfire over the bed he thought in that moment he wanted her more than he wanted to live then look at me he panted the words yanking up her hips look at me when i am and drove into her he watched those glorious eyes blur go dark glassy and swallowed the moan that trembled through her lips beneath him she moved a silkskinned lightning bolt power speed wild and wicked energy barely tapped her nails dug into his back ran over his hips dragged through his hair as all the while that marvelous agile body plunged with his he felt the climax tear through her in one long shuddering rip gloried in the choked sob that caught in her throat he thought mine then his mind emptied as he poured himself into her well cat thought when her mind could function again shed done it now all those good intentions all those sensible lectures shed given herself out the window and into the river advantage duncan she decided not only had she surrendered her body but somewhere along the line shed slipped up and let him get a good grip on her heart as well and she knew just what would happen next hed enjoy it theyd have a tumbling torrid affair discreetly of course he was after all the boss and wouldnt want to risk gossip then when her contract was up hed wink her out of his life perhaps adding a small tasteful parting gift and that would be that men like duncan blade didnt make serious plays for itinerant lounge singers so shed have to prepare herself and when the time came shed do the winking and leaving first determined to follow the rules of this particular game she ran her hands casually down his back then lifted her arms and stretched mmm very nice blade very nice his head was still reeling i feel like a cartoon cat what you know one that gets his head bashed with a sledgehammer then he has three heads all vibrating and making that really cool sound while his eyes spin around she snorted out a laugh and had nearly hugged him before she remembered it was smarter to play it cool what happens when his head stops vibrating he does it all again chuckling he nipped at her throat her jaw paused at her mouth with one long slow kiss and just as cats mind began to fog again he rolled and tucked her neatly against him he was a snuggler she thought and felt that grip on her heart tighten just a bit so you watch a lot of cartoons theyll take your troubles away who can worry when theyre in frostbite falls whatsamatta u he laughed and gave her a squeeze dont make it worse its badenov well whodve thought the sophisticated cat farrell and rocky and bullwinkle hey it takes a very sophisticated palette to truly appreciate moose and squirrel indeed it does and there he thought was that connection again on a different level my cousin cybil and i used to have long intense discussions on the true meaning of those opening credits shes a cartoonist oh yeah mmm clever girl our cybil he nudged cat until they were facetoface damp bodies meshing want to have a long intense discussion we could do that her blood was heating again she slid against him scraping her teeth lightly over his chin or i could get my sledgehammer back out i like the way you think he found her mouth with his sank in move your things in here mmm what she jerked back shoving at his shoulder before he could shift on top of her your things his hand skimmed up cupped her breast move them in here whoa off balance she squirmed free whats that about i want to be with you whats the point of you sleeping two decks below he sat up as well and began to nibble her shoulder discretion if i move in here the crew and passengers are going to know its not that big a boat so what he gave her hips a boost maneuvering her until her legs were around his waist and they were torsototorso were all grown up now past the climbthroughthewindow stage he ran his hands up her back moving in so that he could feast on her neck i want you here i just want the hell out of you think think think she ordered herself even as the blood rushed to her head to roar like the sea youve got a bigger bed a better view incredible hands she said in a humming purr but while she still could she laid her hands on his shoulders and held him off if i move my stuff in here the cabin below stays mine no booking it he looked into her eyes you want an escape route tidier that way sugar if either one of us decides the arrangements getting old i just move back down no harm no foul he ignored the quick twist of annoyance and gripped her hips again deal then he lifted her filled her it didnt get old she kept expecting it to at least on his part but the longer they were together the more they seemed to need to stay that way she told herself it was the sex lord knew their hunger for each other didnt appear to be waning late nights and early mornings one sweltering afternoon in natchez where he surprised her with a hotel suite and theyd made energetic love in an enormous tub frothy with swirling bubbles a hot fast coupling against her dressing room door that had taken them both by surprise and had left her shimmering through her first show he still brought her flowers and foolish little gifts she couldnt get a handle on it he had her why was he still pursuing her it had been nearly three weeks since theyd become lovers she thought as she rolled over in the bed she now thought of as hers as much as his theyd cruised up the river down and now up again and this connection between them remained she didnt have a clue what to do about it enjoy cat she ordered herself just enjoy the moment she stretched and thought about snuggling back into sleep they were docked in saint louis and duncan was doing whatever it was he did on these early mornings in port she had the entire day off and no desire to go into the city shed take the afternoon to work on her demo though she wasnt entirely convinced duncan really meant to do anything with it still shed taken the controls back and had fired cicero the moron shed need that demo when this gig was up shed have to find a new agent another run the salary from this one would tide her over give her enough of a cushion to select representation with more care she wasnt going back to those onenight stands in hotel bars riding the bus from city to city and living out of her trunk in some twobit room shed had just a little too much of a taste of the good life and she liked it no time like the present she decided and rose to dress and take advantage of the nearempty boat she strolled out on deck wincing against the bright flash of sunlight until her dark glasses were in place the heat was outrageous shimmering visibly over the water and had driven those who remained on board inside where airconditioning made life civilized but she liked the heat and treated herself to a stroll before buckling down to work sometimes when she was alone like this she liked to imagine the boat was hers her personal vessel with its glossy white paint and fancy rails she hadnt realized shed enjoy life on the river quite so much and already knew shed miss it dreadfully when it was over but nothing lasted forever she reminded herself so you grabbed on to all you could while you had it then she turned the corner and saw duncan in a hard embrace with a slim strawberry blonde son of a bitch her hands fisted at her sides even as her heart slammed down to her toes nobody twotimed cat farrell nobody played her for a fool she wanted to lunge forward rip the sluts eyes out then finish up by scooping duncan blades cheating heart right out of his chest and tossing it overboard all that held her back was a thin vibrating strand of pride damned if shed let him know he could hurt her so she sucked the hurt in tossed her head and strolled toward them as if she hadnt a care in the world nice morning you jerk the easy smile hed sent her blinked away into bafflement huh who the hell do you think you are pride hadnt held after all and there was a vicious satisfaction in jabbing him in the chest you think you can climb out of bed with me then cozy up with some mother duncan said quickly grabbing cats hand before she could jab him again and put a hole in his heart and not just some mother my mother mom cat farrell i was telling you about her so you were and obviously leaving out some very pertinent details serena thought but she smiled and offered cat a hand first i have to thank you for the compliment mortified and furiously working out why this unspeakable embarrassment was duncans fault cat took the offered hand i beg your pardon mrs blade oh please dont serena said with a laugh youll spoil it some of the stiffness went out of cats shoulders after all she thought the woman was lovely she didnt look like anyones mother with that gorgeous glinting hair and those exotic lavender eyes the breezy yellow slacks and blouse set off a slim figure and her skin was rosepetal smooth an honest mistake but cat took her hand back and shoved it into the pocket of her baggy shorts youre beautiful i like you weve surprised duncan too serena went on his father and i decided to fly in and meet the boat take a day before we head west we have some business in vegas and thats not all thoroughly delighted with cats reaction duncan slid an arm around his mothers shoulders my grandparents are here theyre going to cruise down to new orleans with us terrific cat thought god thats nice for you youll have to excuse me i was just she trailed off as a man headed down the deck toward them he was tall his golden skin gleaming in the sun dark glasses shielded his eyes and made his sculpted face mysterious and not a little dangerous silver glinted in a rich mane of raven black hair prime was all cat could think absolutely prime the champion of heartbreakers justin serena held out a hand come meet cat farrell the singer duncans been telling us about his father cat mused well no wonder duncan was sinfully attractive he came from premium stock a pleasure justin caught cats hand between both of his both mac and duncan have told us what an asset you are to our entertainment area im hoping we can book you into the comanche atlantic city she didnt dance a jig but she wanted to ill look forward to it she had to get out of here cat thought before she did something ridiculous like turn cartwheels i have some work to do i hope ill see you before you go count on it serena said under her breath as cat walked away then lifting a brow she turned to her son so so lets go inside before we melt i want to make sure grandma and grandpa are settling in and i need to get the papers dad wants to review duncan took his mothers hand and yes ill tell you about it good an hour later serena rattled the ice in her tall glass of cold tea and laughed he set you up he just plopped her down on your boat the same way he plopped justin down on my ship all those years ago more or less duncan agreed im going to have to thank him for it dont please justin held up a hand youll create a monster well i cant fault his taste shes fabulous behind his desk duncan kicked back in his chair professionally speaking shes amazing its a miracle she isnt topping the charts bad management is what i figure but were going to fix that we serena said the family has connections he said simply and i intend to use them i know she grew up poor and she grew up rough and her life hasnt changed much there but theres no reason for that to continue when shes got a gift like she does thats the business side as for the personal i just havent quite figured it out yet shes unusual and ive never felt for anyone what i feel for her frowning a little he picked up a brass paperweight in the shape of the macgregor clan symbol and passed it from hand to hand feelings were the issue he mused strong and urgent soft and sweet a tangled confusion of them neatly winding around his heart no other woman at any other time had ever come close to taking root in his heart maybe because shes not like anyone else im going to exercise our option and book her for another six weeks professionally its a solid move she really pulls them in personally itll give me a little more time to figure it out part of you already has serena thought slipping her hand into justins as she studied her sons face but your head just hasnt caught up with your heart she didnt have much time herself serena mused as she slipped away from her family to find cat she wanted a clearer impression of the woman who was dazzling her son though shed managed to wheedle some facts out of her father while scorching him for interfering in her childs life she needed more who was cat farrell and was her heart big enough to make room for duncan she laughed at herself as she reached the doors of the main lounge not to put too fine a point on it she supposed she was about to follow her fathers footsteps and do some meddling of her own then she opened the doors and stopped stopped and just listened cat was at the piano at the corner of the stage she played well not brilliantly serena thought but with enough style to give that stunning voice a path to follow and that voice caressed the heartbreaking lyrics of am i blue with a power that had to come straight from the soul when it was done serenas eyes were wet you should be too young to do that song justice she said smiling when cats head whipped around but you sing it as though it was written for you struggling not to be uncomfortable cat turned on the bench thats my job no its your gift you made me cry the highest of compliments thanks i know im interrupting still she crossed the room to sit beside cat on the piano bench i was hoping to persuade you to join all of us for dinner tonight its a family deal she knew nothing about families and everything about being the outsider wed like you to come youve met my father yes briefly when i was in vegas he makes an impression oh indeed he does laughing serena shifted to noodle with the keys he was very taken with you after a beat cat nodded i suppose duncan told you that mr macgregor arranged for me to have this gig for his own purposes yes thats the macgregor he cant help it she smiled gently i hope youre not offended no surprised really why id have expected him to browse through the debutante line for his grandson and to that the macgregor would say debutante hah a good heart and a strong spines what he looks for and id say you have both a good mind strength of purpose and an appreciation of family cat lifted her eyebrows i barely finished high school so far my purpose has mostly been to earn enough to keep from going hungry and my only family is my mother though i appreciate her very much and to that he would say cat farrell has grit theres no winning with daniel macgregor cat looked down at her hands then at serenas duncans mother had ladys hands she mused a ladys face a ladys way she thought she was getting the drift and youd like me to move along mrs blade before duncan starts thinking his grandfather might have a pretty good idea serena stopped playing looked over and into cats eyes why would you think that its obvious enough i know what i am and where i come from my father was an ordinary man who had the bad luck to die when he wasnt yet thirty my mothers a waitress who never had a chance to be anything else and i sing for my supper youre father might be old and sentimental but you wouldnt be i see serena considered and if i offered you say ten thousand dollars to move along what would you say green fire flashed cold and bitter id say go to hell mrs blade to cats surprise serena threw back her head and laughed delightedly oh i knew i liked you the minute you tore into duncan on deck i knew it cat since you dont know me i wont be insulted by you considering me a shallow snob more interested in pedigree than my sons happiness but she paused and her lovely eyes sobered you should think more of yourself than you apparently do i dont know what youre talking about im talking about the fact that the only one in here whos thinking of you as less than an interesting appealing and delightful woman is you gently now she laid a hand over cats i love my son hes a beautiful young man in every possible way how could i be less than happy that you love him too i didnt say i loved him struck with sheetwhite panic cat yanked back and scrambled up i didnt say that cant be she thought dizzily wont be no serena smiled again no you didnt but if you ever do ill be very happy for him ill let you get back to work she rose gracefully think about dinner will you serena was nearly out the door before cat could speak again mrs blade yes i figured when i saw this setup she gestured to encompass the boat that duncan was a lucky man looks like i didnt know the half of it oh yes serena said i really do like you then she breezed out content chapter contents prev next cat hadnt expected to fall in love during a sixweek gig on the river and she certainly hadnt expected to find herself in love with a ninetyyearold man but she fell head over heels for daniel macgregor he was a rogue and that appealed to her own sense of adventure he was a hothead and she appreciated pitting her own temper against an equal his heart was sentimental mush his mind razor sharp the combination was more than she could resist she wasnt quite so sure of anna macgregor there she thought was dignity serenity and that steelandvelvet ladylike quality that could never be learned you were born with it her daughter had it cat mused she imagined all the macgregor women did including those whod come into the family through marriage well shed never be a lady had no desire to be she didnt intend to get anywhere through marriage she was a solo act and intended to stay that way but she could meet the macgregor headtohead and enjoy every moment you dont know one single scottish ballad what kind of singer are you a torch singer mr macg enjoying herself cat rehearsed in the empty lounge for an audience of one daniel had taken to sitting at one of the tables whenever the lounge was closed and commenting and kibitzing on her song list that means you cant have some variety he glowered at her from under snowy white eyebrows why theres some scottish tunes that will rip a mans heart out of his chest while its still beating with that voice of yours any man with the blood of the scots in him would fall in love with you deliberately she skimmed a hand through her hair they all fall in love with me anyway he barked out a laugh thumped his big fist on the table youre a sassy lass cat farrell why arent you reeling in that handsome grandson of mine it was another standard question and cat grinned wickedly because im holding out for you why settle for small fry when you can have the big shark his wide face went pink with pleasure when he stroked his soft white beard his eyes blue as summer were canny hell give you fine babies give you you mean ive figured you out mr macg she leaned over and kissed him you wont be happy until you have enough greatgrandchildren to fill an auditorium anna frets for them and since his wife wasnt about he sneaked a cigar out of his pocket and she worries day and night over young duncan your wife has a very smooth brow for such a worrywart cat picked up a matchbook struck one and grinned into daniels eyes as he puffed the cigar into life if you run away with me sugar neither of us will have a worry in the world seducing my grandfather again duncan strolled in feeling the lift in his heart he experienced whenever he came across them together which he noted was often i might have talked him into taking me to venice if you hadnt popped up shed barely managed to smirk before duncan had her by the hair and was kissing the breath out of her now then daniel thumped his fist again thats more like it keep a good strong hold on that one lad shes slippery ive got her duncan said easily and he was beginning to think he meant to keep her lounge opens in twenty grandpa he murmured keeping his eyes on cats go play somewhere else now thats no way to talk to your grandfather cat said sternly it is when he keeps trying to steal my woman this womans trying to steal him she tried to wiggle free and found herself firmly caught some of us are working here sugar im the boss remember excuse us grandpa i have to have a little business meeting with the talent here as he pulled cat toward her dressing room he called back over his shoulder by the way grandmas on her way here youre going to want to lose that cigar sweet mary daniel muttered hurriedly stubbing out the cigar waving at smoke then he smiled sentimentally as duncan dragged cat away he was willing to take odds thered be a wedding before summer ended duncan i was having a conversation with mr mcg youre having one with him every time i turn around cant believe the old mans beating my time im crazy about him so am i but he closed the dressing room door flicked the lock then nudged her back against the wall watching her he skimmed his hands up her sides over her breasts down again oh well she murmured as her heart rose up to pound hard in her throat keep it light she ordered herself keep it sexy dont think dont feel any more than you can handle why didnt you say so she wrapped her arms around him and prepared to pull him into a hot turbulent kiss but he framed her face with his hands let his mouth hover over hers then brush then nibble he wanted to hear her breath catch as it did when he took her slowly under wanted to feel that gradual almost reluctant melting that fluid surrender sometimes it was a fire in the blood all heat and flash and glory in those moments they couldnt take each other fast enough other times it was like carefree children all wrestling and laughter and now and then it was slow and tender all heart and that he realized as his mouth cruised lazily over hers was what he wanted now he wanted her heart so she sighed and she sank into his arms and she gave what shed never known she had to give with him there was always more inside her one more well of emotion to be tapped one more door to be quietly nudged open she said his name as he picked her up to carry her to the sofa murmured it as he lay down with her moaned it as his hands began to move over her the stroke of fingertips over flesh the warmth of breath mingling mouths meeting to slide into kisses long and deep and aching he felt her pulse trip under his hands felt her heart race under his mouth but he wanted more than excitement more than desire he wanted love let me in he murmured it against her mouth ill never hurt you but he was even then he was he was ripping something inside her tearing something out of her that she was terrified to lose she shook her head denying both of them but his mouth was patient his hands ruthlessly tender they opened her heart held it wide and let him tumble in the change destroyed her left her helpless and floundering he slipped into her braced so that he could watch her face the awareness and the confusion in her eyes his own heart filled to bursting its different she couldnt speak only shook her head swallowed a sob as his mouth covered hers again unable to resist she flowed with him over the high warm wave then under its different he said again she grabbed a robe from a hook shrugged into it desperate for balance she jerked the belt into place suicide hadnt she said he was suicide and here she was teetering right on the edge of the cliff no its not she wanted to mean it and it doesnt have to be he angled his head why does it scare you to know that i care about you that you matter to me it doesnt to settle her restless hands she snapped up her brush and began to drag it through her hair whatever you may think of me i dont have sex with men unless i matter thats not what i said or what i mean he tugged on his slacks then reached for his shirt youre good at turning the point around to suit yourself cat but im just as good at sticking to whats important right now you are well thats fine her eyes met his in the mirror i like being important steadier she set the brush down then turned and leaned back against the counter youre important too duncan is that what you want to hear of course you are or i wouldnt still be with you dont complicate this funny i actually think im simplifying it what do you feel for me a great many things i want you i think thats obvious enough i enjoy you smiling she walked over to run her hands up his chest i like your style i like your face and i downright adore your body the amusement shed hoped for didnt flicker in his eyes they remained steady level and just a little cool and without the sex hard to say she shrugged turned away to straighten the cosmetics on the counter but her hands felt numb since were not without it are we but for the sake of argument she made herself turn back id still like you youre a likable man i dont make a lot of friends duncan im not in one place long enough to go to the trouble or take the risk that friendship involves youre an exception his brow winged up odd he mused to feel delighted and irritated at the same time so were friends arent we i suppose we are he gave her the same easy smile she gave him well pal well be pulling out of port shortly i have to get to work ill see you around she felt a shudder as if some major crisis had been narrowly evaded oh and duncan nice doing business with you sugar he flashed a grin as he opened the door but when he shut it behind him his eyes narrowed darkened and the smile went thin hed always considered himself a lucky man but what the hell kind of luck was it for him to so suddenly fall in love so ridiculously in love with a woman who didnt follow any standard pattern love wasnt a game hed expected to play until he was damn good and ready but the cards had already been dealt he was just going to have to see that she anted up and didnt bluff him out of the pot because when duncan blade played he played to win chapter contents prev next for the rest of the week he let it ride held his cards close to the vest and let the pot build it wasnt exactly a sacrifice he decided as he did his pass through the casino the more she relaxed the more demonstrative she became and he enjoyed watching the way she flirted with his grandfather the way she gradually warmed toward his grandmother once hed come across the two of them with their heads together on deck and would have sworn the sexy cat and the serene anna were sharing secrets he needed to talk with cat himself and hadnt managed to make time that afternoon hed skimmed over her contract refreshing himself on the details of the option it seemed only fair he talk to her before he called her agent and enforced it then there was the call hed gotten just that morning from reed valentine of valentine records he imagined cat was going to be very pleased with how well the demo hed sent in had been received it wasnt something he wanted to tell her on the fly such news he concluded required the right setting and hed already taken steps to provide it after her second show it made him smile to think of it so the warmth of that showered onto the kingston sister who grabbed his hand as he passed the blackjack table oh im going to miss that she shot him her very best smile in return i cant believe our vacation is up tomorrow i hope you enjoyed it which one was this he wondered vaguely cindi sandi candi every minute were talking about doing it again next year its so much fun we aim to please any luck she kept her baby blues on his not as much as id like he had to laugh i meant with the cards there either but its been entertaining i dont suppose you ever get to philadelphia ive been known to then he saw cat swagger into the casino and everything else went out of his mind excuse me the blonde watched him walk away blew out a wistful sigh some people have all the luck she said to the dealer cat watched him too studying the way he moved the way he strode through the tables past the machines through the tempting seductive sounds of money being won and lost oh yeah she mused this was definitely his turf hey he took her hand toyed with her fingers you never come in here no reason to i dont gamble as a rule ever break the rules all the time sugar want a game ive only got twenty till cue time enough he spotted an empty table pleased shed chosen the early hour to wander in come on i come from a long line of blackjack dealers sure you do well a short line then my mother was a dealer thats how she met my father really it intrigued her enough to let him draw her over and who won both of them ill spot you a hundred i can cover my bets fine youre on credit then with nimble fingers he counted out and stacked her chips you look especially delicious tonight darling what the hell she thought and slid onto a stool her midnight blue dress clung to every curve and shimmered under the lights last night before we dock i always want to leave them happy she nudged a fivedollar chip onto her mark deal em sugar he dealt her a five and a seven gave himself a facing ace possible blackjack insurance i dont believe in it hit me she took an eight and smiled the hand is twenty he flipped over his down card dealer has seven or seventeen takes ten busts on twentyfour he slid her winnings over slipped more cards out of the shoe how about a date later beautiful maybe she glanced at her cards eighteen and his a six showing ill hold holds on eighteen dealer has fifteen wins with nineteen and grinned as he turned up a four do you often call your shots as often as possible he was good she imagined he was good at whatever game he played but then so was she and most often she played to survive so she never never wagered anything she couldnt afford to lose not money not time and never her heart but when she laid down her stake she played to win deal she said and smiled at him he nipped her the next three hands running and had her eyeing him narrowly nothing up my sleeve he assured her we run a clean game cant beat the house you dont gamble he pointed out you hold too easily arent willing to chance the cards i cant control the cards especially if im not dealing them want to switch come on she started to refuse then shrugged her shoulders why not you never know when you might need a fallback career amused she walked around to stand behind the table scanned the casino different perspective isnt it same game same odds only now they favor me ill spot you sugar place your bet he slid one of her chips over waited for his cards she looked entirely too pleased with herself when she turned up the corner of her hold card under her nine he had two eights split deal me two more i know how its done she said dryly then lifted a brow when he tapped on the hand now showing sixteen youre going to hit that thats right a five will do when she dealt him a four and frowned he nodded close enough hold here hit there he said and gestured to the second hand of thirteen she topped it with an eight and swore under her breath nineteen loses she muttered flipping over her queen it wasnt just the cards she decided she kept losing ground to him he kept tempting her to risk a little more and every time she did every time she let herself sink into him it was harder to remember how much it cost when your hand or your heart went bust youre good blade thats my job well since youve just taken me for thirty bucks in about five minutes im done at this rate ill lose my shirt before cue we can play strip blackjack later she laughed and bent down to lean on the table that was a game she could afford where the odds were even between them i just came in to tell you ive got a little surprise for your grandfather at the end of the second show thought you might get a kick out of it what is it come see for yourself she slid her eyes to the side and smiled smugly at the kingston blonde if you can tear yourself away from your harem sweetheart im all yours right she chuckled patted his cheek then straightened well settle up later got to go earn my losses she walked out with a notsosubtle swing of hips that had him blowing out a breath yes indeed he mused they would definitely settle up later she finished up the second show well aware that duncan had slipped in and was now seated at the table with his grandparents shed worked out the timing with anna and stepped out of the lights as the crowd began to thin some would remain back at the bar or scattered at tables but she considered this a personal performance and one that oddly had little wings of nerves fluttering in her gut dont know what your problem is boy daniel muttered that womans made for you daniel anna only sighed shed come to the same conclusion herself and could have bopped him for saying anything that might tip the balance the wrong way leave duncan alone hes a man grown my point my point exactly when is he going to do his duty when is he going to act like a man and settle down i want to know he lets that lass slip through his fingers well hes hes no blood of mine hah folding his arms daniel sat back and glared knowing it would make his grandfather twitch with envy duncan drew out a slim cigar ran it lovingly through his fingers then clamping it between his teeth he lit it puffed contentedly while daniels blue eyes glittered with annoyance and desire who said i was going to let her slip through my fingers if youd use the eyes in your head youd see trailing off daniel backtracked sucked in air then slapped duncan hard on the back well then hah you see anna didnt i tell you the boy was bright didnt i tell you not to fret constantly daniel adoring them both anna laid her hands over theirs i like her very much duncan i know now keep him out of it will you so i can make it work keep me out insulted daniel boomed the protest through the room making the few heads left in the lounge turn why you pipsqueak you wouldnt be in it if i hadnt what daniel anna said it sweetly with a soft smile on her face you didnt interfere or meddle again did you ah no i did nothing nothing at all dont know what youre talking about im just saying what im saying he thought it best to retire from the field we should be getting along anna you need your rest ill just finish my wine she lifted her glass shifting in her chair the signal shed worked out earlier with cat taking her cue cat stepped into the key light daniel macgregor i have something for you well what are you doing skulking around then come over here and give it to me it comes from here and from here she added touching a hand to her heart she sang for him the old scottish ballad loch loman because she kept her eyes on him she saw his begin to swim and felt her own sting in response duncan had accepted or nearly that he was in love with her but as he sat there as he saw the softness that came over her as she sang for the man who held such a large piece of his heart he realized hed only been falling up to that point now he tumbled clean it wasnt the jolt hed thought it would be wasnt the shock to the system hed always imagined it was warm and clear with her at the core of it he saw his life change and was scot enough to accept it had been heading there all along now somewhere he had to win her beside him daniel sniffed fumbled for his handkerchief then blew his nose heartily when the song ended now thats a lass he managed thats a fine lass im going to miss you daniel she stepped over to bend and kiss his cheek im really going to miss you there now and to her surprise and weepy pleasure he drew her into his lap to cuddle duncan take a walk with me anna murmured she took his hand drawing him away from the table that girl needs love she said it softly as duncan glanced back at the couple holding each other at the edge of the stage i have it for her i just have to convince her to take it anna squeezed his hand my moneys on you he knew she was tired could see it in her eyes as he walked her to their cabin he doubted she let her emotions tip over and out very often for a woman like cat duncan imagined the experience was exhausting that was a beautiful thing you did for my grandfather im nuts about him seriously nuts about him it frightened her more than a little that shed come to care so much about people who could never be hers id say the feelings mutual if it wasnt for my grandmother and oh close to seventy years of age difference id be worried she laughed settled again and struggled back a yawn i wouldnt be too sure of myself even as things stand she stepped in ahead of him when he unlocked the cabin then blinked in surprise at the glow of candlelight the glint of crystal whats all this blade i thought you might break another rule he moved to the ice bucket took out the chilling bottle champagne she glanced at the label whistled the good stuff too whats the occasion well get to that would you like a glass i could probably choke one down thanks is this why you didnt want me to change after the show so id be dressed for fancy french grapes no i didnt want you to change because i want to undress you eventually he opened the bottle with an expert twist and cheerful pop he poured two flutes handed her one then tapped rims to those amazing pipes of yours she laughed sipped how could i not drink to that were coming up on the last week of your contract she was grateful shed swallowed or she might very well have choked yes i know its been a good run i want to exercise our option her heart began to beat again well i can drink to that too i wanted to talk it over with you before i called your agent i fired my agent so you can deal with me direct fired him duncan pursed his lips then nodded smart move but youll want representation theyre not exactly beating down my door sugar ill get to it when the time comes though id say its come reed valentine would like to schedule a meeting and arrange for a professional demo in studio in new york when it suits you she couldnt feel her hands or her feet she realized dizzily that all she could feel was the sudden ferocious hammering of her heart reed valentine valentine records a meeting with me why suddenly youre full of questions with a laugh he toasted her again yes reed valentine of valentine records wants a meeting with you because he was very favorably impressed with the tape you put together you sent it in you sent it to reed valentine i told you i was going to send it to a connection of mine valentine records now she couldnt feel her own lips but she could feel the abrupt lurch of her stomach i didnt expect i never thought didnt you think i meant it cat i dont play games like that no i dont god i cant breathe she pressed a hand to her chest as if to push out air but couldnt find any i cant get my breath alarmed he reached for her shed gone dead white hey sit down no yes no i need some air she shoved the wineglass into his hand and bolted for the balcony doors her head was light as if shed swallowed the whole bottle of champagne in one gulp she couldnt get her breath because the air was trapped somewhere under her diaphragm she clutched the rail and leaned out staring blindly at the slowmoving river isnt this what you want with her back to him she squeezed her eyes shut felt the tears pressing hot behind her lids my whole life its all ive ever wanted in my whole life just a chance just one chance to prove i could be somebody when her voice broke she bore down hard i need a minute here duncan okay just give me a minute here instead he went to her turned her to face him and saw her eyes were drenched i thought i knew how much it meant to you he said it gently as gently as the hand that brushed the first tears from her cheek i didnt i should have found a better way to tell you no its perfect its fine she was terrified down to the bone of what he was offering of him of everything that was pounding and beating inside her if youd just leave me alone for a minute i need to pull myself together no you dont he gathered her close you need to let yourself go her breath hitched once then shattered on a sob she clung pressing her face into his shoulder holding on to him to the feeling to the gift this is everything to me everything even if they change their minds hate what i do kick me out on my butt this is everything the chance ill never be able to pay you back for it theres nothing to pay back cat its everything she said again and framed his face as she drew back everything im so grateful duncan she let everything she felt pour out into the kiss let me show you cat im not looking for gratitude i have to give it she kissed him again hypnotizing them both let me give it chapter contents prev next shed been like a witch duncan thought casting spells now in the clear light of day he was still weaving under them hed wanted to tell her he loved her wanted to ask her to belong to him but it hadnt seemed fair when shed been riding an emotional roller coaster already he preferred to play fair when possible he could wait until night until the air was soft and quiet and they were alone with the river in any case that would give him several hours to figure out how to tell her what words he should use what tone he wished he could be certain of her but some odds were impossible to figure he imagined the ring hed dashed out that morning to buy after seeing his grandparents off was going to weigh heavily in his pocket all day the best way to make the time pass he decided was to fill it with work cat had prepared all morning had thought it all through there was only one possible answer duncan blade had given her something shed been working for all of her life and hed done it with no strings attached the only way to repay him as far as she could see was to get out of his quickly cleanly no harm no foul she told herself as she climbed the steps to his office her knees were shaking she stopped cursing herself as she steadied herself again as she forced herself to admit she wasnt being noble she was running she couldnt handle what she felt for him why the hell should she have to she didnt know how to be in love shed never be able to make it work never be able to cover her stake if she gambled here smarter to cut if off clean now before she got in any deeper before she started to let herself believe she could be a real part of his life more it would be cowardly to wait another week until the end of her current contract to tell him she was skipping the decent thing the professional thing to do was to give him time to book another act she wasnt going to pay him back by messing up his business or his life it was just her bad luck shed gone and fallen in love with him shed wanted to convince herself it was just gratitude but hadnt even come close she wanted to believe she would survive whole and intact when they parted company but she knew better it was her doing shed opened herself up for it and now she had to pay the price suddenly the thrill of attaining a lifelong dream didnt have quite the shine it should have but cat farrell stood by her word she faced her responsibilities and she handled herself through good times and bad then she stepped to his office and saw him through the window her needy heart collapsed in her chest oh god he was so perfect she thought what had his mother said a beautiful young man in every way it was perfectly true it wasnt just the looks the charm the snazzy clothes he was kind and he was caring he wasnt some kickitup trustfund baby cruising around on his family money he worked and worked hard and had put his personal stamp on every inch of his boat he had integrity he had ambition dangerous duncan heartbreaker she mused youll forget my name before the seasons over she drew in a breath tossed back her hair and sauntered into his office got a minute boss he leaned back set his paperwork aside oh i think i can make one for you howre you feeling im still flying did you see your grandparents off yeah theyre going to spend a day in new orleans then fly to boston to visit my sister and my cousins play with the babies theyll catch up with my uncle caine and aunt diana then grandpa will harass my cousin ian for a while about why hes still single a fine young lawyer like him there was talk about scooting up to maine so the macgregor could devil the campbell side of the family for a bit cats eyes danced it keeps him young then hell forever be eighteen because hes never going to stop familys his heart yes you learned to understand him quickly i learned to love him quickly love all of you love you so much it makes me shake inside i have an invitation she added and worked up a smile an open invitation to visit hyannis port anytime i like ive seen pictures of that castle he built there very cool then well make a point for you to see it in person not until she was certain she could bear it cat thought which would be approximately never she stretched out her legs crossed her ankles and prepared to give the performance of her life i dont want to interrupt your work for long but theres some business we need to talk about fine i was going to catch you later but nows as good a time as any he flipped open a file folder and took out her contract its a standard option clause with a guaranteed fivepercent salary increase when activated everything else remains the same as it did in the original agreement if youre shaky about signing papers without representation we can hook you up with a lawyer here in new orleans or in one of the ports going back to saint louis im not shaky about signing papers duncan i never sign anything without reading it all top to bottom including fine print and bottom line smart then youve already read these but you might want to read them again i dont have to i dont want to sign he held the papers out between them for several long seconds before he lowered them carefully to the desk excuse me i dont want the option enforced im not interested in another run as far as im concerned when we dock in saint louis next weekend im a free agent take off the glasses its bright in here you want to talk business you look me in the eye there she thought was that quick shift in his voice satin to steel because he was right because it was cowardly to hide behind shaded lenses she slipped them off swung them by the earpiece he took his time studying her face looking for the tells every gambler recognizes if she was bluffing he mused she was damn good at it you want to negotiate new terms thats not what i said and i say what i mean she lifted her shoulders let them fall ive got fresh fish to fry sugar and you to thank for it theres no point in me spending another six weeks singing in a riverboat lounge when i could be in new york i see if you read your contract cat youll know that i have a right to exercise this option clause youre obliged to honor it well she hadnt thought hed make it easy had she i hoped youd let me out without a hassle for old times sake hope springs eternal he rose walked to the minifridge and took out a bottle of water for each of them it felt as though someone had opened his chest and given his heart a bareknuckled punch but this is business and has nothing to do with the fact we sleep together want a glass for this she snatched the bottle out of his hand before she could stop herself and the little snip of temper eased one of the knots in his stomach she wasnt quite as cool as she wanted to be what was her angle he wondered what was the deal okay no favors fair enough she took a long drink so sue me lets just see if we can handle this like professionals first he made his voice deliberately snide and watched her color come up nerves he decided feelings they were there so he would use them you want to get to new york and follow through with valentine i cant blame you when we hit saint louis you can go he held up a finger before she could speak ill get an act to fill in for a week then you meet the boat in new orleans and fulfill the rest of your contract everybodys happy i dont like that deal take it or leave it leaving it she said and got to her feet sit down dont tell me what to do business is concluded now its personal and i said sit down she cocked a hip lifted the bottle and watched him steadily as she drank is that what this is about duncan is your ego bruised or something do you really think im going to let you walk out yeah because if you try otherwise ill bruise a hell of a lot more than your ego look its been fun and i owe you a lot but its movingon time and thats what you do best move on yes regret flickered in her eyes before she could stop it sorry ive got to think about number one here but i wont forget you sugar then she made a mistake she flashed a sassy smile and patted his cheek the smile faded quickly when he grabbed her wrist youre trembling sugar no im not she couldnt quite manage to swallow so shrugged instead its cold in here thats all like hell why are you shaking youre hurting me no his fingers barely encircled her wrist im not but youre doing your damnedest to hurt me why i dont want to hurt you duncan emotion had her voice wavering i dont damn it let me go not a chance you want to dump me you want to move on no harm no foul youre a liar and youre not as good at it as id expected you to be i guess you dont have much experience being the dumpee do you his brow lifted ah now there there it is you break it off and run before i can lets just call it even no lets not lets just lay the cards on the table and see what weve been holding i love you and youre going to marry me what if hed dashed the cold contents of the water bottle in her face shed have been less shocked what are you crazy youre exactly what i want exactly what ill have so get used to it the hell with that who the hell do you i cant get my breath struggling for air she rapped her fist between her breasts damn it funny you had the same reaction last night when i told you about valentine something you claimed to have wanted your entire life he took a step closer while she panted see something else you want cat no get away from me youre a lunatic i need air youre not going anywhere he took her arm and pushed her into a chair we have a tradition in my family out of his pocket he took a coin heads you marry me tails you walk oh sure oh right thoroughly dizzy now she dropped her head between her knees agreed then i did not her head shot back up just as he flipped the coin he snagged it and watching her slapped it onto the back of his hand heads i win you want a big splashy wedding or something quieter she stayed exactly where she was she had her breath back now and the blood was no longer pounding in her head he was angry she could see that beyond the cocky gotohell grin was pure temper duncan sensible people dont decide to get married on the toss of a coin my parents did and so will we you dont plan to welsh on a bet i dont make bets as a rule he finished then putting his hands on either arm of the chair to cage her he leaned down i love you get out she managed but weakly i love you he repeated thats it for me i always knew it would be time place the woman when it hit itd be over for me its over for me catherine mary youre the one now tell me you dont love me i dont dont what oh get out of my face how the hell am i supposed to think with you pushing at me just say it he murmured and brushed his lips over hers and make me believe it it cant work thats not what i asked you i was doing you a favor thanks now tell me back off duncan youre crowding me he smiled stepped back because hed already seen the answer in her eyes okay on your feet is more your style because it was she rose i want my career so do i he meant it she could see it somehow a miracle had happened and the single thing shed dreamed of was as important to him and so was she that she realized was beyond miraculous she jammed her hands in her pockets i dont need any house in the burbs or a white picket fence please that image has always petrified me it made her laugh one quick gulp then she let out a breath do you mean it absolutely i used to have nightmares about white picket fences duncan at a loss she pressed her fingers to her eyes im trying to be straight with you she dropped her hands looked into his eyes and everything she wanted was right there i need you to be straight with me because you can do more than break my heart you can shatter it tenderness welled up inside him i told you ill never hurt you i keep my word she took a breath found it came easier youre sure this is what you want dead sure he took the ring box out of his pocket guess what ive got here oh god you work fast she glanced down at her hands my palms are sweating only happens when im really nervous absently she rubbed them on her shorts okay sugar you asked for it just remember i gave you every chance i love you and thats it for me too i guess i started heading that way when you tried to roust me at the gangplank you looked so sexy and dangerous funny i was thinking the same thing about you nobodys ever gotten inside me this way ive never wanted anyone else inside me this way then were starting on even ground he took her hand again opened the box oh man you could put someones eye out with that he roared with laughter swung her into his arms for a kiss that left them both giddy want to bet it fits for a moment she just pressed her cheek to his my god she thought he wanted her for keeps im not betting against the house again grinning he took the squarecut citrine out of the box and slipped it on her finger smart move he lifted her hand pressed his lips just above the ring deal looks like she brought their joined hands to her own lips in turn hers she thought for keeps but i want to see that coin he cocked a brow flipped the coin through the fingers of his free hand and vanished it what coin from the private memoirs of daniel duncan macgregor there are moments that etch themselves into a mans memory like a fine diamond cuts into clear glass the first time he loves a woman and the first time he sees the woman he will always love the moment his child taken from his mothers womb is placed yowling with life into his hands and the many moments of that childs life that fill his own with joys and sorrows with laughter and tears there are moments etched in my memory too many to count too few to take for granted and all of them cherished another moment joined them recently i watched a lass ive come to love as much as my own stand in the gardens of the home i built with my anna and there on a fine day in the last winds of summer she joined hands with my grandson duncan to become his to become ours and when the vows were taken and the first kiss shared as man and wife didnt she walk straight to me and whisper in my ear thank you mr macg for thats what she likes to call me thank you said she for picking me for him well now i ask you is that a lass not that i did it for thanks but by god its nice to have your thought and care be appreciated from time to time what sons and daughters that pair will make between them not that theres any hurry mind though anna of course is fretting already that theyll be slow about it but well then weve done what we can to set them on the right road now im watching from my window here with the last of annas roses clinging to their stems and waiting to be whipped away by the coming autumn winds time passes no matter how we wish it might stand still for a bit so its not to be wasted is it ive more grandchildren yet who need a bit of direction a wee bit of a nudge so to speak though wed best not speak of it as anna was in a lecturing mode not long ago when i just happened to mention in passing that our young ian was of an age to be thinking about his future boys a lawyer now seems like yesterday he was toddling along in the parlor and wanting to get his hands on his grannys good crystal vase always had an eye for pretty things did our ian well ive found him a pretty one one i think will suit his sweet nature and soft heart the lad wants family make no mistake hasnt he just bought himself a house what does a man buy a house for if it isnt to fill it with family fine enough if he starts with furniture and doodads and the things that content a man to have about him but its family that makes a home hasnt it made mine and its the least i can do for a beloved grandchild give him the direction he needs to go and make his own and the devil i say to those who claim different part three ian chapter contents prev next sometimes ian thought there just werent enough hours in the day he hated to rush whether it was business pleasure or life in general but he had to admit that lately it seemed like hed been doing nothing but tearing around which included pushing his way through the mad maze of boston traffic at peak rush hour one more stop he told himself then he could go home his new home just the thought of the elegant old house tucked behind dignified old maples made him smile and ignore the rude blast of a horn as traffic snarled hed had two months to enjoy it to scout antique shops and kitchensupply departments in order to outfit each room exactly the way he wanted and every time he slipped the key into the lock and walked into the gracious entry with its deep green walls and golden floors he was thrilled his days of college dorms and noisy apartment life were over it wasnt that he didnt like company or having people underfoot hed come from too large a family not to appreciate the confusion the clash of personalities the entertainment that came with crowds but hed wanted his own place needed his own place and he still blessed his cousin julia for helping him find the perfect house in the perfect place old and established was what hed wanted and thats what hed gotten dignity and style and character he supposed the need for such things ran with the macgregor blood hed grown up with dignity style and character both at home and at work the law offices of macgregor and macgregor stood for all three as did his parents his grandparents and all the family that sprawled from them now along with his parents and his sister he was part of that respected law firm he intended to make his mark there to uphold those traditions and perhaps in time to follow the path of his father and uncle to washington the press occasionally hinted that ian macgregor was being groomed for politics they said he had the family lineage what with his father having served as attorney general and his uncle as the commanderinchief he had the looks the gilt hair the steady blue eyes the strong features and firm mouth that made women sigh and men trust the tabloids had once had a field day with a shot of him wearing nothing but a pair of bathing trunks while sailing on the charles the result had been a huge increase in tabloid sales and the title of harvard hunk which had stuck much to ians consternation and his familys amusement hed handled it with humor what choice did he have and had thumbed his nose at those who said he was just another pretty boy by graduating magna cum laude holding steady in the top five percent of his graduating class and passing his bar on the first run ian macgregor hit what he aimed for and hed aimed for the law as long as he could remember but honors and lauds aside he was the youngest member of the firm and as such was often reduced to the position of errand boy his current assignment was little more ian circled scanning for a parking place without much hope he settled for one six blocks from his objective and thought he might as well have driven home and walked from there still he took his briefcase and relaxed enough to windowshop in the artful storefronts on the way up to brightstones it was balmy early autumn perfect new england weather with the trees just beginning to hint at the wild color to come in the evening light of a slowly deepening sky when he got home he promised himself he was going to take a glass of wine sit on his back porch and survey his kingdom with his topcoat flapping in the steady breeze he paused outside of brightstones and studied the sturdy old building of weathered red brick it was an institution in boston one he regretted not having had the time to explore in the last couple of years but now that he lived fairly nearby he thought he would find opportunities to wander in stroll through the stacks the aisles the towers of books brightstones was books in boston he remembered holding his mothers hand when shed shopped there in his childhood then tucking himself into the childrens corner with picture books the staff had always been helpful and unobtrusive the mood serene the stock expansive and remembering the contented hours hed experienced inside he thought it might be a fine idea to turn one of his spare rooms into a library he stepped inside pleased to see the familiar soaring ceilings with their fussy cornices the polished gleam of chestnut floors the grand sweep of books the second floor as he recalled would be histories biographies local interest local authors and the third a treasure trove of rare books as he scanned he noted that business was good which surprised him a little a year or so before hed read that the old boston institution was in serious trouble and apparently unable to compete with the malls or superstores but there were a number of customers browsing the shelves more at the graceful old counter making purchases and a scattering of others settled into the inviting seating arrangements tucked here and there that was new wasnt it he wondered those cushy chairs and thick old tables he saw too a little cafe had been added to the rear up a short flight of steps where he remembered towering shelves and the music playing quietly in the background wasnt the stern classical tunes he remembered but something light with harps and flutes interested he wandered through noting the childrens corner remained as it had but a basket of bright plastic toys and charming posters of fairy tale scenes had been added and here a display of eyecatching bookmarks reading lamps paperweights and a variety of gifts suitable for a book lover as he wound his way through the seductive scent of coffee reached out and hooked him smart very smart he decided it would take a strong will to walk out without a sample and without a purchase telling himself he didnt have time for either he headed to the checkout area and snagged the attention of a clerk im looking for naomi brightstone im ian macgregor shes expecting me ms brightstones in her office on the second floor would you like me to send for her wellmannered efficient staff were obviously still the order of the day ian smiled shook his head no thanks ill go up ill let her know youre on your way mr macgregor appreciate it he started up the sharply angled stairs and had a sudden vivid flash of his mother grinning down at him and telling him theyd go for ice cream if he was very patient while she finished shopping rocky road he murmured hed always gone for rocky road and his mother had always held his hand firmly in hers when theyd crossed the street to order cones good memory he decided then noted that the second floor was no longer dim and intimidating he didnt think it was only because now he was six feet tall rather than three lights had been added and the shelves had changed from dark brown to a honeytoned wood there was a pair of long sturdy tables lined with chairs creating a kind of study area it was being used by what looked to be a highschool couple more interested in each other than the books opened in front of them now that he thought of it he had some fine memories of study dates as well in the lessatmospheric corners of his school library something else there didnt seem to be enough hours in the day for just now he mused not the studying god knew but the dating he was going to have to get back in the swim before too long he missed women mr macgregor he turned and watched the woman approach she was a tidy little package he concluded bandbox neat in her smart red suit and practical heels her hair was glossy black subdued into a thick braid that hung down her back and left her quietly pretty face unframed her lips were full with just the slightest hint of overbite and painted to match the suit simple gold hoops swung at her ears and the hand she offered him was narrow and unadorned ms brightstone yes she smiled im sorry i wasnt downstairs when you got here i wasnt able to be firm on the time its not a problem let me show you to my office can i get you something coffee cappuccino is that cappuccino as good as it smells this time the smile reached her clear gray eyes its better especially if you add one of our hazelnut biscotti on the side sold you wont be sorry she led the way back through the stacks to a door over the cafe ill have someone bring it up please excuse the confusion she said skirting around a stepladder and painting supplies we havent quite finished our facelift i noticed the changes very nice thank you she glanced back and opened another door were getting very positive feedback her office had the feel of recent remodeling the walls were a soft pearly white accented with boston street scenes done in soft misty colors the gleaming cherry desk was tidy suiting her size and style she gestured to one of a pair of cheerful striped chairs let me just call for the coffee he took a seat and the time to study her he knew from the paperwork in his briefcase that she was the daughter of the owners making her in his calculations the fourth generation of brightstone books hed expected her to be older starchier he realized but pegged her in her early twenties efficient but stylish and built he added as he noted just how nicely the red suit showed off her curves when she hung up the phone she took the seat across from him folded her hands in her lap itll be right up i want to thank you for agreeing to meet me here the stores taking all my time these days her voice he noted was as clear and quiet as her eyes i know the feeling and im happy to oblige youre on my way home anyway thats handy then your secretary said you had the papers for me to look over and sign the partnership agreement yes pretty standard and i think we have everything detailed the way your father outlined curious he opened his briefcase stalling as he flipped through papers can i assume your fathers retiring more or less he and my mother want to spend more time in their winter home in arizona perhaps relocate there permanently my brother and his family already have and you dont have any yen to go west no boston is mine and so she thought with a little flutter of the heart was brightstones or it would be ive been taking on more responsibility for the store over the last eighteen months the changes your idea yes ones shed fought for tooth and nail the market changes customer demands and expectations change it was time to catch up she rose at the knock on the door and taking a tray from the boy delivering the coffee murmured her thanks the cafe for one she continued setting the tray on the desk and offering ian his frothy coffee in an oversize cup and saucer its the type of service that people want in a bookstore today they no longer simply come for books but for the atmosphere a meeting place a center she smiled again as she sat with her own cup and great coffee well i can vouch for the last of that ian said after a sip its great coffee and as ive gone over your files your numbers the profitandloss statements and so forth it appears your alterations are working we increased sales by fifteen percent in the last nine months she wouldnt think just yet about what it had cost to make those changes that had helped generate those increases i estimate well be up another fifteen within the next six i always loved to come here as a kid and have you been a customer of brightstones within the last year he shook his head got me but i will be he set the coffee on the little table between them then passed her the papers youll want to look these over ill answer any questions you might have thank you she retrieved a pair of wirerim reading glasses from the desk the minute she put them on ian experienced a slow inevitable meltdown women in glasses drove him crazy he rolled his eyes picked up his coffee and told himself to get a grip she was a client whose sober and intelligent gray eyes looked fabulous behind those lenses then there was that hotly painted and sexily flawed mouth the lushly curved body in the trim nearly military style suit sensible shoes great legs all that stopandgo in one package would drive a saint crazy he comforted himself and the macgregors werent known for being saints still he gave his coffee his attention and tried not to think that the thick neat braid and the subtle allfemale perfume was just one more combo to add to the whole besides what was the harm in asking her out to dinner no lunch he decided lunch was definitely better more businesslike they could have lunch a very casual perfectly acceptable lunch where he wouldnt give a single thought to nibbling on her neck to see if that was where her scent was warmest her nails were short rounded and unpainted she wasnt wearing a ring so he hoped that meant she was unattached he sat waiting while she read and planning exactly how to broach the subject of a nice little lunch later in the week naomi read every line then allowed herself a long quiet breath it was a momentous event for her what these coolly legal papers symbolized if shed been alone she might have clutched them to her breast and wept or shouted with joy but as she wasnt she laid them on the desk slipped off her glasses everything appears to be in order questions no i understand them i minored in business law well then you can sign them now if youre satisfied youll need a witness then ill send them to your parents in scottsdale once theyre signed and sealed its a done deal ill just get my assistant five minutes later naomi held out a steady hand thanks so much for taking care of this for us happy to help listen i have a list here my grandfather youve met him yes many times her eyes warmed again the hot red mouth curved softly he and your grandmother often come in when theyre in boston a couple of first editions hes after he asked if youd see what you could do since i was coming in id be glad to well go up to the third floor and if we dont have what hes looking for well do a search terrific she stepped forward and he stayed where he was when her gaze flicked up to his held he smiled slow and easy you smell fabulous oh her gaze dropped as warm color surged to her cheeks the hands that had been calm and graceful fluttered once then linked together and she visibly shrank back and into herself thank you its ah new that is i just well she said despising herself we should go up hell he thought as he opened the door and let her scramble out ahead of him blew that one macgregor chapter contents prev next as far as naomi was concerned the grand canyon wasnt a big enough hole to fall into only the fact that she was surrounded by books always a comfort and performing a set task had kept her from losing it until ian was gone after shed located two of the books on his list and agreed to start a search for the third shed formally shaken his hand thanked him again and politely seen him downstairs then shed walked back to her office quietly shut the door and laid her head down on the desk moron idiot would she always turn into a babbling fool when an attractive man so much as hinted at a personal interest wasnt that supposed to be one of the benefits in the changes shed made in herself the transformation from the pudgy awkward and dowdy girl to the sleek stylish and confident woman the one whod made a fool of herself because ian macgregor had complimented her perfume a full week later and she still wasnt over it shed found the book it sat on her desk neatly wrapped ready for delivery or pickup shed yet to work up the courage to lift the phone and tell ian his order was now in stock moron she thought again idiot after all the work shed done all the effort shed put in brightstones wasnt the only project shed taken on with a vengeance naomi had systematically and effortfully given herself a facelift over the past year not just the weight loss which had started when shed finally convinced herself to stop feeding her shyness her social clumsiness and her dissatisfaction with her selfimage by going on eating binges and had begun a search for the woman inside a woman shed found she could like and respect a reasonable diet healthy exercise had become habit once shed understood that all shed been doing through her miserable teenage years had been hiding it wasnt just her wardrobe she thought mentally reviewing the process though it had taken her months to finally cull the dowdy out of her closet and replace it with flattering and attractive styles incorporating color for a change she reflected sighing as she looked down at her new teal suit gone were the days of sensible navy unobtrusive brown and selfeffacing gray of boxy styles and baggy jackets but that was just surface she mused just like the cosmetics shed carefully learned to select and apply she no longer faded back into crowds shed taught herself how to present a reasonably attractive competent and professional appearance and she had for the most part managed the metamorphosis from socially awkward to socially adept on the inside as well she wouldnt allow herself to be shy to hide in corners to avoid people as shed done most of her life simply because she couldnt be as beautiful or sophisticated as her mother as outgoing and confident as her brother brightstones required a savvy personable manager and she had become one and shed been doing so well she thought in despair shed been so proud of herself look how nicely shed been handling that oneonone meeting with ian macgregor who was she mused just the kind of man who usually tied her tongue into slippery tangled knots before she managed to say hello the harvard hunk oh yes he definitely rated the title she thought he was so handsome so smooth and when he smiled well she doubted hers was the only womans heart that beat a bit faster but shed been fine theyd shared coffee had conversation done business then hed given her one quick casual personal compliment and shed babbled like a fool stuttered blushed for lords sake and all because hed commented on her new perfume and why do you wear perfume naomi she asked herself viciously you wear it so people notice you so that you feel both feminine and confident a man like him she mused with his looks his background his charm would be well skilled at offering casually flattering comments to women and would expect them to respond in an easy sophisticated or perhaps liberally flirtatious manner all shed done was blush and stutter she could only imagine that ian had laughed about her ridiculous and juvenile reaction all the way home or worse much worse hed felt sorry for her even the thought of it made her wince shed spent too many years of her life being the object of amusement or pity even from her family though they had always loved her but when you were the lone duckling in a family of swans you knew it just as she knew how pleased they all were that shed finally begun to make an effort to present a more polished exterior why her mother had been almost giddy when naomi had asked her for opinions on fashion on cut and color just before theyd left for arizona her father had given her his usual bear hug but this time instead of calling her his sweet girl as was his habit hed called her his pretty girl it had made her feel foolishly naomi was sure like a princess theyd trusted her with brightstones because they knew she had brains knew she would work until she dropped and because shed fought a long difficult battle to win them over to her side her father hadnt wanted to make the changes shed outlined he hadnt wanted to go to the expense or take the financial risk hed wanted quite reasonably naomi mused to retire and let the store something that had been as much burden as livelihood slide quietly into oblivion but she loved it so much and she needed it it had been her refuge her joy her heart as long as she could remember in the end her family had understood that and had trusted her she wasnt going to let them down and she wasnt she thought now going to let herself down either brooding and moaning over one small stumble with ian wasnt going to change anything likely hed already forgotten it and her in order for her to forget it and continue on her quest to become who she wanted to be she had to face it face him she picked up the book on her desk and headed for the door barely stopping herself from chewing on her lipstick she wouldnt call she decided shed deliver the book personally when naomi walked into the lovely old twostory brownstone that held the law offices of macgregor and macgregor she told herself she was perfectly under control shed taken the time to freshen her lipstick in the car because she had indeed chewed it off and shed taken those ten calming breaths she found settled her nerves her problem she admitted was her own reaction to him a reaction that had slammed into her the minute shed seen him standing on the second level at brightstones smiling at the teenagers in the study area it had been a similar reaction to ones shed often experienced in the past whenever she saw something particularly beautiful desirable and completely out of her reach a kind of low and liquid yearning but shed gotten herself under control now by reminding herself often that all ian macgregor was interested in was business she gave herself a booster shot of that advice as she crossed the beautifully appointed reception area decorated in pale greens and creamy whites with a low fire crackling in a hearth that was framed by a mantelpiece of roseveined marble class she thought tradition they were qualities in business and family she appreciated and understood very well she smiled at the woman manning the gorgeous satinwood desk good afternoon may i help you im naomi brightstone i have she broke off as a gorgeous whirlwind burst through the door i won justice once more triumphs and the world is safe for our children the woman a staggeringly lovely brunette in a plumcolored suit flashed naomi a dazzling smile sorry were usually more dignified around here im laura cameron im naomi brightstone and congratulations thanks are you waiting brightstone the bookstore yes thats right oh i love that place always have laura tucked up a strand of hair that had escaped her sleek coil on her dash inside and the new cafe is fabulous the quivers in naomis stomach smoothed out thank you were very proud of it were handling something for you arent we or rather ians handling something for you yes i just dropped by to im his sister yes i know your grandfather wanted a book she lifted the small shopping bag i had some errands out this way and thought id bring it by oh do you want me to take it or did you want to see ian well i she felt herself begin to fumble then was both embarrassed and relieved when the cell phone in her purse rang isnt that the silliest thing she said with a laugh it always gives me a jolt excuse me a moment she reached in her purse drew out the trim little phone and engaged hello naomi ian macgregor oh she felt the blood rush to her cheeks how odd what i mean im just i have the book you wanted i was just great well kill two birds your papers are in i wanted you to know ill be filing them this afternoon i can swing by and pick up the book after im done at the courthouse actually thats not necessary you see its no trouble on my way home remember yes i remember but im downstairs where here he let out a quick delighted laugh stay he ordered and clicked off leaving naomi staring bemusedly at her phone that was your brother yes laura grinned so i gathered the wonders of technology she murmured and wondered just what that sudden rush of color into naomis cheek signified ian came down the steps at a jog oh yeah he thought she looked every bit as good as he remembered he held out a hand noted she was still holding the phone and flashed that grin you can hang up now oh yes i suppose i can brilliant naomi why dont you just let your tongue fall out and swoon at his feet while youre at it i was just running some errands so i thought id bring mr macgregors book by great come on up i dont want to interrupt your work youre not especially he glanced at his sister lifted his eyebrows well slam dunk way to go champ he gave laura a light punch on the arm that naomi recognized as brotherly affection you can give me the playbyplay later he took naomis arm and began to steer her toward the stairs you must be busy she began the scenario shed worked out in her head hadnt included a trip into his office ive got a few minutes it didnt take you long to come up with the book we have a number of excellent sources the price was within the range i quoted you the upper range im afraid he wants it ian said simply and guiding her down a hallway wainscoted in silky mahogany gave the arm he held a little squeeze she still smelled fabulous he mused but he was going to be careful not to mention it and put her off again have a seat he told her his office suited the mood of the old town house if she wasnt mistaken the desk under the stacks of files and spiffy computer was chippendale and the carpet over the lovely hardwood floor a bristol oak file cabinets lined one wall shelves of books another the window with its carved trim looked out on the street where lovely trees were just beginning to burn with fall color seeing no polite escape she sat in one of the burgundy leather chairs its a beautiful building my father bought it before my parents were married he was still working on some of the rehab when my mother took an office here he wanted then they wanted the law housed somewhere with character and warmth they certainly succeeded how about coffee not that what i can serve you will come close to what you gave me no no im fine i really should ill be filing the papers he began no way he thought was he letting her rush off before hed had a chance to make up for his blunder he sat not behind the desk as shed expected but in the chair beside her i have copies for you he continued but the originals will be in the courthouse its not absolutely official until ive filed them but essentially youre now a full partner vice president of brightstone books with full executive power and authority congratulations she opened her mouth to thank him politely then couldnt form a single word as emotion filled her throat all she could do was shut her eyes okay he said gently she nodded her head pressed her fingers to her lips until the first edge of the joys and fears had receded yes sorry dont be he took her hand before he thought about it she looked so thrilled and terrified its a big moment the biggest i thought i was prepared i am she corrected i am prepared to do the job but its just hearing it knowing its real is a little overwhelming thank you so much she managed a laugh im glad i was sitting down i know how it feels like the day i walked into this office sat down at that desk and knew i was a part of what was most important to me i sat there must have been an hour just grinning euphoria and terror exactly her hand relaxed in his its awesome isnt it to be the next step in a long flight of family tradition it certainly is what are you going to do to celebrate celebrate her mind went blank i suppose ill get back to work not nearly good enough how about dinner dinner yes ill fix something when i get home he stared at her a moment then shook his head okay he decided no subtleties naomi id like to take you out to dinner tonight if you dont have any plans oh well plans no not really urn oh please please her mind screamed dont babble you dont have to feel obliged to let me put this another way he said fascinated by the way warm color rose to her cheeks will you go to dinner with me tonight ah yes thank you that would be nice good seven work for you seven yes thats fine should i pick you up at the store or your apartment the my apartment ill give you the address i have it from your file oh yes of course idiot its not far from the store i can walk to work every day i like the neighborhood shut up shut up and get out before you make a total fool of yourself i should get back she got to her feet jerking to a stop when she realized her hand was still caught in his to work at the store her eyes were huge lovely and for reasons that baffled him full of nerves are you okay yes fine just fine thank you ill walk you down no no dont bother desperate now she tugged her hand free i know the way naomi he said before she could get out the door hmm the book book oh cursing herself she turned back and handed him the bag she still carried silly of me i forgot all about it well goodbye see you tonight yes tonight she managed and escaped ian slipped his hands into his pockets and rocked back on his heels funny he mused she hadnt struck him as a scatterbrain he supposed the finality of the partnership agreement had muddled her mind or he considered he made her nervous now wouldnt that be a nice little side benefit he wouldnt mind making the pretty and efficient naomi brightstone nervous not a bit strolling over to the desk he buzzed his secretary and asked her to make reservations for dinner for two at rinaldos at seventhirty then tucking the paperwork into his briefcase he headed out to the courthouse whistling on the way he couldnt remember ever looking forward to an evening more chapter contents prev next ian was just knotting his tie when the phone rang he ignored it not wanting to take time for conversation he still had to go by the florists on the way to naomis apartment but when he heard why the devil arent you home delivered in a booming voice rich with a scottish burr he grinned and snatched up his portable well i am home but not for long cant any one of my grandchildren stay put daniel demanded gallivanters the lot of you your grandmother doesnt get a moments peace worrying over you oh ian stuck his tongue in his cheek i thought she worried i never got out always had my nose in a law book that too daniel said without missing a beat the woman frets night and day when are you coming out to see her grandpa i was there last month for duncans wedding remember so that was last month wasnt it whats wrong with this month not a thing ill come out soon see that you do do you think i want your granny nagging me half to death now what are you up to im up to going to dinner with a pretty woman thanks to you me me why i havent done a bloody thing dont you be telling your grandmother i have either all i did relax ian said with a laugh i wasnt accusing you of meddling its just a happy coincidence you asked me to have brightstones find your books while i was there for my meeting with naomi and what if i did a mans entitled to his books isnt he yes grandpa ian raised his eyes heavenward naomi dropped the walter scott off at my office today right after her paperwork came through so instead of the phone call the papers would have generated your book got me another personal meeting and i asked her out so thanks ah well then in his office in hyannis port daniel grinned like a maniac the boy was sharp he thought but not quite sharp enough to match his grandpa hah thats fine shes a nice young woman little naomi got manners got brains its just dinner grandpa dont get started started on what im only saying its fine youre having dinner with a nice young woman whats wrong with that id like to know nothing not a thing ian glanced at his watch and ive got to go or ill be late then what are you dawdling for on your way lad and call your grandmother before she pines down to the bones daniel hung up then rubbed his hands together well he thought that was easy naomi agonized over what to wear then went through another period of misery over what to do with her hair in the end she settled on a simple black dress with a scooped neck snug sleeves and straight skirt and left her hair loose she thought hoped it looked sophisticated and just casual enough to indicate she hadnt agonized she added her grandmothers triple strand of pearls slid her feet into high black heels that would cause her feet great distress before the evening was over but made her feel powerful then spritzed on the scent that ian had complimented there she said to her reflection youre fine youre ready and you will not be stupid a very nice man is being considerate enough to take you out to dinner to celebrate an important moment in your life thats all there is to it oh god she said when she heard the knock on her door all right okay and closing her eyes she took those habitual ten steadying breaths she was steady and smiling when she opened the door and if her heart sighed at the sight of him handsome as a fairy tale prince she managed to maintain her composure how lovely thanks you too she laughed and didnt feel so foolish i meant the flowers oh these he glanced down at the spray of pink roses i guess you want them yes i do she gathered them into her arms come in ill put them in a vase just make yourself comfortable it would be easy he decided her living space was attractive efficient and simple like her office he thought like her he approved of the strong colors deep greens and mauves the traditional lines of queen anne and chippendale the femininity of the accent pieces and the art she came back with the flowers pleased that though they were the first given to her by a man who wasnt a family member shed only mooned and fluttered over them for a moment later she promised herself she would spend all the time she wanted mooning and fluttering they really are lovely thank you so are you and youre welcome i like your space oh grateful her hands didnt bobble the vase as she set it on a table she straightened i wanted something close to work and i dont need a lot of room i know one of the newer complexes might have been more convenient but i love old buildings all their eccentricities so do i i just bought a house a few months ago the floors creak the plumbing rattles and the cellars damp as a tomb i love it sounds like the one i grew up in i still cant drive by it without getting sentimental would you like a drink before we go no thanks youll need a wrap its getting breezy i have one she turned and opened the closet off the short hallway testing ian stepped up behind her she was just congratulating herself for behaving normally when she turned bumped into him jerked back as if her heels had become springs and all but fell into the closet he took her arms to steady her smiled slowly oh yeah he thought he made her plenty nervous and wasnt that delightful sorry he lied without a qualm didnt mean to startle you i didnt realize you were behind me i was just getting my coat she yanked it up between them and very nearly rapped him in the chin so i see he took it from her why dont i just help you on with it she doubted sincerely that the heart was designed to pound quite this hard she despised the clumsiness berated herself for it then remembered that there would have been a time when shed have sought comfort against the embarrassment in a jumbo bag of potato chips now she turned ordering herself to breathe as he slipped the coat on for her with more speed than grace she ducked away grabbed her purse shall we go it was easier in the restaurant with the soft glow of candlelight and the silky taste of good wine he was wonderful to talk to to listen to and she was quietly amazed they shared so many interests i like the spirit and the charm of traditional music she said thats why i like it playing in the store it think it lifts the customers moods without being intrusive did you make the celtic festival last summer i spent nearly an entire day there me too he offered her a bite of his grilled portabello mushroom wonderful music and the dancers amazing i love to watch the steptoe dancers without thinking she leaned forward to take the offered bite from his fork isnt it odd how something that disciplined and precise can be sexy too mmm she swallowed thats very good want some more no im fine just a weakness for italian food me too i make a pretty terrific chicken picata you like to cook she tried to imagine him puttering around in the kitchen then decided not to risk the rise in her blood pressure so do i and id put my clam sauce against your picata any day well have to have a cookoff when she only smiled vaguely he warned himself not to move too fast his grandfather wasnt the only macgregor who could scheme he thought and he already had a plan in mind actually naomi i have a little business proposition for you business she gave him a blank look as their appetizer plates were removed and the entrees served one i hope will be as much a pleasure for you as it will be for me i want to remodel one of my spare rooms into a library i have a design in mind that i wanted you to look at and offer suggestions on then id hoped you could give me some help with setting up my collection yes of course she fought off a wave of disappointment telling herself it was better this way of course he was interested in her on a professional level what else could she expect youre interested in rare books for investment purposes no not necessarily i want a library not a museum i want a comfortable room and i want the books varied i dont want anyone to feel as if they should sign a waiver if they take a book off the shelf id want to start with my personal favorites most of which i own already then im willing to explore id love to help you if you could give me a list of what you have and what youre looking for we can start there great can you make time to look at my space and review the design all right let me know when it fits into your schedule how about saturday say six she was too surprised and too dazzled by his smile to do anything more than nod the wind was up when he pulled in front of her apartment building rustling energetically through the trees moonlight splattered over the streets and sidewalks and the music hed tuned in on the radio was quiet and dreamy it was to his mind a perfect evening the subtle fragrance she wore drifted through the closed car shed relaxed again he thought becoming particularly animated and easy when theyd continued to discuss books he had to congratulate himself on finding the perfect ploy not that it was precisely a ploy he corrected he wanted the library after all and she was the logical source for the books he believed strongly in enlisting experts it was just a delightful side benefit that she was a lovely woman who stirred his interest on more basic levels and if he wasnt mistaken he stirred hers as well this was wonderful she turned absently brushing the heavy fall of hair back from her face thanks for helping me celebrate my pleasure he slipped out of the car rounding the hood to open her door she didnt fumble with her seat belt but it was a close thing before she could tell him there was no need to walk her to her door hed taken her hand not her arm naomi thought with sudden skittering panic but her hand he was holding her hand as they walked and that was more personal more intimate was she supposed to ask him in impossible out of the question she hadnt figured it into her evening plans so wasnt prepared for it and was bound to do something humiliating i imagine you want to get an early start tomorrow he commented as they stepped inside the building foyer your first full day as partner yes she nearly dissolved in relief at the lifeline hed tossed her i do theres a staff meeting and i have to discuss a new authorsigning policy with my events coordinator were holding our first childrens story hour of the fall on saturday not just selling books is it idly he rubbed his thumb over her wrist and found to his pleasure that her pulse was rabbiting no her pulse had nothing on her stomach as they climbed the stairs to her door its a good bookstore needs to be a community center i want we want to be able to offer services and events that interest all age groups well she turned at the door startled when he took her other hand and held her there and were sponsoring three different reading clubs they hold regular monthly meetings in the in the what the hell was it called cafe she said on an explosion of breath she tugged one of her hands free yanked her purse from under her arm with some notion of digging out her keys so well thank you for a lovely dinner she dropped the keys nearly bumped heads with him as they both bent to retrieve them then jerked up straight as a flagpole ian debated a moment then handing her the keys took her face in his hands to hold her in place lets try it this way he murmured and laid his lips gently on hers she didnt move a muscle which made him wonder if hed misread that tangle of signals then her lips parted under his on a sharp intake of breath and he couldnt resist his hands slid into that thick stream of hair a low hum of pleasure sounded in his throat as he skimmed his tongue over hers drew her closer the world had been none too steady under her feet in any case now with his mouth moving warm and easy over hers it just dropped away the keys slipped out of her hands for a second time landing with a musical crash as her fingers clutched at his arms curled into his coat then slowly swaying she leaned into him rainbows misty at the edges circled in her head he drew back watched those heavy gray eyes blurred now flutter open watched that mouth with its seductive heavy top lip tremble on an unsteady breath he skimmed his hands down to her shoulders and felt her shudder i have to do that again oh well she stared at him so obviously staggered he smiled all right his mouth took hers again a little deeper now a little hotter he felt the same sharp stab of desire hed experienced with the first taste she gave a sexy little sigh that had his blood simmering he steeped himself in the taste of her surrendered to that singular scent that had teased his senses since the moment hed met her she clouded his brain the hesitant brush of her fingers on the back of his neck the slow yielding of her mouth under his rattled him well aware that he was close to asking for more he drew back saying nothing he bent down to pick up her keys then unlocked the door for her good night naomi with his eyes on hers he pressed the keys into her hand yes good night thanks she all but staggered into the apartment and without turning shut the door in his face he stood there a moment wondering if hed made a mistake by kissing her or had made one in stopping then he heard it the musical clink of her keys hitting the floor yet again grinning widely he strolled away no mistake either way he decided and he planned on kissing the very interesting miss brightstone again very soon chapter contents prev next dont you have any chocolate as he stirred his pot of red sauce ian glanced back over his shoulder at his cousin julia she was he thought as pretty as ever impatient as always and grandly pregnant you ate it all the last time you were here eyes sharp julia continued to root through his cupboards you could go to the store now and again couldnt you theres fresh fruit in the fridge but unfortunately its not chocolate covered here he gestured her over with a jerk of his head and held a hand under the bowl of a wooden spoon try this deciding beggars couldnt be choosers julia walked over and resting a hand on the wide shelf of her belly sampled the sauce he offered its good wheres dessert he laughed and set the spoon aside doesnt cullum ever feed you its not me butch here wants chocolate she patted her swollen belly im just the delivery chute not even a candy bar sorry ill stock up with travis it was ice cream wasnt it gallons as i recall he still loves ice cream she said with a soft maternal smile his first words were fudge ripple when ian laughed again she cocked her head youre in a pretty chipper mood pal theres a woman yeah thats the usual answer brightstone thats the one shell be here shortly so cullum and travis will be along to pick me up i wont cramp your style wheres the final design for the library upstairs i was looking at it last night well lets go get it i appreciate it jules he swung a friendly arm around her shoulders as they headed down the hallway to the front stairs between you and cullum this house has really come together you havent exactly stood around with your hands in your pockets youve done a nice job here ian i know a lot of people think that its impractical for a single guy to tie himself up with a big old house like this but not you theres nothing like a house the possibilities within that structure and what you make of them she ran her fingers over the newel post of the silky oak banister this place feels like you open easy sturdy with one eye on the future and the other on the past then she sighed and i dont think im walking up those steps id have to walk down again and im having a little trouble seeing my feet these days ill bring the design down why dont you go sit in the parlor dont need to sit she pressed a hand to the small of her back to relieve some of the pressure need chocolate next time i swear while he headed up julia wandered shed been perfectly sincere when shed said the house felt like her cousin it pleased her that shed helped him find it had been able to watch him fall in love with it and that she and cullum had been able to add their expertise and experience in rehab to make it home for him ian she knew needed home easy butch she murmured rubbing her side as the baby inside her kicked restlessly daddyll be along and hell get us a nice big box of double fudge brownies at the sound of the doorbell she moved as quickly as butch would allow naomis first impression when julia opened the door was flash the kind of style that came from the bones out and still had the power to make her sigh with envy a curling mass of red hair tumbled around a face that glowed with health warm brown eyes both welcomed and appraised you must be naomi hi im julia golden boys cousin yes i know i recognized you i heard you speak at the women in business lunch a couple of years ago oh yeah well i was a bit trimmer then she patted her belly and stepped back come on in ian just went up to get a copy of the design for the library my husband and his crew are going to do most of the work pretty julia mused a little shy very well turned out gorgeous body fabulous hair quiet eyes details she thought amused were what her cousins laura and gwen would want so youve taken over brightstones im managing it now yes you got chocolate mochas in the cafe yes theyre wonderful julia moaned easy butch hes desperate for chocolate she explained with a grin when naomi looked a bit panicked hes got another two months to cook in here dont worry he wants chocolate only slightly baffled naomi glanced down and watched julias stomach ripple under the long forest green sweater i have some m ms julia reached out took a firm hold of naomis arm dont toy with me no really i always carry something in case i miss a meal and need a boost it was something else shed learned not to deny that need for comfort just to regulate it she opened her purse and took out a small bag if you let me have them julia said in a quietly urgent voice ill name the baby after you boy or girl its naomi thats what you told me when you wanted my caramel sundae when you were carrying travis ian commented as he came down the stairs isnt your name travis chuckling naomi passed the bag of candy enjoy ill never forget this julia promised as she ripped open the bag and dug out a handful urn yes good see hes happy now field goal hes kicking cool delighted ian laid a hand on his cousins belly and grinned wow from midfield and right through the goal posts check this out he said to naomi and before she could blink he had her hand pressed to julia under his the first wave of embarrassment never managed to crest as the strong lively movements under her palm shot a thrill straight to her heart oh thats marvelous when her gaze lifted to julias something passed between them that only women know theres cullum julia tilted her head as she heard the two short toots i told him to beep the horn if travis fell asleep in the car seat well look over the plans tonight ian she took them tipped up her face to kiss him nice meeting you naomi she rattled the candy in the bag and thanks too bad the kid zonked out ian said to naomi as he watched his cousin walk to the waiting car hes great not even two years old and he can talk your ear off you like children yeah he shut the door closing the bright autumn breeze out when the car drove off a lot in my family youd better were loaded with them and theres always another on the way two right now with jules working on her second and my cousin mac and his wife expecting their first thanks for coming he added then took her by the shoulders and kissed her when she stepped back abruptly he arched a brow problem no no nothing except shed managed to convince herself that hed only kissed her goodnight after their date because it was what people did at the end of an evening all right let me get you a glass of wine i shouldnt im driving but somehow he was guiding her down the hall i thought wed just look over your the room you want to outfit and then she caught the glorious scent of sauce simmering one step into the kitchen she saw the beautiful warm slate counters the cheerful pots of herbs on the wide window ledge the trim brick hearth youre expecting company she said noting the size of the saucepan i wont keep you long hed started to pour from the bottle hed left breathing on the counter and now just stared at her ah naomi i asked you to come youre who i was expecting oh he finished pouring the wine offered her a glass i figured the least i could do since i was putting you out on a saturday evening was give you a meal you didnt have to go to all that trouble i dont mind coming by im interested in your library project uhhuh he leaned back on the counter am i going to have to dream up an excuse whenever i want to have dinner with you i no hmm stumped she looked down into her wine maybe i should ask if youre only interested in my library project or if youre at all interested in me he watched her gaze shoot up and what he saw in those lovely gray eyes had him stepping forward or maybe i should just tell you im very attracted to you that i enjoy your company he added taking the glass out of her numb fingers setting it aside that i want to spend more time with you he lowered his head to rub his lips over hers that i want to get to know you nibbled on them that i just want you a soft weightless white cloud seemed to drift over her brain want me to what with his mouth still on hers he opened his eyes drawing back slightly he shook his head then began to trace quiet kisses along her jaw then his mouth came back to hers and the sudden sharp lance of heat pierced through the cloud her lips parted on a gasp of shock her hands fluttered up to grip his shoulders wanted her her she thought just before her system went berserk her legs dissolved her bones melted and the blood sang under her skin one wild wave of sensation swamped her tumbled her so that she clung to him certain shed be swept away he hadnt meant to move fast but her sudden vivid response slammed into him he spun her around so he could press her back against the counter and devour that wonderfully lopsided mouth desperate to touch he ran his hands up her hips along her sides until he could fill his hands with those fabulous breasts her heart seemed to heave against his palm why dont we get to know each other better later wild with need he attacked her neck with his teeth everything life stories hopes and dreams likes and dislikes damn naomi ive got to have you yes no wait it terrified her this fierce and violent hunger inside her own body lets go with yes no please she lifted her hands to his chest felt the tension vibrate looked up into his eyes saw the desire swirl please she said again but didnt start to tremble until hed stepped back im sorry dont be were moving a little fast but he picked up one of the wineglasses and drank deeply i figured we were going at the same pace he was angry she thought trying not to be but there was temper stirring in his eyes no i am sorry i misunderstood why you asked me to come over why you did you misunderstand why i kissed you the other night the way i kissed you she was right the temper was bubbling the way you kissed me i dont know her voice went sharp as she clutched her arms and fought against a miserable combination of embarrassment and confusion i just dont know i dont have any experience with this im sorry ive never done what you seem to want me to do rising temper died in simple shock you havent ever ever no embarrassment won i have to go and because he was still reeling she managed to dash by him naomi wait damn it he caught her in the hall just wait he ordered taking her upper arms give me a minute here will you im not going to apologize again she said between her teeth no i am if youll just give me a minute he let her go to rub his hands over his face he needed to settle and quickly to get beyond the surprise the guilt and god help him the arousal her announcement caused him im sorry shed never been touched good god hed taken her in a series of quick greedy bites naomi im sorry i moved in on you that way i must have scared you some yes i wont scare you again he touched a hand to her cheek doing his best to make the gesture unthreatening and i wont push you why dont we just take a step back she studied him a moment then closed her eyes and took her ten calming breaths what kind of step back well take a glass of wine upstairs look at the space for the library ill show you the design then well have dinner youre not angry no of course im not angry im hoping you wont be will you stay give me another chance to get to know you yes all right she smiled a little id like to good ill get the wine he started back to the kitchen resisted rubbing a hand over the knot of desire tangled in his gut it would take time he told himself to earn her trust he didnt think it would help the situation to tell her that he only wanted her more now that he knew hed be the first to touch her be careful macgregor he murmured as he picked up the glasses be very careful chapter contents prev next it was pointless to be embarrassed that shed confessed her complete lack of experience with men a sharper woman would have said she wanted more time or she wasnt certain she wanted to have an affair some naomi imagined would have enjoyed that flashpoint kiss indulged in others then coolly left the man dangling later darling maybe such smoldering promises would be delivered in a husky voice with a throaty laugh while keeping a man at arms length with a tantalizing skim of beautifully manicured nails along the cheek and a sultry sweep of long thick lashes naomi decided that was a female skill she couldnt even pull off in dreams much less reality but there was no use being embarrassed that shed simply blurted out shed never been with a man in any case she thought it had lightened the tension in the air that evening she supposed it was the politician in his blood that had enabled ian to smooth over the awkwardness so quickly so completely and take her upstairs to show her the room he intended for his books by the time theyd reached it no one would have imagined the two of them had just shared a violent embrace in his kitchen she was having a hard time imagining it herself a few days later better that way she told herself imagining it too well would only cause that restless stirring inside her again work was a much better way a much more productive way of spending her time with her hands folded in front of her she stood at the rear of the events area she and her staff had worked so hard to create for brightstones new monthly womens evening the guest author was keeping the audience well entertained with offthecuff stories and short readings from her book dates from hell and how to survive them spontaneous laughter had drawn a number of other midweek customers over to stand behind the rows of chairs business naomi predicted would be very brisk during the afterlecture autographing unobtrusively she slipped over to the signing table to fuss where no fussing was needed the books were cleverly stacked pens were at hand the flower arrangement was in place and would be a gift to the author after the evening was over there was a pitcher of ice water and the author would be offered her choice of beverage from the cafe as far as naomi could see her very first wednesday evening program was a huge success with a murmur to her events coordinator to make certain the authors autographing would be announced over the loudspeaker at the end of the lecture she turned and rammed headon into ian sorry he took her arms to keep her from overbalancing i seem to have a habit of sneaking up on you i wasnt looking she stared into his eyes and suddenly she could imagine very well all too well that staggering kiss she could all but taste it then he gave her arms a light somewhat fraternal squeeze and let her go you pulled in a crowd tonight yes she glanced behind her as the audience erupted with laughter shelly goldsmith i saw the ad in the paper clever idea the womens night yours i worked on it with my events coordinator did you come to hear the lecture he lifted a brow as the applause rang out if i did im a little late oh excuse me she hurried to the front slipped up to the podium to shake the authors hand handles it well ian mused professional polite but warm the thank you into the mike was neat cheerful and included an invitation to the audience to have their books signed by the author he kept out of the way while naomi settled her charge offered her something from the cafe then flicked a single glance at a hovering assistant who dashed off to fetch the coffee then she took a moment to chat with goldsmith bending down to speak quietly with a smile efficient personable incredibly sexy in the trim moss green suit with her hair all that terrific hair coiled in a neat roll at the base of her neck her very tasty neck and he had to stop thinking that way hed known shed be busy it had been his intention to go straight home after work hed had no business detouring by the bookstore just for a look at her hadnt he vowed to give her plenty of space and here he was only days after hed nearly devoured her in his kitchen jumping back in and sniffing around her like a puppy it was demoralizing it was stupid it was irresistible he gauged the line forming at the table decided that the efficient ms brightstone would stand by her author for the duration so he took himself off to wander she saw him go out of the corner of her eye and tried not to let her shoulders slump it was likely hed just dropped in for a book it was a bookstore wasnt it she reminded herself viciously hed seen the crowd and had come back to satisfy his curiosity now hed find his book and leave and all shed managed to do was trip over his feet pulling herself together she turned to chat with some of the waiting customers it was after nine before the event wound down naomi considered it a very productive two hours which had taken more than forty manhours to create and worth every minute she decided after personally escorting her featured guest to the door now all she wanted was a quiet place to sit down and close her eyes for fifteen minutes nice job ian had waited her out but hadnt wasted time he had a loaded brightstones shopping bag weighing down one hand i didnt realize you were still here i was going to browse he grinned and shook the bag at this rate im going to have to add more shelves to my library design brightstones appreciates your patronage she smiled when she said it and managed to stop herself from fussing with her hair did you find everything you were looking for found you didnt i it looks that way and as an extra service i did some spying for you spying well eavesdropping anyway you have some very satisfied customers there was a group of women scouring the new fiction section they were pretty chirpy about tonights event and already talking about making an evening of it next month wonderful thats what were after are you done or are you going to be tied up for a while no that was it she blew out a breath thank god he chuckled how about i buy you some excellent brightstones coffee he watched her blink hesitate and shoving guilt aside he pushed i really hoped i could show you the changes weve made in the design i think weve got it now id love to see them do you want to go upstairs where he could be alone with her not a good idea he decided the cafes fine with me all right but brightstones buys the coffee its the least we can do for such a good customer she led the way noting that the childrens corner needed to be tidied if ian hadnt been with her she would have stopped and stored the scatter of toys and books herself tired he asked as they climbed the short flight to the cafe hmm no actually im a little wired i suppose i authorized the advertising and promotion budget for this new program i could almost see my father wincing over the phone hes given you pretty much a free rein hasnt he yes he trusts me her voice warmed on the words its going to be very nice to let him know he didnt make a mistake she scanned the cafe pleased to see it was nearly filled to capacity and smiled broadly when she spotted a table of women bubbling with laughter as one of them read a portion of shelly goldsmiths book aloud here ian took her elbow and steered her to one of the few empty tables lucky to find one it looks like brightstones cafe is a happening place yes it does sometimes i come through here and i get giddy and weepy at the same time silly she said quickly annoyed with herself for saying such a thing to him no its not youre making your mark naomi you should be proud of what youre accomplishing i watched you working youre very good at your job she wasnt sure which thrilled most the compliment or realizing hed watched her its all ive ever wanted to do when i was little id come in here with my father id wander the stacks tuck myself into corners sit behind the checkout counter my poor mother used to buy me dolls and id only use them as customers and clerks when i played bookstore and pretend to feed them the candy i stuffed in my face she remembered because i knew she was disappointed i couldnt be the pretty frilly little girl she wanted some of us are born for something he murmured this is yours yes this is mine and her days of hiding in corners were in the past she glanced at the waitress who hurried over busy tonight tracy we havent stopped hopping since fivethirty what can i get you ms brightstone two cappuccinos naomi ordered glancing at ian and receiving his nod you got it you should try a slice of that chocolate sin ms brightstone its awesome and youve been on your feet for hours oh i well split it ian said flashing a smile at the waitress thanks six million calories naomi muttered and ian laughed honey odds are youve already burned them off during the event where do you get your looks the honey had thrown her off and the sharp veer in topic finished the job excuse me your coloring you have hair like my mothers that thick dense black is brightstone native american yes actually theres some cherokee on my fathers side mixed with all manner of others some italian some french some english then english and welsh on my mothers she likes to say her children are hybrids i have comanche through my mother but laura got the coloring shes beautiful your sister yes she is your whole familys dazzling whenever i see a picture in the paper or a clip on the news im staggered you take after your father i suppose one day youll be a mix of the distinguished statesman and the harvard hunk when he winced she simply goggled had that actually come out of her mouth im sorry what a ridiculous thing to say he angled his head amused that she was more embarrassed than he was so im not a hunk and have no hope of achieving distinguished status no of course you are and she simply shut her eyes and wondered if the grand canyon might be a big enough hole after all he laughed until his sides ached and caused the waitress who brought their drinks to grin in delight it was about time as far as tracy was concerned that ms brightstone got lucky and it was looking as though shed hit the jackpot ill never live down that picture ian sighed and stirred his coffee what was i twentythree twentyfour out for a sail and minding my own business guy takes his shirt off to catch some rays and snap hes immortalized it must be intrusive the press i grew up with it he scooped up a forkful of the creamy chocolate confection on the plate between them and offered it you get used to it im not sure i could because he didnt seem offended after all she accepted the bite ive been dealing with the media for over a year now promoting the store giving interviews that sort of thing its necessary for the store but i cant say im used to it doing it wells often the bottom line he sampled the chocolate himself this is very well named sin he tormented himself by imagining the taste of her mixed with the chocolate it made her stomach jump youre going to have to sin by yourself she picked up her coffee im resisting one more he murmured sliding the fork into the dessert lifting a tempting bite to her lips and he was pleased to see when she took it that she could indeed be tempted he also decided that if he wanted to survive the evening hed better shift into business mode so let me show you what ive got tell me what you think he opened his briefcase took out the scale drawing of the proposed design im handing it over to cullum tomorrow he can get started right away you move quickly usually he muttered then spread out the drawing naomi took her glasses out of the little case in her pocket slipped them on and made ians mouth water then she leaned forward bending over the drawings and drove him slightly mad as her scent slipped into his senses oh these are wonderful just wonderful you put in the library ladder and the console they were good suggestions thanks im so glad i could help this is going to be fabulous you have a wonderful space for furniture too and with the fireplace here a perfect spot for enjoying the books youre going to display he imagined the two of them doing just that sprawled together on the sofa in front of a roaring fire with a nice bottle of red and music playing quietly in the background hed rub her feet he thought then start nibbling until hed worked his way up to hold it he ordered himself and resolutely shoving the image aside cleared his throat any changes youd make oblivious she continued to study shaking her head no i think its absolutely perfect as it is i love it ian good so do i he wanted to touch the hand she had on the table stroke a fingertip over her knuckles down her wrist down boy he thought and comforted himself with chocolate sin the discreet announcement that the store was closing in fifteen minutes had naomi looking up where had the time gone i didnt realize it was so late do you have anything left to do no and i actually dont have to be in until midmorning tomorrow my little treat for the last few twelvehour days want to go to a movie a movie weve just pumped in all this caffeine he smiled easily noting how quickly her eyes could go wary if she was going to learn to trust him to become used to him he was going to have to start nudging her into his company on a regular basis neither one of us are going to sleep for a while yet why not take in a movie well i suppose great moving quickly now he folded the drawing you walked to work right my cars just down the block ill drive you home afterward he was already on his feet the bag and his briefcase in one hand and his other held out to her chapter contents prev next he was a patient man he knew how to wait he understood and appreciated the value of building foundations developing relationships bonding friendships he enjoyed taking his time holding on to moments planning days he found those times those moments those days he managed to spend with naomi very precious and he certainly valued learning more about her having conversations about family about work about mutual interests he wasnt an animal after all whose only goal in life was sex he was a civilized and reasonable man who found pleasure and contentment in the company of a woman he liked respected and enjoyed and he thought if he didnt get his hands on naomi brightstone soon hed go completely insane she was fascinating fabulous and so unwittingly sexy he spent half his time with her quivering like a stallion wild to cover a mare and the other half in dazzled delight at having found her he was careful not to touch her oh a few brotherly pats or pecks but nothing that came close to that hotblooded embrace in his kitchen he wasnt about to risk scaring her off and as hed gotten to know her over the past weeks hed realized that she was a great deal more shy more vulnerable and more insecure than hed assumed when hed met her they went to concerts to films for long walks they cooked a few meals together and spent ridiculous amounts of time on the phone late at night he realized he hadnt experienced such an intense wonderful innocent and sexually frustrating relationship since high school and when once or twice he tested the waters shed shied back like a rabbit under the gun and had left his gut grinding it reminded him forcibly that if they did become lovers he would be her first and would have not only the pleasure but the responsibility of that it wasnt a simple matter or one to be taken lightly or quickly but he was a patient man ian assured himself as he surveyed the nearly finished library he had always been able to work steadily toward what was really important this was important in its own way too he thought running his fingers on the freshly waxed trim of one of his customdesigned builtin units the creation of something that was well thought out that was right that would last cullum did beautiful work he mused precise creative the cherry wood gleamed its corners softly curved almost fluid shelves stood at varying heights as ian had wanted to avoid the look and feel of uniformity he wanted nothing rigid or forbidding about the room between the two tall windows hed set a huge festive ornamental lemon tree in a brass pot a gift from his parents they always knew what suited him best he thought smiling as he trailed a fingertip over a glossy leaf hed already arranged the seating area a long takeanap sofa in cheerful blue a pair of wide chairs low tables that invited the occupants to put up their feet and relax naomi had helped him choose the lamps he recalled the charming diecut tin shades the romantic globes on one of their shopping forays the stately pewter candlesticks that graced the mantel were heirlooms housewarming gifts from his grandparents the bronzecolored mums that stood in a wedgwood vase between them had come out of his own garden there was a great deal of himself in the room ian realized and pieces of those he loved including naomi he sat in one of the oversize chairs dragged his hands through his giltedged hair there was no point in turning away from it he told himself he was in love with her was nearly sure hed fallen flat on his face in love the instant hed met her he believed in such things in love at first sight in fate in mating for life he wanted such things ian admitted even during his college years when hed played as hard as hed worked hed always had an eye focused on what was ahead for him his career and where he wanted to take it his life and where he needed it to go and that was home marriage family children pushing out of the chair he began to pace he couldnt use his feelings to pressure naomi he felt dead certain that if he told her he loved her shed let him make love with her from there he could persuade her to move in with him then nudge her gently into marriage and hed have exactly what he wanted which said nothing of what she wanted he jammed his hands into his pockets and stared out the window it had to be her decision she didnt know what she was supposed to do naomi pulled up at the address julia had given her and studied the gorgeous old brick house a house only blocks away from ians she wanted to be with him as much as it scraped at her heart she wanted to be where he was hed be arranging his books today she thought with a sigh books theyd pored over together books shed helped him select hed asked her to come by and be part of the final stage of the library he was so sweet about it she thought with a sigh but shed already agreed to come here and join what julia called girl day naomi had become so fond of julia over the last few weeks as theyd consulted on ians library project that she hadnt been able to make excuses she took the glossy white bakery box and climbed out of the car and crossing to the house through the sunday sunshine she smiled well after all shed never been part of a girl day before when shed been a teenager and the other girls were riding in herds having slumber parties talking about boys and clothes shed stood on the outside unable to break into that lovely haze of young femininity telling herself she didnt want to but of course she had now at least for a day shed have a taste of it casual julia had said and naomi tugged at the hem of her red sweater before she knocked hey julia homed in on the box even as she grabbed naomis hand to pull her inside whatd you bring brownies i love you and you timed it perfectly as weve just put all the midgets down for naps oh i was hoping to see travis you will he and lauras daniel never stay down long she pulled naomi into a beautifully finished parlor as she spoke you met laura right yes hello hi glad you could come by laura sat on the floor eating from a bowl of potato chips whats in the box brownies oh god gimme dont be greedy julia returned and this is our cousin gwen ive heard lots about you gwen rose out of her chair where shed been studiously painting her toenails im in your store all the time bransons doing one of your author events next month hes wonderful branson maguires one of bostons best and brightest naomi replied i have all of his books in my personal collection signed by the author did you know the psycho in do no harm was based on gwen laura commented not the psycho part gwen said with a laugh just the dedicateddoctor part weve got hot chocolate chocolate mousse chocolate drops and chocolatecovered pretzels julia chose the menu laura put in butch did setting the box down julia opened it and hes going to really go for these have a seat naomi and pull up some calories within an hour her system was jangling with caffeine her stomach groaning from overindulgence she hadnt allowed herself in over three years and shed laughed more than she could ever remember the girl shed once been wouldnt have been able to indulge herself only once she wouldnt have been able to sprawl comfortably on the floor and talk about so many wonderful and foolish things or to feel a part of the whole before and after she thought and nearly laughed at herself when was she going to remember to really accept that she was firmly rooted in the after here she thought in the time it took to demolish a boxful of brownies she had somehow made three friends mmm julia licked chocolate from her fingers wait till you see ians library she said to gwen its great cullum did a fantastic job on the builtins laura poured more hot chocolate hey i helped design them julia jerked a thumb at naomi and so did she i didnt do that much ian already knew what he wanted he get the books in yet julia wanted to know hes doing that today so how are the two of you getting on oh fine hes a wonderful friend friend laura choked out a laugh i wouldnt say the looks he was giving you the last time i was over were pal to pal looked to me like he wanted to start gnawing at your neck he doesnt think of me that way since when naomi shrugged and decided one more chocolate drop couldnt hurt he did but now he doesnt excuse me julia held up a hand are we all friends now without waiting for an answer she nodded good naomi are you out of your mind i dont know what you mean ians gone over you honey hes sunk hes gaga name your terms gwen you havent seen it but you know our boy ian right know him and love him gwen said and stuck out her bare feet to admire her toes well in your medical opinion knowing the patient well whats your diagnosis on a guy who spends all his free time with one woman talks about her constantly goes into daydreams with a dopey look on his face and cooks cozy dinners for two hmm gwen pursed her lips wiggled her toes in medical terminology that would be gaga julia patted her belly to soothe the actively kicking butch see he moons at the office too laura commented and i heard him tell his secretary last week to hold all of his calls while he worked on this brief unless it was ms brightstone terminally gaga gwen said with a sober nod a heartbreaking condition that has so far baffled medical science but hes not unsure whether to laugh or moan naomi dug into the chocolate drops again he treats me like a sister a very sick man gwen murmured if youd care to share more details id be happy to try to suggest a course of treatment he kisses my cheek naomi muttered while a frown slowly formed on her brow pats my head once in a while he looks at me and i think oh boy here it comes then nothing before i told him id never had sex he kissed me brainless but now oh she moved quickly rapping laura on the back as ians sister choked are you all right oh poor ian then laura burst into wild laughter baffled naomi stood looking around the room as her three new friends howled until tears ran down their cheeks sorry sorry laura pressed both hands to her heart i doubt its funny to you or him but were his family we have to laugh he must be suffering the torments of the damned gwen helpless laura waved a hand for her cousin to take over hes terrified of you gwen told her the thought made her smile and she remembered how sweetly how romantically branson had become her first thats just silly no sympathetic now gwen held out a hand he wouldnt want to push not a man like ian hed be afraid hed make the wrong move frighten you hurt you and if hes as attracted as i think he is those brotherly pats and pecks arent easy on him hes waiting for you to make the next move for you to be sure its what you want and thats exactly as it should be for ten staggered seconds naomi stared at the three grinning faces i thought he just wasnt interested that way after he found out i didnt have any experience hed never pressure a woman naomi laura gave her hand a squeeze and the more he cares the more careful hed be you really think naomi trailed off and smiled dreamily into space ohoh dr maguire i think we have another case of gaga julia grinned and winked at her cousins this could cause an epidemic it was dusk when naomi stopped her car in front of ians house the lights were on glowing in welcome through the windows was he still up in the library she wondered arranging his books was he wondering if shed call or drop by did he want her to or was his family wrong was it exactly as shed assumed and he thought of her as a friend maybe he wasnt alone that thought sneaked into her brain and had her gripping the steering wheel he was so attractive so charming so every thing there had to be a dozen women he could summon with one crook of the finger beautiful experienced sophisticated women why would he be waiting for her stop it stop it stop it annoyed with herself she thumped a fist on the wheel thats the way you used to think youre different now shed made herself different maybe it was still a work in progress but she had indeed made progress she was reasonably attractive when she took time to work on it she could hold up her end in conversations she owned a business for gods sake she had employees and none of them thought of her as a wishywashy addon three incredibly delightful and intelligent women now considered her a friend oh she would treasure that naomi thought closing her eyes she would remember this single foolish afternoon all of her life and those three women knew and loved ian didnt they why should she question their opinion and why didnt she stop being a sniveling coward get out of the car and see for herself okay all right were going she drew calming breaths as she walked to the door but they didnt seem to do the job caffeine overload she decided and bracing herself rang the bell he answered in bare feet faded jeans and a ragged harvard law sweatshirt and his quick smile of greeting warmed her shaky heart hi i didnt think id see you tonight i should have called but i was just over at julias and girl day yeah he grasped her hands drawing her inside out of the chilly twilight they do that every couple of months what the hell do you do on girl day paint your nails eat chocolate talk about men yeah what do you say about us ah could i have a drink sure sorry come on up ive got some wine in the library and im dying to show you what ive done he could have eaten her up her cheeks were rosy her eyes dark and the oversize sweater made his fingers itch to find her under it so he kept his hands in his pockets as they walked upstairs ive been at it most of the day he went on once i got started i couldnt stop he stopped a short distance from the open door close your eyes when she obeyed without question simply stood there eyes shut his hands fisted in his pockets it took some effort to unball them to lay them lightly on her shoulders and guide her into the room okay open up when she did her hands went straight to her heart oh ian its wonderful its more than wonderful eyes shining she turned to look around the room where the beautifully trimmed builtin shelves were lined with books old worn spines new glossy ones embossed leather and tattered covers perfect and your library ladder arrived i just love it she turned in another circle then beamed at him i wanted you here his heart had circled with her and now beat uncomfortably in his chest i wanted to see how the room would feel with you in it just right he dug his hands into his pockets again dragged them back out let me get you that wine the hands still held against her heart dropped to her sides she gathered all her courage ian do you want to go to bed with me he bobbled the glass splashed wine on his shirt swore what i dont mean to be rude or to put you in an awkward position its just that id like to know if youre still attracted to me in that way or not if not then thats fine but if you are and youve just been trying to be considerate because i havent been with a man before you could stop now id prefer you to stop being so considerate if thats what youre being she ran out of breath and words and compensated by shrugging as he stood staring at her a bottle of wine in one hand a halfempty glass in the other and a good splotch of cabernet sauvignon spreading over his beloved harvard law sweatshirt chapter contents prev next he set the bottle down you dont want me to be considerate no not really he put the glass beside the bottle you dont want me to keep my hands off you a shivery thrill ran up her spine not if you still feel um interested his throat went bonedry this was the woman he wanted and she was offering herself to him as shed done with no other man could he be careful enough to show her what there could be between the two of them he had to be because nothing had ever been more important a smile was slowly curving his lips as he walked toward her the witness is required to answer the question yes or no do you want me to keep my hands off you no she had to tilt her head back to keep her eyes on his thank god then he was sweeping her close pulling her to her toes and his mouth captured hers in a long draining kiss that had her heart flopping helplessly in her chest does that answer your question he murmured shifting his attention from her mouth to her neck until little startled sounds hummed in her throat what question do i want you do i want to make love with you lord she was delicious in case you missed my answer the first time let me just repeat myself his lips skimmed over her jaw then settled warmly on hers got it now yes for balance for pleasure she linked her arms around his neck yes ive got it now youve been making me crazy for weeks he circled her slowly toward the door i the concept shocked and delighted really being considerate was killing me i thought youd decided wed just be friends we are friends he kept circling a long slow dance down the hallway into his bedroom that only makes me want you more no one ever has emotion swam into her eyes as she laid a hand on his cheek i dont know what to do about it ill help you with that he turned his head so that his lips brushed her palm trust me naomi i wont hurt you and if you want me to stop ill stop i wont want you to he left the light burning though he wished hed lit a fire wished there were candles flickering he didnt think he could let her go long enough to tend to it she was trembling lightly but those lovely gray eyes were steady on his the trust hed asked for was in there he swore that whatever his own needs he wouldnt break that trust his mouth was soft on hers drawing her in with care with warmth i love this part of you he caught her top lip between his teeth chewed gently its so sexy her eyes blinked open the aroused surprise in them pulling a groaning laugh out of him dont have a clue do you pretty naomi ive been dying to bite your lips so he did pleasing himself destroying her until the pressure building inside her threatened to erupt with a muffled cry she threw her arms around him and her mouth went wild pure hot lust burst in his blood rattled his brain slow down slow down he ordered himself her response might have been the answer to every sexual dream but she was still untouched and hed given his word he softened the kiss soothing her lips now as he began to unwind the braid at her back he wanted her hair in his hands tumbled over his bed wrapped around him the weight and texture of it the scent enthralled him combing his fingers through it he stepped back then keeping his eyes on hers he lifted her sweater up her first instinct was to cover herself but he caught her hands in his struggling for air she felt the heat rise up to flush her skin as his gaze swept down lingered came back to hers nerves and needs jangled inside her as he skimmed a fingertip over the swell above her bra her hands curled at her sides before she ordered herself to relax to be brave enough to do what she wanted after a shaky breath she gripped the hem of his sweatshirt and drew it up over his body oh my he was beautiful lean muscles smooth skin without thinking she laid her hands on his chest then snatched them back when she felt him quiver with a strained laugh he brought her hands back step out of your shoes oh his heart was racing she thought and his chest was so hard my shoes step out of them mmm fascinated by the feel of him she splayed her fingers over him as she obeyed then her body jerked when he unhooked her trousers relax he murmured the word bringing his mouth back to hers taking her swimming into another kiss as the trousers slid down while his mouth continued to play on hers he lifted her laid her on the bed she felt the heat from his body over hers the coolness of the spread beneath her and as her heart plunged she felt the smooth lazy glide of his hands she stirred under him yearning towardsomething but before she could reach it she was floating drifting into dreams at the urging of his mouth and hands hed never taken more care with a woman never felt the need to take so much he wanted to give her every pleasure awaken her to her own desires it was easier than hed believed to bank the fires within himself to let them simmer her eyes were closed her breathing deep but he could feel her heart trip beneath his mouth as he tasted her the low and mindless moan she gave when he slipped her bra aside sent an echoing shimmer into his gut she slipped into his hands firm and full her hips arched instinctively as he skimmed his thumbs over her nipples he watched the stunned pleasure flicker over her face her lashes flutter then lift to reveal eyes gone storm dark and clouded she sucked in a ragged breath what should i do her hands were roaming restlessly over his back driving him wonderfully mad enjoy his mouth lowered his breath skimming over the sensitized skin of her breast his tongue flicking erotically tortuously until her hands clamped on the back of his head to bring him to her with lazy tugs and pulls he set out to destroy her reveling in her shocked gasps her trembles he let her taste fill him as his hands roamed down stroking closer and closer to the heat just a brush of fingertips and slow openmouthed kisses over her shoulders her breasts just a slide of his palm along her thigh he cupped her gently intending to give her time to get used to this new intimacy she exploded beneath him her body bucking his name bursting from her lips and the heat flooding out of her into his hand her reaction ripped through him forcing him to bury his face in her hair and for the first time fight viciously for control her body went lax and her breath remained shallow and fast nothing had prepared her for that long glorious shock to the system for the tidal wave of hot liquid pleasure delirious from it she turned her head hands pulling at him until she could find his mouth with hers his skin was damp slippery oh she loved the feel of it wanted more and raced her lips over his neck and shoulders even as her hips began to lift and press lift and press against him her body was full of storms ready to break her mind whirling with them he rolled with her struggling back from the edge holding himself in check long enough to strip off his jeans and protect her fighting the beat of his own blood so he could take her back up slowly drench her in pleasure until he knew she was close to flying again and as her body bowed as that moan of release sounded in her throat he gripped her hips and slipped into her the resistance of innocence made him shudder and made him gentle he took her mouth swallowed her single sharp cry and made her his only his he thought as he filled her for the first time she quivered still cradled in the circle of his arms he held her there stroking her hair and waiting for his own system to level out you okay mmm was the best she could manage and made him smile how do you feel ah thickheaded floaty a little drunk she sighed incredibly relaxed not awkward at all i was sure id feel awkward did i do everything right he lifted a brow her voice was slurred and sleepy no you were a huge disappointment to me im afraid ill have to ask you to leave now her head snapped up her eyes wide in a face still glowing then she saw his grin blinked i could probably do better with practice she said stunning herself hmm well maybe ill give you another shot at it pretty naomi he cupped her cheek and touched his lips to hers want that wine now all right she couldnt have cared less about wine but thought it would give her a chance to recover from the quiver it gave her when he called her pretty she pretended not to watch him as he climbed out of bed and walked naked from the room but when hed gone she patted a hand to her heart how in the world she wondered had she managed to engage the interest of a man who looked like that who had such intense physical beauty along with such intense kindness better not to question it she told herself then realizing suddenly that she was naked too she tugged up the tangled sheets and spread just as he came back into the room he stood there a moment then shook his head why the hell hasnt someone gobbled you up before me she flushed only adding to the sexy tumbled image she projected i guess no one ever really tried with a laugh he carried the wine and glasses to the bed get serious you must not have been paying attention no ive always been clumsy with boys men males and because she was starting to feel clumsy again she gratefully took the wine he offered honey id say the males youve come across have been the clumsy ones if none of them managed to get ahold of you with a fingertip he drew the sheet she held to her breasts down an inch you have an amazing body i always wanted to be tall and slim trying to relax again she sipped her wine but i started you know developing early it was very painful why oh i suppose you have to be a girl to understand what its like to be an adolescent and suddenly grow beautiful breasts he finished with a smile but boys really like breasts naomi we consider them one of natures finest miracles she laughed a little i spent years trying to hide mine still are he pointed out then tugged the sheet down to her waist grinning when she sputtered much better hows your wine its fine resolutely she pulled the sheet back up she couldnt possibly sit there drinking wine while uncovered im sorry about your shirt you could probably get most of the stain out if you soaked it now im keeping the stain to remind me of a monumental night in my life delight shone in her eyes thats so sweet how could you possibly be interested in me even as she prepared to saw off her tongue he angled his head gave her a long considering look you have breasts her eyes widened her mouth dropped open then she caught the gleam in his eyes and burst into laughter well lucky me his fingertip skimmed over the curve of her shoulder down her throat lowered to toy with the sheet again after you finish your wine i think we should have that practice session oh he wanted her again life was so suddenly full of miracles all right but id like to move into the library this time it was her turn to see surprise light in his eyes you see i do really well around books the image that brought into his mind had him going rock hard naomi yes finish your wine she had to swallow first then tipped back her glass and drained it done she announced it was a wonderful thing ian mused to lie in the dark with naomi curled against him in sleep this was what he wanted now tomorrow forever it was almost ridiculously simple how she slipped into and completed his life he could imagine them there in that big bed in the sturdy old house year after year with children sleeping safe down the hall a dog snoring on the rug life would be busy with her career and his a family to raise a marriage to nurture but they would do it his parents had and it was what hed seen in them seen between them what that bond had given him and laura that he wanted now for himself for naomi all he had to do was take his time move slowly caution and care had brought her to him after all hed given her the space to move toward physical intimacy and shed come to him not only willing but eager it stirred his blood to think just how eager hed give her a few weeks then persuade her to move in with him step by step he told himself that was the way to handle it he could control his impatience his needs when the rewards were so rich hed give her room he thought even as he drew her closer then theyd have a lifetime together chapter contents prev next ian hung up the phone and shook his head his grandfather was certainly keeping in close touch lately that made the third call in less than two weeks he really had to make time to get to hyannis port soon ian decided turning back to his computer to study the wording of the writ he was composing hed love to take naomi there for a quick weekend but he didnt have a doubt in the world that if the macgregor liked the looks of her hed start meddling hinting none too subtly about weddings about duty about continuing the macgregor line ian grinned changed a phrase on the screen little did the macgregor know that was exactly what his grandson had in mind and ian wanted to keep it that way he glanced up at the knock on his open door lifted a brow at his mother busy not too she walked in tall slim her dark hair swept back from a strong and beautiful face then she dropped a load of files on his desk gee now you are not the perinsky matter diana smiled cheerfully at her sons distress got it in one this time shes determined to sue her neighborhood market for not carrying her brand of tea claims its violating her civil rights he thumbed through a file it was full of the paperwork mrs perinsky loved to generate old bat ian thought but not without some reluctant affection lauras so much better with her he lifted hopeful blue eyes mrs perinsky likes you best with a laugh diana leaned a hip on his desk i think she has a thing for you sweetheart shes a hundred and fifty at the very least and hasnt forgotten the thrill of having a handsome young man at her beck and call i know its a pain ian but shes been a client since before you were born since before you were born he muttered and made diana laugh again nearly but in any case shes just lonely and looking for attention youll give her a little eat some of her cookies and talk her out of filing a nuisance suit against her very harassed grocer i can do that but then youll owe me would a homecooked meal balance the scales he considered anything involving mrs perinsky required stiff payment maybe if it was a pot roast with the works it could come close i think we can arrange that sunday work for you it would if you could stretch it to include one more naomi yeah since they hadnt really discussed it or her ian studied his mothers face is that all right with you i like her very much im in love with her oh helpless to stop it diana felt her eyes fill and held up a hand im sorry hold it alarmed he got up to shut the door then hurried back to take his mothers shoulders i thought you said you liked her i do i do diana waved her hand then laid it on his cheek youre my baby straightening she rested her cheek on his remembered a hundred sweet and foolish moments my baby she murmured again oh ian im happy for you couldve fooled me no i am she gave a watery laugh and drew back but theres a place inside me where youll always be my little boy and another thats so incredibly proud of the man hes become this time he rested his cheek against hers youll make me sloppy in a minute she wrapped her arms around him in one fierce hug i know there were other girls other women she took a deep breath let it out in a sigh and stepped back me girls women i dont know where you got such an idea she laughed again easier now maybe it was the way they kept popping up at the house or answering your phone at college but she framed his face with her hands this is the first time youve ever looked at me and told me you were in love so i know its real it is very real shes a very lucky woman diana kissed him lightly and i say that without any prejudice whatsoever so maybe you could drop a few comments about what a terrific guy i am when we come to dinner i think i could do that but subtly she shies easily and i dont want to scare her off surprise had diana lifting her brows you havent told her how you feel im working up to it ive got it planned out ian if i have one criticism of you its that you tend to plan things just a bit too carefully or perhaps she said with a gleam in her eye the word should be plot a la daniel macgregor works for him ian said cheerfully and wont it take some of the wind out of his sails when i present him with the woman im going to marry before he manages to get his hand into it diana pursed her lips recalling the list of books daniel had given ian to purchase when it would have been a simple matter for daniel to pick up the phone and order them himself wont it just she murmured and decided to let her baby have his illusions naomi arranged the display of branson maguires latest thriller personally she felt she had a special interest in him now as shed become friends with his wife and family shed even cuddled his children they were such pretty girls she mused just as lauras boys were a handsome delight and travis well naomi had to admit she had a special fondness for julias energetic young son shed always been good with children naomi thought as she studiously arranged copies of killer run in a dramatic spiral tower one of her first adult duties at brightstones had been to handle the childrens area and the weekly reading hour still shed rarely allowed herself to think of what it would be like to have children of her own as she was now if she didnt do anything to ruin it ian could fall in love with her it wasnt impossible nothing was impossible any longer he wanted her and she knew he had strong feelings for her there was no reason those feelings couldnt blossom into love the kind of deep stirring consuming love she felt for him then one day he might take her face in his hands as he sometimes did look into her eyes and say it i love you naomi naomi the brisk tap on the shoulder had her coming back to earth and staring blankly at julia did you have a nice trip oh with a laugh naomi shook her head to clear her thoughts my mind was wandering julia youre due any minute you shouldnt be out driving around god you sound like cullum julia rolled her eyes and youll be pleased to know that hes out looking for a parking place he let me off at the door so i could waddle inside which is how i maneuver these days she pressed a hand to her lower back you know if youd wanted anything from the store id have brought it to you touched julia smiled and her eyes softened i know youre an absolute sweetheart naomi but i wanted to get out for a bit i was feeling restless she admitted and very likely driving cullum insane he had the bright idea to distract me with a chocolate mocha well lets go into the cafe and get you one yeah lets this looks great by the way she added gesturing to the display bran will have them lined up around the block naomi glanced over the nearly completed display as she took julias arm were counting on it have you read it yet i cant seem to concentrate long enough to read it was the same way right before travis was born ive got it in my bag for the hospital though as soon as i give birth i can curl up like a cat for hours at a time youll love it its a heart pounder maybe i should pick up a couple other books while im here still pressing a hand to her back she frowned around the store that suddenly seemed to hold entirely too many choices im not in the mood to shop would you like me to pick a few out for you yeah fine whoa she jerked to a stop shoving a hand against a shelf and knocking a trio of books to the floor is he kicking do you want to sit down no hes not kicking hes knocking to get out no wonder ive felt so snarly all day get out fingers of panic tickled up naomis throat as julia bent over and panted you mean out now not right this minute julia managed a bit surprised at how strongly the contraction came on with travis theyd been mild initially before building to flash point but pretty soon oh hell im not going to get that mocha after all you need to sit down to sit desperate naomi searched the store she knew like the back of her hand because shed completely forgotten where the closest seating area was located over here you just sit and do whatever ill find cullum good idea julia lowered herself onto a pretty love seat and naomi tell him he better hurry i dont think butch is going to waste any time two hours later naomi was pacing a hospital waiting room crowded with macgregors she didnt know how they could be so calm how they could sit there chatting laughing telling family stories her own stomach was tied in knots and her palms were sweating ians mother sat curled up in one of the chairs talking cheerfully on the phone to the former president and first lady julias parents were on their way to boston and getting periodic updates on the progress via cell phone caine was on his own phone laughing as he spoke to the soontobe greatgrandparents and ian she thought as she peeked into the corridor again was nowhere to be found but she spotted gwen coming out of the birthing room and pounced before she could remember she wasnt family how is she whats happening her eyes widened as she heard a stream of violent cursing coming through the door dont you tell me to breathe murdoch you bonehead i know how to breathe you try it gwen chuckled patted naomis white cheek shes doing great its going to be a quick one and there arent any complications fetal heartbeat is strong shes fully dilated completely effaced keeping a hand on naomis shoulder she smiled at the crowd of faces in the waiting room im going back in shes ready to start pushing so get the cigars ready shelby did you hear diana laughed no ill stay right here on the phone shes nearly there yes i know gwen will tell her you love her on my way gwen promised then waved down the corridor ian did i miss it he was slightly out of breath from the run from the parking lot and up the stairs the elevators were too damn slow to suit him nearly she pulled open the door of the birthing room letting out the next stream of abuse dont you tell me not to push yet you sadistic moron youre fired thats the third time shes fired her ob with this one she made it to five with travis obviously amused gwen stepped in and shut the door she must be in pain naomi wrung her hands she must be terrified terrified julia not in this lifetime oh what do you know naomi rounded on ian making him take a step back and causing both him and his family to eye her with surprise you werent even here where have you been ah trapped with an irritable old woman and her endless supply of stale sugar cookies i broke out as soon as the message got to me want some water naomi no i dont want any water she slapped his hand aside then marched down the corridor when she reentered the waiting room she caught sight of the sea of faces watching her most of which hadnt manage to hold back grins she flushed stammered i im sorry im so sorry ive never been involved with anything like this im nervous why isnt anyone else nervous weve been going through this pretty regularly for the past few years ian told her honey why dont you sit down i cant but she did close her eyes and take her breaths ian counted with her to ten i am sorry she continued looking at him again i shouldnt have snapped at you like that youre allowed to snap when you need to i was hoping youd be here he put an arm around her shoulders and led her to an empty chair i called the store when i got the message about julia wanted to let you know what was going on and your assistant filled me in theyve got a pool going she found herself sitting he was clever that way she tried to stay still but couldnt do you think itll be much longer hard to say seems to me travis took her oh about a decade fourteen hours laura corrected three hours less than it took me for my first an hour longer than it took for my second same thing ian decided remembering that with lauras first hed been just as terrified and fidgety as naomi while hed waited out the birth rounds out to a decade for me he glanced around the room wheres bran he drew the short straw caine said with a grin hes got all the kids he asked us to pray for him here you go he added and neatly wrapped naomis hands around a cup of tea oh thank you too embarrassed to tell him she didnt want anything she sipped dutifully listened to the chatter the quick laughter and didnt realize her stomach had calmed until shed emptied the cup ladies and gentlemen gwen stood in the doorway again her face damp with sweat and bright with joy id like to announce the appearance of fiona joy murdoch arriving into this world at pm at eight pounds even mother father and daughter are doing beautifully tears spilled over absolutely beautifully then everyone was talking at once rushing for hugs weeping without shame naomi found herself kissed squeezed and swept along when ians father offered her a cigar she stared down at it dumbfounded then ian lifted her right off her feet isnt this great chapter contents prev next they were the most incredible family naomi thought and theyd let her be a part of it let her share one of their miraculous moments shed been able to stand at the glass and stare at the beautiful new baby in cullums arms when caine had announced they were all going out to celebrate shed been dragged right along with them no one looked at her as if she were an outsider as if she didnt belong they were open and loving and most of all honest and she admitted with a weight of guilt she hadnt been not really not with ian when she agreed to go home with him that evening she was prepared to be therell be another wave of family in by tomorrow he said as he unlocked the front door you can count on it headed up by the macgregor himself wholl puff around for a bit then sniffle over the new baby then if dc and layna get here by then hell want to know why the devil they havent started a baby of their own he thought it best to prepare her for what was bound to happen then hell start on you on me miserably nervous she wandered into the parlor fluffed pillows that didnt need fluffing why a pretty young lass like you isnt married dont you like babies what are you waiting for then he laced his speech with a thick scottish burr and really hoped shed smile but her eyes were gray and serious as she turned to him ian this isnt right for you your family youre all so kind to me whats not right about that i havent been honest you dont even know me youre not attracted to me i beg to differ he murmured and started toward her no dont really she pressed her hands to his lips and prepared to confess i shouldnt have let you think this was me she spread her arms dropped them im working on making it me but its just not fair to you naomi i dont know what youre talking about im looking at you im holding you he added when he took her shoulders only because ive changed the surface even two years ago you wouldnt have looked twice at me why would you no one ever did pudgy working my way up to fat because eating was easier than accepting really accepting that id never be like my mother no matter what i did like your mother he was baffled by the sudden passion in her voice slim beautiful completely naturally female i could never be that so i just ate and hid at the bookstore naomi a lot of kids go through a pudgy stage it wasnt a stage it was a condition and only a symptom of what i was inside i was drab and dowdy and clumsy and i only worked to be otherwise because i started to loathe what i was doing to myself i wanted to find what was really inside and try to like who that was and you have theres nothing drab or dowdy about you but there is impatient she pushed away i still cant figure out what to wear in the morning unless i check my computer your computer oh it was mortifying i have my wardrobe filed on my computer with cross references for the right accessories right down to shoes and shade of lipstick and i keep another file so i know what ive worn when and where so i dont repeat myself too often really he cocked his head thats brilliant brilliant its ridiculous any normal woman just goes to her closet and takes something out last week we had a power outage and i couldnt boot my home computer i nearly called in sick because i panicked she huffed out a breath its pathetic not that you dont always look fabulous but i dont think you need to worry about it quite so much you couldnt possibly understand youre beautiful you grew up beautiful and confident and personable my parents are absolutely stunning people my brother looks like a movie star then theres me naomi he took her shoulders again you are a beautiful woman no i can be very presentable if im careful im content with that actually im thrilled with that and i think with more practice it wont be such a worry to accomplish you really believe that dont you vaguely annoyed he pulled her into the hall turned her firmly around to face a mahoganyframed mirror what do you see there you her heart simply rolled over in her chest just you no one ever wanted me before you for the first time the full impact of that got through and began to worry him ive never felt this way about anyone else she murmured compounding what he was beginning to recognize as guilt my whole life ive felt one step behind and i never thought anyone would care enough to let me catch up naomi let me finish it was terrifying to turn to face him i dont want you to go on thinking im something im not when part of me is still the awkward girl who had exactly two dates in high school and both of them friends of my brothers who felt sorry for me and the young woman who spent her entire college career buried in books because it was the only place she felt comfortable it often still is she drew a deep breath you were the first man to give me flowers the first to make me dinner the first to just sit and listen to me and to look at me when you did her voice broke and had her fighting to finish youre the only man whos touched me kissed me her first he thought in every way that counted not just physically but emotionally shed been sleeping like a butterfly waiting to break free to spread her wings and hed snatched her out of the air before shed ever really felt the power oh god he thought what had he done what was he going to do im not the only one wholl want to and youre wrong if you think this isnt who you are he ran his hands up and down her arms this right here youve just started to see her for yourself he drew her close rested his cheek on the top of her head and realized he was going to have to do more than give her time he was going to have to let her go and hope that when she really saw herself accepted herself shed come back he gave her arms a quick squeeze then forced himself to take a step back youre a beautiful woman naomi and a fascinating one youre the only one who ever thought so hearing her say it seeing the glimmer of tears in her eyes as she did ripped him to pieces i dont think you were paying enough attention and you know it occurs to me that ive been monopolizing all your free time for the last several weeks my free time i hadnt thought about the fact that you were just getting the alterations in the store finished then helping me with my library he spoke lightly as he walked past her into the parlor he could give her six months he told himself viciously six months then by god he was going for her shed better be ready i havent given you much of a chance to settle into this new life of yours to give himself something to do he crouched and began to lay a fire weve been moving along pretty fast here maybe we should slow down she opened her mouth closed it again because the violent kick to her heart had robbed her of breath im afraid youre going to have to be more specific ian i dont have enough experience in relationships to be certain i understand the underlying meaning that he thought as he struck a match stared at the flame was exactly the point no underlying meaning naomi just slowing the pace maybe taking a breather you dont want to see me anymore yes i still want to see you he watched the kindling catch hold but the flare of heat didnt warm him im suggesting that our relationship doesnt have to be exclusive he rose turned certain that knowing he was doing the right thing for her would eventually cure this sickness that churned in his gut you should see other people other people she murmured other women she thought he wanted to see other women of course she should have expected it i suppose thats very sensible very reasonable a brittle smile curved her lips arent we lucky ive always been a sensible reasonable person i imagine some women would be angry or at least annoyed with a suggestion like that but then im not like a lot of other women am i no youre not he said it quietly youre one in a million she let out a short laugh one in a million she murmured but still not quite good enough well its been a long day all this excitement im tired im going home naomi i dont want you to go tonight she studied him a moment with the fire flickering behind him and i dont want to stay she walked toward the hall made it to the doorway before she turned back i was honest with you ian as i should have been all along so ill finish this by being honest im in love with you and i have been all along she went quickly to the front door and out before he could say anything kind that would make the ache inside her any worse i know he let it out in a sigh to the empty house but you never really had a chance to be otherwise now you do he was unhappy for a day miserable for two more then surly for the best part of a week but he didnt pick up the phone he didnt call her he didnt give in to his own needs and drive to her apartment and beat on her door hed worked it out damn it six months and times up he thought staring out the window of his office as he seemed to do much too often lately shed have six months of freedom to figure out who she was and what she wanted six months to see other men and if any one of them touched her hed no that was the whole point he reminded himself how could she know she loved him really loved him enough for a lifetime if shed never been romanced touched loved by anyone else his lips curled at the knock on his office door he wanted to ignore it or better yet to shout out go away damn it cant you see im sulking here what is it he snapped out now thats a fine way to talk daniel said as he shoved open the door is that how you behave with clients mr counseloratlaw or is it just family that rates sorry ian walked over to accept his grandfathers bear hug and his grandmothers warm kiss had something on my mind we wont keep you anna aimed a warning glance at her husband even as daniel took a seat and made himself at home we just wanted to say goodbye goodbye you only got here a few days ago woman cant stay still daniel muttered you want your own bed as much as i do anna said with a laugh were going by julias to see the baby first then heading back home ill miss you then why dont you come visit more often daniel thumped his fist on the arm of the chair too busy flitting around with some pretty young woman to take time to visit your poor old grandparents ill come up in a couple weeks im not so busy flitting just now and why the devil not wheres naomi at work i imagine ian angled his head why every one of the familys talking about her daniel tapped his fingers together except you that is why is it i havent seen the two of you in the same place since i got here when talk is youve been in each others pockets for weeks because were taking a break from each other break break why in bloody hell would you do that youre perfect for each other that girls made for you you dunderhead shes smart got a nice sweetness about her comes from a fine family good strong stock and dont let that quiet nature fool you theres a sturdy woman in there the kind who stands firm you seem to know quite a bit about a woman youve met a handful of times in a bookstore daniel glowered know her family dont i oh daniel anna sighed shaking her head i should have known known what his eyes twinkled an innocent blue you set me up after all ian said and sat on the edge of his desk fetch me these books will you laddie and see if little naomi will help you with it with a half laugh ian gazed at the ceiling i never saw it coming so what all i did was send you on an errand if you didnt like what you saw as if any kin of mine would be so stupid you buy the books and youre on your way seems to me daniel continued a canny smile in place now that you liked what you saw just fine and dandy yes i did so what do you have to say about it thank you daniel blinked rapidly narrowed his eyes in search of the trap thank you thank you for having the good taste to recognize the woman i hope to marry hah with surprising speed for a man of his size and age daniel lunged out of the chair to clasp ian against him thats a fine lad see there anna this one knows how to appreciate his grandpas wisdom thats why hes always been my favorite julia was your favorite two days ago ian reminded him i heard you tell her so well shed just had a baby needed some coddling but you now beaming he leaned back then the smile faded what do you mean hope to marry you are or you arent going to marry the lass and i expect to hear that you are because youre not a pinhead im giving her some time a few months afterward i hope to pick things up where we left off time a few months daniel roared out the words hes a pinhead after all what the devil kind of thinking is this go get the girl for sweet lords sake daniel leave the boy alone the hell i will he boomed at his wife then gave his current favorite grandchild a light cuff on the side of the head are you in love with that pretty young lass or arent you yes damn it ians temper was a rare thing but it could roar as fiercely as his grandsires enough to know what she needs and to give it to her you got it started and im grateful but ill handle it from here handle it bobble its more likely why excuse me caine said at the top of his voice from the doorway this is a place of business the last i looked family fights arent allowed in the schedule until after six pm do you know what this boys up to daniel shouted your own son gets his hard head from you thats where he gets it youd best be talking some sense into him or i wash my hands of it what a fine idea caine said pleasantly why dont you go wash your hands of it and ill talk to my son see that you do daniel sniffed lets go see julia who has more sense than a radish unlike some of my grandchildren and that precious baby and you he cuffed ian on the side of the head again stop being a pinhead long enough to go get the girl caine kissed his mother then his father grinning as anna pulled a stillblustering daniel from the room then he closed the door chose a chair and continued to grin as ian rubbed his head got a hand like a brick doesnt he he hasnt boxed my ears since i was twelve then ian worked up a smile i miss them already i know what you mean sit down ian caines face sobered the macgregor called it right its time we talked id like to know just whats going on and why youve been baring fangs at everyone within reach for the past week ive got things on my mind im not required to be pleasant every damn hour of every day caine only lifted a brow i said sit down youll save yourself a headache if you remember the macgregor isnt the only one who can box your ears chapter contents prev ian sat but he didnt like it saying nothing he drummed his fingers on his thigh and met his father eyetoeye stubborn caine thought with admiration it had always been one of his sons finest qualities this bullheaded straightahead attitude it was rare for him to pick a fight and rarer still for him to walk away from one whats going on between you and naomi it was just like his father ian thought to zero in on the point im nearly thirty he returned annoyed by the stiffness in his own voice id think that would be my business at this point in my life absolutely caines agreement was pleasant until it spills over into macgregor and macgregor business you havent been at top form the last few days ian ill work on it im sure you will but in the meantime caine reached over laid a hand over his sons tell me where it hurts damn it as his emotions rushed to the surface ian shoved himself out of the chair damn it im doing whats right whats best for her which is stepping back is that whats best for you ian youre in love with her thats not a question caine added its all over your face i know how it is i feel the same way about your mother i know ive watched it all my life i wont take anything less give anything less he dragged his hands through his hair im giving her some time some room she has to know what she wants and she doesnt youve asked her with a long breath ian sat again shed never been with anyone before me i see considering caine studied his own hands did you seduce her no i backed off it had to be her decision she had to feel ready what else could i do nothing being you now it worries you the fact that youre the only one whos touched her i thought i had a handle on it but its not just that she hadnt had sex she hadnt had anything anyone all at once shes standing there telling me that shes a fraud that im only attracted to her because shed developed this new image and it all comes tumbling out of her she tells me she was pudgy and plain that she hid behind that because she didnt feel she measured up to the rest of her family shes barely even dated never had a chance to see or experience anything shes just starting to realize her own capabilities her own powers and there i am ready to scoop her up tuck her into marriage children the whole deal before shes even seen whats out there so you told her you loved her enough to give her that chance if id told her i loved her she wouldnt have listened to the rest he brooded over that fact she thinks shes in love with me only thinks how the hell would she know ian tossed up his hands and pushed himself out of the chair again interesting question how do you know youre in love with her because ive never wanted to spend my life with anyone else because i can see how it could be with us in a year in ten years in fifty he circled the room then stopped in front of his father you can see im right cant you it wouldnt be fair to take advantage this way to ask her to marry me before shed had time to live a little more does it matter what i think of course it does then ill tell you caine rose laid a hand on his only sons shoulder youre a pinhead what as much as it pains me to agree with the macgregor on this i have no choice youre a pinhead ian youre not giving the woman you claim to love nearly enough credit to know her own mind and heart youre making a decision for her you have no right to make and its my considered opinion though it again pains me to echo my father that your best course of action is to go get the girl he wasnt convinced the men in his family were right but ian planted himself in front of naomis door in her apartment building and waited for her to get home he considered going to the bookstore but discarded the idea if they were going to discuss their future it shouldnt be done in a place of business yet as the hour grew later he began to worry that hed taken the wrong tack at least hed have found her in the bookstore now he didnt know where the devil she was so when he heard her footsteps on the stairs he sprang to his feet she stopped dead in the hallway when she spotted him then shifted her briefcase from one hand to the other and came forward hello ian you worked late she wore the same scent that same wonderful scent yes i did she took her keys out slipped them into the lock id like to talk to you can i come in nows not a good time it would never ever be a good time when just seeing him hurt this much please he braced a hand on the door to keep it open naomi we need to talk all right she could handle it shed promised herself she could but youll have to make it quick i need to change for what i have a date it was a terrible lie one she was sure she would be ashamed of later but for now pride was much more vital than honesty with a man the absolute shock on his face had that pride rearing up and showing teeth i tried dating baboons but we didnt like the same films moving briskly she set her briefcase aside hung up her coat what can i do for you marry me bear my children i didnt make myself clear the other night oh i think you did no i didnt explain to you the what or why i understood perfectly and she wanted to hate herself and him as well because she was so pathetically in love with him i told you that what you saw when you looked at me wasnt what was underneath you agreed and that was it no i god is that what you thought naomi im sorry he reached for her she stepped back thats completely wrong i handled it badly let me explain im a little pressed for time ian your date will just have to wait he snapped and jamming his hands in his pockets stalked around the room while she lifted her eyebrows and watched him after youd finished after you told me youd never been with anyone you knew id never been with anyone i dont mean just the sex he all but snarled it this time and had her eyes narrowing god sex is just a part of things theres companionship theres fun theres sitting around talking half the night watching bad movies all the things you do when youre dating the things youve never done with anyone but me certain he was under control again he turned back to her i wanted to give you time so that you could think it through so you could be sure you wanted to keep doing all those things with only me give me time she wished she could come up with one of those cold gotohell laughs but only managed a derisive snort you told me you wanted to see other women to give me time i never wanted to see other women he shouted it at her then yanked his temper back i thought you should see other men which i can point out you dont seem to have much of a damn problem with you wanted me to see other men she said slowly staring at him its not what i wanted are you insane his eyes went to a bright and burning blue its what you needed how the hell could i ask you to marry me when you didnt have a single point of reference nothing to compare what you thought you felt for me to i was trying to be fair to you fair to me fair to me fury danced over her shattered heart gleefully scattering pieces you decided what was right for me and that was to break my heart no to protect it to protect you from what from you from myself how dare you make those decisions for me i didnt exactly he could feel himself slipping down a very big hole i only wanted to maybe i should take the fifth he muttered oh i could hit you i could actually hit you she had to turn away before she did violence was a new and unstable emotion rushing through her ive never hit anyone in my life but boy i could i wonder how it would feel damn it dont touch me she warned when she sensed him moving in her direction or ill find out how it feels since hed only heard her use the mildest oaths a handful of times since hed met her it became clear just how angry she was naomi she whirled back before he could get another word out you must think im a moron of course i dont i only a poor pitiful excuse for a female who cant trust her own mind her own heart she stalked around the room her movements as stormy as her eyes i suppose the only way id know if i loved you was to have wild sex with a dozen other men first or two dozen what number did you have in mind i dont want you having sex with anyone oh thats right its not about sex well let me get something to write on and you can explain to me exactly how many romantic dinners late night dates drives in the country or whatever im to have before i can be considered competent enough to decide what to think and feel shed actually opened her briefcase and taken out a pad before his temper frayed the rest of the way okay thats it thats enough he snatched the pad out of her hand heaved it i dont give a damn whats fair to you or what isnt im not spending the next six months waiting until youve had your little fling six months was that the cutoff you certainly had it all worked out didnt you joy was bubbling up along with the fury the combination made her feel dizzy and it made her feel powerful well maybe ill see you in april then she started for the door intending to fling it wide and ended up with her back against it and ians furious face close to hers shed done that she thought with a rush of wonder and delight as they glared at each other shed made him so angry he was snarling shed made him love her until he was all but incoherent with it as clumsy as she was she realized how perfectly wonderful and shed done it by doing nothing more than being who she was i said forget it he grasped her hand you can just forget all of it im not living without you not for six months not for six damn hours youre going to marry me and if you figure out later it moved along a little too fast for you thatll be your hard luck all right fine and you might as well pack your things right now because his mouth opened and closed giving her the first glimpse of what it was like to completely stun ian macgregor it was she decided a marvelous feeling all right fine he managed yes riding on the new crest of power she grabbed him by the lapels you idiot and pulled his mouth down to hers he reeled with the impact snatching her up holding her hard against him so their hearts beat strongly one against the other just recently the correct affectionate family term is pinhead pinhead she murmured delirious with love im so angry with you her mouth raced over his face came back to cling to his i know i can tell he chewed restlessly on her top lip go on and stay mad for a while i deserve it okay i love you naomi he caught her face in his hands drew back so she could see his eyes i love you she closed her eyes wallowing in the warm flood of emotions that streamed through her then opening them looked into his and smiled say it again just like that would you he kissed her first her brow her cheeks her lips i love you naomi its not just the way you look though god you look good its the way you are its everything you are i started falling the minute i saw you and i havent stopped yet so did i in exactly the same way for exactly the same reasons oh ian ive been so unhappy without you maybe itll help to know i havent had a decent nights sleep since you left it does her lips curved when he laughed i hope you suffered and ill remind you of how much you suffered the next time you try to decide whats best for me he combed his fingers through her hair im whats best for you yes she rested her head on his shoulder wondering why shed ever questioned how perfectly it would fit there yes and as it happens im whats best for you i want our life together ian lets go home then and get started on it from the private memoirs of daniel duncan macgregor they say as a man grows old his memories of years past stay clear as crystal while those of last week fade into the fog i still remember like yesterday the first time i saw my anna oh i remember that cool disinterested look she gave me hah didnt stay disinterested for long now did she i was a young man then full of piss and vinegar a big strapping man from scotland at a fancy society dance where id gone hunting for a woman to take to wife and there was anna in her pretty blue dress she was mine from the first minute though it took some time to convince her of it i remember that night as if it just happened the lights the music the colors i remember the scent in the air when i brought anna here to this cliffside where i would build the house wed live in and i remember the feel of the earth in my hands when i planted a young sapling to celebrate the birth of my first son so theyre right in that the memory of an old man is long but i remember last week just as clear so what the hell do they know my grandson took him a wife last week and i can tell you the scents in the air of the church the colors of the light that streamed through the windows the full rich sound of the music that swelled when little naomi stood at the back in her glittering white gown with a bit of macgregor tartan showing and the macgregor veil covering her shining black hair brides glow they say that as well and so she did its love that brings that shining beauty to a womans face and one more in love ive yet to see and ian handsome as a prince as he waited for her they dont say a man glows but perhaps they should i cant think of another word for the look on his face as he watched her walk to him and not being such a pinhead after all what did he do he took her hand and the other as well and as the music died off and before the priest could open his mouth to start the business of it ian said i love you naomi his voice as clear and strong as the bells that rang after the deed was done and if there was a dry eye in the whole of the church at that moment well it wasnt daniel macgregors its been a good year for the family with three weddings and a baby ive done my best and my best is better than most now the years nearly done ill watch the snow fall awhile and sit with anna by the fire and listen to the wind howl at the windows and if i do a bit of planning a bit of plotting while i sit with my feet up and a glass of whiskey in my hand whats wrong with that theres another year coming after all and ive more grandchildren yet
