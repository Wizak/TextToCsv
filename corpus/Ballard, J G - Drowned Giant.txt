 with its cool detached style and its disturbing images this story is as mysteriously compelling as kafkas metamorphosis and i think it may be remembered as long the drowned giant jgballard on the morning after the storm the body of a drowned giant was washed ashore on the beach five miles to the northwest of the city the first news of its arrival was brought by a nearby farmer and subsequently confirmed by the local newspaper reporters and the police despite this the majority of people myself among them remained skeptical but the return of more and more eyewitnesses attesting to the vast size of the giant was finally too much for our curiosity the library where my colleagues and i were carrying out our research was almost deserted when we set off for the coast shortly after two oclock and throughout the day people continued to leave their offices and shops as accounts of the giant circulated around the city by the time we reached the dunes above the beach a substantial crowd had gathered and we could see the body lying in the shallow water yards away at first the estimates of its size seemed greatly exaggerated it was then at low tide and almost all the giants body was exposed but he appeared to be a little larger than a basking shark he lay on his back with his arms at his sides in an attitude of repose as if asleep on the mirror of wet sand the reflection of his blanched skin fading as the water receded in the clear sunlight his body glistened like the white plumage of a sea bird puzzled by this spectacle and dissatisfied with the matter offact explanations of the crowd my friends and i stepped down from the dunes onto the shingle everyone seemed reluctant to approach the giant but half an hour later two fishermen in wading boots walked out across the sand as their diminutive figures neared the recumbent body a sudden hubbub of conversation broke out among the spectators the two men were completely dwarfed by the giant although his heels were partly submerged in the sand the feet rose to at least twice the fishermens height and we immediately realized that this drowned leviathan had the mass and dimensions of the largest sperm whale three fishing smacks had arrived on the scene and with keels raised remained a quarter of a mile offshore the crews watching from the bows their discretion deterred the spec tators on the shore from wading out across the sand impa tiently everyone stepped down from the dunes and waited on the shingle slopes eager for a closer view around the margins of the figure the sand had been washed away forming a hollow as if the giant had fallen out of the sky the two fishermen were standing between the immense plinths of the feet waving to us like tourists among the columns of some waterlapped temple on the nile for a moment i feared that the giant was merely asleep and might suddenly stir and clap his heels together but his glazed eyes stared skyward unaware of the minuscule replicas of himself between his feet the fishermen then began a circuit of the corpse strolling past the long white flanks of the legs after a pause to examine the fingers of the supine hand they disappeared from sight between the arm and chest then reemerged to survey the head shielding their eyes as they gazed up at its grecian profile the shallow forehead straight highbridged nose and curling lips reminded me of a roman copy of praxiteles and the elegantly formed cartouches of the nostrils emphasized the resemblance to sculpture abruptly there was a shout from the crowd and a hundred arms pointed toward the sea with a start i saw that one of the fishermen had climbed onto the giants chest and was now strolling about and signaling to the shore there was a roar of surprise and triumph from the crowd lost in a rushing ava lanche of shingle as everyone surged forward across the sand as we approached the recumbent figure which was lying in a pool of water the size of a field our excited chatter fell away again subdued by the huge physical dimensions of this dead colossus he was stretched out at a slight angle to the shore his legs carried nearer the beach and this foreshortening had disguised his true length despite the two fishermen standing on his abdomen the crowd formed itself into a wide circle groups of people tentatively advancing toward the hands and feet my companions and i walked around the seaward side of the giant whose hips and thorax towered above us like the hull of a stranded ship his pearlcolored skin distended by immersion in salt water masked the contours of the enormous muscles and tendons we passed below the left knee which was flexed slightly threads of damp seaweed clinging to its sides draped loosely across the midriff and preserving a tenuous propriety was a shawl of heavy openweave material bleached to a pale yellow by the water a strong odor of brine came from the garment as it steamed in the sun mingled with the sweet potent scent of the giants skin we stopped by his shoulder and gazed up at the motionless profile the lips were parted slightly the open eye cloudy and occluded as if injected with some blue milky liquid but the delicate arches of the nostrils and eyebrows invested the face with an ornate charm that belied the brutish power of the chest and shoulders the ear was suspended in midair over our heads like a sculptured doorway as i raised my hand to touch the pendulous lobe someone appeared over the edge of the forehead and shouted down at me startled by this apparition i stepped back and then saw that a group of youths had climbed up onto the face and were jostling each other in and out of the orbits people were now clambering all over the giant whose reclining arms provided a double stairway from the palms they walked along the forearms to the elbows and then crawled over the distended belly of the biceps to the flat promenade of the pectoral muscles which covered the upper half of the smooth hairless chest from here they climbed up onto the face hand over hand along the lips and nose or forayed down the abdomen to meet others who had straddled the ankles and were patrolling the twin columns of the thighs we continued our circuit through the crowd and stopped to examine the outstretched right hand a small pool of water lay in the palm like the residue of another world now being kicked away by people ascending the arm i tried to read the palmlines that grooved the skin searching for some clue to the giants character but the distention of the tissues had almost obliterated them carrying away all trace of the giants identity and his last tragic predicament the huge muscles and wristbones of the hand seemed to deny any sensitivity to their owner but the delicate flexion of the fingers and the well tended nails each cut symmetrically to within six inches of the quick argued refinement of temperament illustrated in the grecian features of the face on which the townsfolk were now sitting like flies one youth was even standing arms wavering at his side on the very tip of the nose shouting down at his companions but the face of the giant still retained its massive composure returning to the shore we sat down on the shingle and watched the continuous stream of people arriving from the city some six or seven fishing boats had collected offshore and their crews waded in through the shallow water for a closer look at this enormous storm catch later a party of police appeared and made a halfhearted attempt to cordon off the beach but after walking up to the recumbent figure any such thoughts left their minds and they went off together with bemused backward glances an hour later there were a thousand people present on the beach at least two hundred of them standing or sitting on the giant crowded along the arms and legs or circulating in a ceaseless melee across his chest and stomach a large gang of youths occupied the head toppling each other off the cheeks and sliding down the smooth planes of the jaw two or three straddled the nose and another crawled into one of the nostrils from which he emitted barking noises like a demented dog that afternoon the police returned and cleared a way through the crowd for a party of scientific expertsauthorities on gross anatomy and marine biologyfrom the university the gang of youths and most of the people on the giant climbed down leaving behind a few hardy spirits perched on the tips of the toes and on the forehead the experts strode around the giant heads nodding in vigorous consultation pre ceded by the policemen who pushed back the press of specta tors when they reached the outstretched hand the senior officer offered to assist them up onto the palm but the experts hastily demurred after they returned to the shore the crowd once more climbed onto the giant and was in full possession when we left at five oclock covering the arms and legs like a dense flock of gulls sitting on the corpse of a large fish i next visited the beach three days later my friends at the library had returned to their work and delegated to me the task of keeping the giant under observation and preparing a report perhaps they sensed my particular interest in the case and it was certainly true that i was eager to return to the beach there was nothing necrophilic about this for to all intents the giant was still alive for me indeed more alive than many of the people watching him what i found so fascinating was partly his immense scale the huge volumes of space occupied by his arms and legs which seemed to confirm the identity of my own miniature limbs but above all the mere categorical fact of his existence whatever else in our lives might be open to doubt the giant dead or alive existed in an absolute sense providing a glimpse into a world of similar absolutes of which we spec tators on the beach were such imperfect and puny copies when i arrived at the beach the crowd was considerably smaller and some two or three hundred people sat on the shingle picnicking and watching the groups of visitors who walked out across the sand the successive tides had carried the giant nearer the shore swinging his head and shoulders toward the beach so that he seemed doubly to gain in size his huge body dwarfing the fishing boats beached beside his feet the uneven contours of the beach had pushed his spine into a slight arch expanding his chest and tilling back the head forcing him into a more expressly heroic posture the combined effects of sea water and the tumefaction of the tissues had given the face a sleeker and less youthful look although the vast proportions of the features made it impossible to assess the age and character of the giant on my previous visit his classically modeled mouth and nose suggested that he had been a young man of discreet and modest temper now however he appeared to be at least in early middle age the puffy cheeks thicker nose and temples and narrowing eyes gave him a look of wellfed maturity that even now hinted at a growing corrup tion to come the accelerated postmortem development of the giants character as if the latent elements of his personality had gained sufficient momentum during his life to discharge themselves in a brief final resume continued to fascinate me it marked the beginning of the giants surrender to that alldemanding system of time in which the rest of humanity finds itself and of which like the million twisted ripples of a fragmented whirlpool our finite lives are the concluding products i took up my position on the shingle directly opposite the giants head from where i could see the new arrivals and the children clambering over the legs arid arms among the mornings visitors were a number of men in leather jackets and cloth caps who peered up critically at the giant with a professional eye pacing out his dimensions and making rough calculations in the sand with spars of driftwood i assumed them to be from the public works department and other municipal bodies no doubt wondering how to dispose of this monster several rather more smartly attired individuals circus proprietors and the like also appeared on the scene and strolled slowly around the giant hands in pockets of their long overcoats saying nothing to one another evidently its bulk was too great even for their matchless enterprise after they had gone the children continued to run up and down the arms and legs and the youths wrestled with each other over the supine face the damp sand from their feet covering the white skin the following day i deliberately postponed my visit until the late afternoon and when i arrived there were fewer than or people sitting on the shingle the giant had been carried still closer to the shore and was now little more than yards away his feet crushing the palisade of a rotting break water the slope of the firmer sand tilted his body toward sea the bruised swollen face averted in an almost conscious gesture i sat down on a large metal winch which had been shackled to a concrete caisson above the shingle and looked down at the recumbent figure his blanched skin had now lost its pearly translucence and was spattered with dirty sand which replaced that washed away by the night tide clumps of seaweed filled the intervals between the fingers and a collection of litter and cuttlebones lay in the crevices below the hips and knees but despite this and the continuous thickening of his features the giant still retained his magnificent homeric stature the enormous breadth of the shoulders and the huge columns of the arms and legs still carried the figure into another dimension and the giant seemed a more authentic image of one of the drowned argonauts or heroes of the odyssey than the conventional portrait previously in my mind i stepped down onto the sand and walked between the pools of water toward the giant two small boys were sitting in the well of the ear and at the far end a solitary youth stood perched high on one of the toes surveying me as i approached as i had hoped when delaying my visit no one else paid any atten tion to me and the people on the shore remained huddled beneath their coats the giants supine right hand was covered with broken shells and sand in which a score of footprints were visible the rounded bulk of the hip lowered above me cutting off all sight of the sea the sweetly acrid odor i had noticed before was now more pungent and through the opaque skin i could see the serpentine coils of congealed blood vessels however repellent it seemed this ceaseless metamorphosis a macabre lifein death alone permitted me to set foot on the corpse using the jutting thumb as a stair rail i climbed up onto the palm and began my ascent the skin was harder than i expected barely yielding to my weight quickly i walked up the sloping forearm and the bulging balloon of the biceps the face of the drowned giant loomed to my right the cavernous nostrils and huge flanks of the cheeks like the cone of some freakish volcano safely rounding the shoulder i stepped out onto the broad promenade of the chest across which the bony ridges of the rib cage lay like huge rafters the white skin was dappled by the darkening bruises of countless footprints in which the patterns of individual heel marks were clearly visible someone had built a small sand castle on the center of the sternum and i climbed onto this partly demolished structure to get a better view of the face the two children had now scaled the ear and were pulling themselves into the right orbit whose blue globe completely occluded by some milkcolored fluid gazed sightlessly past their miniature forms seen obliquely from below the face was devoid of all grace and repose the drawn mouth and raised chin propped up by gigantic slings of muscles resembling the torn prow of a colossal wreck for the first time i became aware of the extremity of this last physical agony of the giant no less painful for his unawareness of the collapsing musculature and tissues the absolute isolation of the ruined figure cast like an abandoned ship upon the empty shore almost out of sound of the waves transformed his face into a mask of exhaustion and helplessness as i stepped forward my foot sank into a trough of soft tissue and a gust of fetid gas blew through an aperture be tween the ribs retreating from the fouled air which hung like a cloud over my head i turned toward the sea to clear my lungs to my surprise i saw the the giants left hand had been amputated i stared with shocked bewilderment at the blackening stump while the solitary youth reclining on his aerial perch a hundred feet away surveyed me with a sanguinary eye this was only the first of a sequence of depredations i spent the following two days in the library for some reason reluctant to visit the shore aware that i had probably witnessed the approaching end of a magnificent illusion when i next crossed the dunes and set foot on the shingle the giant was little more than yards away and with this close proximity to the rough pebbles all traces had vanished of the magic which once surrounded his distant wavewashed form despite his immense size the bruises and dirt that covered his body made him appear merely human in scale his vast dimensions only increas ing his vulnerability his right hand and foot had been removed dragged up the slope and trundled away by cart after questioning the small group of people huddled by the breakwater i gathered that a fertilizer company and a cattlefood manufacturer were re sponsible the giants remaining foot rose into the air a steel hawser fixed to the large toe evidently in preparation for the following day the surrounding beach had been disturbed by a score of workmen and deep ruts marked the ground where the hands and foot had been hauled away a dark brackish fluid leaked from the stumps and stained the sand and the white cones of the cuttlefish as i walked down the shingle i noticed that a number of jocular slogans swastikas and other signs had been cut into the gray skin as if the mutilation of this motionless colossus had released a sudden flood of repressed spite the lobe of one of the ears was pierced by a spear of timber and a small fire had burned out in the center of the chest blackening the surrounding skin the fine wood ash was still being scat tered by the wind a foul smell enveloped the cadaver the undisguisable signature of putrefaction which had at last driven away the usual gathering of youths i returned to the shingle ad climbed up onto the winch the giants swollen cheeks had now almost closed his eyes drawing the lips back in a monumental gape the once straight grecian nose had been twisted and flattened stamped into the ballooning face by countless heels when i visited the beach the following day i found almost with relief that the head had been removed some weeks elapsed before i made my next journey to the beach and by then the human likeness i had noticed earlier had vanished again on close inspection the recumbent thorax and abdomen were unmistakably manlike but as each of the limbs was chopped off first at the knee and elbow and then at shoulder and thigh the carcass resembled that of any headless sea animalwhale or whale shark with this loss of identity and the few traces of personality that had clung tenuously to the figure the interest of the spectators expired and the fore shore was deserted except for an elderly beachcomber and the watchman sitting in the doorway of the contractors hut a loose wooden scaffolding had been erected around the carcass from which a dozen ladders swung in the wind and the surrounding sand was littered with coils of rope long metalhandled knives and grappling irons the pebbles oily with blood and pieces of bone and skin i nodded to the watchman who regarded me dourly over his brazier of burning coke the whole area was pervaded by the pungent smell of huge squares of blubber being simmered in a vat behind the hut both the thighbones had been removed with the assistance of a small crane draped in the gauzelike fabric which had once covered the waist of the giant and the open sockets gaped like barn doors the upper arms collarbones nd pudenda had likewise been dispatched what remained of the skin over the thorax and abdomen had been marked out in parallel strips with a tarbrush and the first five or six sections had been pared away from the midriff revealing the great arch of the rib cage as i left a flock of gulls wheeled down from the sky and alighted on the beach picking at the stained sand with ferocious cries several months later when the news of his arrival had been generally forgotten various pieces of the body of the dismem bered giant began to reappear all over the city most of these were bones which the fertilizer manufacturers had found too difficult to crush and their massive size and the huge tendons and dhcs of cartilage attached to their joints immediately identified them for some reason these disem bodied fragments seemed better to convey the essence of the giants original magnificence than the bloated appendages that had been subsequently amputated as i looked across the road at the premises of the largest wholesale merchants in the meat market i recognized the two enormous thighbones on either side of the doorway they lowered over the porters heads like the threatening megaliths of some primitive druidical religion and i had a sudden vision of the giant climbing to his knees upon these bare bones and striding away through the streets of the city picking up the scattered fragments of himself on his return journey to the sea a few days later i saw the left humerus lying in the entrance to one of the shipyards in the same week the mummified right hand was exhibited on a carnival float during the annual pageant of the guilds the lower jaw typically found its way to the museum of natural history the remainder of the skull has disappeared but is probably still lurking in the waste grounds or private gardens of the cityquite recently while sailing down the river i noticed two ribs of the giant forming a decorative arch in a waterside garden possibly confused with the jawbones of a whale a large square of tanned and tattooed skin the size of an indian blanket forms a back cloth to the dolls and masks in a novelty shop near the amusement park and i have no doubt that elsewhere in the city in the hotels or golf clubs the mummified nose or ears of the giant hang from the wall above a fireplace as for the immense pizzle this ends its days in the freak museum of a circus which travels up and down the northwest this monumental apparatus stunning in its proportions and sometime potency occupies a complete booth to itself the irony is that it is wrongly identified as that of a whale and indeed most people even those who first saw him cast up on the shore after the storm now remember the giant if at all as a large sea beast the remainder of the skeleton stripped of all flesh still rests on the seashore the clutter of bleached ribs like the timbers of a derelict ship the contractors hut the crane and scaffolding have been removed and the sand being driven into the bay along the coast has buried the pelvis and backbone in the winter the high curved bones are deserted battered by the breaking waves but in the summer they provide an excellent perch for the seawearying gulls
