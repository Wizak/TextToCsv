the dragon the dragon by ray bradbury the night blew in the short grass on the moor there was no other motion it had been years since a single bird had flown by in the great blind shell of sky long ago a few small stones had simulated life when they crumbled and fell into dust now only the night moved in the souls of the two men bent by their lonely fire in the wilderness darkness pumped quietly in their veins and ticked silently in their temples and their wrists firelight fled up and down their wild faces and welled in their eyes in orange tatters they listened to each others faint cool breathing and the lizard blink of their eyelids at last one man poked the fire with his sword dont idiot youll give us away no matter said the second man the dragon can smell us miles off anyway gods breath its cold i wish i was back at the castle its death not sleep were after why why the dragon never sets foot in the town quiet fool he eats men traveling alone from our town to the next let them be eaten and let us get home wait now listen the two men froze they waited a long time but there was only the shake of their horses nervous skin like black velvet tambourines jingling the silver stirrup buckles softly softly ah the second man sighed what a land of nightmares everything happens here someone blows out the sun its night and then and then oh god listen this dragon they say his eyes are fire his breath a white gas you can see him burn across the dark lands he runs with sulfur and thunder and kindles the grass sheep panic and die insane women deliver forth monsters the dragons fury is such that tower walls shake back to dust his victims at sunrise are strewn hither thither on the hills how many knights i ask have gone for this monster and failed even as we shall fail enough of that more than enough out here in this desolation i cannot tell what year this is nine hundred years since the nativity no no whispered the second man eyes shut on this moor is no time is only forever i feel if i ran back on the road the town would be gone the people yet unborn things changed the castles unquarried from the rocks the timbers still uncut from the forests dont ask how i know the moor knows and tells me and here we sit alone in the land of the fire dragon god save us be you afraid then gird on your armor what use the dragon runs from nowhere we cannot guess its home it vanishes in fog we know not where it goes aye on with our armor well die well dressed half into his silver corselet the second man stopped again and turned his head across the dim country full of night and nothingness from the heart of the moor itself the wind sprang full of dust from clocks that used dust for telling time there were black suns burning in the heart of this new wind and a million burnt leaves shaken from some autumn tree be yond the horizon this wind melted landscapes lengthened bones like white wax made the blood roil and thicken to a muddy deposit in the brain the wind was a thousand souls dying and all time confused and in transit it was a fog inside of a mist inside of a darkness and this place was no mans place and there was no year or hour at all but only these men in a faceless emptiness of sudden frost storm and white thunder which moved behind the great falling pane of green glass that was the lightning a squall of rain drenched the turf all faded away until there was unbreathing hush and the two men waiting alone with their warmth in a cool season there whispered the first man oh there miles off rushing with a great chant and a roar the dragon in silence the men buckled on their armor and mounted their horses the midnight wilderness was split by a monstrous gushing as the dragon roared nearer nearer its flashing yellow glare spurted above a hill and then fold on fold of dark body distantly seen therefore indistinct flowed over that hill and plunged vanishing into a valley quick they spurred their horses forward to a small hollow this is where it passes they seized their lances with mailed fists and blinded their horses by flipping the visors down over their eyes lord yes let us use his name on the instant the dragon rounded a hill its monstrous amber eye fed on them fired their armor in red glints and glitters with a terrible wailing cry and a grinding rush it flung itself forward mercy god the lance struck under the unlidded yellow eye buckled tossed the man through the air the dragon hit spilled him over down ground him under passing the black brunt of its shoulder smashed the remaining horse and rider a hundred feet against the side of a boulder wailing wailing the dragon shrieking the fire all about around under it a pink yellow orange sunfire with great soft plumes of blinding smoke did you see it cried a voice just like i told you the same the same a knight in armor by the lord harry we hit him you goin to stop did once found nothing dont like to stop on this moor i get the willies got a feel it has but we hit something gave him plenty of whistle chap wouldnt budge a steaming blast cut the mist aside well make stokely on time more coal eh fred another whistle shook dew from the empty sky the night train in fire and fury shot through a gully up a rise and vanished away over cold earth toward the north leaving black smoke and steam to dissolve in the numbed air minutes after it had passed and gone forever
