 chapter she didnt remember dying with an obscure sense of apprehension she wondered if the distant angry voices drifting in to her meant she was again about to experience that transcendent ending death there was absolutely nothing she could do about it if she was while she didnt remember dying she dimly recalled at some later point solemn whispers saying that she had saying that death had taken her but that he had pressed his mouth over hers and filled her stilled lungs with his breath his life and in so doing had rekindled hers she had had no idea who it was that spoke of such an inconceivable feat or who he was that first night when she had perceived the distant disembodied voices as little more than a vague notion she had grasped that there were people around her who didnt believe even though she was again living that she would remain alive through the rest of the night but now she knew she had she had remained alive many more nights perhaps in answer to desperate prayers and earnest oaths whispered over her that first night but if she didnt remember the dying she remembered the pain before passing into that great oblivion the pain she never forgot she remembered fighting alone and savagely against all those men men baring their teeth like a pack of wild hounds with a hare she remembered the rain of brutal blows driving her to the ground heavy boots slamming into her once she was there and the sharp snap of bones she remembered the blood so much blood on their fists on their boots she remembered the searing terror of having no breath to gasp at the agony no breath to cry out against the crushing weight of hurt sometime afterwhether hours or days she didnt knowwhen she was lying under clean sheets in an unfamiliar bed and had looked up into his gray eyes she knew that for some the world reserved pain worse than she had suffered she didnt know his name the profound anguish so apparent in his eyes told her beyond doubt that she should have more than her own name more than life itself she knew she should have known his name but she didnt nothing had ever shamed her more thereafter whenever her own eyes were closed she saw his saw not only the helpless suffering in them but also the light of such fierce hope as could only be kindled by righteous love somewhere even in the worst of the darkness blanketing her mind she refused to let the light in his eyes be extinguished by her failure to will herself to live at some point she remembered his name most of the time she remembered it sometimes she didnt sometimes when pain smothered her she forgot even her own name now as kahlan heard men growling his name she knew it she knew him with tenacious resolution she clung to that namerichardand to her memory of hint of who he was of everything he meant to her even later when people had feared she would yet die she knew she would live she had to for richard her husband for the child she carried in her womb his child their child the sounds of angry men calling richard by name at last tugged kahlans eyes open she squinted against the agony that had been tempered if not banished while in the cocoon of sleep she was greeted by a blush of amber light filling the small room around her since the light wasnt bright she reasoned that there must be a covering over a window muting the sunlight or maybe it was dusk whenever she woke as now she not only had no sense of time but no sense of how long she had been asleep she worked her tongue against the pasty dryness in her mouth her body felt leaden with the thick lingering slumber she was as nauseated as the time when she was little and had eaten three candy green apples before a boat journey on a hot windy day it was hot like that now summer hot she struggled to rouse herself fully but her awaking awareness seemed adrift bobbing in a vast shadowy sea her stomach roiled she suddenly had to put all her mental effort into not throwing up she knew all too well that in her present condition few things hurt more than vomiting her eyelids sagged closed again and she foundered to a place darker yet she caught herself forced her thoughts to the surface and willed her eyes open again she remembered they gave her herbs to dull the pain and to help her sleep richard knew a good deal about herbs at least the herbs helped her drift into stuporous sleep the pain if not as sharp still found her there slowly carefully so as not to twist what felt like doubleedged daggers skewered here and there between her ribs she drew a deeper breath the fragrance of balsam and pine filled her lungs helping to settle her stomach it was not the aroma of trees among other smells in the forest among damp dirt and toadstools and cinnamon ferns but the redolence of trees freshly felled and limbed she concentrated on focusing her sight and saw beyond the foot of the bed a wall of pale newly peeled timber here and there oozing sap from fresh axe cuts the wood looked to have been split and hewn in haste yet its tight fit betrayed a precision only knowledge and experience could bestow the room was tiny in the confessors palace where she had grown up a room this small would not have qualified as a closet for linens moreover it would have been stone if not marble she liked the tiny wooden room she expected that richard had built it to protect her it felt almost like his sheltering arms around her marble with its aloof dignity never comforted her in that way beyond the foot of the bed she spotted a carving of a bird in flight it had been sculpted with a few sure strokes of a knife into a log of the wall on a flat spot only a little bigger than her hand richard had given her something to look at on occasion sitting around a campfire she had watched him casually carve a face or an animal from a scrap of wood the bird soaring on wings spread wide as it watched over her conveyed a sense of freedom turning her eyes to the right she saw a brown wool blanket hanging over the doorway from beyond the doorway came fragments of angry threatening voices its not by our choice richard we have our own families to think about wives and children wanting to know what was going on kahlan tried to push herself up onto her left elbow somehow her arm didnt work the way she had expected it to like a bolt of lightning pain blasted up the marrow of her bone and exploded through her shoulder gasping against the racking agony of attempted movement she dropped back before she had managed to lift her shoulder an inch off the bed her panting twisted the daggers piercing her sides she had to will herself to slow her breathing in order to get the stabbing pain under control as the worst of the torment in her arm and the stitches in her ribs eased she finally let out a soft moan with calculated calm she gazed down the length of her left arm the arm was spitted as soon as she saw it she remembered that of course it was she reproached herself for not thinking of it before she had tried to put weight on it the herbs she knew were making her thinking fuzzy fearing to make another careless movement and since she couldnt sit up she focused her effort on forcing clarity into her mind she cautiously reached up with her right hand and wiped her fingers across the bloom of sweat on her brow sweat sown by the flash of pain her right shoulder socket hurt but it worked well enough she was pleased by that triumph at least she touched her puffy eyes understanding then why it had hurt to look toward the door gingerly her fingers explored a foreign landscape of swollen flesh her imagination colored it a ghastly blackandblue when her fingers brushed cuts on her cheek hot embers seemed to sear raw exposed nerves she needed no mirror to know she was a terrible sight she knew too how bad it was whenever she looked up into richards eyes she wished she could look good for him if for no other reason than to lift the suffering from his eyes reading her thoughts he would say im fine stop worrying about me and put your mind to getting better with a bittersweet longing kahlan recalled lying with richard their limbs tangled in delicious exhaustion his skin hot against hers his big hand resting on her belly as they caught their breath it was agony wanting to hold him in her arms again and being unable to do so she reminded herself that it was only a matter of some time and some healing they were together and that was what mattered his mere presence was a restorative she heard richard beyond the blanket over the door speaking in a tightly controlled voice stressing his words as if each had cost him a fortune we just need some time the mens voices were heated and insistent as they all began talking at once its not because we want you to you should know that richard you know us what if it brings trouble here weve heard about the fighting you said yourself shes from the midlands we cant allow we wont kahlan listened expecting the sound of his sword being drawn richard had nearly infinite patience but little tolerance cara his bodyguard their friend was no doubt out there too cara had neither patience nor tolerance instead of drawing his sword richard said im not asking anyone to give me anything i want only to be left alone in a peaceful place where i can care for her i wanted to be close to hartland in case she needed something he paused please just until she has a chance to get better kahlan wanted to scream at him no dont you dare beg them richard they have no right to make you beg theyve no right they could never understand the sacrifices youve made but she could do little more than whisper his name in sorrow dont test us well burn you out if we have to you cant fight us allwe have right on our side the men ranted and swore dark oaths she expected now at last to hear the sound of his sword being drawn instead in a calm voice richard answered the men in words kahlan couldnt quite make out a dreadful quiet settled in its not because we like doing this richard someone finally said in a sheepish voice weve no choice weve got to consider our own families and everyone else another man spoke out with righteous indignation besides you seem to have gotten all highandmighty of a sudden with your fancy clothes and sword not like you used to be back when you were a woods guide thats right said another just because you went off and saw some of the world that dont mean you can come back here thinking youre better than us ive overstepped what you have all decided is my proper place richard said is this what you mean to say you turned your back on your community on your roots as i see it you think our women arent good enough for the great richard cypher no he had to marry some woman from away then you come back here and think to flaunt yourselves over us how by doing what marrying the woman i love this you see as vain this nullifies my right to live in peace and takes away her right to heal to get well and live these men knew him as richard cypher a simple woods guide not as the person he had discovered he was in truth and who he had become he was the same man as before but in so many ways they had never known him you ought to be on your knees praying for the creator to heal your wife another man put in all of mankind is a wretched and undeserving lot you ought to pray and ask the creators forgiveness for your evil deeds and sinfulnessthats what brought your troubles on you and your woman instead you want to bring your troubles among honest working folks youve no right to try to force your sinful troubles on us thats not what the creator wants you should be thinking of us the creator wants you to be humble and to help othersthats why he struck her down to teach you both a lesson did he tell you this albert richard asked does this creator of yours come to talk with you about his intentions and confide in you his wishes he talks to anyone who has the proper modest attitude to listen to him albert fumed besides another man spoke up this imperial order you warn about has some good things to be said for it if you werent so bullheaded richard youd see that theres nothing wrong with wanting to see everyone treated decent its only being fair minded its only right those are the creators wishes youve got to admit and thats what the imperial order teaches too if you cant see that much good in the orderwell then youd best be gone and soon kahlan held her breath in an ominous tone of voice richard said so be it these were men richard knew he had addressed them by name and reminded them of years and deeds shared he had been patient with them patience finally exhausted he had reached intolerance horses snorted and stomped their leather tack creaking as the men mounted up in the morning well be back to burn this place down wed better not catch you or yours anywhere near here or youll burn with it after a few last curses the men raced away the sound of departing hooves hammering the ground rumbled through kahlans back even that hurt she smiled a small smile for richard even if he couldnt see it she wished only that he had not begged on her behalf he would never she knew have begged for anything for himself light splashed across the wall as the blanket over the doorway was thrown back by the direction and quality of the light kahlan guessed it had to be somewhere in the middle of a thinly overcast day richard appeared beside her his tall form towering over her throwing a slash of shadow across her middle he wore a black sleeveless undershirt without his shirt or magnificent gold and black tunic leaving his muscular arms bare at his left hip the side toward her a flash of light glinted off the pommel of his singular sword his broad shoulders made the room seem even smaller than it had been only a moment before his cleanshaven face his strong jaw and the crisp line of his mouth perfectly complemented his powerful form his hair a color somewhere between blond and brown brushed the nape of his neck but it was the intelligence so clearly evident in those penetrating gray eyes of his that from the first had riveted her attention richard kahlan whispered i wont have you begging on my account the corners of his mouth tightened with the hint of a smile if i want to beg i shall do so he pulled her blanket up a little making sure she was snugly covered even though she was sweating i didnt know you were awake how long have i been asleep a while she figured it must have been quite a while she didnt remember arriving at this place or him building the house that now stood around her kahlan felt more like a person in her eighties than one in her twenties she had never been hurt before not grievously hurt anyway not to the point of being on the cusp of death and utterly helpless for so long she hated it and she hated that she couldnt do the simplest things for herself most of the time she detested that more than the pain she was stunned to understand so unexpectedly and so completely lifes frailty her own frailty her own mortality she had risked her life in the past and had been in danger many times but looking back she didnt know if she had ever truly believed that something like this could happen to her confronting the reality of it was crushing something inside seemed to have broken that nightsome idea of herself some confidence she could so easily have died their baby could have died before it even had a chance to live youre getting better richard said as if in answer to her thoughts im not just saying that i can see that youre healing she gazed into his eyes summoning the courage to finally ask how do they know about the order way up here people fleeing the fighting have been up this way men spreading the doctrine of the imperial order have been even here to where i grew up their words can sound goodalmost make senseif you dont think if you just feel truth doesnt seem to count for much he added in afterthought he answered the unspoken question in her eyes the men from the order are gone the fools out there were just spouting things theyve heard thats all but they intend us to leave they sound like men who keep the oaths theyve sworn he nodded but then some of his smile returned do you know that were very close to where i first met you last autumn do you remember how could i ever forget the day i met you our lives were in jeopardy back then and we had to leave here ive never regretted it it was the start of my life with you as long as were together nothing else really matters cara swept in through the doorway and came to a halt beside richard adding her shadow to his across the blue cotton blanket that covered kahlan to her armpits sheathed in skintight red leather caras body had the sleek grace of a falcon commanding swift and deadly mordsith always wore their red leather when they believed there was going to be trouble caras long blond hair swept back into a single thick braid was another mark of her profession of mordsith member of an elite corps of guards to the lord rahl himself richard had after a fashion inherited the mordsith when he inherited the rule of dhara a place he grew up never knowing command was not something he had sought nonetheless it had fallen to him now a great many people depended on him the entire new worldwestland the midlands and dhara depended on him how do you feel cara asked with sincere concern kahlan was able to summon little more voice than a hoarse whisper im better well if you feel better cara growled then tell lord rahl that he should allow me to do my job and put the proper respect into men like that her menacing blue eyes turned for a moment toward the spot where the men had been while delivering their threats the ones i leave alive anyway cara use your head richard said we cant turn this place into a fortress and protect ourselves every hour of every day those men are afraid no matter how wrong they are they view us as a danger to their lives and the lives of their families we know better than to fight a senseless battle when we can avoid it but richard kahlan said lifting her right hand in a weak gesture toward the wall before her youve built this only this room i wanted a shelter for you first it didnt take that long just some trees cut and split weve not built the rest of it yet its not worth shedding blood over if richard seemed calm cara looked ready to chew steel and spit nails would you tell this obstinate husband of yours to let me kill someone before i go crazy i cant just stand around and allow people to get away with threatening the two of you i am mordsith cara took her job of protecting richardthe lord rahl of dharaand kahlan very seriously where richards life was concerned cara was perfectly willing to kill first and decide later if it had been necessary that was one of the things for which richard had no tolerance kahlans only answer was a smile mother confessor you cant allow lord rahl to bow to the will of foolish men like those tell him kahlan could probably count on the fingers of one hand the people who in her whole life had ever addressed her by the name kahlan without at minimum the appellation confessor before it she had heard her ultimate titlemother confessorspoken countless times in tones ranging from awed reverence to shuddering fear many people as they knelt before her were incapable of even whispering through trembling lips the two words of her title others when alone whispered them with lethal intent kahlan had been named mother confessor while still in her early twentiesthe youngest confessor ever named to that powerful position but that was several years past now she was the only living confessor left kahlan had always endured the title the bowing and kneeling the reverence the awe the fear and the murderous intentions because she had no choice but more than that she was the mother confessorby succession and selection by right by oath and by duty cara always addressed kahlan as mother confessor but from caras lips the words were subtly different than from any others it was almost a challenge a defiance by scrupulous compliance but with a hint of an affectionate smirk coming from cara kahlan didnt hear mother confessor so much as she heard sister cara was from the distant land of dhara no one anywhere outranked cara as far as cara was concerned except the lord rahl the most she would allow was that kahlan could be her equal in duty to richard being considered an equal by cara though was high praise indeed when cara addressed richard as lord rahl however she was not saying brother she was saying precisely what she meant lord rahl to the men with the angry voices the lord rahl was as foreign a concept as was the distant land of dhara kahlan was from the midlands that separated dhara from westland the people here in westland knew nothing of the midlands or the mother confessor for decades the three parts of the new world had been separated by impassable boundaries leaving what was beyond those boundaries shrouded in mystery the autumn before those boundaries had fallen and then in the winter the common barrier to the south of the three lands that had for three thousand years sealed away the menace of the old world had been breached loosing the imperial order on them all in the last year the world had been thrown into turmoil everything everyone had grown up knowing had changed im not going to allow you to hurt people just because they refuse to help us richard said to cara it would solve nothing and only end up causing us more trouble what we started here only took a short time to build i thought this place would be safe but its not well simply move on he turned back to kahlan his voice lost its fire i was hoping to bring you home to some peace and quiet but it looks like home doesnt want me either im sorry just those men richard in the land of anderith just before kahlan had been attacked and beaten the people had rejected richards offer to join the emerging dharan empire he led in the cause of freedom instead the people of anderith willingly chose to side with the imperial order richard had taken kahlan and walked away from everything it seemed what about your real friends here i havent had time i wanted to get a shelter up first theres no time now maybe later kahlan reached for his hand which hung at his side his fingers were too far away but richard look its not safe to stay here anymore its as simple as that i brought you here because i thought it would be a safe place for you to recover and regain your strength i was wrong its not we cant stay here understand yes richard we have to move on yes richard there was something more to this she knewsomething of far greater importance than the more immediate ordeal it meant for her there was a distant troubled look in his eyes but what of the war everyone is depending on uson you i cant be much help until i get better but they need you right now the dharan empire needs you you are the lord rahl you lead them what are we doing here richard she waited until his eyes turned to look at her why are we running away when everyone is counting on us im doing as i must as you must what does that mean shadow shrouded his face as he looked away ive had a vision chapter a vision kahlan said in open astonishment richard hated anything to do with prophecy it had caused him no end of trouble prophecy was always ambiguous and usually cryptic no matter how clear it seemed on the surface the untrained were easily misled by its superficially simplistic construction unthinking adherence to a literal interpretation of prophecy had in the past caused great turmoil everything from murder to war as a result those involved with prophecy went to great lengths to keep it secret prophecy at least on the face of it was predestination richard believed that man created his own destiny he had once told her prophecy can only say that tomorrow the sun will come up it cant say what you are going to do with your day the act of going about your day is not the fulfillment of prophecy but the fulfillment of your own purpose shota the witch woman had prophesied that richard and kahlan would conceive an infamous son richard had more than once proven shotas view of the future to be if not fatally flawed at least vastly more complex than shota would have it seem like richard kahlan didnt accept shotas prediction on any number of occasions richards view of prophecy had been shown to be correct richard simply ignored what prophecy said and did as he believed he must by his doing so prophecy was in the end often fulfilled but in ways that could not have been foretold in this way prophecy was at once proven and disproved resolving nothing and only demonstrating what an eternal enigma it truly was richards grandfather zedd who had helped raise him not far from where they were had not only kept his own identity as a wizard secret in order to protect richard he also hid the fact that richard had been fathered by darken rahl and not george cypher the man who had loved and raised him darken rahl a wizard of great power had been the dangerous violent ruler of faroff dhara richard had inherited the gift of magic from two different bloodlines after killing darken rahl he had also inherited the rule of dhara a land that was in many ways as much a mystery to him as was his power kahlan being from the midlands had grown up around wizards richards ability was unlike that of any wizard she had ever known he possessed not one aspect of the gift but many and not one side but both he was a war wizard some of his outfit came from the wizards keep and had not been worn in three thousand yearssince the last war wizard lived with the gift dying out in mankind wizards were uncommon kahlan had known fewer than a dozen among wizards prophets were the most rare she knew of the existence of only two one of those was the more within the province of richards gift yet richard had always treated prophecy as a viper in his bed tenderly as if there were no more precious thing in the whole world richard lifted her hand you know how i always talk about the beautiful places only i know way back in the mountains to the west of where i grew up the special places ive always wanted to show you im going to take you there where well be safe dharans are bonded to you lord rahl cara reminded him and will be able to find you through that bond well our enemies arent bonded to me they wont know where we are cara seemed to find that thought agreeable if people dont go to this place then there wont be any roads how are we going to get the carriage there the mother confessor cant walk ill make a litter you and i will carry her in that cara nodded thoughtfully we could do that if there were no other people then the two of you would be safe at least safer than here i had expected the people here to leave us to ourselves i hadnt expected the order to foment unrest this far awayat least not this quickly those men usually arent a bad lot but theyre working themselves up into a dangerous mood the cowards have gone back to their womens skirts they wont be back until morning we can let the mother confessor rest and then leave before dawn richard cast cara a telling look one of those men albert has a son lester lester and his pal tommy lancaster once tried to put arrows into me for spoiling some fun tommy was about to have hurting someone now tommy and lester are missing a good many teeth albert will tell lester about us being here and soon after tommy lancaster will know too now that the imperial order has filled their heads with talk of a noble war on behalf of good those men will be fancying what it would be like to be war heroes they arent ordinarily violent but today they were more unreasonable than ive ever seen them theyll go drinking to fortify their courage tommy and lester will be with them by then and their tales of how i wronged them and how im a danger to decent folks will get everyone all worked up because they greatly outnumber us theyll begin to see the merit in killing ussee it as protecting their families and doing the right thing for the community and their creator full of liquor and glory they wont want to wait until morning theyll be back tonight we have to leave now cara seemed unconcerned i say we wait for them and when they come back we end the threat some of them will bring along other friends there will be a lot of them by the time they get here we have kahlan to think about i dont want to risk one of us being injured theres nothing to be gained by fighting them richard pulled the ancient tooledleather baldric holding the goldandsilverwrought scabbard and sword off over his head and hung it on the stump of a branch sticking out of a log looking unhappy cara folded her arms she would rather not leave a threat alive richard picked his folded black shirt off the floor to the side where kahlan hadnt seen it he poked an arm through a sleeve and drew it on a vision kahlan finally asked again as much trouble as the men could be they were not her biggest concern just then youve had a vision the sudden clarity of it felt like a vision but it was really more of a revelation revelation she wished she could manage more than a hoarse whisper and what form did this vision revelation thing take understanding kahlan stared up at him understanding of what he started buttoning his shirt through this realization ive come to understand the larger picture ive come to understand what it is i must do yes cara muttered and wait until you hear it go ahead tell her richard glared at cara and she answered him in kind his attention finally returned to kahlan if i lead us into this war we will lose a great many people will die for nothing the result will be a world enslaved by the imperial order if i dont lead our side in battle the world will still fall under the shadow of the order but far fewer people will die only in that way will we ever stand a chance by losing you want to lose first and then fight how can we even consider abandoning the fight for freedom anderith helped teach me a lesson he said his voice was restrained as if he regretted what he was saying i cant press this war freedom requires effort if it is to be won and vigilance if it is to be maintained people just dont value freedom until its taken away but many do kahlan objected there are always some but most dont even understand it nor do they care tothe same as with magic people mindlessly shrink from it too without seeing the truth the order offers them a world without magic and readymade answers to everything servitude is simple i thought that i could convince people of the value of their own lives and of liberty in anderith they showed me just how foolish i had been anderith is just one place anderith was not remarkable look at all the trouble weve had elsewhere were having trouble even here where i grew up richard began tucking in his shirt forcing people to fight for freedom is the worst kind of contradiction nothing i can say will inspire people to careive tried those who value liberty will have to run to hide to try to survive and endure what is sure to come i cant prevent it i cant help them i know that now but richard how can you even think of i must do what is best for us i must be selfish life is far too precious to be casually squandered on useless causes there can be no greater evil than that people can only be saved from the coming dark age of subjugation and servitude if they too come to understand and care about the value of their own lives their freedom and are willing to act in their own interest we must try to stay alive in the hope that such a day will come but we can prevail in this war we must do you think that i can just go off and lead men into war and because i wish it we will win we wont it takes more than my wishing it it will take vast numbers of people fully committed to the cause we dont have that if we throw our forces against the order we will be destroyed and any chance for winning freedom in the future will be forever lost he raked his fingers back through his hair we must not lead our forces against the army of the order he turned to pulling his black opensided tunic on over his head kahlan struggled to give force to her voice to the magnitude of her concern but what about all those who are prepared to fightall the armies already in the field there are good men able men ready to go against jagang and stop his imperial order and drive them back to the old world who will lead our men lead them to what death they cant win kahlan was horrified she reached up and snatched his shirtsleeve before he could lean down to retrieve his broad overbelt richard youre only saying this walking away from the struggle because of what happened to me no i had already decided it that same night before you were attacked when i went out alone for a walk after the vote i did a lot of thinking i came to this realization and made up my mind what happened to you made no difference except to prove the point that im right and should have figured it out sooner if i had you would never have been hurt but if the mother confessor had not been hurt you would have felt better by morning and changed your mind light coming through the doorway behind him lit in a blaze of gold the ancient symbols coiled along the squared edges of his tunic cara what would happen if id been attacked with her and we had both been killed what would you all do then i dont know that is why i withdraw you are all following me not participating in a struggle for your own future your answer should have been that you would all fight on for yourselves for your freedom i have come to understand the mistake ive made in this and to see that we cannot win in this way the order is too large an opponent kahlans father king wyborn had taught her about fighting against such odds and she had practical experience at it their army may outnumber ours but that doesnt make it impossible we just have to outthink them i will be there to help you richard we have seasoned officers we can do it we must look how the orders cause spreads on words that sound goodrichard swept out an armeven to distant places like this we know beyond doubt the evil of the order yet people everywhere passionately side with them despite the ghastly truth of everything the imperial order stands for richard kahlan whispered trying not to lose what was left of her voice i led those young galean recruits against an army of experienced order soldiers who greatly outnumbered us and we prevailed exactly they had just seen their home city after the order had been there everyone they loved had been murdered everything they knew had been destroyed those men fought with an understanding of what they were doing and why they were going to throw themselves at the enemy with or without you commanding them but they were the only ones and even though they succeeded most of them were killed in the struggle kahlan was incredulous so you are going to let the order do the same elsewhere so as to give people a reason to fight you are going to stand aside and let the order slaughter hundreds of thousands of innocent people you want to quit because i was hurt dear spirits i love you richard but dont do this to me im the mother confessor im responsible for the lives of the people of the midlands dont do this because of what happened to me richard snapped on his leatherpadded silver wristbands im not doing this because of what happened to you im helping save those lives in the only way that has a chance im doing the only thing i can do you are doing the easy thing cara said richard met her challenge with quiet sincerity cara im doing the hardest thing i have ever had to do kahlan was sure now that their rejection by the anderith people had hit him harder than she had realized she caught two of his fingers and squeezed sympathetically he had put his heart into sparing those people from enslavement by the order he had tried to show them the value of freedom by allowing them the freedom to choose their own destiny he had put his faith in their hands in a crushing defeat an enormous majority had spurned all he had offered and in so doing devastated that faith kahlan thought that perhaps with some time to heal the same as with her the pain would fade for him too you cant hold yourself to blame for the fall of anderith richard you did your best it wasnt your fault he picked up his big leather overbelt with its goldworked pouches and cinched it over the magnificent tunic when youre the leader everything is your fault kahlan knew the truth of that she thought to dissuade him by taking a different tack what form did this vision assume richards piercing gray eyes locked on her almost in warning vision revelation realization postulation prophecy understanding call it what you will for in this they are all in one the same and unequivocal i cant describe it but to say it seems as if i must have always known it maybe i have it wasnt so much words as it was a complete concept a conclusion a truth that became absolutely clear to me she knew he expected her to leave it at that if it became so clear and is unambiguous she pressed you must be able to express it in words richard slipped the baldric over his head laying it over his right shoulder as he adjusted the sword against his left hip light sparkled off the raised gold wire woven through the silver wire of the hilt to spell out the word truth his brow was smooth and his face calm she knew she had at last brought him to the heart of the matter his certainty would afford him no reason to keep it from her if she chose to hear it and she did his words rolled forth with quiet power like prophecy come to life i have been a leader too soon it is not i who must prove myself to the people but the people who must now prove themselves to me until then i must not lead them or all hope is lost standing there erect masculine masterful in his black war wizard outfit he looked as if he could be posing for a statue of who he was the seeker of truth rightfully named by zeddicus zuzorander the first wizard himselfand richards grandfather it had nearly broken zedds heart to do so because seekers so often died young and violently while he lived a seeker was a law unto himself backed by the awesome power of his sword a seeker could bring down kingdoms that was one reason it was so important to name the right persona moral personto the post zedd claimed that the seeker in a way named himself by the nature of his own mind and by his actions and that the first wizards function was simply to act on his observations by officially naming him and giving him the weapon that was to be his lifelong companion so many different qualities and responsibilities had converged in this man she loved that she sometimes wondered how he could reconcile them all richard are you so sure because of the importance of the past kahlan and then zedd had sworn their lives in defense of richard as the newly named seeker of truth that had been shortly after kahlan had met him it was as seeker that richard had first come to accept all that had been thrust upon him and to live up to the extraordinary trust put in him his gray eyes fairly blazed with clarity of purpose as he answered her the only sovereign i can allow to rule me is reason the first law of reason is this what exists exists what is is from this irreducible bedrock principle all knowledge is built this is the foundation from which life is embraced reason is a choice wishes and whims are not facts nor are they a means to discovering them reason is our only way of grasping realityits our basic tool of survival we are free to evade the effort of thinking to reject reason but we are not free to avoid the penalty of the abyss we refuse to see if i fail to use reason in this struggle if i close my eyes to the reality of what is in favor of what i would wish then we will both die in this and for nothing we will be but two more among uncounted millions of nameless corpses beneath the gray gloomy decay of mankind in the darkness that will follow our bones will be meaningless dust eventually perhaps a thousand years from now perhaps more the light of liberty will again be raised up to shine over a free people but between now and then millions upon millions of people will be born into hopeless misery and have no choice but to bear the weight of the orders yoke we by ignoring reason will have purchased those mountains of broken bodies the wreckage of lives endured but never lived kahlan found herself unable to summon the courage to speak much less argue to do so right then would be to ask him to disregard his judgment at a cost he believed would be a sea of blood but doing as he saw they must would cast her people helpless into the jaws of death kahlan her vision turning to a watery blur looked away cara richard said get the horses hitched to the carrage im going to scout a circle to make sure we dont have any surprises i will scout while you hitch the horses i am your guard youre my friend too i know this land better than you hitch the horses and dont give me any trouble about it cara rolled her eyes and huffed but marched off to do his bidding the room rang with silence richards shadow slipped off the blanket when kahlan whispered her love to him he paused and looked back his shoulders seemed to betray the weight he carried i wish i could but i cant make people understand freedom im sorry from somewhere inside kahlan found a smile for him maybe it isnt so hard she gestured toward the bird he had carved in the wall just show them that and they will understand what freedom really means to soar on your own wings richard smiled she thought gratefully before he vanished through the doorway chapter all the troubling thoughts tumbling through her mind kept kahlan from falling back to sleep she tried not to think about richards vision of the future as exhausted as she was by pain his words were too troubling to contemplate and besides there was nothing she could do about it right then but she was determined to help him get over the loss of anderith and focus on stopping the imperial order it was more difficult to shake her thoughts about the men who had been outside men richard had grown up with the haunting memory of their angry threats echoed in her mind she knew that ordinary men who had never before acted violently could in the right circumstances be incited to great brutality with the way they viewed mankind as sinful wretched and evil it was only a small step more to actually doing evil after all any evil they might do they had already rationalized as being predestined by what they viewed as mans inescapable nature it was unnerving to contemplate an attack by such men when she could do nothing but lie there waiting to be killed kahlan envisioned a grinning toothless tommy lancaster leaning over her to cut her throat while all she could do was stare helplessly up at him she had often been afraid in battle but at least then she could fight with all her strength to survive that helped counter the fear it was different to be helpless and have no means to fight back it was a different sort of fear if she had to she could always resort to her confessors power but in her condition that was a dubious proposition she had never had to call upon her power when in anything like the condition in which she now found herself she reminded herself that the three of them would be long gone before the men returned and besides richard and cara would never let them get near her kahlan had a more immediate fear though and that one was all too real but she wouldnt feel it for long she would pass out she knew she hoped she tried not to think of it and instead put her hand gently over her belly over their child as she listened to the nearby splashing and burbling of a stream the sound of the water reminded her of how much she wished she could take a bath the bandages over the oozing wound in her side stank and needed to be changed often the sheets were soaked with sweat her scalp itched the mat of grass that was the bedding under the sheet was hard and chafed her back richard had probably made the pallet quickly planning to improve it later as hot as the day was the streams cold water would be welcome she longed for a bath to be clean and to smell fresh she longed to be better to be able to do things for herself to be healed she could only hope that as time passed richard too would recover from his invisible but real wounds cara finally returned grumbling about the horses being stubborn today she looked up to see the room was empty i had better go look for him and make sure hes safe hes fine he knows what hes doing just wait cara or he will then have to go out and look for you cara sighed and reluctantly agreed retrieving a cool wet cloth she set to mopping kahlans forehead and temples kahlan didnt like to complain when people were doing their best to care for her so she didnt say anything about how much it hurt her torn neck muscles when her head was shifted in that way cara never complained about any of it cara only complained when she believed her charges were in needless dangerand when richard wouldnt let her eliminate those she viewed as a danger outside a bird let out a highpitched trill the tedious repetition was becoming grating in the distance kahlan could hear a squirrel chattering an objection to something or perhaps arguing over his territory hed been doing it for what seemed an hour the stream babbled on without letup this was richards idea of restful i hate this she muttered you should be happylying about without anything to do and i bet you would be happy to trade places i am mordsith for a mordsith nothing could be worse than to die in bed her blue eyes turned to kahlans old and toothless she added i didnt mean that you i know what you meant cara looked relieved anyway you couldnt diethat would be too easy you never do anything easy i married richard see what i mean kahlan smiled cara dunked the cloth in a pail on the floor and wrung it out as she stood it isnt too bad is it just lying there how would you like to have to have someone push a wooden bowl under your bottom every time your bladder was full cara carefully blotted the damp cloth along kahlans neck i dont mind doing it for a sister of the agiel the agiel the weapon a mordsith always carried looked like nothing more than a short red leather rod hanging on a fine chain from her right wrist a mord siths agiel was never more than a flick away from her grip it somehow functioned by means of the magic of a mordsiths bond to the lord rahl kahlan had once felt the partial touch of an agiel in a blinding instant it could inflict the kind of pain that the entire gang of men had dealt kahlan the touch of a mordsiths agiel was easily capable of delivering bonebreaking torture and just as easily if she desired death richard had given kahlan the agiel that had belonged to denna the mordsith who had captured him by order of darken rahl only richard had ever come to understand and empathize with the pain an agiel also gave the mordsith who wielded it before he was forced to kill denna in order to escape she had given him her agiel asking to be remembered as simply denna the woman beyond the appellation of mordsith the woman no one but richard had ever before seen and understood that kahlan understood and kept the agiel as a symbol of that same respect for women whose young lives had been stolen and twisted to nightmare purposes and duties was deeply meaningful to the other mordsith because of that compassionuntainted by pityand more cara had named kahlan a sister of the agiel it was an informal but heartfelt accolade messengers have come to see lord rahl cara said you were sleeping and lord rahl saw no reason to wake you she added in answer to kahlans questioning look the messengers were dharan and able to find richard by their bond to him as their lord rahl kahlan not able to duplicate the feat had always found it unsettling what did they have to say cara shrugged not a lot jagangs army of the imperial order remains in anderith for the time being with reibischs force staying safely to the north to watch and be ready should the order decide to threaten the rest of the midlands we know little of the situation inside anderith under the orders occupation the rivers flow away from our men toward the sea so they have not seen bodies to indicate if there has been mass death but there have been a few people who managed to escape they report that there was some death due to the poison which was released but they dont know how widespread it was general reibisch has sent scouts and spies in to learn what they will what orders did richard give them to take back none none he sent no orders cara shook her head and then leaned over to dunk the cloth again he wrote letters to the general though she drew the blanket down lifted the bandage at kahlans side and inspected its weak red charge before tossing it on the floor with a gentle touch she cleaned the wound when kahlan was able to get her breath she asked did you see the letters yes they say much the same as he has told youthat he has had a vision that has caused him to come to see the nature of what he must do he explained to the general that he could not give orders for fear of causing the end of our chances did general reibisch answer lord rahl has had a vision dharans know the lord rahl must deal with the terrifying mysteries of magic dharans do not expect to understand their lord rahl and would not question his behavior he is the lord rahl the general made no comment but sent word that he would use his own judgment richard had probably told them it was a vision rather than say it was simply a realization for that very reason kahlan considered that a moment weighing the possibilities we have that much luck then general reibisch is a good man and will know what to do before too long ill be up and about by then maybe richard will be better too cara tossed the cloth into the pail as she leaned closer her brow creased with frustration and concern mother confessor lord rahl said he will not act to lead us until the people prove themselves to him im getting better i hope to help him get over what happened and help him to see that he must fight but this involves magic she picked at the frayed edge of the blue blanket lord rahl said its a vision if it is magic then its something he would know about and must handle in the way he sees it must be done we need to be a little understanding of what hes been throughthe loss weve all suffered to the orderand remember too that richard didnt grow up around magic much less ruling armies cara squatted and rinsed her cloth in the pail after wringing it out she went back to cleaning the wound in kahlans side he is the lord rahl though hasnt he already proven himself to be a master of magic a number of times kahlan couldnt dispute that much of it but he still didnt have much experience and experience was valuable cara not only feared magic but was easily impressed by any act of wizardry like most people she couldnt distinguish between a simple conjuring and the kind of magic that could alter the very nature of the world kahlan realized now that this wasnt a vision as such but a conclusion richard had arrived at much of what hed said made sense but kahlan believed that emotion was clouding his thinking cara looked up from her work her voice bore an undertone of uncertainty if not despairing bewilderment mother confessor how will the people ever be able to prove themselves to lord rahl ive no idea cara set down the cloth and looked kahlan in the eye it was a long uncomfortable moment before she finally decided to speak mother confessor i think maybe lord rahl has lost his mind kahlans immediate thought was to wonder if general reibisch might believe the same thing i thought dharans do not expect to understand their lord rahl and would not question his behavior lord rahl also says he wants me to think for myself kahlan put her hand over caras how many times have we doubted him before remember the chicken thatwasntachicken we both thought he was crazy he wasnt this is not some monster chasing us this is something much bigger cara do you always follow richards orders of course not he must be protected and i cant allow his foolishness to interfere with my duty i only follow his orders if they do not endanger him or if they tell me to do what i would have done anyway or if it involves his male pride did you always follow darken rahls orders cara stiffened at the unexpected encounter with the name as if speaking it might summon him back from the world of the dead you followed darken rahls orders no matter how foolish they were or you were tortured to death which lord rahl do you respect i would lay down my life for any lord rahl cara hesitated and then touched her fingertips to the red leather over her heart but i could never feel this way for any other i love lord rahl not like you love him not like a woman loves a man but it is still love sometimes i have dreams of how proud i am to serve and defend him and sometimes i have nightmares that i will fail him caras brow drew down with sudden dread you wont tell him that i said i love him will you he must not know kahlan smiled cara i think he already knows because he has similar feelings about you but if you dont wish it i wont say anything cara let out a sigh of relief good and what made you come to feel that way about him many things he wishes us to think for ourselves he allows us to serve him by choice no lord rahl has ever done that before i know that if i said i wished to quit him he would let me go he would not have me tortured to death for it he would wish me a good life that and more is what you value about him he never pretended any claim to your lives he believes no such claim can ever rightfully exist its the first time since you were captured and trained to be mordsith that you have felt the reality of freedom that cara is what richard wants for everyone she swished a hand as if dismissing the seriousness of the whole thing he would be foolish to grant me my freedom if i asked for it he needs me too much you wouldnt need to ask for your freedom cara and you know it you already have your freedom and because of him you know that too thats what makes him a leader you are honored to follow thats why you feel the way you do about him he has earned your loyalty cara mulled it over i still think he has lost his mind in the past richard had more than once expressed his faith that given a chance people would do the right thing that was what he had done with the mordsith that was also what he had done with the people of anderith now kahlan swallowed back her emotion not his mind cara but maybe his heart cara seeing the look on kahlans face dismissed the seriousness of the matter with a shrug and a smile i guess we will simply have to bring him around to the way things are going to betalk some sense into him cara dabbed away the remnant of a tear as it rolled down kahlans cheek before he comes back how about getting that stupid wooden bowl for me cara nodded and bent to retrieve it kahlan was already fretting knowing how much it was going to hurt but there was no avoiding it cara came up with the shallow bowl before those men came i was planning on making a fire and warming some water i was going to give you a bed bathyou know with a soapy cloth and a bucket of warm water i guess i can do it when we get where we are going kahlan half closed her eyes with the dreamy thought of being at least somewhat clean and fresh she thought she needed a bath even more than she needed the wooden bowl to relieve herself cara if you would do that for me i would kiss your feet when i get better and name you to the most important post i can think of i am mordsith cara looked nonplussed she finally drew the blanket down that is the most important post there isexcept perhaps wife to the lord rahl since he already has a wife and i am already mordsith i will have to be content with having my feet kissed kahlan chuckled but a stab of pain through her abdomen and ribs brought it to an abrupt halt richard was a long time in returning cara had made kahlan drink two cups of cold tea heavily laced with herbs to dull the pain it wouldnt be long before she was in a stupor if not exactly asleep kahlan had been just about to yield to caras desire to go look for richard when he called from a distance to let them know it was him did you see any of the men cara asked when he appeared in the doorway with a straight finger richard swiped glistening beads of sweat off his forehead his damp hair was plastered to his neck no theyre no doubt off to hartland to do some drinking and complaining by the time they come back well be long gone i still say we should lie in wait and end the threat cara muttered richard ignored her i cut and stripped some stout saplings and used some canvas to make a litter he came closer and with a knuckle nudged kahlans chin as if to playfully buck up her courage from now on well just let you stay on the litter and then we can move you in and out of the carriage without he had that look in his eyesthat look that hurt her to see he showed her a smile it will make it easier on cara and me kahlan tried to face the thought with composure were ready then his gaze dropped as he nodded good kahlan said cheerfully im in the mood for a nice ride id like to see some of the countryside he smiled more convincingly this time she thought you shall have it and well end up at a beautiful place its going to take a while to get there traveling as slow as we must but it will be worth the journey youll see kahlan tried to keep her breathing even she said his name over and over in her head telling herself that she would not forget it this time that she would not forget her own name she hated forgetting things it made her feel a fool to learn things she should have remembered but had forgotten she was going to remember this time well do i have to get up and walk or are you going to be a gentleman and carry me he bent and kissed her foreheadthe one part on her face that the soft touch of his lips would not hurt he glanced at cara and tilted his head to signal her to get kahlans legs will those men be drinking a long time kahlan asked its still midday dont worry well be long gone before they ever get back here im sorry richard i know you thought these people from your homeland theyre people just like everyone else she nodded as she fondly stroked the back of his big hand cara gave me some of your herbs ill sleep for a long time so dont go slow on my accounti wont feel it i dont want you to have to fight all those men i wont be doing any fighting just traveling my forests thats good kahlan felt daggers twist in her ribs as her breathing started getting too fast i love you you know in case i forgot to say it i love you despite the pain in his gray eyes he smiled i love you too just try to relax cara and i will be as gentle as we can well go easy theres no rush dont try to help us just relax youre getting better so it wont be so hard she had been hurt before and knew that it was always better to move yourself because you knew exactly how to do it but she couldnt move herself this time she had come to know that the worst thing when you were hurt was to have someone else move you as he leaned over she slipped her right arm around his neck while he carefully slid his left arm under her shoulders being lifted even that much ignited a shock of pain kahlan tried to ignore the burning stitch and attempted to relax as she said his name over and over in her mind she suddenly remembered something important it was her last chance to remind him richard she whispered urgently just before he pushed his right arm under her bottom to lift her please remember to be careful not to hurt the baby she was startled to see her words stagger him it took a moment before his eyes turned up to look into hers what she saw there nearly stopped her heart kahlan you remember dont you remember his eyes glistened that you lost the baby when you were attacked the memory slammed into her like a fist nearly taking her breath oh are you all right yes i forgot for a moment i just wasnt thinking i remember now i remember you told me about it and she did their child their child that had only begun to grow in her was long since dead and gone those beasts who had attacked her had taken that from her too the world seemed to turn gray and lifeless im so sorry kahlan he whispered she caressed his hair no richard i should have remembered im sorry i forgot i didnt mean to he nodded she felt a warm tear drop onto the hollow of her throat close to her necklace the necklace with its small dark stone had been a wedding gift from shota the witch woman the gift was a proposal of truce shota said it would allow them to be together and share their love as they had always wanted without kahlan getting pregnant richard and kahlan had decided that for the time being they would reluctantly accept shotas gift her truce they already had worries enough on their hands but for a time when the chimes had been loose in the world the magic of the necklace unbeknownst to richard and kahlan had failed one small but miraculous balance to the horrors the chimes had brought had been that it had given their love the opportunity to bring a child to life now that life was gone please richard lets go he nodded again dear spirits he whispered to himself so softly she could hardly hear him forgive me for what i am about to do she clutched his neck she now longed for what was comingshe wanted to forget he lifted her as gently as he could it felt like wild stallions tied to each limb all leaped into a gallop at the same instant pain ripped up from the core of her the shock of it making her eyes go wide as she sucked in a breath and then she screamed the blackness hit her like a dungeon door slamming shut chapter a sound woke her as suddenly as a slap kahlan lay on her back still as death her eyes wide listening it wasnt so much that the sound had been loud but that it had been something disturbingly familiar something dangerous her whole body throbbed with pain but she was more awake than she had been in what seemed like weeks she didnt know how long she had been asleep or perhaps unconscious she was awake enough to remember that it would be a grave mistake to try to sit up because just about the only part of her not injured was her right arm one of the big chestnut geldings snorted nervously and stamped a hoof jostling the carnage enough to remind kahlan of her broken ribs the sticky air smelled of approaching rain though fits of wind still bore dust to her nostrils dark masses of leaves overhead swung fretfully to and fro their creaking branches giving voice to their torment deep purple and violet clouds scudded past in silence beyond the trees and clouds the field of blueblack sky held a lone star high over her forehead she wasnt sure if it was dawn or dusk but it felt like the death of day as the gusts beat strands of her filthy hair across her face kahlan listened as hard as she could for the sound that didnt belong still hoping to fit it into a picture of something innocent since shed heard it only from the deepness of sleep its conscious identity remained frustratingly out of her reach she listened too for sounds of richard and cara but heard nothing surely they would be close they would not leave her alonenot for any reason this side of death she recoiled from the image she ached to call out for richard and prove the uninvited thought a foolish fear but instinct screamed at her to stay silent she needed no reminder not to move a metallic clang came from the distance then a cry maybe it was an animal she told herself ravens sometimes let out the most awful cries their shrill wails could sound so human it was eerie but as far as she knew ravens didnt make metallic sounds the carriage suddenly lurched to the right her breath caught as the unanticipated movement caused a stitch of pain in the back of her ribs someone had put weight on the step by the careless disregard for the carriages injured passenger she knew it wasnt richard or cara but if it wasnt richard then who gooseflesh tickled the nape of her neck if it wasnt richard where was he stubby fingers grasped the top of the corded chafing strip on the carriages side rail the blunt fingertips were rounded back over grubby gnaweddown little halfbutton fingernails kahlan held her breath hoping he didnt realize she was in the carriage a face popped up cunning dark eyes squinted at her the mans four middle upper teeth were missing leaving his eyeteeth looking like fangs when he grinned well well if it aint the wife of the late richard cypher kahlan lay frozen this was just like her dreams for an instant she couldnt decide if it was only that just a dream or real his shirt bore a dark patina of dirt as if it was never removed for anything sparse wiry hairs on his fleshy cheeks and chin were like early weeds in the plowed field of his pockmarked face his upper lip was wet from his runny nose he had no lower teeth in front the tip of his tongue rested partway out between the yawning gap of his smirk he brought up a knife for her to see he turned it this way and that almost as if he were showing off a prized possession to a shy girl he was courting his eyes kept flicking back and forth between the knife and kahlan the slipshod job of sharpening appeared to have been done on rough granite rather than on a proper whetstone dark blotches and rust stained the poorly kept cheap steel but the scratched and chipped edge was no less deadly for any of it his wicked toothless grin widened with pleasure as her gaze followed the blade watching it carve careful slices of the air between them she made herself look into his dark sunken eyes which peered out from puffy slits wheres richard she demanded in a level voice dancing with the spirits in the underworld he cocked his head to one side wheres the blond bitch the one my friends said they saw before the one with the smart mouth the one what needs to have her tongue shortened before i gut her kahlan glared at him so he would know she had no intention of answering as the crude knife advanced toward her his stench hit her you would have to be tommy lancaster the knife paused howd you know that anger welled up from deep inside her richard told me about you the eyes glittered with menace his grin widened yeah what did he tell you that you were an ugly toothless pig who wets his pants whenever he grins smells like he was right the smirking grin turned to a scowl he raised up on the step and leaned in with the knife that was what kahlan wanted him to doto get close enough so she could touch him with the discipline borne of a lifetime of experience she mentally shed her anger and donned the calm of a confessor committed to a course of action once a confessor was resolved to releasing her power the nature of time itself seemed to change she had but to touch him a confessors power was partly dependent on her strength in her injured condition she didnt know if she would be able to call forth the required force and if she could whether she would survive the unleashing of it but she knew she had no choice one of them was about to die maybe both he leaned his elbow on the side rail his fist with the knife went for her exposed throat rather than watching the knife kahlan watched the little scars like dusty white cobwebs caught on his knuckles when the fist was close enough she made her move to snatch his wrist unexpectedly she discovered she was snugly enfolded in the blue blanket she hadnt realized richard had placed her on the litter hed made the blanket was wrapped around her and tightly tucked under the stretcher poles in order to hold her as still as possible and prevent her from being hurt when the carriage was moving her arm was trapped inside what was about to become her death shroud hot panic flared up as she struggled to free her right arm she was in a desperate race with the blade coming for her throat pain knifed her injured ribs as she battled with the blanket she had no time to cry out or to curse in frustration at being so unwittingly snared her fingers gathered a fold of material she yanked at it trying to pull some slack from under the litter she lay atop so she could free her arm kahlan had merely to touch him but she couldnt his blade was going to be the only contact between them her only hope was that maybe his knuckles would brush her flesh or maybe he just might be close enough as he started to slice her throat that she could press her chin against his hand then she could release her power if she was still aliveif he didnt cut too deep first as she twisted and pulled at the blanket it seemed to her an eternity as she watched the blade poised over her exposed neck an eternity to wait before she had any hope of unleashing her poweran eternity to live but she knew there was only an instant more before she would feel the ripping slash of that rough blade it didnt happen at all as she expected tommy lancaster wrenched backward with an earsplitting shriek the world around kahlan crashed back in a riot of sound and motion with the abrupt readjustment to the discontinuation of her intent kahlan saw cara behind him her teeth clenched in a grim commitment of her own in her pristine red leather she was a precious ruby behind a clod of dirt bent into the agiel pressed against his back tommy lancaster had less hope of pulling away from cara than if she had impaled him on a meat hook his torment would not have been more brutal to witness his shrieks more painful to hear caras agiel dragged up and around the side of his ribs as he collapsed to his knees each rib the agiel passed over broke with a sharp crack like the sound of a tree limb snapping vivid red the match of her leather oozed over his knuckles and down his fingers the knife clattered to the rocky ground a dark stain of blood grew on the side of his shirt until it dripped off the untucked tails cara stood over him an austere executioner watching him beg for mercy instead of granting it she pressed her agiel against his throat and followed him to the ground his eyes were wide and white all around as he choked it was a slow agonizing journey toward death tommy lancasters arms and legs writhed as he began to drown in his own blood cara could have ended it quickly but it didnt appear she had any intention of doing so this man had meant to kill kahlan cara meant to extract a heavy price for the crime cara kahlan was surprised that she could get so much power into the shout cara glanced back over her shoulder tommy lancasters hands went to his throat and he gasped for air when she rose up to stand over him cara stop it wheres richard richard may need your help cara leaned down over tommy lancaster pressed her agiel to his chest and gave it a twist his left leg kicked out once his arms flopped to the side and he went still before either cara or kahlan could say anything richard his face set in cold ferocity sprinted up toward the carriage he had his sword to hand the blade was dark and wet the instant kahlan saw his sword she comprehended what had awakened her the sound had been the sword of truth announcing its arrival in the evening air in her sleep her subconscious recognized the unique ring of steel made by the sword of truth when it was drawn and she instinctively grasped the danger that that sound represented on his way to kahlans side richard only glanced at the lifeless body at caras feet are you all right kahlan nodded fine belatedly yet feeling triumphant at the accomplishment she pulled her arm free of the blanket richard turned to cara anyone else come up the road no just this one she gestured with her agiel toward the knife on the ground he intended to cut the mother confessors throat if tommy lancaster hadnt already been dead richards glare would have finished him i hope you didnt make it easy on him no lord rahl he regretted his last vile acti made certain of it with his sword richard indicated the surrounding area stay here and keep your eyes open im sure we got them all but im going to check just to be certain no one else was holding back and trying to surprise us from another direction no one will get near the mother confessor lord rahl dust rose in the gloomy light when he gave a reassuring pat to the shoulder of one of the two horses standing in their harnesses soon as i get back i want to get going we should have enough moonfor a few hours anyway i know a safe place to make camp about four hours up the road that will get us a good distance away from all this he pointed with his sword drag his body past the brush over there and roll him off the edge down into the ravine id just as soon the bodies werent found until after were long gone and far away probably only the animals will ever find them way out here but i dont want to take any chances cara snatched a fistful of tommy lancasters hair with pleasure he was stocky but the weight gave her no difficulty richard trotted soundlessly off into the gathering darkness kahlan listened to the sound of the body scraping across the ground she heard small branches snapping as cara pulled the dead weight through the brush and then the muffled thuds and tumbling scree as tommy lancasters body rolled and bounced down a steep slope it was a long time before kahlan heard the final thump at the bottom of the ravine cara ambled back to the side of the carnage everything all right with you she casually pulled off her armored gloves kahlan blinked at the woman cara he nearly had me cara flicked her long blond braid back over her shoulder as she scanned the surrounding area no he didnt i was standing right there behind him the whole time i was nearly breathing down his neck i never took my eyes from his knife he had no chance to harm you she met kahlans gaze surely you must have seen me no i didnt oh i thought you saw me looking a little sheepish she tucked most of the cuffs of the gloves behind her belt and folded the rest down over the front i guess maybe you were too low in the carriage to see me there behind him i had my attention on him i didnt mean to let him frighten you if you were there the whole time why did you allow him to nearly kill me he did not nearly kill you cara smiled without humor but i wanted to let him believe it its more of a shock more of a horror if you let them think theyve won it crushes a mans spirit to take him then when youve caught him dead to rights kahlans head was swimming in confusion and so she decided not to press the issue whats going on whats happened how long have i been asleep we have been traveling for two days you have been in and out of sleep but you didnt know anything the times you were awake lord rahl was fretful about hurting you to get you into the carnage and about having told you what you forgot kahlan knew what cara meant her dead baby and the men they came after us this time though lord rahl didnt discuss it with them she seemed especially pleased about that he knew in enough time that they were coming so we werent taken by surprise when they came charging in some with arrows noched and some with their swords or axes out he shouted at themoncegiving them a chance to change their minds he tried to reason with them even then well not exactly he told them to go home in peace or they would all die and then what and then they all laughed it only seemed to embolden them they charged arrows flying swords and axes raised so lord rahl ran off into the woods he did what before they came he had told me that he was going to make them all chase after him as lord rahl ran the one who thought he would cut your throat yelled at the others to get richard and finish him this time lord rahl had hoped he would draw them all away from you but when that one went after you instead lord rahl gave me a look and i knew what he wanted me to do cara clasped her hands behind her back as she scrutinized the gathering darkness keeping watch should anyone try to surprise them kahlans thoughts turned to richard and what it must have been like all alone as they chased him how many men i didnt count them cara shrugged maybe two dozen and you left richard alone with two dozen men chasing after him two dozen men intent on killing him cara shot kahlan an incredulous look and leave you unprotected when i knew that toothless brute was going after you lord rahl would have skinned me alive if i had left you tall and lean shoulders squared and chin raised cara looked as pleased as a cat licking mouse off its whiskers kahlan suddenly understood richard had entrusted cara with kahlans life the mordsith had proven that faith justified kahlan felt a smile stretch the partly healed cuts on her lips i just wish id known you were standing there the whole time now thanks to you i wont need the wooden bowl cara didnt laugh mother confessor you should know that i would never let anything happen to either of you richard appeared out of the shadows as suddenly as he had vanished he stroked the horses reassuringly as he moved down beside them he quickly checked the neck collars the trace chains and the breaching to make sure it was all secure anything he asked cara no lord rahl quiet and clear he leaned in the carnage and smiled well as long as youre awake how about i take you for a romantic moonlight ride she rested her hand on his forearm are you all right im fine not a scratch thats not what i meant his smile vanished they tried to kill us westland has just suffered its first casualties because of the influence of the imperial order but you knew them that doesnt entitle them to misplaced sympathy how many thousands have i seen killed since i left here i couldnt even convince men i grew up with of the truth i couldnt even get them to listen fairly all the death and suffering ive seen is ultimately because of men like thismen who refuse to see their willful ignorance does not entitle them to my blood or life they picked their own path for once they paid the price he didnt sound to her like a man who was quitting the fight he still held the sword was still in the grip of its rage kahlan caressed his arm letting him know that she understood it was clear to her that even though hed been justly defending himself and though he was still filled with the swords rage he keenly regretted what hed had to do the men had they been able to kill richard instead would have regretted nothing they would have celebrated his death as a great victory that was still perilousmaking them all chase after you no it wasnt it drew them out of the open and into the trees they had to dismount its rocky and the footing is poor so they couldnt rush me together or with speed like they could out here on the road the light is failing they thought that was to their advantage it wasnt in the trees it was even darker im wearing mostly black its warm so id left my gold cape behind here in the carriage the little bit of gold on the rest of the outfit only serves to break up the shape of a mans figure in the neardark so they had an even harder time seeing me once i took down albert they stopped thinking and fought with pure anger until they started seeing blood and death those men are used to brawls not battles they had expected an easy time murdering usthey werent mentally prepared to fight for their own lives once they saw the true nature of what was happening they ran for their lives the ones left anyway these are my woods in their panic they became confused and lost their way in the trees i cut them off and ended it did you get them all cara asked worried about any who might escape and bring more men after them yes i knew most of them and besides i had their number in my head i counted the bodies to make sure i got them all how many cara asked richard turned to take up the reins not enough for their purpose he clicked his tongue and started the horses moving chapter richard rose up and drew his sword this time when its distinctive sound rang out in the night kahlan was awake her first instinct was to sit up before she even had time to think better of it richard had crouched and gently restrained her with a reassuring hand she lifted her head just enough to see that it was cara leading a man into the harsh flickering light of the campfire richard sheathed his sword when he saw who cara had with her captain meiffert the dharan officer who had been with them back in anderith before any other greeting the man dropped to his knees and bent forward touching his forehead to the soft ground strewn with pine needles master rahl guide us master rahl teach us master rahl protect us captain meiffert beseeched in sincere reverence in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours when he had gone to his knees to recite the devotion as it was called kahlan saw cara almost reflexively go to her knees with him so ingrained was the ritual the supplication to their lord rahl was something all dharans did in the field they commonly recited it once or on occasion three times at the peoples palace in dhara most people gathered twice a day to chant the devotion at length when hed been a captive of darken rahl richard often in much the same condition as tommy lancaster just before he died had himself been forced to his knees by mordsith and made to perform the devotion for hours at a time now the mordsith like all dharans paid that same homage to richard if the mordsith saw such a turn of events as improbable or even ironic they never said as much what many of them had found improbable was that richard hadnt had them all executed when he became their lord rahl it was richard though who had discovered that the devotion to their lord rahl was in fact a surviving vestige of a bond an ancient magic invoked by one of his ancestors to protect the dharan people from the dream walkers it had long been believed that the dream walkerscreated by wizards to be weapons during that ancient and nearly forgotten great warhad vanished from the world the conjuring of strange and varied abilitiesof instilling unnatural attributes in peoplewilling or not had once been a dark art the results always being at the least unpredictable often uncertain and sometimes dangerously unstable somehow some spark of that malignant manipulation had been passed down generation after generation lurking unseen for three thousand yearsuntil it rekindled in the person of emperor jagang kahlan knew something about the alteration of living beings to suit a purpose confessors were such people as had been the dream walkers in jagang kahlan saw a monster created by magic she knew many people saw the same in her much as some people had blond hair or brown eyes she had been born to grow tall with warm brown hair and green eyesand the ability of a confessor she loved and laughed and longed for things just the same as those born with blond hair or brown eyes and without a confessors special ability kahlan used her power for valid moral reasons jagang no doubt believed the same of himself and even if he didnt most of his followers certainly did richard too had been born with latent power the ancient adjunct defense of the bond was passed down to any gifted rahl without the protection of the bond to richardthe lord rahlwhether formally spoken or a silent heartfelt affinity anyone was vulnerable to jagangs power as a dream walker unlike most other permutations conjured by wizards in living people the confessors ability had always remained vital at least it had until all the other confessors had been murdered by order of darken rahl now without such wizards and their specialized conjuring only if kahlan had children would the magic of the confessors live on confessors usually bore girls but not always a confessors power had originally been created for and had been intended to be used by women like all other conjuring that introduced unnatural abilities in people this too had had unforeseen consequences a confessors male children it turned out also bore the power after it had been learned how treacherous the power could be in men all male children were scrupulously killed kahlan bearing a male child was precisely what the witch woman shota feared shota knew very well that richard would never allow his and kahlans son to be slain for the past evils of male confessors kahlan too could never allow richards son to be killed in the past a confessors inability to marry out of love was one of the reasons she could emotionally endure the practice of infanticide richard in discovering the means by which he and kahlan could be together had altered that equation too but shota didnt simply fear kahlan giving birth to a male confessor she feared something of potentially far greater magnitudea male confessor who possessed richards gift shota had foretold that kahlan and richard would conceive a male child shota viewed such a child as an evil monster dangerous beyond comprehension and so had vowed to kill their offspring to prevent such a thing from being required she had given them the necklace to keep kahlan from becoming pregnant they had taken it reluctantly the alternative was war with the witch woman it was for reasons such as this that richard abhorred prophecy kahlan watched as captain meiffert spoke the devotion a third time caras lips moving with his the soft chant was making kahlan sleepy it was a luxury for kahlan to be able to be down with richard and cara in the sheltered camp beside the warmth of the fire rather than having to stay in the carriage especially since the night had turned chilly and damp with the litter they could move her more easily and without causing her much pain richard would have made the litter sooner but he hadnt expected to have to abandon the house he had started to build they were far off the narrow forsaken road in a tiny clearing concealed in a cleft in a steep rock wall behind a dense expanse of pine and spruce a small meadow close by provided a snug paddock for the horses richard and cara had pulled the carriage off the road behind a mass of deadfall and hidden it with spruce and balsam boughs no one but a dharan bonded to their lord rahl had much of a chance of ever finding them in the vast and trackless forest the secluded spot had a fire pit richard had dug and ringed with rocks during a previous stay nearly a year before it hadnt been used since a protruding shelf of rock about seven or eight feet above them prevented the light of the campfire from shining up the rock wall helping keep the camp hidden its slope also kept them snug and dry in the drizzle that had begun to fall with a fog closing in too it was as protected and secure a campsite as kahlan had ever seen richard had been true to his word it had taken more like six hours than four to reach the campsite richard had proceeded slowly for kahlans sake it was late and they were all tired from a long day of traveling to say nothing of the attack richard had told her that it looked like it might rain for a day or two and they would stay in the camp and rest up until the weather cleared there was no urgency to get where they were going after the third devotion captain meiffert came haltingly to his feet he clapped his right fist to the leather over his heart in salute richard smiled and the two men clasped forearms in a less formal greeting how are you doing captain richard grasped the mans elbow whats the matter did you fall off your horse or something the captain glanced at cara to his side ah well im fine lord rahl really you look hurt i just had my ribs tickled by your mordsith thats all i didnt do it hard enough to break them cara scoffed im truly sorry captain we had a bit of trouble earlier today cara was no doubt worried for our safety when she saw you approaching in the dark richards eyes turned toward cara but she still should have been more careful before risking injuring people im sure shes sorry and will want to apologize cara made a sour face it was dark im not about to take any foolish chances with the life of our lord rahl just so i would hope not captain meiffert put in before richard could reprimand her he smiled at cara i was once kicked by a stalwart warhorse you did a better job of putting me down mistress cara im gratified to find lord rahls life is in capable hands if sore ribs are the price i willingly accept it caras face brightened the captains simple concession disarmed a potentially nettlesome situation well if the ribs bother you let me know cara said dryly and ill kiss them and make them better in the silence as richard glowered at her she scratched her ear and finally added anyway sorry but i didnt want to take any chances as i said a price i willingly pay thank you for your vigilance what are you doing here captain richard asked general reibisch send you to see if the lord rahl is crazy although it was impossible to tell in the firelight kahlan was sure that the mans face turned scarlet no of course not lord rahl its just that the general wanted you to have a full report i see richard glanced down at their dinner pot whens the last time you ate captain you look a little drawn besides having sore ribs well ah ive been riding hard lord rahl i guess yesterday i must have eaten something im fine though i can have something after sit down then richard gestured let me get you something hot to eat it will do you good as the man reluctantly settled down on the mossy ground beside kahlan and cara richard scooped some rice and beans into a bowl he cut a big piece of bannock from what hed left to cool on the griddle off to the side of the fire he held the bowl out to the man captain meiffert saw no way to prevent it and was now mortified to find himself being served by none other than the lord rahl himself richard had to lift the food toward him a second time before he took it its only some rice and beans captain its not like im giving you caras hand in marriage cara guffawed mordsith dont marry they simply take a man for a mate if they wish himhe gets no say in it richard glanced up at her kahlan knew by richards tone that he hadnt meant anything by the comment but he didnt laugh with cara he knew all too well the truth of her words such an act was not an act of love but altogether the opposite in the uncomfortable silence cara realized what shed said and decided to break some branches down and feed them to the fire kahlan knew that denna the mordsith who had captured richard had taken him for her mate cara knew it too when richard would sometimes wake with a start and cling to her kahlan wondered if his nightmares were of things imaginary or real when she kissed his sweatslicked brow and asked what he had dreamed he never remembered she was thankful for that much of it richard retrieved a long stick that had been propped against one of the rocks ringing the fire with his finger he slid several sizzling pieces of bacon off the stick and into the captains bowl and then set the big piece of bannock on top they had with them a variety of food kahlan shared the carrage with all the supplies richard had picked up along their journey north to hartland they had enough staples to last for a good long time thank you captain meiffert stammered he brushed back his fall of blond hair it looks delicious it is richard said youre lucky i made dinner tonight instead of cara cara proud of being a poor cook smiled as if it were an accomplishment of note kahlan was sure it was a story that would be repeated to wide eyes and stunned disbelief the lord rahl himself serving food to one of his men by the way the captain ate she guessed it had been longer than a day since he had eaten as big as he was she figured he had to need a lot of food he swallowed and looked up my horse he began to stand when mistress cara i forgot my horse i need eat your food richard stood and clapped captain meifferts shoulder to keep him seated i was going to check on our horses anyway ill see to yours as well im sure it would like some water and oats too but lord rahl i cant allow you to eat this will save time when i get back youll be done and then you can give me your report richards shape became indistinct as he dissolved into the shadows leaving only a disembodied voice behind but im afraid i still wont have any orders for general reibisch in the stillness crickets once again took up their rhythmic chirping some distance away kahlan heard a night bird calling beyond the nearby trees the horses whinnied contentedly probably when richard greeted them every once in a while a feather of mist strayed in under the overhang to dampen her cheek she wished she could turn on her side and close her eyes richard had given her some herb tea and it was beginning to make her drowsy at least it dulled the pain too how are you mother confessor captain meiffert asked everyone is terribly worried about you a confessor wasnt often confronted with such honest and warm concern the young mans simple question was so sincere it almost brought kahlan to tears im getting better captain tell everyone ill be fine after ive had some time to heal were going someplace quiet where i can enjoy the fresh air of the arriving summer and get some rest ill be better before autumn im sure by then i hope richard will be of the war the captain smiled everyone will be relieved to know youre healing i cant tell you how many people told me that when i return they want to hear how youre doing tell them i said ill be fine and i asked for them not to worry anymore about me but to take care of themselves he ate another spoonful kahlan saw in his eyes that there was more to the mans anxiety it took him a moment before he addressed it we are concerned too that you and lord rahl need protection cara already sitting straight nevertheless managed to straighten more at the same time making the subtle shift in her posture appear threatening lord rahl and the mother confessor are not without protection captain they have me anything more than a mordsith is just pretty brass buttons this time he didnt back down his voice rang with the clear tone of authority this is not a matter of disrespect mistress cara nor is presumption intended like you i am sworn to their safety and that is my proper concern these brass buttons have met the enemy before in the defense of lord rahl and i dont really believe a mordsith would want to deter me from that duty for no more reason than petty pride were going to a remote and secluded place kahlan said before cara could answer i think our solitude and cara will be ample protection if richard wishes it otherwise he will say so with a reluctant nod he accepted her answer the last of it anyway settled the matter when richard had taken kahlan north he had left their guard forces behind she knew it was deliberate probably part of his conviction about what he felt he had to do richard wasnt opposed to the concept of protection in the past he had accepted troops being with them cara too had been insistent on having the security of those troops along it was different though for cara to admit it directly to captain meiffert they had spent a good deal of time in anderith with the captain and his elite forces kahlan knew him to be a superb officer she thought he must be approaching his midtwentiesprobably a soldier for a decade already and the veteran of a number of campaigns from minor rebellions to open warfare the sharp wholesome lines of his face were just beginning to take on a mature set over millennia through war migration and occupation other cultures had mixed in with the dharan leaving a blend of peoples tall and broadshouldered captain meiffert was marked as fullblooded dharan by blond hair and blue eyes as was cara the bond was strongest in fullblooded dharans after he had finished about half his rice he glanced over his shoulder into the darkness where richard had gone his earnest blue eyes took in both cara and kahlan i dont mean it to sound judgmental or personal and i hope im not speaking out of turn but may i ask you both a a sensitive question you may captain kahlan said but i cant promise we will answer it the last part gave him pause for a moment but then he went on general reibisch and some of the other officers well there have been worried discussions about lord rahl we trust in him of course he was quick to add we really do its just that so what are your concerns then captain cara put in her brow drawing tight if you trust him so much he stirred his wooden spoon around the bowl i was there in anderith through the whole thing i know how hard he workedand you too mother confessor no lord rahl before him ever worried about what the people wanted in the past the only thing that mattered was what the lord rahl wanted then after all that the people rejected his offerrejected him he sent us back to the main force and just left ushe gestured around himselfto come here out in the middle of nowhere to be a recluse or something he paused while searching for the right words we dont understand it exactly he looked up from the fire back into their eyes as he went on were worried that lord rahl has lost his will to fightthat he simply no longer cares or perhaps he is afraid to fight the look on his face told kahlan that he feared reprisal for saying the things he said and for asking such a question but he needed the answer enough to risk it this was probably why he had come to give a report rather than send a simple messenger about six hours before he cooked that nice dinner pot of rice and beans cara said in a casual manner he killed a couple dozen men all by himself hacked them apart like ive never seen before the violence of it shocked even me he left only one man for me to dispatch quite unfair of him i think captain meiffert looked positively relieved as he let out a long breath he looked away from caras steady gaze and back into his bowl to stir his dinner that news will be well received thank you for telling me mistress cara he cant issue orders kahlan said because he unequivocally believes that for now if he takes part in leading our forces against the imperial order it would bring about our defeat he believes that if he enters the battle too soon we will then have no chance of ever winning he believes he must wait for the right time thats all theres nothing more to it kahlan felt a bit conflicted helping to justify richards actions when she wasnt entirely in favor of them she felt it was necessary to check the advance of the imperial orders army now and not give them a chance to freely pillage and murder the people of the new world the captain mulled this over as he ate some bannock he frowned as he gestured with the piece he had left there is sound battle theory for such a strategy if you have any choice in it you only attack when its on your terms not the enemys he became more spirited as he thought about it a moment it is better to hold an attack for the right moment despite the damage an enemy can cause in the interim than to go into a battle before the right time such would be an act of poor command thats right kahlan laid her arm back and rested her right wrist on her brow perhaps you could explain it to the other officers in those wordsthat its premature to issue orders and hes waiting for the proper time i dont think thats really any different from the way richard has explained it to us but perhaps it would be better understood if put in such terms the captain ate the last bite of his bannock seeming to think it over i trust lord rahl with my life i know the others do too but i think they will be reassured by such an explanation as to why he is withholding his orders i can see now why he had to leave usit was to resist the temptation to throw himself into the fray before the time was right kahlan wished she was as confident of the reasoning as the captain she recalled caras question wondering how the people could prove themselves to richard she knew he would not be inclined to try it through a vote again but she didnt see how else the people could prove themselves to him id not mention it to richard she said its difficult for himnot being able to issue orders hes trying to do what he believes is right but its a difficult course to hold to i understand mother confessor in his wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are his kahlan studied the smooth lines and simple angles of his young face lit by the dancing firelight in that face she saw some of what richard had been trying to say to her before richard doesnt believe your lives are his captain but that they are your own and priceless that is what he is fighting for he chose his words carefully if he wasnt worried about her being the mother confessor since he hadnt grown up fearing the power and the rule of such a woman she was still the lord rahls wife most of us see how different he is from the last lord rahl im not claiming that any of us understands everything about him but we know he fights to defend rather than to conquer as a soldier i know the difference it makes to believe in what im fighting for because the captain looked away from her gaze he lifted a short branch of firewood tapping the end on the ground for a time his voice took on a painful inflection because it takes something precious out of you to kill people who never meant you any harm the fire crackled and hissed as he slowly stirred the glowing coals sparks swirled up to spill out from around the underside of the rock overhang cara watched her agiel as she rolled it in her fingers you feel that way too captain meiffert met caras gaze i never realized before what it was doing to me inside i didnt know lord rahl makes me proud to be dharan he makes it stand for something right it never did before i thought that the way things were was just the way things were and they could never change caras gaze fell away as she privately nodded her agreement kahlan could only imagine what life was like living under that kind of rule what it did to people im glad you understand captain kahlan whispered thats one reason he worries so much about all of you he wants you to live lives you can be proud of lives that are your own he dropped the stick into the fire and he wanted all the people of anderith to care about themselves the way he wants us to value our lives the vote wasnt really for him but for themselves that was why the vote meant so much to him thats why kahlan confirmed afraid to test her own voice any further than that he stirred his spoon around to cool his dinner it no longer needed cooling she was sure she supposed his thoughts were being stirred more than his dinner you know he said one of the things i heard people say back in anderith was that since darken rahl was his father richard rahl was evil too they said that since his father had done wrong richard rahl might sometimes do good but he could never be a good person i heard that too cara said not just in anderith but a lot of places thats wrong why should people think that just because one of his parents was cruel those crimes pass on to someone who never did them and that he must spend his life making amends id hate to think that if im ever lucky enough to have children they and then their children and their children after that would have to suffer forever for the things ive done serving under darken rahl he looked over at kahlan and cara such prejudice isnt right in the silence cara stared into the flames i served under darken rahl i know the difference in the two men his voice lowered with simmering anger its wrong of people to lay guilt for the crimes of darken rahl onto his son youre right about that cara murmured the two may look a little alike but anyone who has ever looked into the eyes of both men as i have could never begin to think they were the same kind of men chapter captain meiffert ate the rest of his rice and beans in silence cara offered him her waterskin he took it with a smile and his nod of thanks she dished him out a second bowlful from the pot and cut him another piece of bannock he looked only slightly less mortified to be served by a mordsith than by the lord rahl cara found his expression amusing she called him brass buttons and told him to eat it all he did so as they listened to the sounds of the fire snapping and water dripping from the pine needles onto the carpet of leaves and other debris of the forest floor richard returned loaded down with the captains bedroll and saddlebags he let them slip to the ground beside the officer and then shook water off himself before sitting down beside kahlan he offered her a drink from a full waterskin hed brought back she took only a sip she was more interested in being able to rest her hand on his leg richard yawned so captain meiffert you said the general wanted you to give a full report yes sir the captain went into a long and detailed account on the state of the army to the south how they were stationed out on the plains what passes they guarded in the mountains and how they planned on using the terrain should the imperial order suddenly come up out of anderith and move north into the midlands he reported on the health of the men and their supply situationboth good the other half of general reibischs dharan force was back in aydindril protecting the city and kahlan was relieved to hear that everything there was in order captain meiffert relayed all the communications theyd received from around the midlands including from kelton and galen two of the largest lands of the midlands that were now allied with the new dharan empire the allied lands were helping to keep the army supplied in addition to providing men for rotation of patrols scouting land they knew better and other work kahlans half brother harold had brought word that cyrilla kahlans half sister had taken a turn for the better cyrilla had been queen of galea after her brutal treatment in the hands of the enemy she became emotionally unbalanced and was unable to serve as queen in her rare conscious moments worried for her people she had begged kahlan to be queen in her stead kahlan had reluctantly agreed saying it was only until cyrilla was well again few people thought she would ever have her mind back but apparently it looked as if she might yet recover in order to soothe the ruffled feathers of galeas neighboring land kelton richard had named kahlan queen of kelton when kahlan first heard what richard had done she had thought it was lunacy strange as the arrangement was though if suited both lands and brought them not only peace with each other but also into the fold of those lands fighting against the imperial order cara was pleasantly surprised to hear that a number of mordsith had arrived at the confessors palace in aydindril in case lord rahl needed them berdine would no doubt be pleased to have some of her sister mordsith with her in aydindril kahlan missed aydindril she guessed the place you grew up could never leave your heart the thought gave her a pang of sorrow for richard that would be rikka cara said with a smile wait until she meets the new lord rahl she added under her breath finding that even more to smile about kahlans thoughts turned to the people they had left to the imperial orderor more accurately to the people who had chosen the imperial order have you received any reports from anderith yes from a number of men we sent in there im afraid we lost some too the ones who returned report that there were fewer enemy deaths from the poisoned waters than we had hoped once the imperial order discovered their soldiers dying or sick they tested everything on the local people first a number of them died or became sick but it wasnt widespread by using the people to test the food and water they were able to isolate the tainted food and destroy it the army has been been laying claim to everythingthey use a lot of supplies the imperial order was said to be far larger than any army ever assembled kahlan knew that much of the reports to be accurate the order dwarfed the dharan and midland troops arrayed against them perhaps ten or twenty to onesome reports claimed more than that some reports claimed the new world forces were outnumbered by a hundred to one but kahlan discounted that as outright panic she didnt know how long the order would feed off anderith before they moved on or if they were being resupplied from the old world they had to be to some extent anyway how many scouts and spies did we lose richard asked captain meiffert looked up it was the first question richard had asked some may yet turn up but it appears likely that we lost fifty to sixty men richard sighed and general reibisch thinks it was worth losing the lives of those men to discover this captain meiffert cast about for an answer we didnt know what we would discover lord rahl that was why we sent them in do you wish me to tell the general not to send in any more men richard was carving a face in a piece of firewood sporadically tossing shavings into the fire he sighed no he must do as he sees fit ive explained to him that i cant issue orders the captain watching richard pick small chips of wood from his lap and pitch them into the fire tossed a small fan of pine needles into the flames where it blazed in shortlived glory richards carving was a remarkably good likeness of the captain kahlan had on occasion seen richard casually carve animals or people she once had strongly suggested that his ability was guided by his gift he scoffed at such a notion saying that he had liked to carve ever since he was little she reminded him that art was used to cast spells and that once he had been captured with the aid of a drawn spell he insisted this was nothing like that as a guide he said hed passed many an evening at camp by himself carving not wanting to carry the added weight he would toss the finished piece into the fire he said he enjoyed the act of carving and could always carve another kahlan considered the carvings inspired and found it distressing to see them destroyed what do you intend to do lord rahl if i may ask richard took a smooth steady slice that demarcated the line of an ear bringing it to life along with the line of the jaw he had already cut he looked up and stared off into the night were going to a place back in the mountains where other people dont go so we can be alone and safe the mother confessor will be able to get well there and gain back her strength while were there i may even make cara start wearing a dress cara shot to her feet what when she saw richards smile cara realized he was only joking she fumed nonetheless id not report that part of it to the general were i you captain richard said cara sank back down to the ground not if brass buttons here values his ribs she muttered kahlan struggled not to chuckle lest she twist the ever present knives in her ribs sometimes she felt as if she knew how the chunk of wood richard was carving felt it was good to see richard for once get the best of cara it was usually she who had him flustered i cant help you for now richard said his serious tone returning he went back to his work with his knife i hope you can all accept that of course lord rahl we know that you will lead us into battle when the time is right i hope that day comes captain i really do not because i want to fight but because i hope there to be something to fight for richard stared into the fire his countenance a chilling vision of despair right now there isnt yes lord rahl captain meiffert said finally breaking the uncomfortable silence we will do as we think best until the mother confessor is better and you are then able to join us richard didnt argue the time schedule as the captain had described it it was one kahlan hoped for too but richard had never said it would be that soon he had in fact made it clear to them that the time might not ever come he cradled the wood in his lap studying what he had done he ran his thumb along the freshcut line of the nose as he asked did the returning scouts say how it faired for the people in anderith with the imperial order there kahlan knew he was only torturing himself by asking that question she wished he hadnt asked it could do him no good to hear the answer captain meiffert cleared his throat well yes they did report on the condiions and the young officer launched into a cold report of the facts they knew jagang set up his troop headquarters in the capital fairfield he took over the minister of cultures estate for himself their army is so huge that it swallowed the city and overflows far out onto the hills all around the anderith army put up little resistance they were collected and all summarily put to death the government of anderith for the most part ceased to exist within the first few hours there is no rule or law the order spent the first week in unchecked celebration most people in fairfield were displaced and lost everything they owned many fled the roads all around were packed solid with those trying to escape what was happening in the city the people fleeing the city only ended up being the spoils for the soldiers in the hills all around who couldnt fit into the city only a trickle mostly the very old and sicklymade it past that gauntlet his impersonal tone abandoned him he had spent time with those people too im afraid that in all it went badly for them lord rahl there was a horrendous amount of killing of the men anywayin the tens of thousands likely more they got what they asked for caras voice was as cold as winter night they picked their own fate kahlan agreed but didnt say so she knew richard agreed too none of them were pleased about it though and the countryside richard asked anything known about places outside fairfield is it going better for them no better lord rahl the imperial order has been methodically going about a process of pacifying the land as they call it their soldiers are accompanied by the gifted by far the worst of the accounts were about one called deaths mistress who cara asked deaths mistress they call her her must be the sisters richard said which ones do you think it would be cara asked richard cutting the mouth into the firewood face shrugged jagang has both sisters of the light and sisters of the dark held captive hes a dream walker he forces both to do his bidding it could be either the woman is simply his tool i dont know captain meiffert said weve had plenty of reports about the sisters and how dangerous they are but theyre being used like you said as tools of the armyweapons basicallynot as his agents jagang doesnt let them think for themselves or direct anything this one from the reports anyway behaves very differently from the others she acts as jagangs agent but still the word is she decides things for herself and does as she pleases the men who came back reported that she is more feared than jagang himself the people of one town when they heard she was coming their way all gathered together in the town square they made the children drink poison first then the adults took their dose every last person in the town was dead when the woman arrivedclose to five hundred people richard had stopped carving as he listened kahlan knew that unfounded rumors could also be so lurid as to turn alarm into deadly panic to the point where people would rather die than face the object of their dread fear was a powerful tool of war richard went back to the carving in his lap he held the knife near the tip of the point like a pen and carefully cut character into the eyes they didnt get a name for her did they this deaths mistress im sorry no lord rahl they said she is simply called by everyone deaths mistress sounds like an ugly witch cara said quite the contrary she has blue eyes and long blond hair she is said to be one of the most beautiful women you could ever lay eyes upon they say she looks like a vision of a good spirit kahlan couldnt help notice the captains furtive glance at cara who had blue eyes and long blond hair and was also one of the most beautiful women you could ever lay eyes upon she too was deadly richard was frowning blond blue eyes there are several it could be too bad they didnt catch her name sorry but they gave no other name lord rahl only that description oh yes and that she always wears black dear spirits richard whispered as he rose to his full height gripping his carving by its throat from what ive been told lord rahl though she looks like a vision of one the good spins themselves would fear her with good reason richard said as he stared into the distance as if looking beyond the black wall of mist to a place only he could see you know her then lord rahl kahlan listened to the fire pop and crackle as she waited along with the other two for his answer it almost seemed richard was trying to find his voice as his gaze sank back down to meet the eyes of the carving in his hand i know her he said at last i know her all too well she was one of my teachers at the palace of the prophets richard tossed his carving into the flames pray you never have to look into niccis eyes captain chapter look into my eyes child nicci said in her soft silken voice as she cupped the girls chin nicci lifted the bony face the eyes dark and wideset blinked with dull bewilderment there was nothing to be seen in them the girl was simple nicci straightened feeling a hollow disappointment she always did she sometimes found herself looking into peoples eyes like this and then wondering why if she was searching for something she didnt know what it was she resumed her leisurely walk down the line of the townspeople all assembled along one side of the dusty market square people in outlying farms and smaller communities no doubt came into the town several times a month on market days some staying overnight if they had come from far away this wasnt a market day but it would suit her purpose well enough a few of the crowded buildings had a second story typically a room or two for a family over their small shop nicci saw a bakery a cobblers shop a shop selling pottery a blacksmith an herbalist a shop offering leatherworkthe usual places one of these towns was much the same as the next many of the towns people worked the surrounding fields of wheat or sorghum tended animals and had extensive vegetable plots dung straw and clay being plentiful they lived in homes of daub and wattle a few of the shops with a second story boasted beam construction with clapboard siding behind her sullen soldiers bristling with weapons filled the majority of the square they were tired from the hot ride and worse bored nicci knew they were a twitch away from a rampage a town even one with meager plunder was an inviting diversion it wasnt so much the taking as the breaking that they liked sometimes though it was the taking the nervous women only rarely met the soldiers bold stares as she strolled past the scruffy people nicci looked into the eyes watching her most were wide with terror and fixed not on the soldiers but on the object of their dread niccior as people had taken to calling her deaths mistress the designation neither pleased nor displeased her it was simply a fact she noted a fact of no more significance to her than if someone had told her that they had mended a pair of her stockings some she knew were staring at the gold ring through her lower lip gossip would have already informed them that a woman so marked was a personal slave to emperor jagangsomething lower even than simple peasants such as themselves that they stared at the gold ring or what they thought of her for it was of even less significance to her than being called deaths mistress jagang only possessed her body in this world the keeper would have her soul for eternity in the next her bodys existence in this world was torment her spirits existence in the next would be no less existence and torment were simply the two sides of the same cointhere could be no other smoke rolling up from the fire pit over her left shoulder sailed away on a fitful wind to make a dark slash across the bright blue afternoon sky stacked stones to each side of the communal cooking pit supported a rod above the fire two or three pigs or sheep skewered on the rod could be roasted at once temporary sides were probably available to convert the fire pit into a smokehouse at other times an outdoor fire pit was used often in conjunction with butchering for the making of soap since making soap was not something typically done indoors nicci saw a wooden ash pit used for making lye standing to the side of the open area along with a large iron kettle that could be used for rendering fat lye and fat were the primary ingredients of soap some women liked to add fragrance to their soap with herbs and such like lavender or rosemary when nicci was little her mother made her go each autumn when the butchering was being done to help people make soap her mother said helping others built proper character nicci still had a few small dots of scars on the backs of her hands and forearms where she had been splashed and blistered by the hot fat niccis mother always made her wear a fine dressnot to impress the other people who didnt have such clothes but to make nicci conspicuous and uncomfortable the attention her pink dress attracted was not admiration as she stood with the long wooden paddle stirring the bubbling kettle while the lye was being poured in some of the other children trying to splash the dress and ruin it burned nicci too niccis mother had said the burns were the creators punishment as nicci moved past inspecting the assembled people the only sounds were the horses off behind the buildings the sporadic coughs of people and the flags of flame in the fire pit snapping and flapping in the breeze the soldiers had already helped themselves to the two pigs that had been roasting on the rod so the aroma of cooking meat had mostly dissipated on the wind leaving the sour smells of sweat and the stink of human habitation whether a belligerent army or a peaceful town the filth of people smelled the same you all know why im here nicci announced why have you people made me go to the trouble of such a journey she gazed down the line of maybe two hundred people standing four and five deep the soldiers who had ordered them out of their homes and in from the fields greatly outnumbered them she stopped in front of a man she had noticed people glancing at well the wind fluttered his thin gray hair across his balding bowed head as he fixed his gaze on the ground at her feet we dont have anything to give mistress were a poor community we have nothing you are a liar you had two pigs you saw fit to have a gluttonous feast instead of helping those in need but we have to eat it was not an argument so much as a plea so do others but they are not so fortunate as you they know only the ache of hunger in their bellies every night what an ugly tragedy that every day thousands of children die from the simple want of food and millions more know the gnawing pain of hungerwhile people like you in a land of plenty offer nothing but selfish excuses having what they need to live is their right and must be honored by those with the means to help our soldiers too need to eat do you think our struggle on the behalf of the people is easy these men risk their lives daily so you may raise your children in a proper civilized society how can you look these men in the eye how can we even feed our troops if everyone doesnt help support the cause the trembling man remained mute what must i do to impress upon you people the seriousness of your obligation to the lives of others your contribution to those in need is a solemn moral dutysharing in a greater good niccis vision suddenly went white with a pain like scorching hot needles driven into her ears jagangs voice filled her mind why must you play this game make examples of people teach them a lesson that i am not to be ignored nicci swayed on her feet she was completely blinded by the pain bursting inside her head she let it wash through her as if watching it happen to a stranger her abdominal muscles twitched and convulsed a rusty barbed lance driven up through her ripping her insides could not have hurt more her arms hung limp at her sides while she waited for jagangs displeasure to end or for death she was unable to tell how long the torture lasted when he was doing it she was never able to sense timethe pain was too allconsuming she knew from what others told her when they saw it done to her and from seeing it done to others that it sometimes lasted only an instant sometimes it lasted hours making it last hours was a waste of jagangs effortshe couldnt tell the difference she had told him as much suddenly she was unable to draw a breath it felt like a fist squeezed her heart to a stop she thought her lungs might burst her knees were about to buckle do not disobey me again with a gasp air filled her lungs jagangs discipline ended as it always did with an impossibly tart sour taste on her tongue like an unexpected mouthful of fresh raw lemon juice and pain searing the nerves at the back of her jaw under her earlobes it left her head ringing and her teeth throbbing as she opened her eyes she was surprised as she always was not to see herself standing in a pool of blood she touched the corner of her mouth and then brushed her fingers to an ear she found no blood she wondered in passing why jagang had been able to come into her mind now sometimes he couldnt it didnt happen that way for any of the other sistershe always had access to their minds as her vision cleared she saw people staring at her they didnt know why she had paused the young menand a few of the older ones toowere sneaking peeks at her body they were used to seeing women in drab shapeless dresses women whose bodies exhibited the toll taken by endless hard work and almost constant pregnancy from the time they were old enough for the seed to catch they had never before seen a woman like nicci standing straight and tall looking them in the eye wearing a fine black dress that hugged a nearly flawless shape marred by neither hard work or the labor of birth the stark black material contrasted the pale curve of cleavage revealed by the cut of the laced bodice nicci was numb to such stares occasionally they suited her purposes but most of the time they didnt and so she disregarded them she began walking down the line of people again ignoring emperor jagangs orders she rarely complied with his orders she was for the most part indifferent to his punishment if anything she welcomed it nicci forgive me you know i dont mean to hurt you she ignored his voice too as she studied the eyes peering up at her not everyone did she liked to look into the eyes of those courageous enough to risk a glimpse of her most were filled with simple terror there would soon be abundant justification for such apprehension nicci you must do as i tell you or you are only going to end up forcing me to do something terrible to you neither of us wants that someday i am going to end up doing something from which you will be unable to recover if that is what you wish to do then do it she thought in answer it was not a challenge she simply didnt care you know i dont want to do that nicci without the pain his voice was little more than a fly annoying her she paid it no heed she addressed the crowd do you people have any concept of the effort being put into the fight for your future or is it that you expect to benefit without contributing many of our brave men have given their lives fighting the oppressors of the people fighting for our new beginning we struggle so that all people will be able to share equally in the coming prosperity you must help us in our effort on your behalf just as helping those in need is the moral obligation of every person so too is this commander kardeef displaying a look of sour displeasure planted himself in front of her the sunlight slanting across his lined face cast his hooded eyes in deep shadows she was not moved by his disfavor he was never satisfied with anything well she corrected herself almost never people can only achieve virtue through obedience and sacrifice your contribution to the order is to implement their compliance we are not here to hold civic lessons commander kardeef was confident in his privileged mastery over her he too had given her pain she endured what kadar kardeef did to her with the same detachment with which she endured what jagang did to her only in the furthest depths of pain could she begin to feel anything even pain was preferable to the nothingness she usually felt kadar kardeef was probably unaware of the punishment jagang had just completed or his orders his excellency didnt use commander kardeefs mind it was an arduous undertaking for jagang to control those who didnt possess the gifthe could do it but it was rarely worth his effort he had the gifted to control people for him a dream walker somehow used the gift in those who possessed it in order to help complete the connection to their minds in a way the gifted made it possible for jagang to so easily control them kadar kardeef glowered down at her as she gazed up at his darkly tanned creased face he was an imposing figure with the studded leather straps that crossed his massive chest his armored leather shoulder and breast plates his chain mail array of wellused weapons nicci had seen him crush mens throats in one of big powerful hands as silent witness to his bravery in battle he bore a number scars she had seen them all few officers ranked higher or were more trusted than kadar kardeef he been with the order since his youth rising through the ranks to fight alongside jagang as they expanded the empire of the imperial order out of their homeland alturrang to eventually subjugate the rest of the old world kadar kardeef was the hero of the little gap campaign the man who almost singlehandedly the course of the battle breaking through enemy lines and personally slaying the three great kings who had joined forces to trap and crush the imperial order before it could seize the imaginations of the millions of people living in a patchwork of kingdoms fiefdoms clans citystates and vast regions controlled by alliances of warlords the old world had been a tinderbox waiting for the spark of revolution the preachings of the order were that spark if the high priests were the orders soul jagang was its bone and muscle few people understood jagangs geniusthey saw only a dream walker or a ferocious warrior he was far more it had taken jagang decades to finally bring the rest of the old world to heelto put the order on its final path to greater glory during those years of struggle for the order while engaged in nearly constant war jagang toiled building the road system that allowed him to move men and supplies great distances with lightning speed the more lands and peoples he annexed the more laborers he put to the construction of yet more roads by which he could conquer yet more territory he was thus able to maintain communications and to react to situations faster than anyone would have believed possible formerly isolated lands were suddenly connected to the rest of the old world jagang had knitted them together with a net of roads along those roads the people of the old world had risen up to follow him as he forged the way for the order kadar kardeef had been part of it all more than once he had taken wounds to save jagangs life jagang had once taken a bolt from a crossbow to save kardeef if jagang could be said to have a friend kadar kardeef was as close as any came to it nicci first met kardeef when he had come to the palace of the prophets in tanimura to pray old king gregory who had ruled the land including tanimura had disappeared without a trace kadar kardeef was a solemnly devout man before battle he prayed to the creator for the blood of the enemy and after for the souls of the men he had killed that day he was said to have prayed for the soul of king gregory the imperial order was suddenly the new rule in tanimura the people celebrated in the streets for days over the course of three thousand years the sisters from their home at the palace of the prophets in tanimura had seen governments come and go for the most part the sisters led by their prelate considered matters of rule a petty foolishness best ignored they believed in a higher calling the sisters believed they would remain at the palace of the prophets undisturbed in their work long after the order had vanished into the dust of history revolutions had many times come and gone this one though caught them up kadar kardeef had been nearly twenty years younger thena handsome conqueror riding into the city many of the sisters were fascinated by the man nicci never was but he was fascinated by her emperor jagang of course did not send such invaluable men as commander kardeef out to pacify conquered lands he had entrusted kardeef with a much more important task guarding his valuable propertynicci nicci turned her attention away from kadar kardeef and back to the people she settled her gaze on the man who had spoken before we cannot allow anyone to shirk their responsibility to others and to our new beginning please mistress we have nothing disregard of our cause is treasonous he thought better of disagreeing with that pronouncement you dont seem to understand that this man behind me wants you to see that the imperial order is resolute in their devotion to their causeif you dont do your duty i know you have heard the stories but this man wants you to experience the grim reality imagining it is never quite the same never quite as gruesome she stared at the man waiting for his answer he licked his weathercracked lips we just need some more time our crops are doing well when the harvest comes in we could contribute our fair share toward the struggle for for the new beginning yes mistress he said bobbing his head the new beginning when his gaze returned to the dirt at his feet she moved on down the line her purpose was not really to collect but to kill the time had come a girl gazing up at her snagged nicci to a stop distracting her from what she had intended the girls big dark eyes sparkled with innocent wonder everything was new to her and she was eager to see it all in her dark eyes shone that rare fragile and most perishable of qualities a guileless view of life that had yet to be touched by pain or loss or evil nicci cupped the girls chin staring into the depths of those thirsting eyes one of niccis earliest memories was of her mother standing over her like this holding her chin looking down at her niccis mother was gifted too she said that the gift was a curse and a test it was a curse because it gave her abilities others didnt have and it was a test to see if she would wrongly exert that superiority niccis mother almost never used her gift servants handled the work she spent most of her time nested among her clutch of friends devoting herself to higher pursuits dear creator but niccis father is a monster she would complain as she wrung her hands some of her friends would murmur their sympathy why must he burden me so i fear his eternal soul is beyond hope or prayer the other women would ask in grim agreement her mothers eyes were the same dull brown as a cockroachs back to niccis mind they were set too close together her mouth too was narrow as if fixed is place by her perpetual disapproval while nicci never really thought of her mother as homely neither did she consider her beautiful although her friends regularly reassured her that she most surely was niccis mother said beauty was a curse to a caring woman and a blessing only to whores puzzled by her mothers displeasure of her father nicci had finally asked why had done nicci her mother had said cupping niccis small chin that day nicci eagerly awaited her mothers words you have beautiful eyes but you do not yet see withthem all people are miserable wretches that is the lot of man do you have any idea how it hurts those without all your advantages to see your beautiful face that is all you bring to others insufferable pain the creator brought you into the world for no reason but to ease the misery of others and here you bring only hurt her mothers friends sipping tea nodded whispering to one another their sorrowful but firm agreement that was when nicci had first learned that she bore the indelible stain of so shadowy nameless unconfessed evil nicci gazed into the rare face looking up at her today this girls dark eyes would see things they could not yet imagine those big eyes eagerly watched without seeing she could not possibly understand what was to come or why what kind of life could she have it would be for the best this way the time had come chapter before she could begin nicci saw something that ignited her indignation she whirled to a nearby woman where is there a washtub surprised by the question the woman pointed a trembling finger toward a two story building not far off there mistress in the yard behind the pottery shop are laundry tubs where we were washing clothes nicci seized the woman by her throat get me a pair of scissors bring them to me there the woman stared in wideeyed fright nicci shoved her now or would you prefer to die on the spot nicci yanked free a wellworn reserve studded strap bunched with several others and secured over commander kardeefs shoulder he made no effort to stop her but as she gathered up the strap he seized her upper arm in his powerful grip you had better be planning on drowning this little brator maybe cutting off hunks of her hide and then stabbing out her eyes his breath smelled of onion and ale he smirked in fact you start in on her and while shes screaming and begging for her life ill begin separating out some young men or perhaps ill select some women to be an example which would you prefer this time nicci turned her glare down at his fingers on her arm he removed them as he growled a warning she turned to the girl and whipped the strap twice around her neck to serve as a collar twisting it into a handle in the back so she could control the girl with it the girl squeaked in choked surprise she had probably never been handled so roughly in her entire life nicci forced her ahead toward the building the woman had pointed out seeing how angry nicci had suddenly become no one followed a woman not far off undoubtedly the girls mother began to cry out in protest but then fell silent as kardeefs men turned their attention on her by then nicci already had the perplexed girl around the corner out back drab laundry deformed and crumpled from its ordeal on the washboard and now stretched and pinned to lines twisted in the wind as if struggling to escape smoke from the fire pit peeked over the top of the building the nervous woman waited with a large pair of shears nicci marched the girl up to a tub of water drove her down on her knees and shoved her head under the water while the girl struggled nicci snatched the scissors from the woman her chore completed the woman held her apron up over her mouth to muffle her wails as she ran off in tears not wanting to watch a child being murdered nicci pulled the girls head up out of the water and while she sputtered and gasped for air began clipping her dark soaking wet hair close to the scalp when nicci had finished cutting it off in sodden clumps she dunked the girl again while leaning over and scooping up a cake of pale yellow soap from the washboard on the ground beside the tub nicci hauled the girls head up and then began scrubbing the girl screeched flailing her spindly arms and clawing at the strap around her neck by which nicci controlled her nicci realized she was probably hurting her but from within the grip of rage it was only a dim realization whats the matter with you nicci shook the gasping girl dont you know youre crawling with lice but but the soap was harsh and as rough as a rasp the girl squealed as nicci bent her over and put more muscle into the scouring do you like having a head full of lice no well you must why else would you have them please ill try to do better ill wash i promise nicci remembered how much she hated catching lice from the places her mother sent her she remembered scrubbing herself using the harshest soap she could find only to again be sent off to another place where she would get infested with the hated things all over again when nicci had scrubbed and dunked a dozen times she finally dragged the girl to a tub of clean water and swished her head about in it to rinse her off the girl blinked furiously trying to clear her eyes of the stinging soapy water as it streamed down off her face gripping the girls chin nicci peered into her red eyes no doubt your clothes are lousy with nits youre to scrub your clothes every dayunderthings especiallyor the lice will just be right back nicci squeezed the girls cheeks until her eyes watered you are better than to be filthy with lice dont you know that the girl nodded as best as she could with niccis strong fingers holding her face the big dark intelligent eyes although red from the water and wide with shock were still filled with that rare sense of wonder as painful and frightening as the experience was this had not dispelled it burn your bedding get new given the way these people lived and worked it seemed a hopeless challenge your whole family must burn their bedding wash all their clothes the girl nodded her oath task completed nicci marched the girl back toward the gathered crowd forcing her along by the studded strap used as a collar nicci was unexpectedly struck by a memory it was a memory of the first time she had seen richard nearly every sister at the palace of the prophets had been gathered in the great hall to see the new boy sister verna had brought in nicci lingered at the mahogany rail twining around her finger a lace dangling from her bodice only to pull the lace straight and then to twine it again when the pair of thick walnut doors opened the rumbling drone of conversation sprinkled with bright laughter trailed to an expectant hush as the group led by sister phoebe marched into the chamber past the white columns topped by gold capitals and in under the huge vaulted dome the birth of gifted boys was rare and a cause of expectant delight when they were discovered and finally brought to live at the palace a grand banquet was planned for that evening most of the sisters dressed in their finery stood on the floor below eager to meet the new boy nicci remained near the center of the lower balcony she didnt care whether she met him or not it came as something of a shock to see how sister verna had aged on her journey such journeys typically lasted at most a year this one beyond the great barrier to the new world had taken nearly twenty events beyond the barrier being uncertain verna had apparently been sent off on her mission too far in advance life at the palace of the prophets was as long as it was serene no one at the palace of the prophets appeared to have aged at all in so trifling a span of time as two decades but away from the spell that enveloped the palace verna had verna probably close to one hundred and sixty years old had to be at least twenty years younger than nicci yet she now looked twice niccis age people outside the palace aged at the normal rate of course but to see it happen so rapidly to a sister as the roaring applause thundered on in the huge room many of the sisters wept over the momentous occasion nicci yawned sister phoebe held up her hand until the room fell silent sisters phoebes voice trembled please welcome sister verna home she finally had to raise a hand to again bring the clamor of applause to a halt when the room had quieted she said and may i present our newest student our newest child of the creator our newest charge she turned and held an arm out in introduction wiggling her fingers urging the apparently timid boy forward as she went on please welcome richard cypher to the palace of the prophets several of the women stepped back out of the way as he strode forward niccis eyes widened her back straightened it was not a young boy he was grown into a man the crowd despite their shock clapped and cheered with the warmth of their welcome nicci didnt hear it her attention was riveted by those gray eyes of his he was introduced to some of the nearby sisters the novice assigned to him pasha was brought before him and tried to speak to him richard brushed pasha aside a stag dismissing a vole and stepped out alone into the center of the room his whole bearing conveyed the same quality nicci beheld in his eyes i have something to say the vast chamber fell to an astonished hush his gaze swept the room niccis breath caught when for an instant their eyes met as he probably met countless others her trembling fingers clutched the rail for support nicci swore at that moment to do whatever was necessary to be named as one of his teachers his fingers tapped the radahan around his neck as long as you keep this collar on me you are my captors and i am your prisoner murmurs hummed in the air a radahan was put around a boys neck not joust to govern him but to protect him as well the boys were never thought of as prisoners but wards who needed security care and training richard though did not see it that way since i have committed no aggression against you that makes us enemies we are at war several older sisters teetered on their heels nearly fainting the faces of half the women in the room went red the rest went white nicci could not have imagined such an attitude his demeanor kept her from blinking lest she overlook something she drew slow breaths lest she miss a word her pounding heart though was beyond her ability to control sister verna has made a pledge to me that i will be taught to control the gift and when i have learned what is required i will be set free for now as long as you keep that pledge we have a truce but there are conditions richard lifted a red leather rod hanging on a fine gold chain around his neck at the time nicci hadnt known it to be the weapon of a mordsith i have been collared before the person who put that collar on me brought me pain to punish me to teach me to subdue me nicci knew that such could be the only fate of one like him that is the sole purpose of a collar you collar a beast you collar your enemies i made her much the same offer i am making you i begged her to release me she would not i was forced to kill her not one of you could ever hope to be good enough to lick her boots she did as she did because she was tortured and broken made mad enough to use a collar to hurt people she did it against her nature you his gaze swept all the eyes watching him you do it because you think it is your right you enslave in the name of your creator i dont know your creator the only one beyond this world who i know would do as you do is the keeper the crowd gasped as far as im concerned you may as well be the keepers disciples little did he know that some of them were if you do as she and use this collar to bring me pain the truce will be ended you may think you hold the leash to this collar but i promise you if the truce ends you will find that what you hold is a bolt of lightning the room was as silent as a tomb he was alone defiant in the midst of hundreds of sorceresses who knew how to harness every nuance of the power with which they were born he knew next to nothing of his ability and was collared by a radahan besides in this he may have been a stag but a stag challenging a congregation of lions hungry lions richard rolled up his left sleeve he drew his sworda swordin defiance of the prodigious power arrayed before him the distinctive ring of steel filled the silence as the blade was brought free nicci stood spellbound as he listed his conditions he finally pointed back with the sword sister verna captured me i have fought her every step of this journey she has done everything short of killing me and draping my body over a horse to get me here though she too is my captor and enemy i owe her certain debts if anyone lays a finger to her because of me i will kill that person and the truce will be ended nicci couldnt fathom such a strange sense of honor but somehow she knew it fit what she saw in his eyes the crowd gasped as richard drew his sword across the inside of his arm he turned it wiping both sides in the blood until it dripped from the tip nicci could plainly see even if the others could not much as she saw in his eyes a quality others did not seethat the sword united with and completed magic within him his knuckles white around the hilt he thrust the glistening crimson blade into the air i give you a blood oath he cried out harm the baka ban mana harm sister verna or harm me and the truce will be ended and i promise you we will have war if we have war i will lay waste to the palace of the prophets from the upper balcony where richard couldnt see him jedidiahs mocking voice drifted out over the crowd all by yourself doubt me at your peril i am a prisoner i have nothing to live for i am the flesh of prophecy i am the bringer of death no answer came in the stupefied silence probably every woman in the room knew of the prophecy of the bringer of death though none was certain of its intended meaning the text of that prophecy along with all the others was kept in the vaults deep under the palace of the prophets that richard knew it that he dared declare it aloud in such company augured the worst possible interpretation every lioness in the room retracted her claws in caution richard drove his sword home into its scabbard as if to punctuate his threat nicci knew that the profound importance of what she had seen in his eyes and in his presence would forever haunt her she knew too that she must destroy him nicci had to surrender favors and commit to obligations she never imagined she would have willingly done but in return she became one of richards six teachers the burdens she had taken on in return for that privilege were all worth it when she sat alone with him across a small table in his room lightly holding his handsif one could be said to lightly grasp lightningendeavoring to teach him to touch his han the essence of life and spirit within the gifted try as he might he felt nothing that in itself was peculiar the inkling of what she felt within him though was often enough to leave her unable to bring forth more than a few sparse words she had casually questioned the others and knew they were blind to it although nicci could not comprehend what it was about his intellect that his eyes and his conduct revealed she did know that it disturbed the numb safety of her indifference she ached to grasp it before she had to destroy him and at the same time ached to destroy him before she did whenever she became confident that she was beginning to unravel the mystery of his singular character and thought she could predict what he would do in a given situation he would confound her by doing something completely unexpected if not impossible time and again he reduced to ashes what she had thought was the foundation of her understanding of him she spent hours sitting alone in abysmal misery because it seemed to be in plain sight yet she couldnt define it she knew only that it was some principle important beyond measure and it remained beyond her grasp richard never happy about his situation became increasingly distant as time passed forlorn of hope nicci decided that the time had come when she went to his room for what she meant to be his final lesson and his end he surprised her by offering her a rare white rose worse he offered it with a smile and no explanation as he held it out she was so petrified that she could only manage to say why thank you richard the white roses were from only one kind of place dangerous restricted areas no student should ever have been able to enter that he apparently could and that he would so boldly offer her the proof of his trespass startled her she held the white rose carefully between a finger and thumb not knowing if he was warning herby giving her a forbidden thingthat he was the bringer of death and she was being marked or if it was a gesture of simple if strange kindness she erred on the side of caution once again his nature had stayed her hand the other sisters of the dark had plans of their own richards gift as far as nicci was concerned was probably the least remarkable and by far the least important thing about him yet liliana one of his other teachers a woman of boundless greed and limited insight thought to steal the innate ability of his han for herself it sparked a lethal confrontation which liliana lost the six of them their leader ulicia and richards five remaining teachershaving been discovered escaped with their lives and little else only to end up in jagangs clutches in the end nicci understood that quality in his eyes no better than the first moment she had seen it it had all slipped through her fingers the girl ran for her mother when nicci released her grip on the studded strap around her neck well commander kardeef shrieked he planted his fists on his hips are you through with your games its time these people learned the true meaning of ruthless nicci stared into the depths of his dark eyes they were defiant angry and determinedyet they were nothing at all like richards eyes nicci turned to the soldiers she gestured you two seize the commander the men blinked dumbly commander kardeefs face went red with rage thats it youve finally gone too far he wheeled to his men a whole field of themtwo thousand of them he pointed a thumb back over his shoulder at nicci grab this lunatic witch half a dozen men nearest to her drew weapons as they rushed her like all order field troops they were big strong and quick they were also experienced nicci thrust a fist out in the direction of the closest as he lifted his whip to lash out and entangle her with the speed of thought both additive magic and subtractive twined together in a lethal mix as she unleashed a focused bolt of power it produced a burst of light so hot and so white that for an instant it made the sunlight seem dim and cold by comparison the blast blew a mellonsized hole through the center of the soldiers chest for an instant before the internal pressure forced his organs to fill the sudden void she could see men behind through the gaping hole in his chest the afterimage of the flare lingered in her minds eye like lightnings arc the acrid smell of scorched air stung her eyes the clap of her powers thunder rumbled out across the surrounding green fields of wheat before the soldier hit the ground nicci unleased her power on three more of the charging men taking off ones entire shoulder the wallop whirling him around like a ghastly fountain the dangling limb flinging off into the crowd a third man was cut almost in two she felt the concussion of the following bolt deep in her chest and amid a blinding flash the fourth mans head came apart in a cloud of red mist and bony debris her warning gaze met the eyes of two men with knives gripped in whiteknuckled fists they halted many more took a step back as the four reports to her so separate yet so close atop one another that they almost merged into one ripping blast still echoed off the buildings now she said in a quiet calm composed voice that by its very gentleness betrayed how deadly earnest was the threat if you men do not follow my orders and seize commander kardeef i will seize him myself but of course not until after ive killed every last one of you the only sound was the moan of wind between the buildings do as i say or die i will not wait the big men knowing her made their decision in the instant they knew was all she would grant them and leaped to seize the commander he managed to draw his sword kadar kardeef was no stranger to pitched battle he screamed orders as he fought them off more than one man fell dead in the melee others cried out as they took wounds from behind men finally caught the deadly sword arm additional men piled on the commander until they had him disarmed down on the ground and finally under control what do you think youre doing kadar kardeef roared at her as the men pulled him to his feet nicci closed the distance between them the soldiers held his arms twisted behind his back she stared into his wild eyes why commander i am merely following your orders what are you talking about she smiled without humor just because she knew it would further madden him one of the men glanced back over his shoulder what do you want done with him dont hurt himi want him fully conscious strip him and bind him to the pole pole what pole the pole that held the pigs you men ate nicci snapped her fingers and they began pulling off their commanders clothes she watched without emotion as he was finally stripped his gear and prized weapons became plunder quickly disappearing into the hands of men he had commanded they grunted with effort as they fought to bind the struggling naked hairy commander to the pole at his back nicci turned to the stunned crowd commander kardeef wishes you to know how ruthless we can be i am going to carry out those orders and demonstrate it for you she turned back to the soldiers put him over the fire to roast like a pig the soldiers bore the struggling furious kadar kardeef the hero of the little gap campaign to the fire pit they knew that jagang watched them through her eyes they had reason to be confident that the emperor would stop her if he wished to after all he was the dream walker and they had seen him force her and the other sisters to submit to his wishes countless times no matter how degrading those wishes were they could not know that for some reason jagang did not have access to her mind right then the wooden ends of the pole clattered into the sockets in the stone supports to each side of the fire pit the pole sprang up and down with the weight of its load the weight finally settled leaving kadar kardeef to hang facedown he had little choice but to watch the glowing coals beneath him even though the fire had burned down it wasnt long before the heat of the wavering low flames began causing him distress as people watched in silent dismay the commander twisted as he shrieked orders demanding that his men take him down promising them punishment if they delayed his diatribe trailed off as he began gasping for control of his growing dread watching the eyes of the towns people nicci pointed behind her this is how ruthless the imperial order is they will slowly painfully burn to death a great commander a war hero a man known and revered far and wide a man who has served them well just to prove to you the people of an insignificant little town that they will not hesitate to kill anyone our goal is the good of all and that goal is held more important than any mere man among us this is the proof now do you people for any reason still think that we would shrink from harming any or all of you if you dont contribute to the common good nearly everyone shook their heads as they all mumbled no mistress behind her commander kardeef writhed in pain he again yelled at his men commanding them to bring him down and to kill the crazy witch none of the soldiers moved to comply with his orders to look at them they didnt even hear him these men had no notion of compassion there was only life and death they chose life that choice required his death nicci stood watching the eyes of the people as the minutes dragged on the commander was up a good distance from the low flames but there was a expansive bed of broiling hot coals she knew that from time to time the gusty breeze diverted the fierce heat to give him a fleeting reprieve it would only prolong his ordeal the heat was inexorable still it would take some time she didnt ask for more firewood she was in no hurry peoples noses wrinkled everyone could smell his body hair burning no one dared speak as the ordeal wore on the skin across kardeefs chest and stomach reddened and then darkened it was a good fifteen minutes before it finally began to crack and split open he shrieked in pain nearly the entire time the smell turned to a surprisingly pleasant aroma of cooking meat in the end he gave in to wailing for mercy he called her name begging her to bring it to an end to either free him or to finish him quickly as she listened to him sob her name she stroked the gold ring through her lower lip his voice little more to her than the buzzing of a fly the thin layer of fat that lay over his powerful muscles began melting he grew hoarse fueled by the fat flames flared up scorching his face nicci kardeef knew his pleas for mercy were falling on indifferent ears he betrayed his true feelings you vicious bitch you deserved everything i did to your she casually confronted his wild gaze yes i did give my regards to the keeper kadar tell him yourself when jagang finds out about this hell tear you limb from limb youll soon be in the underworld in the keepers hands his words were once more but a trifling drone sweat beaded on peoples foreheads as the spectacle dragged on they needed no spoken orders to know she expected them to remain and watch the whole thing their own imaginations should they consider disobeying her unspoken orders would dream up punishments she never could only the boys were fascinated by the remarkable exhibition knowing looks passed among them torture such as this was a treat to the minds of young immortals someday they might make good order troopsif they didnt grow up nicci met the glare of the girl the hatred in those eyes was breathtaking even though the girl had been afraid of the dunking and scrubbing her eyes at the time had shown that the world was still a wondrous place and she was someone special now her eyes betrayed her lost innocence the whole time nicci stood tall with her back straight and shoulders square to take the full blow of the girls bright new hatred feeling the rare sensation of experiencing something the girl had no idea that commander kardeef had taken her place in the flames when the commander finally went silent nicci turned her eyes from the girl and spoke to the towns people the past is gone you are part of the imperial order if you people dont do the moral thing by contributing toward the wellbeing of your fellow citizens of the order i will return they did not doubt her if there was one thing they obviously wanted it was never to see her again one of the soldiers his fists trembling at his sides tramped forward in halting steps his eyes were wide with bewildered pain i want you back darlin he growled in a voice that didnt match the startled expression in his eyes the voice turned deadly and i want you back right now there was no mistaking jagangs voice or the rage in it it was difficult for him to control the mind of one without the gift he had the soldier in a tenacious grip jagang would not have used a soldier thereby betraying his impotence had he been able to reach in and control niccis mind she had absolutely no idea why he had suddenly lost the link to her it had happened before she knew he would eventually reestablish his ability to hurt her she had merely to wait you are angry with me excellency what do you think she shrugged since kadar was your better in bed i would think you would be pleased get yourself back here right now the soldier roared in jagangs voice do you understand right now nicci bowed but of course excellency as she straightened she yanked the soldiers long knife from the sheath at his belt and slammed it hiltdeep into his muscled gut she gritted her teeth with the effort of pivoting the handle sideways sweeping the blade in a lethal arc through his insides she doubted the man felt his messy death writhing at her feet while she waited for her carriage to make its way around the square he died with jagangs chuckle on his lips since a dream walker could only be in a living mind for the time being the afternoon returned to quiet after her carriage rocked to a dusty halt a soldier reached up and opened the door she leaned out from the step turning back to the crowd holding the outside handrail in order to stand straight so that they all might see her her blond hair fluttered in the sunny breeze do not forget this day and how your lives were all spared by jagang the just the commander would have murdered you the emperor through me has instead shown his compassion spread the word of the mercy and wisdom of jagang the just and i will have no need to return the crowd mumbled that they would do you want us to bring the commander with us a soldier asked the man kadar kardeefs loyal second now wore kardeefs sword like vegetables fidelitys fresh vitality was fleeting its final fate stench and rot leave him to roast as a reminder everyone else will return with me to fairfield by your command he said with a bow he circled his arm and ordered the men to mount up and move out nicci leaned out farther and looked up at the driver his excellency wishes to see me although he has not said as much im reasonably sure he would like you to hurry nicci took her place on the hard leather cushion inside her back straight against the upright seat while the driver let out a shrill whistle and cracked his whip the team leaped forward jerking the carriage ahead with a hand on the windowsill she steadied herself as the ironbound wheels bounced over the hard rough ground of the town square until they reached the road where the carnage settled down into this familiar jolting ride sunlight slanted in the window falling across the empty cushion opposite her the bold bright patch glided off the seat as the carriage negotiated a curve in the road finally slipping up to come to rest in her lap like a warm cat darkly clad riders to each side ahead and behind stretched forward over the withers of their galloping mounts a rumbling roar along with billowing plumes of dust lifted into the air from the thundering hooves for the moment nicci was free of jagang she was surrounded by two thousand men yet she felt totally alone before long she would have pain to fill the terrible void she felt no joy no fear she sometimes wondered why she felt nothing but the need to hurt as the carriage raced toward jagang her thoughts were focused instead on another man trying to recall every occasion that she had seen him she went over every moment she had spent with richard cypher or as he was now knownand as jagang knew himrichard rahl she thought about his gray eyes until the day she saw him she had never believed such a person could exist when she thought about richard like now only one haunting need burned in her to destroy him chapter huge garish tents festooned the prominent hill outside the city of fairfield yet despite the festive colors erected amid the gloom despite the laughing the shouting the coarse singing and the riotous excess this was no carnival come to town but an occupying army the emperors tents and those of his retinue were styled in the fashion of the tents used by some of the nomadic people from jagangs homeland of alturrang yet they were embellished far beyond any actual tradition the emperor a man vastly exceeding any nomadic tribal leaders ability to imagine created his own cultural heritage as he saw fit around the tents covering the hills and valleys as far as nicci could see the soldiers had pitched their own small grimy tents some were oiled canvas many more were made from animal skins beyond the shared basics of practicality there was uniformity only in their lack of conformity to any one style outside some of the shabby little tents and almost as large sat ornate upholstered chairs looted from the city the juxtaposition almost looked as if it had been intentionally done for a comical effect but nicci knew the reality had no kinship to humor when the army eventually moved on such large meticulously crafted items were too cumbersome to take and would be left to rot in the weather horses were picketed haphazardly with occasional paddocks holding small herds other enclosures held meat on the hoof individual wagons were scattered here and there seemingly wherever they could find an empty spot but in other places they had been set up side by side many were camp followers others were army wagons with everything from basic supplies to blacksmith equipment the army brought along minimal siege equipment they had the gifted to use as weapons of that sort brooding clouds scudded low over the scene the humid air reeked of excrement from both animals and men the green fields all around had been churned to a muddy morass the two thousand men who had returned with nicci had disappeared into the sprawling camp like a sprinkling of raindrops into a swamp an imperial order army encampment was a place of noise and seeming confusion yet it was not as disorderly as it might appear there was a hierarchy of authority and duties and chores to attend scattered men worked in solitude on their gear oiling weapons and leather or rolling their chain mail inside barrels with sand and vinegar to clean it of rust while others cooked at fires furriers saw to the horses craftsmen saw to everything from repairing weapons to fashioning new boots to pulling teeth mystics of all sorts prowled the camp tending impoverished souls or warding troublesome demons duties completed raucous gangs gathered together for entertainment usually gambling and drinking sometimes the diversions involved the camp followers sometimes the captives even surrounded by such vast numbers nicci felt alone jagangs absence from her mind left a feeling of staggering isolationnot a sense of being forsaken but simply solitude by contrast with the dream walker in her mind not even the most intimate detail of lifeno thought no deedcould be held private his presence lurked in the dark mental corners and from there he could watch everything every word you spoke every thought you had every bite you took every time you cleared your throat every time you coughed every time you went to the privy you were never alone never the violation was debilitating the trespass complete that was what broke most of the sisters the brutal totality of it the awareness of his constant presence in your own mind watching worse almost the dream walkers roots sunk down through you but you never knew when his awareness was focused on you you might call him a vile name and with his attention elsewhere it would go unnoticed another time you might have a brief private nasty thought about him and he would know it the same instant you thought it nicci had learned to feel those roots as had many of the other sisters she had also learned to recognize when they were absent as now that never happened with the others with them those roots were permanent jagang always eventually returned though to once again sink his roots into her but for now she was alone she just didnt know why the jumble of troops and campfires left no clear route for the team so nicci had left her carriage for the walk the rest of the way up the hill it exposed her to the lecherous looks and lewd calls of the soldiers who crowded the slope she supposed that before jagang was finished with her she might be exposed to far more from the men most of the sisters were sent out to the tents from time to time to be used for the mens pleasure it was done either to punish them or sometimes merely to let them know it could be ordered on a whimto remind them that they were slaves nothing more than property nicci though was reserved for the exclusive amusement of the emperor and those he specifically selectedlike kadar kardeef many of the sisters envied her status but despite what they believed being a personal slave to jagang was no grace women were sent to the tents for a period of time maybe a week or two but the rest of the time they had less demanding duties they were valued after all for their abilities with their gift there was no such time limit for nicci she had once spent a couple of months sequestered in jagangs room so as to be there for his amusement any time of day or night the soldiers enjoyed the womens company but had to mind certain restrictions in what they could do to them jagang and his friends imposed on themselves no such limits on occasion for reason or not jagang would become furious at her and would heatedly order her to the tents for a monthto teach her a lesson he would say nicci would obediently bow and pledge it would be as he wished he knew she was not bluffing it would have been a lesser torment before she could be out the door to the tents he would turn moody command her to return to face him and then angrily retract the orders since the beginning nicci had measure by measure inch by inch acquired a certain status and freedom afforded none of the others she hadnt specifically sought it it just came about jagang had confided to her that he read the sisters thoughts and that they privately referred to her as the slave queen she supposed jagang told her so as to honor her in his own way but the title slave queen had meant no more to her than deaths mistress for now she floated like a bright waterlily flower in the dark swamp of men other sisters always made an attempt to look as drab as the men so as to go less noticed and be less desirable they only deceived themselves they lived in constant terror of what jagang might do to them what happened happened they had no choice or influence in it nicci simply didnt care she wore her fine black dresses and left her long blond hair uncovered for all to see for the most part she did as she wished she didnt care what jagang did to her and he knew it in much the way richard was an enigma to her she was an enigma to jagang too jagang was fascinated by her despite his cruelty toward her there was a spark of caution mixed in when he hurt her she welcomed it she merited the brutality pain could sometimes reach down into the dark emptiness he would then recoil from hurting her when he threatened to kill her she waited patiently for it to be done she knew she didnt deserve to live he would then withdraw the sentence of death the fact that she was sincere was her safetyand her peril she was a fawn among wolves safe in her coat of indifference the fawn was in danger only if it ran she did not view her captivity as a conflict with her interests she had no interests time and again she had the opportunity to run but didnt that perhaps more than anything captivated jagang sometimes he seemed to pay court to her she didnt know his real interest in her she never tried to discover it he occasionally professed concern for her and a few times something akin to affection other times when she left on some duty he seemed glad to be rid of her it had occurred to her because of his behavior that he might think he was in love with her as preposterous as such a thought might be it didnt matter one way or the other to her she doubted he was capable of love she seriously doubted that jagang really knew what the word meant much less the entire concept nicci knew all too well what it meant a soldier near jagangs tent stepped in front of her he grinned moronically it was meant to be an invitation by means of threat she could have dissuaded him by mentioning that jagang waited for her or she could even have used her power to drop him where he stood but instead she simply stared at him it was not the reaction he wanted many of the men rose to the bait only if it squirmed when she didnt his expression turned sour he grumbled a curse at her and moved off nicci continued on toward the emperors tent nomadic tents from alturrang were actually quite small and practical being made of bland unadorned lambskin jagang had recreated them rather more grandly than the originals his own was more oval than round three poles rather than the customary one held up the multipeaked roof the tents exterior walls were decorated with brightly embroidered panels around the top edge of the sides where the roof met the walls hung fistsized multicolored tassels and streamers that marked the traveling palace of the emperor banners and pennants of bright yellow and red atop the huge tent hung limp in the stale lateafternoon air outside a woman beat small rugs hung over one of the tents lines nicci lifted aside the heavy doorway curtain embellished with gold shields and hammered silver medallions depicting battle scenes inside slaves were at work sweeping the expanse of carpets dusting the delicate ceramic ware set about on the elaborate furnishings and fussing at the hundreds of colorful pillows lining the edge of the floor hangings richly decorated with traditional alturrang designs divided the space into several rooms a few openings overhead covered with gauzy material let in a little light all the thick materials created a quiet place amid the noise lamps and candles lent sleepy light to the soft room nicci did not acknowledge the eyes of the guards flanking the inside of the doorway or those of the other slaves going about their domestic duties in the middle of the front room sat jagangs ornate chair draped with red silks this was where he sometimes took audiences but the chair was empty she didnt falter as did other women summoned by his excellency but strode resolutely toward his bedroom in the rear section one of the slaves a nearly naked boy looking to be in his late teens was down on his hands and knees with a small whiskbroom sweeping the carpet set before the entrance to the bedroom without meeting niccis gaze he informed her that his excellency was not occupying his tents the young man irwin was gifted he had lived at the palace of the prophets training to be a wizard now irwin tended the fringe of carpets and emptied the chamber pots niccis mother would have approved jagang could be any number of places he might be off gambling or drinking with his men he could be inspecting his troops or the craftsmen who attended them he might be looking over the new captives selecting those he wanted for himself he might be talking with kadar kardeefs second nicci saw several sisters cowering in a corner like her they too were jagangs slaves as she strode up to the three women she saw that they were busy sewing mending some of the tents gear sister nicci sister georgia rushed to her feet as a look of relief washed across her face we didnt know if you were alive or dead we havent seen you for so long we thought maybe you had vanished being that nicci was a sister of the dark sworn to the keeper of the underworld she found the concern from three sisters of the light to be somewhat insincere nicci supposed that they considered their captivity a common bond and their feelings about it paramount overcoming their more basic rifts too they knew jagang treated her differently they were probably eager to be seen as friendly ive been away on business for his excellency of course sister georgia said drywashing her hands as she dipped her head the other two sisters rochelle and aubrey set aside the bag of bone buttons and tent thread untangled themselves from yards of canvas and then stood beside sister georgia they both bowed their heads slightly to nicci the three of them feared her inscrutable standing with jagang sister nicci his excellency is very angry sister rochelle said furious sister aubrey confirmed he he railed at the walls saying that you had gone too far this time nicci only stared sister aubrey licked her lips we just thought you should know so you can be careful nicci thought this would be a poor time to suddenly begin being careful she found the groveling of women hundreds of years her senior annoying wheres jagang he has taken a grand building not far outside the city as his quarters sister aubrey said it used to be the minister of cultures estate sister rochelle added nicci frowned why he has his tents since youve been gone hes decided that an emperor needs proper quarters sister rochelle said proper proper for what to show the world his importance i suppose sister aubrey nodded hes having a palace built in alturrang its his new vision she arced an arm through the air apparently indicating with the slice of her hand the grand scale of the place hes ordered a magnificent palace built he was planning on using the palace of the prophets sister rochelle said but since it was destroyed hes decided to build another only betterthe most opulent palace ever conceived nicci frowned at the three women he wanted the palace of the prophets because it had a spell to slow aging that was what interested him all three women shrugged nicci began to get an inkling of what jagang might have in mind so this place hes at now what is he doing learning to eat with something other than his fingers seeing how he likes living the fancy life under a roof he only told us he was staying there for now sister georgia said he took most of the younger women with him he told us to stay here and see to things in case he wished to return to his tent it didnt sound like much had changed except the setting nicci sighed her carriage was gone she would have to walk all right how do i find the place after sister aubrey gave her detailed directions nicci thanked them and turned to go sister alessandra has vanished sister georgia said in a voice straining mightily to sound nonchalant nicci stopped in her tracks she rounded on sister georgia the woman was middle aged and seemed to look worse every time nicci saw her her clothes were little more than tattered rags she wore with the pride of a fine uniform her thin hair was more white than brown it might once have looked distinguished but it didnt appear to have seen a brush much less soap for weeks she was probably infested with lice too some people looked forward to age as an excuse to become a frump as if all along their greatest ambition in life had been to be drab and unattractive sister georgia seemed to delight in dowdiness what do you mean sister alessandra has vanished nicci caught the slight twitch of satisfaction georgia spread her hands innocently we dont know what happened shes just turned up missing still nicci did not move i see sister georgia spread her hands again feigning simplemindedness it was about the time the prelate disappeared too nicci denied them the reward of astonishment what was verna doing here not verna sister rochelle said she leaned in ann sister georgia scowled her displeasure at rochelle for spoiling the surpriseand a surprise it was the old prelate had diedat least that was what nicci had been told since leaving the place of the prophets nicci had heard about all the other sisters novices and young men spending the night at the funeral pyre for ann and the prophet nathan knowing ann there was obviously some sort of deception afoot but even for her such a thing would be extraordinary the three sisters smiled like cats with a carp they looked eager for a long game of truthandgossip give me the important details i dont have time for the long version his excellency wishes to see me nicci took in the three wilting smiles she kept her voice level unless you want to risk him returning here angry and impatient to see me sisters rochelle and aubrey blanched georgia abandoned the game and went back to dry washing her hands the prelate came to the camp when you were goneand was captured why would she come into jagangs midst to try to convince us to escape with her sister rochelle blurted out a shrill titter jittery rather than amusedburbled up she had some silly story about the chimes being loose and magic failing imagine that wild stories they were expected us to believe so that was what happened nicci whispered as she stared off in reflection she realized instantly it was no wild story pieces began fitting together nicci used her gift the others werent allowed to so they might not know if magic had failed for a time thats what she claimed sister georgia said so magic had failed nicci reasoned aloud and she thought that would prevent the dream walker from controlling your minds that might explain much of what nicci didnt understand why jagang sometimes couldnt enter her mind but if the chimes are loose were sister georgia said even if it was true for a time they now have been banished his excellency has full access to us im happy to say and everything else concerning magic has returned to normal nicci could almost see the three of them wondering if jagang was listening to their words but if magic was returned to normal jagang should be in niccis mind he wasnt she felt the spark of a possible understanding fizzle and die so the prelate made a blunder and jagang caught her well not exactly sister rochelle said sister georgia went and got the guards we turned her in as was our duty nicci burst out with a laugh her own sisters of the light how ironic she risks her life while the chimes have interrupted magic to come and save your worthless hides and instead of escaping with her you turn her in how fitting we had to sister georgia protested his excellency would have wished it our place is to serve we know better than to try to escape we know our place nicci surveyed their tense faces these women sworn to the creators light these sisters of the light who had worked hundreds of years in his name yes you do youd have done the same sister aubrey snapped we had to or his excellency would have taken it out on the others it was our duty to the welfare of the othersand that includes you i might add we couldnt think only of ourselves or ann but had to think of what was good for everyone nicci felt the numb indifference smothering her fine so you betrayed the prelate only a spark of curiosity remained but what made her think she could escape with you for good surely she must have had some plan for the chimes what was she expecting to happen when jagang once again had access to your mindsand hers his excellency is always with us sister aubrey insisted ann was just trying to fill our heads with her preposterous notions we know better the rest of it was just a trick too we were too smart for her rest of it what was the rest of her plan sister georgia huffed her indignation she tried to tell us some foolishness about a bond to richard rahl nicci blinked she concentrated on keeping her breathing even bond what nonsense are you talking about now sister georgia met niccis gaze squarely she insisted that if we swore allegiance to richard it would protect us she claimed some magic of his would keep jagang from our mind how sister georgia shrugged she claimed this bond business protected peoples minds from dream walkers but we arent that gullible to still her fingers nicci pressed her hands to her thighs i dont understand how would such a thing work she said something about it being inherited from his ancestor she claimed that we had but to swear loyalty to him loyalty in our heartsor some such nonsense to tell the truth it was so preposterous i wasnt really paying that much attention she claimed that was why jagang couldnt enter her mind nicci was staggered of course she had always wondered why jagang didnt capture the rest of the sisters there were many more still free they were protected by this bond to richard it had to be true it made sense her own leader sister ulicia and richards other teachers had escaped too but that didnt seem to make sense they were sisters of the darklike niccithey would have had to swear loyalty to richard nicci couldnt imagine such a thing but then jagang was often unable to enter niccis mind you said sister alessandra has vanished sister georgia fussed with the collar of her scruffy dress she and ann both vanished jagang doesnt bother to inform you of his actions perhaps he simply had them put to death georgia glanced at her companions well maybe but sister alessandra was one of yours a sister of the dark she was caring for ann why werent you caring for her you are her sisters sister georgia cleared her throat she threw such a fit about us that his excellency assigned sister alessandra to look after her nicci could only imagine that it must have been quite a fit but after being betrayed by her own sisters it was understandable jagang would have thought the woman valuable enough that he wanted to keep her alive as we marched into the city the wagon with anns cage never showed up sister georgia went on one of the drivers finally came around with a bloody head and reported that the last thing he saw before the world went dark was sister alessandra now the two of them are gone nicci felt her fingernails digging into her palms she made herself relax her fists so ann offered you all freedom and you chose instead to continue to be slaves the three women lifted their noses we did what is best for everyone sister georgia said we are sisters of the light our duty is not to ourselves but to relieve the suffering of othersnot cause it besides sister aubrey added we dont see you leaving seems youve been free of his excellency from time to time and you dont go nicci frowned how do you know that well i i mean sister aubrey stammered nicci seized the woman by the throat i asked you a question answer it sister aubreys face reddened as nicci added the force of her gift to the grip the tendons in her wrist stood out with the strain the womans eyes showed white all around as niccis power began squeezing the life from her unlike nicci jagang possessed their minds and they were prohibited from using their power except at his direction sister georgia gently placed a hand on niccis forearm his excellency questioned us about it thats all sister let her go please nicci released the woman but turned her glare on sister georgia questioned you what do you mean what did he say he simply wanted to know if we knew why he was from time to time blocked from your mind he hurt us sister rochelle said he hurt us with his questions because we had no answer we dont understand it for the first time nicci did sister aubrey comforted her throat what is it with you sister nicci why is it his excellency is so curious about you why is it you can resist him nicci turned and walked away thank you for the help sisters if you can be free of him why do you not leave sister georgia called out nicci turned back from the doorway i enjoy seeing jagang torment you witches of the light i stay around so that i might watch they were unmoved by her insolencethey were accustomed to it sister nicci rochelle said smoothing back her frizz of hair what did you do that made his excellency so angry what oh that nothing of importance i just had the men tie commander kardeef to a pole and roast him over a fire the three of them gasped as they straightened as one they reminded nicci of three owls on a branch sister georgia fixed nicci with a grim glare a rare blaze of authority born of seniority you deserve everything jagang does to you sisterand what the keeper will do to you too nicci smiled and said yes i do before ducking through the tent opening chapter the city of fairfield had returned to a semblance of order it was the order of a military post little of what could be said to make a city was left many of the buildings remained but there were few of the people who had once lived and worked in them some of the buildings had been reduced to charred beams and blackened rubble others were hulks with windows and doors broken out yet most were much the same as they had been before except of course that all had been emptied in the wanton looting the buildings stood like husks only a reminder of past life here and there a few toothless old people sat legs splayed leaning against a wall watching with empty eyes the masses of armed men moving up and down their streets orphaned children wandered in a daze or peered out from dark passageways nicci found it remarkable how quickly civilization could be stripped from a place as she walked through the streets nicci thought she understood how many of the buildings would feel if they could feel empty devoid of life lacking purpose while they waited for someone to serve their only true value being in service to the living the streets populated as they were by grimfaced soldiers gaunt beggars the skeletal old and sick wailing children all amongst the rubble and filth looked much like some of the streets nicci remembered from when she was little her mother often sent her out to streets like this to minister to the destitute its the fault of men like your father her mother had said hes just like my father was he has no feelings no concern for anyone but himself hes heartless nicci had stood wearing a freshly washed frilly blue dress her hair brushed and pinned back her hands hanging at her sides listening as her mother lectured on good and evil on the ways of sin and redemption nicci hadnt understood a lot of it but in later years it would be repeated until she would come to know every word every concept every desolate truth by heart niccis father was wealthy worse to mothers way of thinking he wasnt morseful about it mother explained that selfinterest and greed were like the eyes of a monstrous evil always looking for yet more power and gold to feed its insatiable hunger you must learn nicci that a persons moral course in this life is to help others not yourself mother said money cant buy the creators blessing but how can we show the creator were good nicci asked mankind is a wretched lot unworthy morbid and foul we must fight depraved nature helping others is the only way to prove your souls value its only true good a person can do niccis father had been born a noble but all his adult life he had worked as armorer mother believed that he had been born with comfortable wealth and instead of being satisfied with that he sought to build his legacy into a shameless fortune she said wealth could only be had by fleecing it from the poor in one fashion or another others of the nobility like mother and many of her friends were content not to squeeze an undeserved share from the sweat of the poor nicci felt great guilt for fathers wicked ways for his illgotten wealth mother said she was doing her best to try to save his straying soul nicci never worried for her mothers soul because people were always saying how caring how kindhearted how charitable mother was but nicci would sometimes lie awake at night unable to sleep with worry for father worry that the creator might exact punishment before father could be redeemed while mother went to meetings with her important friends the nanny on the way to the market often took nicci to fathers business to ask his wishes for dinner nicci relished watching and learning things at fathers work it was a fascinating place when she was very young she thought she might grow up to be an armorer too at home she would sit on the floor and play at hammering on an item of clothing meant to be armor laid on an upturned shoe used as an anvil that innocent time was her fondest memory of her childhood niccis father had a great many people working for him wagons brought foursquare bars and other supplies from distant places heavy castmetal sows came in on barges other wagons with guards took goods to faroff customers there were men who forged metal men who hammered it into shape and yet other men who shaped glowing metal into weapons some of the blades were made from costly poison steel said to inflict mortal wounds even in a small cut there were other men who sharpened blades men who polished armor and men who did beautiful engraving and artwork on shields armor and blades there were even women who worked for niccis father helping to make chain mail nicci watched them sitting on benches at long wooden tables gossiping a bit among themselves tittering at stories as they worked with their pincers burring over tiny rivets in the flattened ends of all those thousands of little steel rings that together went into the making of a suit of chainmail armor nicci thought it remarkable that mans inventiveness could turn something as hard as metal into a suit of clothes men from all around and from distant places too came to buy her fathers armor father said it was the finest armor made his eyes the color of the blue sky on a perfect summer day sparkled wonderfully when he spoke of his armor some was so beautiful that kings traveled from great distances to have armor ordered and fitted some was so elaborate that it took skilled men hunched at benches many months to make blacksmiths bellowsmen hammermen millmen platers armorers polishers leatherworkers riveters patternmakers silversmiths guilders engraving artists even seamstresses for the making of the quilted and padded linen and of course apprentices came from great distances hoping to work for her father many of those with skills lugged along samples of their best work to show him father turned away far more than he hired niccis father was an impressive figure upright angular and intense at his work his blue eyes always seemed to nicci to see more than any other person saw as if the metal spoke to him when his fingers glided over it he seemed to move his limbs precisely as much as was needed and no more to nicci he was a vision of power strength and purpose officers officials and nobility came round to talk to him as did suppliers and his workers when nicci went to her fathers work she was always astonished to see him engaged in so much conversation mother said it was because he was arrogant and made his poor workers pay court to him nicci liked to watch the intricate dance of people working the workers would pause to smile at her answer her questions and sometimes let her hit the metal with a hammer from the looks of it father enjoyed talking to all those people too at home mother talked and father said little as his face took on the look of hammered steel when he did talk at home he spoke almost exclusively about his work nicci listened to every word wanting to learn all about him and his business mother confided that at his core his vile nature ate away at his invisible soul nicci always hoped to someday redeem his soul and make it as healthy as he outwardly appeared he adored nicci but seemed to think raising her was a task too sacred for his coarse hands so he left it to mother even when he disagreed with something he would bow to mothers wishes saying she would know best about such a domestic duty his work kept him busy most of the time mother said it was a sign of his barren soul that he spent so much of his time at building his richestaking from people she often called itrather than giving of himself to people as the creator meant all men to do many times when father came home for dinner while servants scurried in and out with all the dishes theyd prepared mother would go on in tortured tones about how bad things were in the world nicci often heard people say that mother was a noble woman because of how deeply she cared after dinner father would go back to work often without a word that would anger mother because she had more to tell him about his soul but he was too busy to listen nicci remembered occasions when mother would stand at the window looking out over the dark city worrying no doubt about all the things that plagued her peace on those quiet nights father sometimes glided up behind mother putting a hand tenderly to her back as if she were something of great value he seemed to be mellow and contented at those moments he squeezed her bottom just a little as he whispered something in her ear she would look up hopefully and ask him to contribute to the efforts of her fellowship he would ask how much peering up into his eyes as if searching for some shred of human decency she would name a figure he would sigh and agree his hands would settle around her waist and he would say that it was late and that they should retire to bed once when he asked her how much she wished him to contribute she shrugged and said i dont know what does your conscience tell you howard but a man of true compassion would do better than you usually do considering that you have more than your fair share of wealth and the need is so great he sighed how much do you and your friends need it is not me and my friends who need it howard but the masses of humanity crying out for help our fellowship simply struggles to meet the need how much he repeated she said five hundred gold crowns as if the number were a club she had been hiding behind her back and seeing the opening she had been waiting for she suddenly brandished it to bully him with a gasp father staggered back a step do you have any idea of the work required to make a sum of that size you do no work howardyour slaves do it for you slaves they are the finest craftsmen they should be you steal the best workers from all over the land i pay the best wages in the land they are eager to work for me they are the poor victims of your tricks you exploit them you charge more than anyone else you have connections and make deals to cut out other armorers you steal the food from the mouths of working people just to line your own pockets i offer the finest work people buy from me because they want the best i charge a fair price for it no one charges as much as you and thats the simple fact you always want more gold is your only goal people come to me willingly because i have the highest standards that is my goal the other shops produce haphazard work that doesnt proof out my tempering is superior my work is all proofed to a doublestamp standard i wont sell inferior work people trust me they know i create the best pieces your workers do you simply rake in the money the profits go to wages and to the businessi just sank a fortune into the new batteringmill business business business when i ask you to give a little something back to the community to those in need you act as if i wanted you to gouge out your eyes would you really rather see people die than to give a pittance to save them does money really mean more to you howard than peoples lives are you that cruel and unfeeling a man father hung his head for a time and at last quietly agreed to send his man around with the gold his voice came gentle again he said he didnt want people to die and he hoped the money would help he told her it was time for bed youve put me off howard with your arguing you couldnt just give charitably of yourself it always has to be dragged out of youwhen its the right thing to do in the first place you only agree now because of your lecherous needs honestly do you think i have no principles father simply turned and headed for the door he paused as he suddenly saw nicci sitting on the floor watching the look on his face frightened her not because it was angry or fierce but because there seemed to be so much in his eyes and the weight of never being able to express it was crushing him raising nicci was mothers work and he had promised her he would not meddle he swept his blond hair back from his forehead then turned and picked up his coat in a level voice he said to mother that he was going to go see to some things at work after he was gone mother too saw nicci forgotten on the floor playing with beads on a board pretending to make chain mail her arms folded she stood over nicci for a long moment your father goes to whores you know im sure thats where hes off to now a whore you may be too young to understand but i want you to know so that you dont ever put any faith in him hes an evil man ill not be his whore now put away your things and come with mother im going to see my friends its time you came along and began learning about the needs of others instead of just your own wants at her friends house there were a few men and several women sitting and talking in serious tones when they politely inquired after father niccis mother reported that he was off working or whoring i dont know which and can control neither some of the women laid a hand on her her arm and comforted her it was a terrible burden she bore they said across the room sat a silent man who looked to nicci as grim as death itself mother quickly forgot about father as she became engrossed in the discussion her friends were having about the terrible conditions of people in the city people were suffering from hunger injuries sickness disease lack of skill no work too many children to feed elderly to care for no clothes no roof over their heads and every other kind of strife imaginable it was all so frightening nicci was always anxious when mother talked about how things couldnt go on the way they were for much longer and that something had to be done nicci wished someone would hurry up and do it nicci listened as mothers fellowship friends talked about all the intolerant people who harbored hate nicci feared ending up as one of those terrible people she didnt want the creator to punish her for having a cold heart mother and her friends went on at great length about their deep feelings for all the problems around them after each person said their piece they would steal a glance over at the man sitting solemnly in a straight chair against the wall watching with careful dark eyes as they talked the prices of things are just terrible a man with droopy eyelids said he was all crumpled down in his chair like a pile of dirty clothes it isnt fair people shouldnt be allowed to just raise their prices whenever they want the duke should do something he has the kings ear the duke mother said she sipped her tea yes ive always found the duke to be a man sympathetic to good causes i think he could be persuaded to introduce sensible laws mother glanced over the gold rim of her cup at the man in the straight chair one of the women said she would encourage her husband to back the duke another spoke up that they would write a letter of support for such an idea people are starving a wrinkled woman said into a lull in the conversation people eagerly mumbled their acknowledgment as if this were an umbrella to run in under to escape the drenching silence i see it every day if we could just help some of those unfortunate people one of the other women puffed herself up like a chicken ready to lay an egg its just terrible the way no one will give them a job when theres plenty of work if it was just spread around i know mother said with a tsk ive talked to howard until im blue in the face he just hires people who please him rather than those needing the job the most its a disgrace the others sympathized with her burden it isnt right that a few men should have so much more than they need while so many people have so much less the man with the droopy eyelids said its immoral man has no right to exist for his own sake mother was quick to put in as she nibbled on a piece of dense cake while glancing again at the grimly silent man i tell howard all the time that selfsacrifice in the service of others is mans highest moral duty and his only reason for being placed in this life to that end mother announced i have decided to contribute five hundred gold crowns to our cause the other people gasped their delight and congratulated mother for her charitable nature they agreed as they sneaked peeks across the room that the creator would reward her in the next life and talked about all they would be able to do to help those less fortunate souls mother finally turned and regarded nicci for a moment and then said i believe my daughter is old enough to learn to help others nicci sat forward on the edge of her chair thrilled at the idea of at last putting her hand to what mother and her friends said was noble work it was as if the creator himself had offered her a path to salvation i would so like to do good mother mother cast a questioning look at the man in the straight chair brother narev the deep creases of his face pleated to each side as the thin line of his mouth stretched in a smile there was no joy in it or in his dark eyes hooded beneath a brow of tangled white and black hairs he wore a creased cap and heavy robes as dark as dried blood wisps of his wiry hair above his ears curled up around the edge of the cap that came halfway down on his forehead he stroked his jaw with the side of a finger as he spoke in a voice that almost rattled the teacups so child you wish to be a little soldier well no sir nicci didnt know what soldiering had to do with doing good mother always said that father pandered to men in an evil occupationsoldiers she said soldiers only cared about killing i wish to help those in need that is what we all try to do child his spooky smile remained fixed on his face as he spoke we here are all soldiers in the fellowshipthe fellowship of orderas we call our little group all soldiers fighting for justice everyone seemed too timid to look directly at him they glanced for a moment looked away then glanced back again as if his face was not something to be taken in all at once but sipped at like a scaldinghot foultasting remedy mothers brown eyes darted around like a cockroach looking for a crack why of course brother narev that is the only moral sort of soldierthe charitable sort she urged nicci up and scooted her forward nicci brother narev here is a great man brother narev is the high priest of the fellowship of orderan ancient sect devoted to doing the creators will in this world brother narev is a sorcerer she cast a smile up at him brother narev this is my daughter nicci her mothers hands pushed her at the man as if she were an offering for the creator unlike everyone else nicci couldnt take her gaze from his hooded eyes she had never seen their like there was nothing in them but dark cold emptiness he held out a hand pleased to meet you nicci curtsy and kiss his hand dear mother prompted nicci went to one knee she kissed the knuckles so as not to have to put her lips on the spongy web of thick blue veins covering the back of his hairy hand floating before her face the whitish knobs were cold but not icy as she had expected we welcome you to our movement nicci he said in that deep rattling voice of his with your mothers caring hand raising you up i know you will do the creators work nicci thought that the creator himself must be very much like this man from all the things her mother told her nicci feared the creators wrath she was old enough to know that she had to start doing the good work her mother always talked about if she was to have any chance at salvation everyone said mother was a caring moral person nicci wanted to be a good person too but good work seemed so hard so sternnot at all like her fathers work where people smiled and laughed and talked with their hands thank you brother narev nicci said i will do my best to do good in the world one day with the help of fine young people like you we will change the world i dont delude myself with so much callousness among men it will take time to win true converts but we here in this room along with others of like mind throughout the land are the foundation of hope is the fellowship a secret then nicci asked in a whisper everyone chuckled brother narev didnt laugh but his mouth smiled again no child quite the contrary it is our most fervent wish and duty to spread the truth of mankinds corruption the creator is perfect we mortals are but miserable wretches we must recognize our wicked nature if we hope to avoid his righteous wrath and reap our deliverance in the next world selfsacrifice for the good of all is the only route to salvation our fellowship is open to all those willing to give of themselves and live ethical lives most people dont take us seriously someday they will gleaming mousy eyes around the room watched without blinking as his deep powerful voice rose like the creators own fury a day will come when the hot flames of change will sweep across the land burning away the old the decaying and the foul to allow a new order to grow from the blackened remains of evil after we burn clean the world there will be no kings yet the world will have order championed by the hand of the common man for the common man only then will there be no hunger no shivering in the cold no suffering without help the good of the people will be put above the selfish desires of the individual nicci wanted to do goodshe truly did but his voice sounded to her like a rusty dungeon door grating shut on her all the eyes in the room watched her to see if she was good like her mother that sounds wonderful brother narev he nodded it will be child you will help bring this to be let your feelings be your guide you will be a soldier marching toward a new world order it will be a long and arduous task you must keep the faith the rest of us in this room will not likely live to see it flourish but perhaps you will live long enough to one day see such a wondrous order come to pass nicci swallowed i will pray for it brother narev chapter the next day loaded with a big basket of bread nicci was let out of the carrage along with a gaggle of other people from the fellowship to fan out and distribute bread to the needy mother had attired her in a ruffled red dress for the special occasion her short white stockings had designs stitched in red thread filled with pride to at last be doing good nicci marched down the garbage strewn street armed with her basket of bread thinking about the day when the hope of a new order could be spread to all so that all could finally rise up out of destitution and despair some people smiled and thanked her for the bread some took the bread without a word or a smile most though were surly about it complaining that the bread was late and the loaves were too small or the wrong kind nicci was not discouraged she told them what mother had said that it was the bakers fault because he baked bread for profit first and since he received a reduced rate for charity baked that second nicci told them that she was sorry that wicked people treated them as secondrate but that someday the fellowship of order would come to the land and see to it that everyone was treated the same as nicci walked down the street handing out the bread a man snatched her arm and pulled her into the stench of a narrow dark alley she offered him a loaf of bread he swiped the basket out of her hands he said he wanted silver or gold nicci told him she had no money she gasped in panic as he yanked her close his filthy probing fingers groped everywhere on her body even violating her most private places looking for a purse but found none hidden on her he pulled off her shoes and threw them away when he found they had no coins hidden in them his fist punched her twice in the stomach nicci crashed to the ground he spat a curse at her as he stole away into the shadowed heaps of refuse holding herself up on trembling arms nicci vomited into the oily water running from under the mounds of offal people passing the alley looked in and saw her retching there on the ground but turned their eyes back to the street and hurried on their way a few quickly darted into the alley bent and scooped up bread from the overturned basket before rushing off nicci panted tears stinging her eyes trying to get her wind back her knees were bleeding her dress was splattered with scum when she returned home in tears mother smiled at seeing her their plight often brings tears to my eyes too nicci shook her head her golden locks swinging side to side and told mother that a man had grabbed her and hit her demanding money nicci reached for her mother as she wailed in misery that he was a wicked wicked man mother smacked her mouth dont you dare judge people you are just a child how can you presume to judge others stopped cold nicci was bewildered by the slap more startling than painful the rebuke stung more but mother he was cruel to mehe touched me everywhere and then he hit me mother smacked her mouth again harder the second time ill not have you disgrace me before brother narev and my friends with such insensitive talk do you hear you dont know what made him do it perhaps he has sick children at home and he needs money to buy medicine here he sees some spoiled rich child and he finally breaks knowing his own child has been cheated in life by the likes of you and all your fine things you dont know what burdens life has handed the man dont you dare to judge people for their actions just because you are too callous and insensitive to take the time to understand them but i think mother smacked her across the mouth a third time hard enough to stagger her you think thinking is a vile acid that corrodes faith it is your duty to believe not think the mind of man is inferior to that of the creator your thoughtsthe thoughts of anyoneare worthless as all mankind is worthless you must have faith that the creator has invested his goodness in those wretched souls feelings not thinking must be your guide faith not thinking must be your only path nicci swallowed back her tears then what should i do you should be ashamed that the world treats those poor souls so cruelly that they would so pitifully strike out in confusion in the future you should find a way to help people like that because you are able and they are notthat is your duty that night when her father came home and tiptoed into her room to see if she was tucked in snugly nicci clutched two of his big fingers together and held them tight to her cheek even though her mother said he was a wicked man it felt better than anything else in the world when he knelt beside the bed and silently stroked her brow in her work on the streets nicci came to understand the needs of many of the people there their problems seemed insurmountable no matter what she did it never seemed to resolve anything brother narev said it was only a sign that she wasnt giving enough of herself each time she failed at brother narevs or mothers urging nicci redoubled her efforts one night at dinner after being in the fellowship several years she said father there is a man ive been trying to help he has ten children and no job will you hire him please father looked up from his soup why i told you he has ten children but what sort of work can he do why would i want him because he needs a job father set down his spoon nicci dear i employ skilled workers that he has ten children is not going to shape steel now is it what can the man do what skills has he if he had a skill father he could get work is it fair that his children should starve because people wont give him a chance father looked at her as if inspecting a wagonload of some suspicious new metal mothers narrow mouth turned up in a little smile but she said nothing a chance at what he has no skill with a business as big as yours surely you can give him a job he tapped a finger on the stem of his spoon as he considered her determined expression he cleared his throat well perhaps i could use a man to load wagons he cant load wagons he has a bad back he hasnt been able to work for years because of his back troubling him so fathers brow drew down his back didnt prevent him from begetting ten children nicci wanted to do good and so she met his stare with a steady look of her own must you be so intolerant father you have jobs and this man needs one he has hungry children needing to be fed and clothed would you deny him a living just because he has never had a fair chance in life are you so rich that all your gold has blinded your eyes to the needs of humble people but i need must you always frame everything in terms of what you need instead of what others need must everything be for you its a business and what is the purpose of a business isnt it to employ those who need work wouldnt it be better if the man had a job instead of having to humiliate himself begging is that what you want for him to beg rather than work arent you the one who always speaks so highly of hard work nicci was firing the questions like arrows getting them off so fast he couldnt get a word through her barrage mother smiled as nicci rolled out words she knew by heart why must you reserve your greatest cruelty for the least fortunate among us why cant you for once think of what you can do to help instead of always thinking of money money money would it hurt you to hire a man who needs a job would it father would it bring your business to an end would that ruin you the room echoed her noble questions he stared at her as if seeing her for the first time he looked as if real arrows had struck him his jaw worked but no words came out he didnt seem able to move he could only gape at her mother beamed well he finally said i guess he picked up his spoon and stared down into his soup send him around and ill give him a job nicci swelled with a new sense of prideand power she had never known it would be so easy to stagger her father she had just bested his selfish nature with nothing more than goodness father pushed back from the table i i need to go back to the shop his eyes searched the table but he would not look at nicci or mother i just remembered i have some work i must see to after he had gone mother said im glad to see that you have chosen the righteous path nicci instead of following his evil ways you will never regret letting your love of mankind guide your feelings the creator will smile upon you nicci knew she had done the right thing the moral thing yet the thought that came to haunt her victory was the night her father had come into her room and silently stroked her brow as she had held two of his fingers to her cheek the man went to work for father father never mentioned anything about it his work kept him busy and away from home niccis work took more and more of her time as well she missed seeing that look in his eyes she guessed she was growing up the next spring when nicci was thirteen she came home one day from her work at the fellowship to find a woman in the sitting room with mother something about the womans demeanor made the hair at the back of niccis neck stand on end both women rose as nicci set aside her list of names of people needing things nicci darling this is sister alessandra shes traveled here from the palace of the prophets in tanimura the woman was older than mother she had a long braid of fine brown hair looped around in a circle and pinned to the back of her skull like a loaf of braided bread her nose was a little too big for her face and she was plain but not at all ugly her eyes focused on nicci with an unsettling intensity and they didnt dart about the way mothers always did was it quite a journey sister alessandra nicci asked after she had curtsied all the way from tanimura i mean three days is all sister alessandra said a smile grew on her face as she took in niccis bony frame my my so little yet for such grownup work she held out a hand toward a chair wont you sit with us dear are you a sister with the fellowship nicci asked not really understanding who the woman was the what nicci mother said sister alessandra is a sister of the light astonished nicci dropped into a chair sisters of the light had the gift just like her and mother nicci didnt know very much about the sisters except that they served the creator that still didnt settle her stomach to have such a woman right there in her house was intimidatinglike when she stood before brother narev she felt an inexplicable sense of doom nicci was also impatient because she had duties waiting there were donations to collect she had older sponsors who accompanied her to some of the places for other places they said a young girl could get better results by herself by shaming people who had more than they deserved those people who had businesses all knew who she was they would always stammer and ask how her father was as she had been instructed nicci told them how pleased her father would be to know they were thoughtful to the needy in the end most became civicminded then there were remedies nicci needed to take to women with sick children there wasnt enough clothing for the children either nicci was trying to get some people to give cloth and other people to sew clothes some people had no homes others were crowded together in little rooms she was trying to get some rich people to donate a building also nicci had been assigned the task of locating jugs for women to bring water from the well she needed to pay a visit to the potter soma of the older children had been caught stealing others had been fighting and a few of them were beating younger children bloody nicci had been pleading on their behalf trying to explain that they had no fair chance and were only reacting to their cruel circumstance she hoped to convince father to take on at least a few so they might have work the problems just kept mounting without any end in sight it seemed like the more people the fellowship helped the more people there were who needed help nicci had thought she was going to solve the problems of the world she was beginning to feel hopelessly inadequate it was her own failing she knew she needed to work harder do you read and write dear the sister asked not very much sister mostly just names ive much too much to do for those less fortunate than myself their needs must come before any selfish desires of my own mother smiled and nodded to herself practically a good spirit in the flesh the sisters eyes teared ive heard about your work you have nicci felt a flash of pride but then she thought of how things never seemed to get better despite all her efforts and her sense of failure returned besides mother said pride was evil i dont see whats so special about what i do the people in the streets are the ones who are special because of their suffering in horrid conditions they are the true inspiration mother smiled contentedly sister alessandra leaned forward her tone serious have you learned to use your gift child mother teaches me to do some small things like how to heal little troubles but i know it would be unfair to flaunt it over those less blessed than i so i try my best not to use it the sister folded her hands in her lap ive been talking to your mother while we waited for you shes done a fine job of getting you started on the right path we feel however that you would have so much more to offer were you to serve a higher calling nicci sighed well all right maybe i can get up a little earlier but i already have my duties to the needy and i will have to fit this other in as i can i hope you understand sister im not trying to get undeserved sympathy honestly im not but i hope you dont need this calling done too soon as im already quite busy sister alessandra smiled in a longsuffering sort of way you dont understand nicci we would like you to continue your work with us at the palace of the prophets you would be a novice at first of course but one day you will be a sister of the light and as such you will carry on with what you have started panic welled up in nicci like rising floodwaters there were so many people who hung to life only by a thread she tended she had friends at the fellowship whom she had come to love she had so much to do she didnt want to leave mother and even father he was evil she knew but he wasnt evil to her he was selfish and greedy she knew but he still tucked her into bed sometimes and patted her shoulder she was sure she would see something in his blue eyes again if she just gave it time she didnt want to leave him for some reason she desperately needed to again see that spark in his eyes she was being selfish she knew i have needy people here sister alessandra nicci blinked at her tears my responsibility is to them im sorry but i cant abandon them at that moment father came in the door he stopped in an awkward posture his legs frozen in midstride with his hand on the lever staring at the sister whats this then mother stood howard this is alessandra she is a sister of the light shes come to no ill not have it do you hear shes our daughter and the sisters cant have her sister alessandra stood giving mother a sidelong glance please ask your husband to leave this is not his business not my business shes my daughter youll not take her he lunged forward to seize niccis outstretched hand the sister lifted a finger and to niccis astonishment he was thrown back in a sparkling flash of light fathers back slammed against the wall he slid down clutching his chest as he gasped for breath tears bursting forth nicci ran for him but sister alessandra snatched her by the arm and held her back howard mother said through gritted teeth the child is my business to raise i carry the creators gift you gave your word when our union was arranged that if we had a girl and she had the gift i would have the exclusive authority to raise her as i saw fit i believe this to be the right thing to do what the creator wants with the sisters she will have time to learn to read she will have time to learn to use her gift to help people as only the sisters can you will keep your word i will see to this im sure you have work to which you must immediately return with the flat of his hand he rubbed his chest finally his arms dropped to his sides head down he shuffled to the door before he pulled closed the door his gaze met niccis through the tears she saw the spark in his eyes as if he had things to tell her but then it was gone and he pulled the door shut behind himself sister alessandra said it would be best if they left at once and if nicci didnt see him just now she promised that if nicci followed instructions and after she was settled and after she had learned to read and after she had learned to use her gift she would see him again nicci learned to read and to use her gift and mastered everything else she was supposed to master she fulfilled all the requirements she did everything expected of her her life as a novice to become a sister of the light was numbingly selfless sister alessandra forgot her promise she was not pleased to be reminded of it and found more work that nicci needed to do several years after she had been taken to the palace nicci again saw brother narev she came across him quite by accident he was working as a stablehand at the palace of the prophets he smiled his slow smile with his eyes fixed on her he told her that he had gotten the idea to go to the palace by her example he said he wished to live long enough to see order come to the world she thought it an odd occupation for him he said that he found working for the sisters morally superior to contributing his labor to the evil of profit he said it mattered not if she chose to tell anyone at the palace anything about him or his work for the fellowship but he asked her not to tell the sisters that he was gifted since they would not allow him to continue to stay and work in the stables if they knew and he would refuse to serve them should they discover his gift because he said he wanted to serve the creator in his own quiet way nicci honored his secret not so much out of any sense of loyalty but mostly because she was kept far too busy with her studies and work to concern herself with brother narev and his fellowship she rarely had occasion to see him mucking out horse stalls and as his importance in her childhood had faded into her past she never really even gave him a second thought the palace had work they wished her to put her attention tomuch the same sort of work brother narev would have approved of only many years later did she come to discover his real reasons for having been at the palace of the prophets sister alessandra saw to it that nicci was kept busy she was allowed no time for such selfish indulgences as going home for a visit twentyseven years after she had been taken away to become a sister of the light still a novice nicci again saw her father it was at his funeral mother had sent word for nicci to return home to see father because he was is failing health nicci immediately rushed home accompanied by sister alessandra by the time nicci arrived father was already dead mother said that for several weeks he had been begging her to send for his daughter she sighed and said she put it off thinking he would get better besides she said she hadnt wanted to disturb niccis important worknot for such a trivial matter she said it had been the only thing he asked for to see nicci mother thought that was silly since he was a man who didnt care about people why should he need to see anyone he died alone while mother was out helping the victims of an uncaring world by that time nicci was forty mother though still thinking of nicci as a young woman because under the spell at the palace she had aged only enough to look to be maybe fifteen or sixteen told her to wear a pretty brightly colored dress because it wasnt really a sad occasion after all nicci stood looking at the body for a long time her chance to see his blue eyes again was forever lost for the first time in years the pain made her feel something down deep inside it felt good to feel something again even if it was pain as nicci stood looking at her fathers sunken face sister alessandra told nicci that she was sorry she had to take her away but that in her whole life she had not encountered a woman with the gift as powerful as it was in nicci and that such a thing as the creator had given her was not to be wasted nicci said she understood since she had ability it was only right that she use it to help those in need at the palace of the prophets nicci was said to be the most selfless caring novice they had under their roof everyone pointed to her and told the younger novices to look to niccis example even the prelate had commended her the praise was but a buzz in her ear it was an injustice to be better than others try as she might nicci could not escape her fathers legacy of excellence his taint coursed through her veins oozed from every pore and infected everything she did the more selfless she was the more it only confirmed her superiority and thus her wickedness she knew that could mean only one thing she was evil try not to remember him like this sister alessandra said after a long silence as they stood before the body try to remember what he was like when he was alive i cant nicci said i never knew him when he was alive mother and her friends at the fellowship ran the business she wrote nicci joyful letters telling her how she had put many of the needy to work at the armorers she said the business could afford it with all the wealth it had accumulated mother was proud that that wealth could now be put to a moral use she said fathers death had been a cloaked blessing because it meant help at last for those who had always deserved it most it was all part of the creators plan she said mother had to raise her prices in order to pay the wages of all the people shed given work a lot of the older workers left mother said she was glad they were gone because they had uncooperative attitudes orders fell behind suppliers began demanding to be paid before delivering goods mother discontinued having the armor proofed because the new workers complained that it was an unfair standard to be held to they said they were trying their best and that was what counted mother sympathized the batteringmill had to be sold some of the customers stopped ordering armor and weapons mother said they would be better off without such intolerant people she sought new laws from the duke to require work to be spread out equally but the laws were slow in coming the few remaining customers hadnt paid their account for quite a while but promised to catch up in the meantime their goods were shipped if late within six months of father dying the business failed the vast fortune he had built over a lifetime was gone some of the skilled workers once hired by father moved on hoping to find work at armories in distant places most men who stayed could find only menial work they were lucky to have that many of the new workers demanded mother do something she and the fellowship petitioned other businesses to take them on some business tried to help but most were in no position to hire workers the armory had been the largest employer in the area and drew many other people employed in other occupations other businesses like traders smaller suppliers and cargo earners who had depended on the armory failed for lack of work businesses in the city everything from bakers to butchers lost customers and were reluctantly forced to let men go mother asked the duke to speak with the king the duke said the king was considering the problem like her fathers armory other buildings were abandoned as people left to find work in thriving cities elsewhere squatters at the fellowships urging took over many of the abandoned buildings the empty places became the sites of robberies and even murders many a woman who went near those places regretted it mother couldnt sell the weapons from her closed armory so she gave them to the needy so they might protect themselves despite her efforts crime only increased in honor of all her good work and her fathers service to the government the king granted mother a pension that allowed her to stay in the house with a reduced staff she continued her work with the fellowship trying to right all the injustice that she believed was responsible for the failure of the business she hoped one day to reopen the shop and employ people for her righteous work the king awarded her a silver medal mother wrote that the king proclaimed she was as close to a good spirit in the flesh as he had ever seen nicci regularly received word of awards mother was given for her selfless work eighteen years later when mother died nicci still looked like a young woman of perhaps seventeen she wanted a fine black dress to wear to the funeralthe finest available the palace said that it was unseemly for a novice to make such a selfish request and it was out of the question they said they would supply only simple humble clothes when nicci arrived home she went to the tailor to the king and told him that for her mothers funeral she needed the finest black dress he had ever made he told her the price she informed him she had no money but said she needed the dress anyway the tailor a man with three chins waxy down growing from his ears abnormally long yellowish fingernails and an unfailing lecherous smirk said there were things he needed too he leaned close lightly holding her smooth arm in his knobby fingers and intimated that if she would take care of his needs he would take care of hers nicci wore the finest black dress ever made to her mothers funeral mother had been a woman who had devoted her entire life to the needs of others nicci could never again look forward to seeing her mothers cockroachbrown eyes unlike at her fathers funeral nicci felt no pain reach down to touch that abysmal place inside her nicci knew she was a terrible person for the first time she realized that for some reason she simply no longer cared from that day on nicci never wore any dress but black one hundred and twentythree years later standing at the railing overlooking the great hall nicci saw eyes that stunned her with their sense of an inner value held dear but what had been an uncertain ember in her fathers eyes was ablaze in richards she still didnt know what it was she knew only that it was the difference between life and death and that she had to destroy him now at long last she knew how if only when she had been little someone had shown her father such mercy chapter trudging down the road between the edge of the city of fairfield and the estate where the three sisters had told her emperor jagang had set up his residence nicci scanned the surrounding jumble of the imperial orders encampment looking for a specific station of tents she knew they would be somewhere in the area jagang liked to have them close at hand regular sleeping tents wagons and men lay like a dark soot over the fields and hills as far as she could see sky and land alike seemed tinted by a dusky taint sprinkled through the dark fields campfires twinkled like a sky full of stars the day was becoming oppressively dim not only with the approach of evening but also from the dull overcast of churning gray clouds the wind kicked up in little fits setting tents and clothes flapping fluttering the campfires flames and whipping smoke this way and that the gusts helped coat the tongue with the fetid stench of human and animal waste smothering any pleasant but weak cooking aroma that struggled to take to the air the longer the army stayed in place the worse it would get up ahead the elegant buildings of the estate rose above the dark grime at its feet jagang was there because he had access to sisters georgia rochelle and aubreys minds he would know nicci was back he would be waiting for her the emperor would have to wait she had something else to do first without jagang able to enter her mind she was free to pursue it nicci saw what she was looking for off in the distance she could just make them out standing above the smaller tents she left the road and headed through the crowded snarl of troops even from the distance she could distinguish the distinctive sounds coming from the group of special tentshear it over the laughing and singing the crackle of fires the sizzle of meat in skillets the scraping rasp of whetstones on metal the ring of hammers on steel and the rhythm of saws boisterous men grabbed at her arms and legs or tried to snatch her dress as she marched along picking her way through the disorder the rowdy soldiers were but a minor consideration she simply pulled away ignoring their mocking calls of love as she made her way through the throng when a husky soldier seized her wrist in his powerful grip yanking her around to a jerking halt she paused only long enough to loose her power and burst his beating heart within his chest other men laughed when they saw him collapse to the ground with a thud not yet realizing he was dead but none tried to claim his intended prize she heard the words deaths mistress pass in whispers among the men she finally made her way through the gauntlet soldiers played dice ate beans or snored in their bedrolls beside the tents where captives screamed under the agony of torture two men lugged a corpse dragging some of its innards out of a big tent they threw the flaccid form in a wagon with a tangle of others nicci snapped her fingers at an unshaven soldier coming from the direction of another tent let me see the list captain she knew he was the officer in charge by the blue canvas cover of the register book he carried he scowled at her a moment but when he glanced down at her black dress a look of recognition came over his face he passed her the grubby rumpled book it had a deep crease across the middle as if someone had accidentally sat on it the pages that had fallen out had been pushed back in but they never fit right and their edges stuck out here and there to become frayed and filthy not much to report mistress but please let his excellency know that weve tried just about every skill known and she isnt talking nicci opened the book and began scanning the list of recent names and what was known about them her who are you talking about captain she mumbled as she read why the mordsith of course nicci turned her eyes up toward the man the mordsith of course where is she he pointed at a tent a ways off through the disarray i know his excellency said he didnt expect a witch of her dark talents to give us any information about lord rahl but i was hoping to surprise him with good news he hooked his thumbs behind his belt as he let out a sigh of frustration no such luck nicci eyed the tent for a moment she heard no screams she had never before seen one of those women the mordsith but she knew a little about them she knew that using magic against one was a deadly mistake she went back to reading the entries in the register there was nothing of much interest to her most of the people were from around here they were merely a sampling collected to check what they might know they would not have the information she wanted nicci tapped a line near the end of the writing in the book it said messenger where is this one the captain tilted his head indicating a tent behind him i put one of my best questioners with him last i checked there was nothing from him yetbut that was early this morning it had been all day since he had checked all day could be an eternity under torture like all the rest of the tents used for questioning prisoners the one with the messenger stood above the surrounding field tents which were only large enough for soldiers to lie in nicci pushed the book at the officers thick gut thank you that will be all youll be giving his excellency a report then nicci nodded absently at his question her mind was already elsewhere youll tell him that there is little to be learned from this lot no one was eager to stand before jagang and admit they were unable to accomplish a task even if there was nothing to accomplish jagang did not appreciate excuses nicci nodded as she strode away heading for the tent holding the messenger ill be seeing him shortly ill give him the report for you captain as soon as she threw back the flap and entered she saw that she was too late the messy remains of the messenger lay on a narrow wooden table affixed with glistening tools of the trade the messengers arm hung down off the sides dripping warm blood nicci saw that the questioner had a folded piece of paper what have you there a map of what where this fellows been i drew it all out from what he volunteered he laughed at his own humor she didnt really nicci said the mans grin was what had her attention a man like this only grinned when he had something hed been seeking something to bring him favor in the eyes of his superiors and where has the man been to see his leader he waved the paper like a treasure map tired of the game nicci snatched the booty from his hand she unfolded the wrinkled yellow paper and saw that it was indeed a map with rivers the coastline and mountains all meticulously drawn out even mountain passes were noted nicci could tell that the map was authentic when she had lived at the palace of the prophets the new world was a faroff and mysterious place rarely visited by anyone but a few sisters any sister who ventured there always kept exacting records that were added to maps at the palace along with many other esoteric items all novices memorized those maps in the course of their studies even though at the time she had never expected to travel to the new world she was thoroughly familiar with the lay of the land there nicci scrutinized the paper in her hands carefully surveying the geography overlaying everything on it that was new onto the memorized map in her mind the soldier pointed a thick finger at a single bloody fingerprint on the map that there is where lord rahl himself is hidingon that dot in those mountains niccis breath paused she stared at the paper burning the line of every stream and river every mountain every road trail and mountain pass every village town and city into her memory what did this man confess before he died she looked up his excellency is waiting for my report i was just on my way to see him she snapped her fingers impatiently lets have it all the man scratched his beard his fingernails were crusted with dried blood youll tell him wont you youll tell his excellency that sergeant wetzel was the one who got the information out of the messenger of course nicci assured him you will receive full credit i have no need of such recognition she tapped the gold ring through her lower lip the emperor is alwaysevery moment of every dayin my mind he no doubt this very moment sees through my eyes that you not i are the one who succeeded in getting the information now what did this man confess sergeant wetzel scratched his beard again apparently trying to decide if be could trust her to credit him or if he should be sure and take the information to jagang there was little trust among those in the imperial order and good reason to distrust everyone as he scratched his beard flakes of dried blood stuck in its curly hair nicci stared into his redrimmed eyes he smelled of liquor if you dont report everything to me sergeant wetzel and i mean right now i will have you up on the table next and i will have your report between your screams and when im done with you they will throw you in the wagon with the rest of the corpses he dipped his head twice in surrender of course i only wanted to be sure his excellency knew of my success when nicci nodded he went on he was just a messenger we had a small unit of six men doing deep scouting patrol they went on a circle far to the north around any enemy forces they had one of the gifted women with them to help them remain at a good distance so they wouldnt be detected they were somewhere northwest of the enemy force when by chance they came across this man they brought him back for me to question i discovered he was one of a number of regular messengers sent back and forth to report to lord rahl nicci waggled a finger at the paper but this down here looks like the enemy force are you saying rich lord rahl isnt with his men with his army thats right the messenger didnt know why his only duty was to carry troop positions and regular news of their condition to his master he tapped the map in her hand but right here is where lord rahl is hiding along with his wife nicci looked up her mouth falling open wife sergeant wetzel nodded the man said lord rahl married some woman known as the mother confessor shes hurt and theyre hiding way up there in those mountains nicci remembered richards feelings for her and her name kahlan richard being married put everything in a new light it had the potential to disrupt niccis plans or anything else sergeant the man said lord rahl and his wife have one of them women them mord sith guarding them why are they up there why arent lord rahl and the mother confessor with their army or back in aydindril or in dhara for that matter he shook his head this messenger was just a lowranking soldier who knew how to ride fast and read the lay of the land thats all he knew theyre up there and theyre all alone nicci was puzzled by such a development anything else anything at all he shook his head she laid her hand on the mans back between his shoulder blades thank you sergeant wetzel you have been more help than you will ever know as he grinned nicci released a flow of power that shot up through his spine and instantly incinerated his brain inside his skull he dropped with a crash to the hard ground the air fleeing his lungs in a grunt nicci held up the map she had committed to memory and with her gift set it aflame the paper crackled and blackened as the fire advanced across the rivers and cities and mountains all carefully drawn out on it until the hot glow surrounded the bloody fingerprint over a dot in the mountains she let the paper rise from her fingers as it was consumed in a final puff of smoke ash like black snow drifted down onto the body at her feet outside the tent where the mordsith was held nicci cast a wary gaze across the surrounding camp to see if anyone was watching no one was paying any attention to the business of the torture tents she slipped in through the opening nicci winced at the sight of the woman laid out on the wooden table she finally made herself draw a breath a soldier his hands red from his work scowled at nicci she didnt wait for him to object but simply commanded report not a word from her he growled nicci nodded and placed her hand on the soldiers broad back wary of her hand he began to step away from it but he was too late the man fell dead before he knew he was in trouble had she the time she would have made him suffer first nicci made herself step up to the table and look down into the blue eyes the womans head trembles slightly use your power to hurt me witch a small smile touched niccis lips to the bitter end you would fight wouldnt you use your magic witch i think not you see i know a bit about you women defiance blazed up from the blue eyes you know nothing oh but i do richard told me you would know him as your lord rahl but be was for a time my student i know that women like you have the ability to capture the power of the gifted if that power is used against you then you can turn it against us so you see i know better than to use my power on you the woman looked away then torture me if that is what you came to do you will learn nothing im not here to torture you nicci assured her then what do you want let me introduce myself nicci said i am deaths mistress the womans blue eyes turned back betraying for the first time a glint of hope good kill me i need you to tell me some things ill not tell you anything it was a struggle for her to speak nor anything kill me nicci picked up a bloody blade from the table and held it before the blue eyes i think you will the woman smiled go ahead it will only hasten my death i know how much a person can take i am not far from the spirit world but no matter what you do ill not talk before i die you misunderstand i do not wish you to betray your lord rahl didnt you hear your questioner hit the ground if you turn your head a little more perhaps you can see that the man who did this to you is now dead i dont wish you to tell me any secrets the woman glanced as best she could toward the body on the ground her brow twitched what do you mean nicci noticed that she didnt ask to be freed she knew she was well past the point of hope to live the only thing she could hope for now was for nicci to end her agony richard was my student he told me that he was once a captive of the mord sith now thats not a secret is it no thats what i want to know about what is your name the woman turned her face away nicci put a finger to the womans chin and turned her head back i have an offer to make you i wont ask you anything secret that you arent supposed to tell ill not ask you to betray your lord rahli wouldnt want you to those are not the things that are of interest to me if you cooperate nicci held up the blade again for the woman to seei will end it quickly for you i promise no more torture no more pain just the final embrace of death the womans lips began trembling please she whispered the hope returning to her eyes please kill me what is your name nicci asked nicci for the most part was numb to sights of torture but this she found disturbing she avoided looking away from the womans face down at the naked body so as not to have to consider what had been done to her nicci could not imagine how this woman could keep from screaming or even how she was able to speak hania the womans hands and ankles were shackled to the table so she was unable to move much other than her head she stared up into niccis eyes will you kill me please i will hania i promise quickly and efficientlyif you tell me what i want to know i cant tell you anything in despair hania seemed to sag against the table knowing her ordeal was to go on i wont i only want to know about when richard was a captive did you know he was once a captive of the mord sith of course i want to know about it why because want to understand him hanias head rocked side to side she actually smiled none of us understands lord rahl he was tortured but he never took revenge we dont understand him i dont either but i hope to my name is nicci i want you to know that im nicci and im going to deliver you from this hania tell me about it please i need to know do you know the woman who captured him her name the woman considered for a moment before she spoke as if testing in her own mind whether or not the information was in any way secret or could in any way harm him denna hania whispered at last denna richard killed her in order to escapehe already told me that much did you know denna before she died yes im not asking anything of secret military importance am i hania hesitated she finally shook her head so you knew denna and did you know richard at the time when he was there and she had him did you know he was her captive we all knew why is that lord rahlthe lord rahl at the time richards father yes he wanted denna to be the one to train richard to prepare him to answer without hesitation whatever questions darken rahl asked him she was the best at what we do good now tell me everything about it everything you know hania drew a shaky breath it took a moment before she spoke again i wont betray him i am experienced at what is being done to me you cannot trick me i will not betray lord rahl just to spare myself this i have not endured this much to betray him now i promise not to ask anything about the presentabout the waranything that would betray him to jagang if i tell you only about when denna had him and not about now about the war or where he is or anything else do you give me your word that you will end it for methat you will kill me i give you my word hania i wouldnt ask you to betray your lord rahli know him and have too much respect for him to ask that of you all i wish is to understand him for personal reasons i was his teacher last winter instructing him in the use of his gift i want to understand him better i need to understand him i believe i can help him if i do and then you will help me there was a shimmer of hope along with the tears you will kill me then this woman could aspire to nothing more now it was all that was left to her in this life a quick death to finally end the pain just as soon as youre finished telling me all about it i will end your suffering hania do you swear it by your hope to an eternity in the underworld in the warmth of the creators light nicci felt a sharp shiver of pain wail up from her very soul she had started out near to one hundred and seventy years before wanting nothing but to help and yet she could not escape the fate of her evil nature she was deaths mistress she was a fallen woman she ran the side of a finger down hanias soft cheek the two women shared a long and intimate look i promise nicci whispered quick and efficient it will be the end of your pain tears overflowing her eyes hania gave a little nod chapter the estate was a grand place she supposed nicci had seen grandeur such as this before she had also seen much greater majesty to be sure she had lived among such splendor for nearly one and threequarters centuries among the imposing columns and arches of immaculate rooms the intricately carved stone vines and buttery smooth wood paneling the feather beds and silk coverlets the exquisite carpets and rich draperies the silver and gold ornamentation and the bright sparkle of windows made of colored glass composed into epic scenes the sisters there offered nicci brighteyed smiles and clever conversation the extravagance meant no more to her than the rubble of the streets the cold wet blankets laid on rough ground the beds made in the slime among greasy runnels in the muck of narrow alleys with nothing but the bitter sky overhead the huddled people there never offered a smile but gaped up at her with hollow eyes like so many pigeons cooing for alms some of her life was spent among splendor some among garbage some people were fated to spend their lives in one place some in the other she in both nicci reached for the silver handle on one of the ornate double doors flanked by two husky soldiers who had probably been raised in a sty with the hogs and saw that her hand was covered in blood she turned and casually wiped the hand on the filthy bloodstained fleece vest worn by one of the men the biceps of his folded arms were nearly as thick as her waist although he scowled as she cleaned her hand on him he made no move to stop her after all it wasnt as if she were defiling him hania had kept her part of the bargain nicci rarely resorted to using a weapon she usually used her gift but of course in this case that could have been a mistake when she had held the knife over her throat hania had whispered her thanks for what nicci was about to do it was the first time anyone had ever thanked nicci before she had killed them few people ever thanked nicci for the help she provided she was able they were not it was her duty to serve their needs when she had finished cleaning her hand on the mute guard she flashed an empty smile at his dark glaring visage and then went on through the doors into a stately reception hall a row of tall windows lining one wall of the room was trimmed with wheatcolored drapes near their tasseled edges the curtains sparkled in the lamplight as if they might be embellished with gold thread latesummer rain spattered against tightly shut glass panes that revealed only darkness outside but reflected the activity inside the pale wool carpets graced with flowers painstakingly sculpted in relief by means of differentlength yarn were tracked with mud scouts came and went along with messengers and soldiers giving their reports to some of the officers other officers barked orders soldiers carrying rolled maps followed a few of the higherranking men as they meandered around the stuffy room one of the maps lay unrolled across a narrow table the tables silver candelabrum had been set aside on the floor behind the table as nicci passed the table she glanced down and saw that it was missing many of the elements so carefully marked on the map drawn by the dharan messenger on the map laid out over the narrow table there was nothing but dark splotches from spilled ale in the area to the northwest in the map etched in niccis mind there were the mountains rivers high passes and streams there and a dot marking the place where richard was along with his mother confessor bride and the mordsith officers talked among themselves some standing about some half sitting on ironlegged marbletopped tables some lounging in padded leather chairs as they took delicacies from silver trays borne on the trembling hands of sweating servants others swilled ale from tall pewter mugs and yet others drank wine from dainty glasses all acting as if they were intimate with such splendor and all of them looking as out of place as toads at tea an older woman sister lidmila apparently trying to be unobtrusive by cowering in the shadows beside the drapes snapped upright when she saw nicci marching across the room sister lidmila stepped out of the shadows briefly pausing to smooth her dingy skirts an act that could not possibly produce any noticeable improvement sister lidmila once had told nicci that things learned in youth never left you and were often much easier to recall than yesterdays dinner rumor had it that the old sister skilled in arcane spells known to only the most powerful sorceresses had many interesting things from her youth to recall sister lidmilas leathery skin was stretched so tight over the bones of her skull that she reminded nicci of nothing so much as an exhumed corpse as cadaverous looking as the aged sister was she advanced across the room in quick sharp movements when she was only ten feet away sister lidmila waved an arm as if not sure nicci would see her sister nicci sister nicci there you are she seized niccis wrist come along dear come along his excellency is waiting for you this way come along nicci clasped the sisters tugging hand lead the way sister lidmila im right behind you the older woman smiled over her shoulder it wasnt a pleasant or joyous smile but one of relief jagang punished anyone who displeased him regardless of their culpability what took you so long sister nicci his excellency is in quite a state he is because of you where have you been i had business i had to attend to the woman had to take two or three steps for every one of niccis business indeed were it up to me id have you down in the kitchen scrubbing pots for being off on a lark when you are wanted sister lidmila was frail and forgetful and she sometimes failed to realize she was no longer at the palace of the prophets jagang used her to fetch people or to wait for them and show them the wayusually to his tents should she forget the way he could always correct her route if need be it amused him to use a venerable sister of the light a sorceress reputedly possessing knowledge of the most esoteric incantationsas nothing more than an errand girl away from the palace and its spell that slowed aging sister lidmila was in a sudden headlong rush toward the grave all the sisters were the roundbacked sister her dangling arm swinging shuffled along in front of nicci pulling her by her hand leading her through grand rooms up stairways and down hallways at a doorway framed in goldleafed moldings she finally paused touching her fingers to her lower lip as she caught her breath sober soldiers prowling the hall painted nicci with glares as dark as her dress she recognized the men as imperial guards here it is sister lidmila peered up at nicci his excellency is in his rooms hurry then go on go on now she swirled her hands as if she were trying to herd livestock in you go before entering nicci took her hand from the lever and turned back to the old woman sister lidmila you once told me that you thought i would be the one best suited for some of the knowledge you had to pass on sister lidmilas face brightened with a sly smile ah some of the more occult magic interests you at long last sister nicci nicci had never before been interested in what sister lidmila had occasionally pestered her to learn magic was a selfish pursuit nicci learned what she had to but never went out of her way to go beyond to the more unusual spells yes as a matter of fact i believe i am at last ready i always told the prelate that you were the only one at the palace with the power for the conjuring i know the woman leaned close dangerous conjuring it is too it should be passed on while you are able sister lidmila nodded with satisfaction i believe you are old enough i could show you when i will come see you tomorrow nicci glanced toward the door i dont believe i will be able to take a lesson tonight tomorrow then if i do come around to see you i will be most eager to learn i especially wish to know about the maternity spell from what nicci knew of it the oddly named maternity spell might be just what she needed it had the further advantage that once invoked it was inviolate sister lidmila straightened and again touched her fingers to her lower lip a look of concern crossed her face my my that one is it well yes i could teach you you have the abilityfew do id trust none but you to be able to bring such a thing to life it requires tremendous power of the gift you have that as long as you understand and are willing to accept the cost involved can teach you nicci nodded i will come when can then the old sister ambled on down the hall deep in thought already thinking about the lesson nicci didnt know if she would live to take the lesson after she had watched the old sister vanish around the corner nicci entered a quiet room lit by myriad candles and lamps the high ceiling was edged with a painted leafandacorn design plush couches and chairs upholstered in muted browns were set about on thick carpets of rich yellows oranges and reds making them look like a forest floor in the autumn heavy drapes had been pulled closed across an expanse of windows two sisters sitting on a couch leaped to their feet sister nicci one virtually shouted in relief the other ran to the double doors at the other side of the room and opened one without knocking apparently by instruction she stuck her head into the room beyond to speak in a low voice nicci couldnt hear the sister leaped back when jagang in the inner room roared get out all of you everyone else out two more young sisters no doubt personal attendants to the emperor burst out of the room nicci had to step out of the way as all four gifted women made for the doorway leading out of the apartment a young man nicci hadnt noticed in the corner joined the women none even glanced in niccis direction as they rushed to do as they were ordered the first lesson you learned as a slave to jagang was that when he told you to do something he meant you to do it right now little provoked him more than delay at the door to the inner room a woman nicci didnt recognize ran out following close on the heels of the others she was young and beautiful with dark hair and eyes probably a captive picked up somewhere along the long march and no doubt used for jagangs amusement her eyes reflected a world gone mad for her such were the unavoidable costs if the world was to be brought to a state of order great leaders by their very nature came with shortcomings in character which they themselves viewed as mere peccadilloes the farranging benefits jagang would bring to the poor suffering masses of humanity far outweighed his crass acts of personal gratification and the relatively petty havoc he wrought nicci was often the object of his transgressions it was a price worth paying for the help that would eventually accrue to the helpless that was the only matter that could be considered the outer door closed and the apartment was finally empty of everyone but nicci and the emperor she stood erect head held high arms at her sides relishing the quiet of the place the splendor meant little to her but quiet was a luxury she had come to appreciate even if it was selfish in the tents there was always the noise of the army pressed close around here it was quiet she glanced around the spacious and elaborately decorated outer room contemplating the idea that jagang would have acquired the taste for such places perhaps he too simply wanted quiet she turned back to the inner room he was just inside waiting watching her a muscled mass of fury coiled in rage she strode directly up to him you wished to see me excellency nicci felt a stunning pain as the back of his beefy hand whipped across her face the blow spun her around her knees hit the floor he yanked her to her feet by her hair the second time she clouted the wall before crashing to the floor again stupefying pain throbbed through her face when she had her bearings she got her legs under her and stood before him again the third time she took a freestanding candelabrum down with her candles tumbled and rolled across the floor a long wisp of sheer curtain she had snatched as she grabbed for support ripped away and drifted down over her as she and an upturned table slammed to the floor glass shattered metal clattered as small items bounded away she was dizzy and stunned her vision faltering her eyes felt as if they might have burst her jaw as if it had been shattered her neck as if the muscles had ripped nicci lay sprawled on the floor savoring the strident waves of pain wallowing n the rare sensation of feeling she saw blood splattered across the light fringe of the carpet beneath her and across the warns glow of wooden flooring she heard jagang yelling something at her but she couldnt make out the words over the ringing in her ears with a shaky arm pushed herself up onto her hip blood warmed her fingers when she touched them to her mouth she relished the hurt it had been so long since she had felt anything except for that too brief moment with the mordsith this was a glorious wash of agony jagangs brutality was able to reach down into the abyss not only because of the cruelty itself but because she knew she need not suffer it he too knew that she was here by her choice not his that only intensified his anger and thus her sensations his rage seemed lethal she merely noted the fact that she very probably wouldnt leave the room alive she would probably not get to learn sister lidmilas spells nicci simply waited to discover what fate had already decided for her the rooms spinning finally slowed enough for her to once more make it to her feet she pulled herself up straight before the silent brawny form of emperor jagang his shaved head reflected points of light from some of the lamps his only facial hair was a twoinch braid of mustache growing above each corner of his mouth and another in the center under his lower lip the gold ring through his left nostril and its thin gold chain running to another ring in his left ear glimmered in the mellow lamplight except for a heavy ring on each finger he was without the plundered assortment of royal chains and jewels he usually wore around his neck the rings glistened with her blood he was barechested but unlike his head his chest was covered in coarse hair his muscles bulged their tendons standing out as he flexed his fists he had the neck of a bull and his temperament was worse nicci half a head shy of his height stood before him waiting looking into the eyes she used to see in her nightmares they were a murky gray without whites and clouded over with sullen dusky shapes that stole across a surface of inky obscurity even though they had no evident iris and pupilnothing but seeming dark voids where a normal person had eyesshe never had any doubt whatsoever as to when he was looking at her they were the eyes of a dream walker a dream walker denied access to her mind now she understood why well he growled he threw up his hands cry yell scream beg argue make excuses dont just stand there nicci swallowed back the sharp taste of blood as she gazed placidly into his scarlet glare please be specific excellency as to which one you would prefer how long i should carry on and if i should end it of my own accord or wait for you to beat me into unconsciousness he lunged at her with a howl of fury he seized her throat in his massive fist to hold her as he struck her her knees buckled but he held her up until she was able to steady herself he released her throat with a shove i want to know why you did that to kadar she offered only a bloody smile to his anger he wrenched her arm behind her back and pulled her hard against him why would you do such a thing why the deadly dance with jagang had begun she dimly wondered again if this time she would lose her life jagang had killed a number of the sisters who had displeased him niccis safety himsuch as it waslay in her very indifference to her safety her utter disgust in her own life fascinated jagang because he knew it was sincere sometimes youre a fool she said with true contempt too arrogant to see what is in front of your nose he twisted her arm until she thought it surely would snap his panting breath was warn on her throbbing cheek ive killed people for saying much less than that she mocked him through the pain do you intend to bore me to death then if you want to kill me seize me by the throat and strangle me or slash me to a bloody mess so that i will bleed to death at your feetdont think you can suffocate me with the sheer weight of your monotonous threats if you wish to kill me then be a man and do so or else shut your mouth the mistake most people made with jagang was to believe because of his capacity for such profound brutality that he was an ignorant dumb brute he was not he was one of the most intelligent men nicci had ever met brutality was but his cloak as an outgrowth of his access to the thoughts of so many different peoples minds he was directly exposed to their knowledge wisdom and ideas such exposure augmented his intellect he also knew what people most feared if anything about him frightened her it was not his brutality but his intelligence for she knew that intelligence could be a bottomless well of truly inventive cruelty why did you kill him nicci he asked again his voice losing some of its fire in her mind like a protective stone wall was the thought of richard he had to see it in her eyes part of jagangs rage she knew was at his own impotence at penetrating her mind of possessing her as he could so many others her knowing smirk taunted him with what he could not have it amused me to hear the great kadar kardeef cry for mercy and then to deny it jagang roared again a beastly sound out of place for such a mannerly bedchamber she saw the blur of his arm swinging for her the room whirled violently around her she expected to hit something with a bonebreaking impact instead she upended and crashed onto unexpected softness the bed she realized somehow she had missed the marble and mahogany posts at the cornersthey surely would have killed her fate it seemed was trifling with her jagang landed atop her she thought he might beat her to death now instead he studied her eyes from inches away he sat up straddling her hips his meaty hands pulled at the laces on the bodice of her dress with a quick yank of the material he exposed her breasts his fingers squeezed her bared flesh until her eyes watered nicci didnt watch him or resist but instead went limp as he pushed her dress up around her waist her mind began its journey away to where only she alone could go he fell on her driving the wind from her lungs in a helpless grunt arms lying at her sides her fingers open and slack eyes unblinking nicci stared at the folds of the silk in the canopy of the bed her mind unaffected in the distant quiet place the pain seemed remote her struggle to breathe seemed trivial as he went about his coarse business she focused her thoughts instead on what she was going to do she had never believed possible what she now contemplated now she knew it was she had only to decide to do it jagang slapped her causing her to focus her mind back on him youre too stupid to even weep she realized he had finished he was not happy that she hadnt noticed she had to make an effort not to comfort her jaw stinging from what to him was a smack but to the person receiving it was a blow nearly strong enough to cripple sweat dripped from his chin onto her face his powerful body glistened from the exertion she had not perceived his chest heaved as he glared down at her anger of course powered the glare but nicci thought she saw a tinge of something else there too regret or maybe anguish or maybe even hurt is that what you wish me to do then excellency weep his voice turned bitter as he flopped onto his side beside her no i wish you to react but i am she said as she stared up at the canopy it is simply not the reaction you wish he sat up whats the matter with you woman she gazed up at him a moment and then turned her eyes away i have no idea she answered honestly but i think i must find out chapter jagang gestured take off your clothes youre spending the night its been too long this time it was he who stared off at the walls ive missed you in my bed nicci she didnt answer she did not believe that in his bed he missed anything she didnt believe she could conceive of him understanding what it was to miss a person what he missed she thought was being able to miss someone nicci sat up and threw her legs over the side of the bed as she untangled herself from the black dress she pulled it off over her head and then laid it out across the back of a padded leather chair she reclaimed her underthings from the tangles of the bed covering and tossed them on the chair before drawing off her stockings and placing them too on the seat of the chair he watched her body the whole time watched her as she tended to her dress smoothing it to straighten what he had done to it watched the mysterious allure of a woman acting a woman when she had finished she turned back to him she stood proudly to let him see that which he could have only by force and never as a willing gift she could detect the sense of privation in his expression this was the only victory she could have the more he took her by force the more he understood that that was the only way he could ever have her and the more it maddened him she would just as soon die as willingly give him the satisfaction of that gift and he knew the brutal truth of that he finally forced himself away from his private bitter longing and looked up into her eyes whyd you kill kadar she sat on the edge of the bed opposite him just out of his easy reach but within range of his lunge and shrugged her bare shoulders you are not the order the order is no single man but an ideal of equity as such it will survive any one person you serve that ideal and the order for now in the capacity of but a brute the order could use any brute to serve its purpose you kadar or another i simply eliminated someone who might one day have been a threat to you before you can rise above your present role he grinned you expect me to believe that you were doing me a kindness now you mock me if it pleases you to think so then do her smooth white limbs were a vivid contrast to the heavy dark variegated verdant bedcover and sheets he lay back atop them against several rumpled pillows immodestly displayed before her his eyes looked even darker than usual whats all this talk i keep hearing about jagang the just your new title it is the thing that will save you the thing that will win for you the thing that will bring you more glory than anything else yet in return for eliminating a future threat to your standing and for making you a hero to the people you draw my blood he put an arm behind his head sometimes you make me believe the stories fat people tell that you really are crazy and if you kill everyone then they will be dead i have recently been through towns visited by your soldiers it seems they didnt harm the peopleat least they didnt slaughter everyone in sight as they did when fey began their march into the new world he lunged and seized a fistful of her hair with a snarl he yanked her onto her back beside him she caught her breath as he rose up on an elbow and directed his disturbing gaze down into her eyes it is your job to make examples of people to show them that they must contribute to our cause to make them fear the imperial orders righteous wrath that is the task i assigned you is that so then why did the soldiers not make examples too why did they let those towns be why did they not contribute to striking fear into the hearts of the people why didnt they lay waste to every city and town in their path and then who would i rule but my soldiers who would do the work who would make things who would grow the food who would pay tribute to whom will i bring the hope of the order who will there be to glorify the great emperor jagang if i kill them all he flopped onto his back you may be called deaths mistress but we cant have it your way and kill everyone in this world you are bound to the orders purpose if people feel the orders arrival can mean nothing but their death they will resist to the end they must know that it is only their resistance which will bring a swift and sure death if they realize our arrival offers them a moral life a life which puts man under the creator and the welfare of man above all else they will embrace us you dealt death to this city she taunted forcing him to unwittingly prove the validity of what she had done even though they chose the order ive given orders that any people of the city still alive be allowed to go back to their homes the rampage is ended the people here betrayed their promises and thus invited brutality they saw it but now that is finished and a new day of order has come the old ideas of separate lands are over as it was ended in the old world all people will be governed together and will enter a new age of prosperity togetherunder the imperial order only those who resist will be crushednot because they resist but because ultimately they are traitors to the wellbeing of their fellow man and must be eliminated here in anderith was the turning point in our struggle richard rahl was at last cast out by the people themselves who came to see the virtue of what we offer no longer can he claim to represent them yet you came in and slaughtered the leaders here betrayed certain promises to mewho knows how much of the general population may have collaborated in thatand so the people had to pay a puce but collectively they have also earned a place in the order for their courage in emphatically rejecting lord rahl and the outdated selfish uninspired morals he offered them the tide has turned people no longer have faith in lord rahl nor can he now have any faith in them richard rahl is a fallen leader nicci smiled inwardly a sad smile she was a fallen woman and richard was a fallen man their fate was sealed perhaps here in this one small place she said but he is far from defeated he is still dangerous after all you failed to gain everything you sought here in anderith because of richard rahl he not only denied you a clear victory by destroying vast stores of supplies and leaving the systems and services of production in total disarray but he also slipped right through your fingers when you should have captured him i will have him really i wonder she watched his fist and waited until it relaxed before she continued when will you move our forces north into the midlands jagang stroked his hand down his woolly chest soon i want to give them time to become careless first when they grow complacent i will strike north a great leader must read the nature of the battle to be able to adjust his tactics we will be liberators now as we move north into the midlands bringing the creators glory to the people we must win the hearts and minds of the unconverted you have decided this change on your own you do not consider the will of the creator in your campaign he glared at her insolence as if to tell her she knew better than to even ask such a question i am the emperor i need not consult our spiritual guides but since their counsel is always welcome ive already talked to the priests theyve spoken favorably about my plans brother narev thinks it wise and has given his blessing you had better keep to your job of extinguishing any ideas of opposition if you dont follow my orders well no one will miss one sister i have others she was not moved by his threats real as they were by his suspicious look he was beginning to understand her vision too what you are doing is fitting she said but it must be cut up into little pieces the people can chew they do not have the orders wisdom in seeing what is best for themthe public rarely does even one as bullheaded as you must be able to see that i have anticipated your plans by helping those you cant afford to kill to understand that you are sparing them out of your sense of justice word of such deeds will win hearts he cast her a sidelong glance i am the orders cleansing fire the fire is a necessary conflagration but not the important endit is merely the means to the end from the ashes i jagang create new order can sprout and grow it is this end this glorious new age of man that warrants the means in this it is my responsibility not yoursto decide justice when and how i will dispense it and who will receive it she grew impatient with his vanity scorn seeped into her voice i have simply put a name to itjagang the justand begun to spread your new title for you when the opportunity arose i sacrificed kadar to that end for all the same reasons youve listed it had to be done now in order for it to have the necessary time to spread and flourish or the new world would soon harden irreversibly against the order i chose the time and place and by using kadar kardeefs lifea war heros lifeproved your devotion to the cause of the order above all else you benefit any brute could ignite the conflagration this new title shows your moral visionanother manifestation of worth over other men i have planted the vital seed that will make you a hero to the common people and even more important to the priests are you going to pretend you think the title inadequate or that it will not serve you well what i alone have done will help win what your powerful army cannot willing allegiance without a battle at a cost of nothing with kadars life i nicci have made you more than you could make of yourself i nicci have given you the reputation of honor i nicci have made you into a leader people will trust because they believe you to be just he brooded for a time turning his gaze from her hot glare his arm finally fell own and his fingers tenderly trailed down her thigh the touch was an admission for himan admission that she was right even if he would not say the words after a few moments he yawned and then his eyes closed his breathing evened and he started to drift off into a nap as was his way with her he expected her to remain right where she was so that when he awoke she would be available to him she supposed she could leave but it was not time not yet he finally awoke an hour later nicci was still staring up at the canopy thinking about richard there seemed to be one piece missing in her plan one more thing that she felt needed to fall into place in his sleep jagang had rolled over on his side facing away from her now he turned back his dark eyes took her in with a look of lust rekindled he drew her close his body was as warm as a rock in the sun and only slightly softer pleasure me he commanded in a husky growl that would have frightened any other woman into doing as ordered or what you will kill me if i feared that i would not be here this is by force not consent i will not willingly take part in it nor will i allow you to deceive yourself into believing that i want you he backhanded her knocking her across the bed you take part willingly he seized her by the wrist and dragged her back toward him why else would you be here you ordered me here he smirked and you came when you could have fled she opened her mouth but she had no answer she could put into words no answer he would understand with a grin of victory he fell on her and pressed his lips to hers as much as it hurt her for jagang this was gentle behavior he had told her several times that she was the only woman he ever cared to kiss he seemed to believe that by expressing those emotions for her she could have no alternative but to surrender feelings in kind as if spoken feelings were currency with which he could purchase affection on demand it was only the beginning of a long night a long ordeal she knew she would have to endure his forceful violation several more times before morning his question haunted the distant place in her mind morning came accompanied by the dull throbbing of a headache from her succeeding beating and the sharper aches from the places where hed struck her when he came to find that what he thought was her willing submission was but a delusion that left him more angered than before the pillows were stained with her blood it had been a long night of rare sensations experienced now she knew she was evil and deserved to be violated in such a brutal fashion she could offer no moral objection to it even in the terrible things he did to her jagang was nowhere near as corrupt as she jagang erred in simple matters of the flesh and that could only be expected all people were corrupt in the fleshbut because of her indifference to the suffering around her she failed in matters of the spirit that she knew was pure evil that was why she deserved to suffer whatever he did to her for the moment that deep dark place within came close to being sated nicci touched her mouth and found the cuts painful but closed the healing of wounds though did not offer the warranted sensations of receiving them so she resolved to have one of the other sisters heal her rather than give him the satisfaction of witnessing her suffering the inconvenience of the injures with that her mind turned to thoughts of sister lidmila nicci realized that jagang wasnt in bed beside her she sat up and saw him in a chair not far away watching her she pulled the sheet up to cover her breasts speckled with droplets of dried blood you are a pig you cant get enough of me despite what you say nicci you wish to be with me if not why would you stay those nightmare eyes of his watched her trying to find a way into her mind there was none he could no longer be a nightmare for her richard guarded her mind not for the reasons you wish to believe i stay because the ultimate cause of the order is a moral one i wish it to succeed i wish the suffering of lifes helpless victims to end i wish everyone to finally be equal and to finally live with everything they need i have worked nearly my entire life for those goals the order can see to it that such a fair world comes to be if i must endure youeven aid youfor such an end then it is but an insignificant gnat to swallow you sound so very noble but i think there is something more basic behind it i think you would have left if you could orhe smiledif you could you would have left if you really wanted to which is it then nicci she didnt want to contemplate the question her head hurt whats all the talk about you building a palace so you heard then he took a deep breath and sighed wistfully it will be the grandest palace ever built a fitting place for the emperor of the imperial order for the man who rules both the old and the new worlds the man who wants to rule lord rahl stands in your way how many times has he bested you now jagangs eyes flashed a rage she knew could turn violent richard had frustrated jagang a number of times even if richard hadnt been victorious over jagang he had stung him quite an accomplishment really for such a tiny force against the array of the imperial order a man like jagang hated the humiliation of a sting almost as much as he would hate to be gored i will eliminate richard rahl dont you worry jagang said in a low growl she changed the subject back to what she really wanted to know about sine when has the all conquering emperor jagang turned soft and wanted to live in splendor ali but i am jagang the just now remember he returned to the bed and flopped down beside her nicci im sorry i hurt you i never want to hurt you but you make me do it you know i care about you you care about me yet you beat me you care about me yet you never bothered to tell me of such an enormous project as the building of a palace i am insignificant to you i told you im sorry i hurt youbut that was your own fault and you know it he spoke the words almost lovingly with mention of the palace his face had softened into a visionary look its only proper and fitting that i at last have the prestige of such a monumental edifice you the man who was content in tents in the field now wants to live in a resplendent building why because once i bring the new world under the guidance of the order i will owe it to all the people as their leader to be seen in a majestic setting but it will have more than simple splendor but of course she sniped he gathered up her hand nicci i will proudly wear the title jagang the just youre right the time has come for such a move i was only angered because you wrongly made that move without first discussing it with me but let us forget that now she said nothing he gripped her hand more tightly to show his sincerity she supposed youre going to love the palace when its finished he ran the back of the fingers of his other hand tenderly down her cheek we will all live there for a very long time the words struck a cord in her a very long time for the first time she realized there was something more to this than simply his vanity of wanting a palace after richard had denied him the palace of the prophets he wanted what else richard had denied him could it be she looked up into his face searching for the answer he simply smiled at the questions in her eyes construction has already begun he said turning his words away from those questions architects and great builders from all over the old world have gathered to work on it everyone wants to be part of such a grand project and brother narev she probed what does he think of building such a frivolous monument to one man when there is important work to be done for so many needy people brother narev and his disciples greatly favor the project jagang flashed her a sly smile they will live there too of course understanding washed over her hes going to spell the new palace she whispered in astonishment to herself jagang only smiled as he watched her clearly pleased with her reaction brother narev had been at the palace of the prophets almost as long as she nearly one hundred and seventy years but in all that time he seemed to have aged only ten or fifteen yearsthe same as she no one but nicci ever knew he was anything but a stablehandthey didnt know he was gifted in all that time with her along with everyone else paying him little heed he must have been studying the spell around the palace from what she knew most of brother narevs disciples had been young wizards from the palace of the prophets they had access to the vaults they too could have added information that helped him but could he really do such a thing tell me about the palace she said preferring his voice to the silent scrutiny of nightmare eyes he kissed her first the way a man kisses a woman not the way a brute kisses a victim she endured it with no more favor than any of the rest of it he seemed not to notice this time and by the smile of his face appeared to have enjoyed it it will be a walk of nearly fifteen miles to walk all the halls he swept a hand out and began to give shape to the grand palace in the air before them as he went on he stared off at his imaginary outline hanging there in space the world has never seen anything to match it while i carry on with our work of bringing the hope of the order to the new world of bringing the true word of the creator to the wicked and the greedy of banishing the selfish ideals of the ancient religion of magic back in my homeland the work of building the palace will go on quarries will be busy for years extracting all the rock that will go into the construction the variety of stone will leave no doubt about the glory of the place the marble will be the finest the woods will be only the best every material going into the palace will be exceptional the best craftsmen will shape it all into a grand structure yes but despite the fact that others may live there she mocked in cool disdain it will be but a pompous monument to only one man the great and powerful emperor jagang no it will be devoted to the glory of the creator oh and will the creator be taking up residence there too then jagang scowled at her blasphemy brother narev wishes the palace to be instructional to the people he is contributing his spiritual guidance to the undertaking and will personally oversee the construction while i cleanse the way for the order that was what she wanted to know he stared off at the invisible shape still hanging in the air before them his voice took on a reverent tone brother narev shares my vision in this he has always been like a father to me he put the fire in my belly his spiritual direction has been a lifelong inspiration he allows me to stand at the fore and take the glory of our victories but i would be nothing without his moral teachings what i win is only as the fist of the order and a fist is but one part of the whole as we are all but insignificant fragments of society as a whole you are right many others could stand in my place for the order but it is my part to be the one to lead us i would never do anything to betray the trust brother narev has placed in methat would be like betraying the creator himself he guides the way for all of us i only thought to build a fitting palace for us all a place from which to govern for the benefit of the people it was brother narev who took up the dream and gave it moral meaning by envisioning everyone when they see the vast structure as seeing mans place in the new orderseeing that man can never live up to the glory of the creator and that individually he is but a meaningless member of the greater brotherhood of man and thus can have no greater part to play than to uplift all his brothers in need so all will thrive together yet it will also be a place that will humble every man before it by showing him his utter insignificance before the glory of his creator by showing mans depravity his tortured contorted inferior nature for all men in this world are such as this nicci could almost see such a place when he spoke of it it would indeed be a humbling inspiration to the people he came near to inspiring her with such talk as brother narev had at one time inspired her this is why i have stayed she whispered because the cause of the order is righteous the piece that had been missing was now found in the quiet jagang kissed her again she allowed him to finish it and then pushed away from his embrace with a distant smile he watched as she rose and began dressing youre going to love it there nicci it will be a place befitting you oh as the slave queen as a queen if you wish it i plan to give you the kind of authority youve never before had well be happy there you and i truly happy for a long long time well be happy there she drew a stocking up her leg when sister ulicia and the four with her found away to leave you i chose to ignore their discovery and stay because i know the order is the only moral course for mankind but now i you stayed because you would be nothing without the order she looked away from his eyes she tugged her dress down over her head poked her arms through the sleeves and worked the skirt over her hips i am nothing without the order and i am nothing with it no one is we are all inadequate miserable creatures that is the nature of man that is what the creator teaches but the order shows man his duty to make a better life for the good of all and i am the emperor of the imperial order his red face cooled more slowly than it had heated he gestured vaguely in the hollow silence and he went on in a more mellow tone the world will be one under the order well be happy at the palace when its finished nicci you and i under the spiritual guidance of our priests youll see in time when im leaving she drew on a boot i will not permit it nicci paused at pulling on her other boot and glanced up into his dark eyes she flicked a finger toward a stone vase on a table against the far wall light flashed the vase exploded in a cloud of dust and chips with a sound that rocked the room the draperies shuddered the panes in the windows chattered when the dust had settled she said you will not permit it she bent forward and began doing up the laces on her boots jagang strolled over to the table and dragged his fingers through the dust that was all that remained of the stone vase he turned back to her in all his naked hairy imperial glory are you threatening me do you actually think you could use your power against me i do not think itshe yanked the laces tighti know it the truth is i choose not to he struck a defiant pose and why is that nicci stood and faced him because as you said the order needs you or rather a brute like you you serve the ends of the orderyou are their fist you bring that cleansing fire you perform that function very well it could even be said that you perform that service with extraordinary talent you are jagang the just you see the wisdom in the title i have given you and will use it to further the cause of the order that is why i choose not to use any power against you it would be like using my power against the order against my own duty to the future of mankind then why do you want to leave because i must she gave him a look of icy determination and deadly threat before i go i will be spending some time with sister lidmila you are to immediately and completely withdraw from her mind and remain out of it the entire time i am with her we will use your tents since you are not using them you will see to it that everyone leaves us entirely alone for however long it takes us anyone who enters without my express permission will die that includes you you have my oath as a sister of the dark on that when im finished and after i leave you may do what you will with sister lidmila kill her if that is your wish although i dont see why you would want to bother since she is going to be doing you a great service i see his huge chest rose he let the deep breath out slowly and how long will you be gone this time nicci this is not like the other times this is different how long perhaps only a short time perhaps a very long time i dont yet know leave me alone to do as i must and if i can i will one day return to you he gazed into her eyes but he could not look into her mind another man protected her mind and kept her thoughts her own in all the time she had spent with richard nicci had never learned that which she hungered most to know but in one way she had learned too much most of the time she was able to entomb that unwanted knowledge under the numb weight of indifference occasionally though it would like now unexpectedly rise up out of its tomb to seize her when it did she was helpless in its grip and could do nothing but wait for the oblivion of numb detachment to bury it yet again staring into the long dark night of jagangs inhuman eyes eyes that revealed nothing but the bleakness of his soul nicci touched her finger to the gold ring jagang had ordered pierced through her lower lip to mark her as his personal slave she released a threadthin channel of subtractive magic and the ring ceased to exist and where are you going nicci i am going to destroy richard rahl for you chapter zeddicus zu zorander had been able to talk and smile his way past the other soldiers but these were not moved by his explanation that he was richards grandfather he supposed he should have entered the camp in the daylightit would have avoided a lot of the suspicionbut he was tired and hadnt thought it would be that much trouble the soldiers were properly suspicious which greatly pleased him but he was weary and had more important things to do than answer questions he wanted to ask them instead why do you want to see him the bigger guard repeated i told you im richards grandfather this is the richard cypher youre talking about who you now say yes yes that was his name when he grew up and thats what im used to calling him but i meant richard rahl who he is now you know lord rahl your leader i would think being the grandfather of someone as important as your lord rahl would accord me some respect maybe even a hot meal i could say im lord rahls brother the man said keeping a tight grip on the bit in the mouth of zedds horse but that doesnt make it so zedd sighed how very true as vexing as it was zedd at some dim inward level was pleased to see that the men werent stupid nor easily duped but im also a wizard zedd added drawing low his eyebrows for dramatic effect if i wasnt friendly i could simply do you up crisp and be on my way past the both of you and if i wasnt friendly the man said i could give the signalnow that weve let you venture in this far so that youre completely surroundedand the dozen archers hiding all around you in the dark would let fly the arrows that are at this moment trained on you as they have been ever since you approached our encampment ah zedd said holding up a finger in triumph all very well and good but and even if i were to die in a final flame of service to the lord rahl those arrows will let fly without me needing to give any signal zedd harrumphed lowering his finger but inwardly he smiled here he was first wizard and if he werent entering a friendly camp he would have been bested in this game of banter by a simple soldier or maybe not in the first place sergeant i am as i said a wizard and so i knew of the archers and have already dealt with the threat by spelling their arrows so they will fly no truer and with no more deadly effect than wet dishrags i have nothing to fear from them in the second place even if im lyingwhich is precisely what you are considering at this very momentyou have made a mistake by telling me of the threat which enables me as a wizard of great repute to now use my magic to nullify it a slow smile came to the mans face why thats remarkable he scratched his head he looked to his partner and then back to zedd youre right that was exactly what i was thinking that you could be lying about knowing the archers were back there in the dark you see there young man youre not so smart after all youre right sir im not here i was so busy talking to you and being so intimidated by your wizardly powers and all that i plumb forgot to tell you about what else was out there in the dark watching you the soldiers brow loweredand it would be a mite more trouble than any simple arrows i dare say zedd scowled down at the man now see here why dont you do as i ask and come down here in the light where i can see you better and answer some of our questions with a sigh of resignation zedd dismounted he gave spider a reassuring pat on her neck spider a chestnutcolored mare had a leggy black splotch on her creamy rump from which she had acquired her name young strong and possessing an agreeably spirited nature she made a pleasant traveling companion the two of them had been through a great deal together zedd stepped into the intimate circle of light from the watch fire he turned his a hand up and brought a whitehot flame to life just above the flesh of his palm the two soldiers eyes widened zedd scowled but i have my own fire if you need to see better does this help you see things better sergeant uh why yes it does sir the man stammered yes it does indeed a woman said as she stepped into the light why didnt you simply use your han and give a display of your craft in the first place she motioned into the darkness as if signaling for others to stand down she turned back with a smile that was no more than courteous welcome wizard zedd bowed from the waist zeddicus zu zorander first wizard at your service sister philippa wizard zorander i am aid to the prelate she gestured and the sergeant took the reins from zedds hand to lead the horse away zedd clapped the man on the back to let him know there were no hard feelings and then gave a similar pat to spider to let her know it was all right to go with the men treat her especially well sergeant spider is a friend the sergeant saluted by tapping his fist to his heart shell be treated as a friend sir after the soldiers had led spider away zedd said the prelate which one the narrowjawed sister clasped her hands together prelate verna of course oh yes of course prelate verna the sisters of the light didnt know ann was still alive at least she had been alive when zedd last saw her several months past ann had written in her journey book telling verna that she was alive but also asking her to keep that information x private for the time being zedd had been hoping that perhaps ann had turned up at the dharan army camp with her sisters of the light he was sorry to learn she hadnt it boded ill for her zedd held no favor with the sisters of the lighta lifetime of disapproval was not easily forgotten but he had come to respect ann as a woman of selfdiscipline and resolve even if he took a dim view of some of her convictions and past objectives he knew that at the least he and ann shared many important values he didnt know about the rest of the sisters though sister philippa appeared middleaged but with sisters that meant little she might have lived at the palace of the prophets for only a year or for centuries with dark eyes and high cheekbones she was an exoticlooking woman as in the midlands there were places in the old world where the people had unique physical characteristics sister philippa moved the way highminded women tended to move like a swan taken to human form how may i be of service wizard zorander zedd will do is this prelate of yours awake she is this way zedd if you please he fell in behind the woman as she glided off toward the dark shapes of tents got anything to eat around here she looked back over her shoulder this late well ive been traveling hard its not really all that late is it in the dark she assessed him briefly i dont believe its ever too late according to the teachings of the creator and you do look emaciatedfrom your travels im sure her smile warmed a little food is always at the ready we have soldiers who are active through the night and need to be fed i believe i could find something for you she returned her gaze to the indiscernible path that would be a kindness zedd said in a jovial voice as he scowled at her back and im not emaciated im wiry most women find lean men appealing do they i never knew that sisters of the light were a lofty lot zedd thought ruefully for thousands of years it had been a death sentence for them to even set foot in the new world zedd had always been a little more lenientbut not by much in the past the sisters only came into the new world to steal boys with the giftthey claimed to be saving them it was a wizards task to train wizards if they came for the reason of taking a boy back beyond the great barrier to their palace zedd viewed it as the gravest of crimes they had come for that very reason only the winter before and taken richard sister verna was the one who had captured him and taken him to the old world under the spell of their palace he could have ended up being there for centuries leave it to richard to make friends with the sisters of the light of all people zedd guessed he and the sisters were eventhat they had good reason to view him in a harsh way he had after all set the spell that richard had used to destroy their palace but ann had helped knowing it was the only way to prevent jagang from capturing the palace and acquiring the prophecies therein for his own purposes all around guards big guards prowled the encampment in chain mail and leather armor they were an imposing sight they watched everything as they slipped through the darkness the camp was relatively quiet considering its size noise could give away a variety of information to an enemy it was not easy to see to it that this many men kept quiet im relieved that our first incursion by someone possessing the gift turned out to be a friend the sister said and im glad to see that the gifted are helping to keep watch but there are types of enemy forays that the regular sentries could not identify zedd wondered if they were really prepared for those kinds of troubles if magic is involved we will be there to detect it i suppose you were watching me the whole time i was sister philippa said from the time you crossed the line of hills back there zedd scratched his jaw really that far away with a satisfied smirk she said that far he peered over his shoulder into the night both of you very good she halted and turned to him both you knew there were two of us watching zedd smiled innocently but of course you were just watching she was farther away following conjuring some little nasty should i prove hostile sister philippa blinked in astonishment remarkable you could sense her touching her han from that distance zedd nodded with satisfaction they didnt make me first wizard just because i was wiry sister philippas smile finally looked sincere i am relieved you came as a friend rather than one intent on harm there was more truth in that than the woman knew zedd had experience in the unpleasant dirty business of magic in warfare when hed come near their camp he saw the holes in their defense and the weaknesses in the way they used the gift for their purpose they were not thinking as their enemy would think had lie been intent on harm the entire camp would be in an uproar by now despite what they had done to prepare for one such as he sister philippa turned back to the night to lead him on it was somewhat unsettling for zedd to walk through a dharan campeven though he knew they were now fighting on the same side he had spent a good deal of his life dealing with dharans as the deadly enemy richard had changed all that zedd sighed he sometimes thought that richard might make friends with thunder and lightning and invite them both to dinner dark shapes of tents and wagons loomed all around pole weapons were stacked upright in neat ranks ready should they be suddenly needed some soldiers snored and some sat around in the dark talking in low voices or laughing quietly while x others patrolled the inky shadows those passed close enough for zedd to smell their breath but in the darkness he could not make out their faces wellhidden sentries were stationed at every possible approach route there were very few fires in the camp and those were mostly watch fires set away from the main force leaving the mass of the camp a dark whole of night some armies carried on a considerable amount of work at night performing repairs or making things they needed and letting the men do as they would these men remained quiet throughout the night so watching eyes and listening ears could gain little if any help for an invading force these were well trained disciplined professional soldiers from a distance it was difficult to tell the size of the camp it was huge sister philippa brought zedd to a sizable tent one tall enough to stand in light from lamps hanging inside gave the canvas walls and roof a soft amber glow she ducked beneath a tent line and poked her head in under the flap i have a wizard out here who wishes to see the prelate zedd heard muffled astonished acknowledgment from inside go on in sister philippa smiled while giving his back a gentle push ill see if i can find you some dinner i would be not only grateful but greatly in your debt zedd told her as he stepped inside the tent the people were just coming to their feet to greet him zedd you old fool you be alive zedd grinned as adie the old sorceress known as the bone woman in their adopted homeland of westland rushed into his arms he let out a grunt as she momentarily squeezed the wind from his lungs he smoothed her squarecut jaw length black and gray hair as he held her head to his chest i promised youd see me again now didnt i yes you did she whispered into his heavy robes she pushed back holding his arms and looked him over she reached up and smoothed down his unruly wavy white hair you look as lovely as ever he told her she peered at him with her completely white eyes her sight had been taken from her when she was but a young woman adie now saw by means of her gift in some ways she saw better where be your hat hat i bought you a fine hat arid you lost it i see you still have not replaced it you told me you would get another i believe you promised zedd hated the hat with the long feather shed bought for him when theyd acquired the rest of his clothes hed rather be wearing the simple robes befitting a wizard of his rank and authority but adie had lost them after he purchased the fancy maroon robes with black sleeves and cowled shoulders he now wore three rows of silver brocade circled the cuffs thicker gold brocade ran around the neck and down the front a red satin belt set with a gold buckle gathered the outfit at his thin waist such clothes marked one with the gift as an initiate for one without the gift such clothes befitted nobility or in most places a wealthy merchant so although zedd disliked the ostentatious attire it had at times been a valuable disguise besides adie liked him in the maroon robes the hat though was too much for him it had been misplaced he noted that adie had managed to keep her simple clothes along the way yellow and real beads around the neck of her robes sewn in the shapes of the ancient symbols of her profession of sorceress were the only ornamentation she wore ive been busy he said flicking his hand hoping to dismiss the matter or i would have replaced the hat bale she scoffed you be up to mischief why ive been hush now adie said holding his arm in a tight grip she held out the long thin fingers of her other hand zedd this be verna prelate of the sisters of the light the woman looked to be in her late thirties perhaps early forties zedd knew her to be much older ann vernas predecessor had told him vernas age and while he couldnt recall the exact number it was somewhere close to one hundred and sixty yearsyoung for a sister of the light she had simple attractive features and brown hair with just enough curl and body to add a hint of sophistication her intent browneyed gaze looked as if it could scour lichen off granite by the lines of a resolute expression enduringly fixed on her face she appeared to be a woman with a shell as tight as a beetles and just as hard zedd bowed his head prelate first wizard zeddicus zul zorander at your service he let her know by his tone that it was merely a figure of speech this was the woman who had taken richard away to the old world even if she believed it was to save his life zedd as first wizard viewed such an act as abhorrent the sisterssorceresses allbelieved they could train gifted young men to be wizards they were wrong such a task could only be adequately accomplished by another wizard she offered her hand with the sunburstpatterned gold ring of office he bent forward and kissed it out of what he thought must be their custom she pulled his hand close when he had finished and kissed it in return i am humbled to meet the man who helped raise our richard you would have to be as rare a person as i found him to be when we helped begin his training she forced a chuckle we found it a formidable labor trying to teach that grandson of yours zedd slightly altered his opinion of the woman treating her with greater caution the air in the tent was stuffy and uncomfortable that is because you are all oxen trying to teach a horse to run you sisters should stick to work more befitting your nature yes yes you be a brilliant man zedd adie scoffed simply brilliant one of these days even i may come to believe you she tugged his sleeve turning him from vernas scarlet face and this be warren adie said zedd inclined his head toward warren but the boy was already falling to his knees and bowing his blond head wizard zorander this is quite an honor he popped back up and seized zedds hand in both of his pumping it until zedd thought his arm might come undone at the shoulder im so pleased to meet you richard told me all about you im so pleased to meet a wizard of your standing and talent i would be so happy to learn from you the happier he looked the more verna scowled well im pleased to meet you too my boy zedd didnt tell warren that richard had never mentioned him but that was not out of disrespect or neglect richard had never had a chance to tell zedd a great number of very important things zedd thought he could sense through warrens grip that the young man was a wizard of unusual talents a bear of a man with a curly rustcolored beard a white scar from his left temple to his jaw and heavy eyebrows stepped forward his grayish green eyes fixed on zedd with fierce intensity but he had a grin like a soldier on a long march who had spotted a lonely cask of ale general reibisch commander of the dharan forces here in the south the man said taking zedds hand when warren at last surrendered it and stepped back beside verna lord rahls grandfather what good fortune to see you sir his grip was firm but not painful it got tighter what very good fortune yes indeed zedd muttered unfortunate as the circumstances are general reibisch unfortunate well never mind for the moment zedd said waving off the question he asked another instead tell me general have you begun to dig all the mass graves yet or do you intend the few who are left alive to simply abandon all the bodies bodies why yes the bodies of all your troops who are going to die chapter i hope you like eggs sister philippa sang out as she swept into the tent holding out a steaming plate zedd rubbed his hands together delightful everyone else was still standing in stiff stunned silence sister philippa didnt seem to notice all the hanging jaws i had the cook add some ham and a few other things he had about she glanced down at zedds form i thought you could use some substance marvelous zedd grinned as he relieved her of the plate mounded high with scrambled eggs and ham ah the general began seemingly befuddled as to how to frame his question might you kindly explain what you mean by that wizard zorander zedd will do zedd looked up from inhaling the intoxicating aroma of the dish dead he drew the fork across his throat you know dead nearly all of them dead he turned back to sister philippa this smells delightful he again inhaled the steam lifting from the plate of eggs simply delightful you are a woman of a kind heart and a skillful mind to think to have the cook add such a splendid complement of ingredients simply delightful the sister beamed the general lifted a hand wizard zorander if i may adie hushed the burly general you be poor competition to food be patient zedd took a forkful humming his pleasure at the flavor he encountered as he took a second forkful adie guided him to a simple bench at the side of the tent a table in the middle held a few mugs and a lamp that lent the cozy tent not only its light but its oily odor as well despite adies advice to be patient everyone began talking at once asking questions and offering objections zedd ignored them as he shoveled in the scrambled eggs the large chunks of ham were delicious he waved a particular juicy piece of meat to the confounded spectators to indicate his pleasure with it the spices the onions the peppers and the warm lumps of cheese were delightful he rolled his eyes and moaned in bliss it was the best food hed had in days his traveling rations were simple and had long ago become boring he had often grumbled that spider ate better than he did spider seemed smug about it too which he had always found annoying it wasnt good for a horse to be smug with you philippa verna growled must you be so pleased about a plate of eggs well the poor man is practically starving puzzled by vernas scowl she waggled her hand at zedd just look at him im simply happy to see him enjoy his meal and pleased i could help one of the creators gifted zedd slowed when he all too soon approached the end of his meal putting off the last few bites he could have eaten another plate the same size general reibisch sitting on a bench on the opposite side of the small tent had been furiously twisting a strand of beard now he leaned forward his intent gaze fixed on zedd wizard zorander i need zedd remember yes zedd zedd the lives of these soldiers are my responsibility could you please tell me if you think they are in danger zedd spoke around a mouthful i already did but what is the nature of the danger the gifted you know magic the general straightened with a sober expression his fingers dug into his muscular thighs the gifted yes the enemy has gifted among them i thought you knew he blinked a few times as he seemed to run it through his mind again trying to discover the nugget of invisible danger in zedds simple statement of course we know that ah then why havent you dug some mass graves verna shot to her feet in the name of creation what do you think we are serving wenches here to bring you dinner we are gifted sisters here to defend the army from jagangs captive sisters adie stealthily signaled verna to sit down and keep quiet her voice came out like gravel in honey why dont you tell us what you have found zedd i be sure the general and the prelate would like to hear how to improve our defenses zedd scraped the small yellow lumps across the plate collecting them into a final pitifully small forkful prelate i didnt mean to imply a deliberate inadequacy on your part well you certainly you are all too good thats all i beg your pardon too good you and your sisters have spent your lives trying to help people well i wewhy of course we help people thats our calling killing is not jagang will be intent on killing you all we know that zedd the general scratched his beard his gaze darting back and forth between verna and zedd the prelate and her sisters have helped us with detecting a number of enemy scouts and such just the same as sister philippa here found you when you approached our camp theyve found others intent on harm theyve done their part zedd and without complaint every soldier in this camp is glad to have them here all well and good but when the army of the imperial order attacks it will be different they will use the gifted to lay waste to your forces they will try verna insisted trying to be convincing without shouting which she was clearly itching to do but we are prepared to prevent such a thing thats right warren said nodding his confidence we have gifted at the ready at all times thats good thats good zedd drawled as if he might be reconsidering then you have dealt with the simple threats the albino mosquitoes and such general reibischs bushy eyebrows wrinkled together the what zedd waved his fork so tell me then just to satisfy my curiositywhat are the gifted planning to do when the enemy charges our forces say with a line of cavalry lay down a line of fire before their cavalry warren said without hesitation as they charge in well incinerate them before they can so much as launch a spear ah zedd said fire he put the last forkful in his mouth everyone silently watched him chew he paused in his chewing and looked up big fire i presume colossal gouts of flame and all what mosquitoes is he talking about general reibisch muttered under his breath toward verna and warren beside him on his bench opposite zedd and adie thats right verna said ignoring the general he sighed and folded his arms across his barrel chest a proper line of fire verna waited until zedd swallowed do you find something unsatisfactory about that first wizard zedd shrugged well he paused then frowned he leaned toward the general peering more closely zedd wagged a bony finger at the mans folded arms theres one now a mosquito is about to suck your blood general what oh he swatted it theyve been thick this summer i think the season for them is drawing to an end though well be happy to be rid of the little pests i can tell you zedd waggled his finger again and were they all like that one general reibisch lifted his forearm and glanced down at the squashed bug yes the bloodthirsty little his voice trailed off he peered more closely with a finger and thumb he gingerly lifted the tiny insect by a wing holding it up to have a better look well ill be this thing ishis face lost a shade of colorwhite his grayishgreen eyes turned up toward zedd what was that you were saying about albino mosquitoes zedd confirmed as he set his empty plate on the ground he gestured with a sticklike finger at the generals flat assailant have you ever seen the albino fever general have any of you terrible thing albino fever whats albino fever warren asked i never heard of it ive never read anything about it either im sure really must be just a midlands thing the general peered more closely at the tiny white insect he was holding up what does this albino fever do to a person oh your flesh turns the most ghastly white zedd waved his fork do you know he said frowning in thought as if distracted by something as he looking up at the ceiling of the tent that i once saw a wizard lay down a simply prodigious font of flame before a line of charging cavalry well there you go verna said you know its value then youve seen it in action yes zedd drawled problem was the enemy had been prepared for such a simpleminded trick simpleminded verna shot to her feet i dont see how you could possibly consider the enemy had conjured curved shields just for such an eventuality curved shields warren swiped back a curly lock of his blond hair ive never heard of such a thing what are curved the wizard who laid down the fire had been expecting shields of course and so he made his fire resistant to such an expected defense these shields though werent conjured to stop the firezedds gaze shifted from warrens wide eyes to vernas scowlbut to roll it albino fever the general waved his bug if you might could you explain roll the fire warren asked as he leaned forward yes zedd said roll the fire before the cavalry chargeso that instead of a simple cavalry assault the defenders now had deadly fire rolling back at them dear creator warren whispered thats ingeniousbut surely the shield would extinguish the fire zedd twirled his fork as he spoke as if to demonstrate the shield rolling the flames conjured by their own wizard for the expected defense the fire had been hardened against shields so instead of fizzling it stayed viable that of course enabled the curved shield to roll the fire back without it extinguishing and of course being hardened to shields the wizards own quickly thrown up defensive shields couldnt stop his own fires return but he could just cut it oft warren was becoming panicked as if seeing his own wizards fire coming back at him the wizard who created it could call it and cut it off could he zedd smiled he thought so too but he hadnt been prepared for the peculiar nature of the enemys shield dont you see it not only rolled the fire back but in so doing rolled around the fire as it went protecting it from any alteration by magic of course warren whispered to himself the shield was also sprinkled with a provenanceseeking spell so it rolled the fire back toward the wizard who conjured it he died by his own fireafter it had seared through hundreds of his own men on its way to him silence settled into the tent even the general still holding out the albino mosquito sat transfixed you see zedd finally went on tossing his fork down onto his plate using the gift in war is not simply an act of exercising your power but an act of using your wits zedd pointed for example consider that albino mosquito general reibisch is holding under cover of darkness just like right now tens of thousands of them conjured by the enemy could be sneaking into this camp to infect your men with fever and no one would even realize they were under attack then in the morning the enemy strikes a camp of weak and sick soldiers and slaughters the lot of you sister philippa over on the other side of adie swished her hand in alarm at a tiny buzzing mosquito but the gifted we have could counter such a thing it was more a plea than an argument really its difficult to detect such an infinitesimal bit of magic none of you detected these minuscule invaders did you well no but zedd fixed a fierce glare on sister philippa its night in the night they simply seem to be ordinary mosquitoes pesky but no different from any other why the general here didnt notice them neither did any of you gifted people you cant detect the fever they carry either because it too is such a tiny speck of magic you arent watching for ityoure looking for something huge and powerful and fearsome most of the gifted sisters will be bitten in their sleep without ever knowing it happened until they awake in the pitch blackness with the shivering chills of a frightful fever only to discover the first truly debilitating symptom of this particular fever blindness you see it isnt the blackness of night they awake todawn has already brokenbut blindness then they find that their legs wont obey their wishes their ears are ringing with what sounds like an endless tingling scream the generals gaze darted about testing his eyesight as zedd went on he twisted a big finger in an ear as if to clean it out by now anyone bitten is too weak to stand they lose control of their bodily functions and lie helpless in their own filth they are within hours of death but those last hours will seem like a year how do we counter it on the edge of his seat warren licked his lips whats the cure cure there is no cure now a fog is beginning to creep toward the camp this time the few gifted left can sense that the wide mass of seething murk is foul with dark suffocating magic they warn everyone those too sick to stand wail in terror they cant see but they can hear the distant battle cries of the advancing enemy in a panic not to be touched by the deadly fog anyone able to rise from their bedrolls does so too delirious to stand a few manage to crawl the rest run for their lives before the advancing fog its the last mistake they ever make zedd whispered he swept a hand out before their white faces they run headlong into the horror of a waiting death trap everyone was wideeyed and slackjawed by now sitting on the edge of their benches so general zedd said in a bright cheery tone as he sat back what about those mass graves or are you planning on any of you left alive just abandoning the sick for dead and leaving the bodies to rot probably not a bad idea there will be enough to worry about without the burdensome task of trying to care for the dying and burying all the deadespecially since the very act of touching their white flesh will contaminate the living with a completely unexpected sickness and then verna shot to her feet but what can we do she could plainly see the potential for chaos all around her how can we counter such vile magic she threw open her arms what do we need to do zedd shrugged i thought you and your sisters had it all figured out i thought you knew what you were doing he waggled his hand over his shoulder gesturing off to the south toward the enemy i thought you said you had the situation well in hand verna silently sank back down to the bench beside warren uh zedd general reibisch swallowed in distress he held out the mosquito zedd i think im starting to feel dizzy isnt there anything you can do about what the fever i think my vision is getting dimmer can you do nothing no nothing nothing nothing because theres nothing wrong with you i just conjured a few albino mosquitoes to make a point the point is that what i saw when i came into this camp scared the wits out of me if the gifted among the enemy are at all diabolical and with jagang we have ample reason to believe they are then this army is ill prepared for the true nature of the threat sister philippa haltingly lifted a hand like a schoolgirl with a question but with all the gifted among us surely we would know or something thats what im trying to tell you the way things are now you wont know its the things you never heard of havent seen before dont expect and cant even imagine that are going to be coming for you the enemy will use conventional magic to be sure and that will be trouble enough but its the albino mosquitoes you must fear as you said though you only conjured them to make a point warren said maybe the enemy isnt as smart as you and wont think of such things the order did not take over all of the old world by being stupid but by being ruthless zedds brow drew lower he lifted a finger skyward to mark his words besides they have already thought of just such things this past spring one of the sisters in the hands of the enemy used magic to unleash a deadly plague that could not be detected by anyone with the gift tens of thousands of people from newborn infants to the old suffered gruesome deaths those sisters in the hands of the enemy were a grave and everpresent danger ann had gone off alone on a mission to either rescue those sisters or eliminate them from what zedd had seen when he had been down in anderith ann had failed in her mission he didnt know what had become of her but he knew that jagang still held sisters captive but we stopped the plague warren said richard stopped it as only he could zedd held the gaze of the young wizard did you know that in order to save us from that grim fate he had to venture to the temple of the winds hidden away beyond the veil of life in the underworld itself neither you nor i can imagine the toll such an experience must have taken on him i saw a shadow of the specter in his eyes when he spoke of it i cant even hazard a guess as to how trifling a chance at success he had when he started on so hopeless a journey had he not prevailed against all odds we would all be dead by now from an unseen death brought on by magic we could not detect and could not counter id not want to again count on such an auspicious deliverance no one could disagree with him they nodded slightly or looked away the tent had become a gloomy place verna rubbed her fingers across her brow pride is of no use to the dead i admit it those gifted among us have little knowledge of what were doing when it comes to using our gift in warfare we know some things about fighting perhaps even a great many things but i admit we could be woefully lacking in the depth of knowledge needed think us fools if you will but dont ever think us at odds with you zedd we are all here on the same side her brown eyes betrayed nothing but simple sincerity we not only could use your help we would gratefully welcome it of course he will help us adie scoffed while giving zedd a scolding frown well you have a good start admitting that you dont know something is the first step to learning zedd scratched his chin every day i amaze myself with all i dont know that would be wonderful warren said if you would help us i mean he sounded hesitant but forged ahead anyway i would really like to have the benefit of a real wizards experience despondent with the weight of his other troubles zedd shook his head i would like toand to be sure i will give you all some advice in the task at hand however ive been on a long and frustrating journey and im afraid im not yet finished with it i cant stay i must soon be off again chapter warren swiped back his curly blond hair what sort of journey have you been on zedd zedd pointed a bony finger you dont need to keep that flattened mosquito general general reibisch realized it was still between his finger and thumb he tossed it away everyone awaited zedds words he smoothed the heavy maroon robes over his twiglike thighs as his gaze absently studied the dirt floor he let out a crestfallen sigh i was recovering from my own auspicious deliverance from grappling with remarkable magic id never before encountered and as i regained my senses spent months searching i was down in anderith and saw some of what happened after the order swept in there it was a dark time for the people not only from the rampaging soldiers but also from one of your sisters verna deaths mistress they called her do you know which one it is verna asked in a bitter voice at hearing of a sister causing harm no i only saw her once from a goodly distance had i been fully recovered i might have tried to remedy the situation but i wasnt myself yet and dared not confront her she also had a few thousand soldiers with her the sight of all the soldiers led by a woman they had heard of and feared had people in a panic the sister was young with blond hair she wore a black dress dear creator verna whispered not one of mineone of the keepers there are few women born with the strength of power such as she has she also has power acquired by nefarious means nicci is a sister of the dark ive gotten reports general reibisch said by his grim tone zedd knew the reports must have had it right ive heard too that its quieted considerably zedd nodded the order was at first brutal but now jagang the justas they have taken to calling himhas spared them further harm in most places other than the capital of fairfield where the most killing took place people have turned to supporting him as a liberator come to deliver them into a better life theyre reporting neighbors or travelerswhoever they suspect is not an adherent to the noble ideals of the order i was all through anderith and spent a good deal of time behind the enemy lines searchingwithout success i then journeyed up into the wilds and north to a number of towns and even a few cities but i can find no sign of them i guess my abilities were a long time in recovering i only a short time ago discovered where you all were i have to commend you general youve kept the presence of your forces well hiddentook me forever to find your army the boy though seems to have vanished without a trace zedds fists tightened in his lap i must find him you mean richard adie asked you be searching for your grandson yes for richard and kahlan both zedd lifted his hands in a helpless gesture however without any success i must admit ive talked to no one who has seen even a sign of them ive used every skill i possess but to no avail if i didnt know better id say they no longer existed looks passed among everyone else zedd peered from one surprised face to another for the first time in months zedds hopes rose what what is it you know something verna gestured under the bench show him general at her urging the general lifted out a map roll he pulled it wide in his callused hands and laid it on the ground at his feet the map was turned around so zedd could read it general reibisch tapped the mountains to the west of hartland right here zedd right there what richard and kahlan verna said zedd gaped at her face and then down at the map general reibischs finger hovered over a wild range of peaks zedd knew those mountains they were an inhospitable place there dear spirits why would richard and kahlan be all the way up there in such a forbidding place what are they doing there kahlan be hurt adie said in a consoling tone hurt she was at the brink of passing into the spirit world from what we be told maybe she saw the world on the other side of the veil adie pointed to the map richard took her there to recover but why would he do that with a hand zedd flattened his wavy white hair to the top of his head his thoughts spun in a confusing jumble while he tried to take it all in at once she could be healed no she be spelled if magic be used to try to heal her a vile hidden spell would be unleashed and she would die understanding washed over him dear spirits im thankful the boy knew it in time before the horror of memories of the screams could come roaring to the fore of his thoughts zedd slammed a mental door on them he swallowed with the pain of those that slipped through but still why would he go there hes needed here he certainly is verna snapped by her tone it was a sore subject he cant come here warren said when zedd only stared at him he explained further we dont understand it all but we believe richard is following a prophecy of some sort prophecy zedd dismissed it with a wave richard doesnt take to riddles he hates them and wont pay heed to them there are times when i wish he would but he wont well this one hes paying heed to warren pressed his lips tight for a moment its his own his own what warren cleared his throat prophecy zedd jumped to his feet what richard nonsense hes a war wizard verna said with quiet authority zedd passed a scowl among all the suddenly circumspect expressions he made a sour face and with a flourish of his robes returned to his seat beside adie what is this prophecy warren twisted a little knot of his violet robes he didnt say exactly here general reibisch pulled some folded papers from a pocket he wrote me letters weve all read them zedd stood and snatched the letters from the generals big fist he went to the table and smoothed out the pages as everyone else sat silently watching zedd leaned over the table and read richards words lying before him with great authority richard paradoxically turned away from authority he said that after much reflection he had come to an understanding that arrived with the power of a vision and he knew then beyond doubt that his help would only bring about certain catastrophe in letters that followed richard said he and kahlan were safe and she was slowly recovering cara was with them in response to letters general reibisch and others had written richard remained steadfast in his stand he warned them that the cause of freedom would be forever lost if he failed to remain on his true path he said that whatever decisions general reibisch and the rest of them made he would not contradict or criticize he told them that his heart was with them but they were on their own for the foreseeable future he said possibly forever his letters basically gave no real information other than alluding to his understanding or vision and making it clear that they could expect no guidance from him nonetheless zedd could read some of what the words didnt say zedd stared at the letters long after he had finished reading them the flame of the lamp wavered slowly from side to side occasionally fluttering and sending up a coiled thread of oily smoke he could hear muffled voices outside the tent as soldiers on patrol quietly passed along information inside everyone remained silent they had all read the letters vernas expression was tight with anxiety she could hold her tongue no longer will you go to see him zedd convince him to return to the struggle zedd lightly trailed his fingers over the words on paper i cant this is one time i can be of no help to him but hes our leader in this struggle the soft lamplight illuminated the feminine grace of her slender fingers as she pressed them to her brow in vain solace her hand fell back to her lap without him zedd didnt answer her he could not imagine what anns reaction to such a development would be for centuries she had combed through prophecies in anticipation of the war wizard who would be born to lead them in this battle for the very existence of magic richard was that war wizard born to the battle he had suddenly abandoned what do you think be the problem adie asked in her quiet raspy voice zedd looked back to the letters one last time he pulled his gaze from the words and straightened all eyes around the dimly lit tent were on him as if hoping he could somehow rescue them from a fate they couldnt comprehend but instinctively dreaded this is a time of trial to the depth of richards soul zedd slipped his hands up opposite sleeves until the silver brocade at the cuffs met a passage of sorts thrust upon him because of his comprehension of something only he sees warren cleared his throat what sort of trial zedd can you tell us zedd gestured vaguely as memories of terrible times flashed through his mind a struggle a reconciliation what sort of reconciliation warren pressed zedd gazed into the young mans blue eyes wishing he wouldnt ask so many questions what is the purpose of your gift its purpose well i ability it is to help others verna stated flatly she clutched her light blue cloak more tightly around her shoulders as if it were armor to defend her from whatever zedd might throw at her in answer ah then what are you doing here the question caught her by surprise here yes zedd waved his arm indicating a vague distant place if the gift is to help others then why are you not out there doing it there are sick needing to be healed ignorant needing to be taught and the hungry needing to be fed why are you just sitting there healthy smart and well fed verna rearranged her cloak as she squared her shoulders into a posture of firm resolve in battle if you abandon the gates to help a fallen comrade you have given in to a weakness your inability to steel yourself to an immediate suffering in order to prevent suffering on a much greater scale if i run off to help the few people i could in that manner i must leave my post here with this army as they try to keep the enemy from storming the gateway into the new world zedds estimation of the woman rose a little she had come tantalizingly close to expressing the essence of a vital truth he offered her a small smile of respect as he nodded she looked more surprised by that than she had by his question i can certainly see why the sisters of the light are widely regarded as proper servants of need zedd stroked his chin so then it is your conviction that we with the abilitythe giftare born into the world to be slaves to those with needs well no but if there is a great need then we are more tightly bound in the chains of slavery to those with every greater need zedd finished for her thus anyone with a need by rightto your mindbecomes our master indentured servant to one cause or to any greater cause that might come along but chattel all the same yes this time verna chose not to dance with him over what she apparently regarded as a patch of quicksand it didnt prevent her from glaring at him though zedd held that there could be only one philosophically valid answer to the question if verna knew it she didnt offer it richard has apparently come to a place where he must critically examine his alternatives and determine the proper course of his life zedd explained perhaps circumstances have caused him to question the proper use of his abilities and in view of his values his true purpose verna opened her hands in a helpless gesture i dont see how he could have any higher purpose than to be here helping the army against the threat to the new worldthe threat to the lives of free people zedd sank back down onto the bench you do not see and i do not see but richard sees something that doesnt mean hes right warren said zedd studied the young mans face for a moment warren had fresh features but guess to well it just is the gift was simply an also a knowing look in his eyes that betrayed something beyond mere youth zedd wondered how old warren was no it does not mean richard is right he may be making a heroic mistake that destroys our chance to survive kahlan thinks maybe it be a mistake adie finally put in as if regretting having to tell him she wrote a note to mei believe without richards knowledge seeing as cara wrote down kahlans words for herand gave it to the messenger kahlan says that she fears richard be doing this in part because of what happened to her the mother confessor also confided that she be afraid richard has lost his faith in people and because of his rejection by the people of anderith richard may view himself as a fallen leader bah zedd waved his hand dismissively a leader cannot follow behind people tail between his legs sniffing for their momentary whims and wishes whining to follow them this way and that as they ramble through life those kind of people are not looking for a leaderthey are looking for a master and one will find them a true leader forges a clear path through a moral wilderness so that people might see the way richard was a woods guide because such is his nature perhaps he is lost in that dark wood if he is he must find his way out and it must be a correctly reasoned course if he is to be the true leader of a free people everyone silently considered the implications the general was a man who followed the lord rahl and simply awaited his orders the sisters had their own ideas zedd and adie knew the way ahead was not what it might seem to some thats what richard did for me warren said in a soft voice staring off into memories of his own he showed me the waymade me want to follow him up out of the vaults i had become comfortable down there content with my books and my fate but i was a prisoner of that darkness living my life through the struggles and accomplishments of others i never could understand precisely how he inspired me to want to follow him up and out warren looked up into zedds eyes maybe he needs that same kind of help himself can you help him zedd he has entered a dark time for any man and especially for a wizard he must come out the other side of this on his own if i take him by the hand and lead him through so to speak i might take him a way he would not have selected on his own and then he would forever be crippled by what i had chosen for him but worse yet what if hes right if i unwittingly forced him to another course it could doom us all and result in a world enslaved by the imperial order zedd shook his head no this much i know richard must be left alone to do as he must if he truly is the one to lead us in this battle for the future of magic and of mankind then this can only be part of his journey as it must be traveled almost everyone nodded if reluctantly at zedds words warren didnt nod he picked at the fabric of his violet robes theres one thing we havent considered as everyone waited his blue eyes turned up to meet zedds gaze in those eyes zedd saw an uncommon wisdom that told him that this was a young man who could gaze into the depths of things when most people saw only the sparkles on the surface it could be warren said in a quiet but unflinching voice that richard being gifted and being a war wizard has been visited by a legitimate prophecy war wizards are different from the rest of us their ability is not narrowly specific but broad prophecy is at least theoretically within his purview moreover richard has subtractive magic as well as additive no wizard born in the last three thousand years has had both sides while we can perhaps imagine we could not possibly begin to understand his potential though the prophecies have alluded to it it could very well be that richard has had a valid prophecy that he clearly understands if so then he may be doing precisely what must be done it could even be that he clearly understands the prophecy and it is so gruesome he is doing us the only kindness he canby not telling us verna covered his hand with hers you dont really believe that do you warren zedd noticed that verna put a lot of stock in what warren said ann had told zedd that warren was only beginning to exhibit his gift of prophecy such wizardsprophetswere so rare that they came along only once or twice a millennium the potential importance of such a wizard was incalculable zedd didnt know how far along that path warren really was yet warren probably didnt either prophecy can be a terrible burden warren smoothed his robes along his thigh perhaps richards prophecy told him that if he is to ever have a chance to oversee victory he must not die with the rest of us in our struggle against the army of the imperial order general reibisch silent about such wizardly doings had nevertheless been listening and watching intently sister philippas thumb twiddled a button on her dress even with vernas comforting hand on his warren at that moment looked nothing but forlorn warrenzedd waited until their eyes metwe all at times envision the most fearful turn of events simply because its the most frightening thing we can imagine dont invest your thoughts primarily in that which is not the most likely reason for richards actions simply because it is the reason you fear the most i believe richard is struggling to understand his place in all this remember he grew up as a woods guide he has to come to terms not only with his ability but with the weight of rule yes but zedd lifted a finger for emphasis the truth of a situation most often turns out to be that one with the simplest explanation the gloom on warrens face finally melted away under the dawning radiance of a luminous smile id forgotten that ancient bit of wisdom thank you zedd general reibisch combing his curly beard with his fingers pulled the hand free and made a fist besides dharans will not be so easily bested we have more forces to call upon and we have allies here in the midlands who will come to aid in the fight we have all heard the reports of the size of the order but they are just men not evil spirits they have gifted but so do we they have yet to come facetoface with the might of dharan soldiers warren picked up a small rock not quite the size of his fist and held it in his palm as he spoke i mean no disrespect general and i do not mean to dissuade you from our just cause but the subject of the order has been a pastime of mine ive studied them for years im also from the old world fair enough so what is it you have to tell us well say that the tabletop is the old worldthe area from which jagang draws his troops now there are places to be sure where there are few people spread over vast areas but there are many places with great populations too its much the same in the new world the general said dhara has populous places and desolate areas warren shook his head he passed his hand over the tabletop say this is the old worldthe whole of this table he held up the rock to show the general and then placed it on the edge of the tabletop this is the new world this is its sizethis rock compared to the old world but but that doesnt include dhara general reibisch sputtered surely with dhara dhara is included in the rock im afraid warren is right verna said sister philippa too nodded grim acknowledgment perhaps she said looking down at her hands folded in her lap perhaps warren is right and richard has seen a vision of our defeat and knows he must remain out of it or be lost with all the rest of us i dont think thats it at all zedd offered in a gentle voice i know richard if richard thought we would lose he would say so in order to give people a chance to weigh that in their decisions the general cleared his throat well actually one of the letters is missing from that stack it was the firstwhere lord rahl told me about his vision in it lord rahl did say that we had no chance to win zedd felt the blood drain down into his legs he tried to keep his manner unconcerned oh where is the letter the general gave verna a sidelong glance well actually verna said when i read it i was angered and and she balled it up and threw it in the fire warren finished for her vernas face turned red but she offered no defense zedd could understand the sentiment but he would have liked to have read it with his own eyes he forced a smile were those his actual wordsthat we had no chance to win zedd asked trying not to sound alarmed he could feel sweat running down the back of his neck no general reibisch said as he shifted his shoulders inside his uniform while giving the question careful thought no lord rahls words were that we must not commit our forces to an attack directly against the army of the imperial order or our side will be destroyed and any chance for winning in the future will be forever lost the feeling began to return to zedds fingers he wiped a bead of sweat from the side of his forehead he was able to draw an easier breath well that only makes sense if they are as large a force as warren says then any direct attack would be foolhardy it did make sense zedd wondered though why richard would make such a point of it to a man of general reibischs experience perhaps richard was only being cautious there was nothing wrong with being cautious adie slipped her hand under zedds and cuddled her loose fist under his palm if you believe you must let richard be in this then you will stay help teach the gifted here what they must know every face was etched with concern as they watched him hanging on what he might decide the general idly stroked a finger down the white scar on the side of his face sister philippa knitted her fingers together verna and warren entwined theirs zedd smiled and hugged adies shoulders of course im not going to abandon you the three on the bench opposite him each let out a little sigh their posture relaxed as if ropes around their necks had been slackened zedd passed a hard look among them all war is nasty business its about killing people before they can kill you magic in war is simply another weapon if a frightening one you must realize that it too in this must be used for the end result of killing people what do we need to do verna asked clearly relieved that he had agreed to stay but not to the obvious extent of general reibisch warren or sister philippa zedd pulled some of his robes from each side of his legs over into the middle between them as he gave the question some thought it was not the sort of lesson he relished tomorrow morning we will begin there is much to learn about countering magic in warfare i will teach all the gifted some things about the awful business of using what you always hoped to use for good for harm instead the lessons are not pleasing to endure but then neither is the alternative the thought of such lessons and worse the use of such knowledge could not be pleasant for any of them to contemplate adie who knew a little bit about the horrific nature of such struggle rubbed his back in sympathy his heavy robes stuck to his skin he wished he had his simple wizards robes back we will all do as we must to prevent our own people from falling to the monstrous magic of the imperial order verna said you have my word as prelate zedd nodded tomorrow then we begin i fear to think of magic added to warfare general reibisch said as he stood zedd shrugged to tell the truth the ultimate object of magic in warfare is to counter the enemys magic if we do our job properly we will bring balance to this that would mean that all magic would be nullified and the soldiers would then be able to fight without magic swaying the battle you will be able to be the steel against steel while we are the magic against magic you mean your magic wont be of direct help to us zedd shrugged we will try to use magic to visit harm on them in any way we can but when we try to use magic as a weapon the enemy will try to counter ours any attempt to use their power against us we will try to counter the result of magic in warfare if properly and expertly done is that it seems as if magic did not exist at all if we fail to rise to the challenge then the power they throw at us will be truly horrific to witness if we can best them then you will see such destruction of their forces as you cant imagine but in my experience magic has a way of balancing so that you rarely see such events a deadlock then is our goal sister philippa asked zedd turned his palms up moving his hands up and down in opposition as if they were scales holding great weight the gifted on both sides will be working harder than they have ever worked before i can tell you that its exhausting the result except with small shifts in the advantage is that it will seem as if we are doing nothing to earn our dinner zedd let his hands drop it will be punctuated with brief moments of sheer horror and true panic when it seems beyond doubt that the world itself is about to end in one final fit of sheer madness general reibisch grinned in an odd gentle knowing way let me tell you war when youre holding a sword looks about the same way he held up a hand in mock defense but id rather that i guess than have to swing my sword at every magic mosquito that came along im a man of steel against steel we have lord rahl to be the magic against the magic im relieved we have lord rahls grandfather the first wizard to aid us too thank you zedd anything you need is yours just ask verna and warren added silent nods as the general stepped to the entrance of the tent when zedd spoke general reibisch turned back gripping the flap in one hand youre still sending messengers to richard the general confirmed that they were captain meiffert was up there too he might be able tell you more about lord rahl have all of the messengers returned safely most of them he rubbed his bearded chin weve lost two so far one messenger was found by chance at the bottom of a rockslide another never returned but his body wasnt foundwhich wouldnt be unusual its a long and difficult journey there are any number of hazards on such a journey we have to expect we might lose a few men id like you to stop sending men up there to richard but lord rahl needs to be kept informed what if the enemy should capture one of those messengers and find out where richard is if you have no scruples most any man can eventually be made to talk the risk is not worth it the general rubbed his palm on the hilt of his sword as he considered zedds words the order is far to the south of usway down in anderith we control all the land between here and the mountains where lord rahl is staying he shook his head in resignation at zedds unflinching gaze but if you think its a concern ill not send another wont lord rahl wonder though whats going on with us whats going on with us is not really relevant to him right now he is doing as he must do and he cant allow our situation to influence him he has told you already that he wont be able to give you any orders that he must stay out of it zedd tugged his sleeves straight and sighed as he thought about it perhaps when the summer is over before the full grip of winter descends and theyre snowed in way up there ill go and see how they fare general reibisch gave a departing smile if you could talk to lord rahl it would be a relief for us all zedd he would trust your word good night then the man had just betrayed his true feelings no one in the tent really trusted what richard was doing except perhaps zedd and zedd had his doubts too kahlan had said that she believed richard viewed himself as a fallen leader these people who claimed not to understand how he could believe such a thing at the same time didnt trust his actions richard was all alone with only the strength of his beliefs to support him after the general had gone warren leaned forward eagerly zedd i could go with you to see richard we could get him to tell us everything and we could then determine if it really is a prophecy or as he says just an understanding hes come to if its not really a prophecy we might be able to make him see things differently more important we could begin teaching himor you could anywayabout his gift about using magic he needs to know how to use his ability as zedd paced verna let out a little grunt to express her misgivings about warrens suggestion i tried to teach richard to touch his han a number of sisters attempted it too no one was able to make any progress but zedd believes a wizard is the one to do it isnt that right zedd zedd halted his pacing and regarded them both a moment as he considered how to put his thoughts into words well as i said before teaching a wizard is not really the work for sorceresses but another wizard with richard i dont think you would have any better luck than we did verna railed warren didnt give ground but zedd believes zedd cleared his throat bidding silence youre right my boy it is the job of a wizard to teach another wizard born with the gift verna rose an angry finger to object but zedd went right on in this case however i believe verna is right she is warren asked i am verna asked zedd waved in a mollifying gesture yes i believe so verna i think the sisters can do some teaching after all look at warren here the sisters have managed to teach him something about using his gift even if it was at the cost of time youve taught othersif in a limited way to my view of itbut you couldnt manage to teach richard the most simple of things is that correct vernas mouth twisted with displeasure none of us could teach him the simple task of sensing his own han i sat with him hours at a time and tried to guide him through it she folded her arms and looked away from his intent gaze it just didnt work the way it should have warren touched a finger to his chin while he frowned as if recalling something you know nathan said something to me once i told him that i wanted to learn from himthat i wanted him to teach me about being a prophet nathan said that a prophet could not be made but that they were born i realized then that everything i knew and understood about prophecyreally understood about it in a whole new wayi had learned on my own and not from anyone else could this with richard be something like that is that your point zedd it is zedd sat down once more on the hard wooden bench beside adie i would love not only as his grandfather but as first wizard to teach richard what he needs to know about using his ability but im coming to doubt that such a thing is possible richard is different from any other wizard in more ways than just his having the gift for subtractive magic in addition to the usual additive but still sister philippa said you are first wizard surely you would be able to teach him a great deal zedd pulled a fold of his heavy robes from between his bony bottom and the hard bench as he considered how to explain it richard has done things even i dont understand without my training he has accomplished more than i can even fathom on his own richard reached the temple of the winds in the underworld accomplished the task of stopping a plague and returned from beyond the veil to the world of life can any of you even grasp such a thing especially for an untrained wizard he banished the chimes from the world of the livinghow i have no idea he has worked magic ive never heard of much less seen or understand im afraid my knowledge could be more of an interference than an aid part of richards ability and advantage is the way he views the worldthrough not just fresh eyes but the eyes of a seeker of truth he doesnt know something is impossible so he tries to accomplish it i fear to tell him how to do things how to use his magic because such teaching also might suggest to him limits of his powers thus creating them in reality what could i teach a war wizard i know nothing about the subtractive side of magic much less the gift of such power lacking another war wizard with subtractive magic are you suggesting it would maybe take a sister of the dark to teach him warren asked well zedd mused that might be a thought he let out a tired sigh as he turned more serious i have come to realize that it would not only be useless to try to teach richard to use his ability but it may even be dangerousto the world i would like to go see him and offer him my encouragement experience and understanding but help zedd shook his head i dont dare no one offered any objection verna for one had firsthand experience that very likely confirmed the truth of his words the rest of them probably knew richard well enough to understand much the same may i help you find a spare tent zedd verna finally asked you look like you could use some rest in the morning after you get a good nights rest and we all think this over we can talk more warren who had just been about to ask another question before verna spoke first looked disappointed but nodded in agreement zedd stretched his legs out straight as he yawned that would be best the thought of the job ahead was daunting he ached to see richard to help him especially after searching for him for so long sometimes it was hard to leave people alone when that was what they most needed that would be best he repeated i am tired summer be slipping away from us the nights be turning chilly adie said as she pressed against zedds side she looked up at him with her white eyes that in the lamplight had a soft amber cast stay with me and warm my bones old man zedd smiled as he embraced her it was as much of a comfort to be with her again as he had expected in fact at that moment if she had given him another hat with a feather he would have donned it and with a smile worry though ached through his bones like an approaching storm zedd verna said seeming to notice in his eyes the weight of his thoughts richard is a war wizard who as you say has in the past proven his remarkable ability hes a very resourceful young man besides that he is none other than the seeker himself and has the sword of truth with him for protectiona sword that i can testify he knows how to use kahlan is a confessorthe mother confessor and is experienced in the use of her power they have a mordsith with them mordsith take no chances i know zedd whispered staring off into a nightmare swirl of thoughts but i still fear greatly for them what is it that worries you so warren asked albino mosquitoes chapter panting in exhaustion kahlan had to dance backward through the snarl of hobblebush stitched through with thorny blackberry to dodge the swing of the sword the tip whistled past missing her ribs by an inch in her mad dash to escape she ignored the snag and tug of thorns on her pants she could feel her heartbeat galloping at the base of her skull as he relentlessly pressed his attack forcing her back over a low rise of ledge and through the swale beyond mounds of fallen leaves kicked aloft by his boots boiled up into the lateafternoon air like colorful thunderheads the bright yellow lustrous orange and vivid red leaves rained down over rocky outcrops swaddled in prickly whorls of juniper it was like doing battle amid a fallen rainbow richard lunged at her again kahlan gasped but blocked his sword he pressed his grim attack with implacable determination she gave ground stepping high as she did so in order to avoid tripping over the snare of roots around a huge white spruce losing her footing would be fatal if she fell richard would stab her in an instant she glanced left there loomed a tall prominence of sheer rock draped with long trailers of woolly moss to the other side the brink of the ridge ran back to eventually meet that rock wall once the level ground tapered down to that dead end the only option was going to be to climb straight up or straight down she deflected a quick thrust of his sword and he warded hers in a burst of fury she pressed a fierce assault forcing him back a dozen steps he effortlessly parried her strikes and then returned her attack in kind what she had gained was quickly lost twice over she was once again desperately defending herself and trading ground for her life on a low dead branch of a balsam fir not ten feet away a small red squirrel with his winter ear tufts already grown in plucked a leathery brown rosette of lichen growing on the bark with his white belly gloriously displayed he sat on his haunches at the end of the brokenoff deadwood his bushy tail raised up holding the crinkled piece of lichen in his tiny paws eating round and round the edges like some spectator at a tournament eating a fried bread cake while he watched the combatants clash kahlan gulped air as her eyes darted around looking for clear footing among the imposing trunks of the highland wood while at the same time watching for an opportunity that might save her if she could somehow get around richard around the menace of his sword she might be able to gain a clear escape route he would run her down but it would buy her time she dodged a quick thrust of his sword and ducked around a maple sapling into a bed of brown and yellow bracken ferns dappled by glowing sunlight richard driving forward in a sudden mad rush to end it lifted his sword to hack her it was her openingher only chance in a blink kahlan reversed her retreat and sprang ahead a step ducking under his arm she drove her sword straight into his soft middle richard covered the wound with both hands he teetered a moment and then crumpled into the bed of ferns sprawling flat on his back leaves lying lightly atop taller ferns were lifted by the disturbance they somersaulted up into the air finally drifting down to brightly decorate his body the fierce red of the maple leaves was so vibrant it would have made blood look brown by comparison kahlan stood over richard gasping to catch her breath she was spent she dropped to her knees and then threw herself across his supine body all around them fern fronds the color of caramel candy were curled into little fists as if in defiance of having to die with the season the sprinkling of lighter yellowish hayscented ferns lent a clean sweet scent to the afternoon air there were few things that could equal the fragrance of the woods in late autumn in a spectacular bit of chance a tall maple nearby sheltered as it was by a protective corner in the rock wall was not yet denuded but displayed a wide spread of leaves so orange they looked tangy against the powder blue sky above cara putting her left hand to richards chest kahlan pushed herself up on one arm to call out cara i killed richard cara not far off laying on her belly at the edge of the ridge as she watched out beyond said nothing i killed him did you hear caradid you see yes she muttered i heard you killed lord rahl no you didnt richard said still catching his breath she whacked him across the shoulder with her willowswitch sword yes i did i killed you this time killed you dead you only grazed me he pressed the point of his willow switch to her side youve fallen into my trap i have you at the point of my sword now surrender or die woman never she said still gasping for breath as she laughed id rather die than be captured by the likes of you you rogue she stabbed him repeatedly in his ribs with her willow practice sword as he giggled and rolled from side to side cara did you see i killed him this time i finally got him yes all fight cara grouched as she intently watched out beyond the ridge you killed lord rahl good for you she glanced back over her shoulder this one is mine right lord rahl you promised this one was mine yes richard said still catching his breath this one goes for yours cara good cara smiled in satisfaction its a big one richard smirked up at kahlan i let you kill me you know no you didnt i won i got you this time she whacked him again with her willow sword she paused and frowned i thought you said you werent dead you said it was only a scratch ha you admitted i got you this time richard chuckled i let you kahlan kissed him to shut him up cara saw and rolled her eyes when cara looked back over the ridge she suddenly sprang up they just left come on before something gets it cara nothing is going to get it richard said not this quickly come on you promised this one was mine i dont want to have gone through all this for nothing come on all right all right richard said as kahlan climbed off him were coming he held his hand out for kahlan to help him up she stabbed him in the ribs instead got you again lord rahl youre getting sloppy richard only smiled as kahlan finally offered her hand when he was up he hugged her in a quick gesture and before turning to follow after cara said good job mother confessor good job you killed me dead im proud of you kahlan endeavored to show him a sedate smile but she feared it came out as a giddy grin richard scooped up his pack and hefted it onto his back without delay he started the descent down the steep broken face of the mountain kahlan threw her long wolfsfur mantle around her shoulders and followed him through the deep shade of sheltering spruce at the edge of the ridge stepping on the exposed ledge rather than the low places be careful richard called out to cara already a good distance ahead of them with all the leaves covering the ground you cant see holes or gaps in the rock i know i know she grumbled how many times do you think i need to hear it richard constantly watched out for them both he had taught them how to walk in such terrain and what to be careful of from the beginning marching through the forests and mountains kahlan noted that richard moved with quiet fluidity while cara traipsed along bounding up onto and off of rocks and ledges almost like an exuberant youngster since cara had spent most of her life indoors she didnt know that it made a difference how you walked in such terrain richard had patiently explained to her pick where to put your feet in order to make your steps comparatively level dont step down to a lower spot if you dont need to only to have to step up again as you continue your climb up the trail dont step up needlessly only to have to step down again if you must step up on something you dont always need to lift your whole body just flex your legs cara complained that it was too hard to think about where to put her foot each time he told her that by walling the way she did she was actually climbing the mountain twice for each time he climbed it he admonished her to think as she walked and soon it would become instinctive and would require no conscious thought when cara found that her shin and thigh muscles didnt get as tired and sore when she followed his suggestions she became a keen student now she asked questions instead of arguing most of the time kahlan saw that as cara descended the steep trail she did as richard had taught her and used a stick as an improvised staff to probe any suspicious low area where leaves collected before stepping there this was no place to break an ankle richard said nothing but sometimes he smiled when she found a hole with her stick rather than her foot as she used to forging a new trail on a steep slope like the one they were descending was dangerous work potential trails often withered into dead ends requiring that you retrace your steps on less severe slopes hillsides and flatter ground especially animals often made good trails in a valley a suitable trail that shrank to nothing wasnt a big problem because there you could beat through the brush to more open ground making your own trail on a rocky precipice a thousand feet up was always arduous and often frustrating in such conditions particularly if the hour grew late the desire not to have to backtrack a difficult climb tempted people into taking chances richard said that it was hard work that demanded you put reason before your wish to get down get home or get to a place to camp wishing gets people killed he often said using your head gets you home cara poked her stick into a pile of leaves between bare granite rocks dont step in the leaves here she said over her shoulder as she hopped onto the far rock theres a hole why thank you cara richard said in mock gratitude as if he would have stepped there had she not warned him the cliff face they were on had a number of sizable ledges with rugged little trees and shrubs that provided good footing and the safety of a handhold below the mountainside dropped away before them into a lush ravine beyond the defile it rose up again in a steep slope covered with evergreens and the dull gray and brown skeletons of oaks maples and birches the raucous coats of autumn leaves had been resplendent while they lasted but now they were but confetti on the ground and there they faded fast usually the oaks held on to their leaves until at least early winter and some of them until spring but up in the mountains icy winds and early storms had already stripped even the oaks bare of their tenacious brown leaves cara stepped out onto a shelf of ledge jutting out over the chasm below there she said as she pointed across the way up there do you see richard shielded his eyes against the warm sunlight as he squinted higher up on the opposite slope he made a sound deep in his throat to confirm that he saw it nasty place to die kahlan snugged the warm wolf fur up against her ears to protect them from the cold wind theres a good place richard let his hand drop from his brow i guess not farther up the slope from where cara had pointed the forest ended in a place called the crooked wood above that where no trees could grow the mountain was naked rock ridges and scree a little farther up snow white as sugar sparkled in the slanting sunlight below the snow and bare rock the crooked wood was exposed to harsh winds and bitter weather causing the trees to grow in tortured shapes the crooked wood was a line of demarcation between the desolation where little more than lichen could survive the forbidding weather and the forest of trees huddled below richard gestured off to their right lets not waste any time though i dont want to be caught up here come dark kahlan looked out to where the mountain opened onto a grand vista of snowcapped peaks valleys and the undulating green of seemingly endless trackless forests a roiling blanket of thick clouds had invaded those valleys stealing in around the mountains sneaking ever closer in the distance some of the snowcapped peaks stood isolated in a cottony gray sea lower down the mountains below those dense dark clouds the weather would be miserable both richard and cara awaited kahlans word she didnt like the thought of being exposed in the crooked wood when the icy cold fog and drizzle arrived im fine lets go and get it done then we can get down lower where well be able to find a wayward pine to stay dry tonight i wouldnt mind sitting beside a hearty little fire sipping hot tea cara blew warm breath into her cupped hands that sounds good to me it was on the first day kahlan met richard more than a year before that he had taken her to a wayward pine kahlan had never known about such trees in the deep woods of westland wayward pines still held the same mystic quality for her as they did the first time she saw one silhouetted against a darkening sky taller than all the trees around it such mature trees were a friend to travelers far from any conventional shelter a big wayward pines boughs hung down to the ground all around the needles grew mostly at the outer fringe leaving the inner branches bare inside under their dense green skirts wayward pines provided excellent shelter from harsh weather something about the trees sap made them resistant to fire so if you were careful you could have a cozy campfire inside while outside it rained and stormed richard kahlan and cara often stayed in wayward pines when they were out in the mountains those nights getting warm around a small fire within the trees confines brought them all closer and gave them time to reflect to talk and to tell stories some of the stories made them laugh some brought a lump to their throats after kahlans assurance that she was up to it richard and cara nodded and started down the cliff she had recovered from her terrible wounds but they still left it up to her to decide if she was prepared for the effort of such a descent and climb and then descent again before they found a sheltered campsitehopefully in a wayward pine kahlan had been a long time in healing she had known of course that injuries such as she had suffered would take time to heal bedridden for so long her muscles had become withered weak and nearly useless for a long time it had been hard for her to eat much she became a skeleton with the realization of just how weak and helpless she had become even as she healed she had inexorably spiraled down into a state of abject depression kahlan had not comprehended completely the punishing effort that would be required if she was to he herself again richard and cara tried to cheer her up but their efforts seemed distant they just didnt understand what it was like her legs wasted away until they were bony sticks with knobby knees she felt not just helpless but ugly richard carved animals for her hawks foxes otters ducks and even chipmunks they seemed only a curiosity to her at the lowest point kahlan almost wished she had died along with their child her life became a tasteless gruel all she saw day after day week after week were the four walls of her sickroom the pain was exhausting and the monotony numbing she came to hate the bitter yarrow tea they made her drink and the smell of the poultice made of tall cinquefoil and yarrow when after a time she resisted drinking yarrow they would sometimes switch to linden which wasnt so bitter but didnt work as well yet it did help her sleep skullcap often helped when her head hurt though it was so astringent it make her mouth pucker for a long time after sometimes they switched to a tincture of feverfew to help ease her pain kahlan came to hate taking herbs and would often say she didnt hurt when she did just to avoid some horrid concoction richard hadnt made the window in the bedroom very big in the summer heat the room was often sweltering kahlan could see only a bit of the sky outside her window the tops of some trees and the jagged bluegray shape of a mountain in the distance richard wanted to take her outside but kahlan begged him not to try because she didnt think it would be worth the pain it didnt take much convincing for him to be talked out of hurting her every kind of day from sunny and bright to gray and gloomy came and went lying in her little room as time slipped away while she slowly healed kahlan thought of it as her lost summer one day she was parched and richard had forgotten to fill the cup and place it where she could reach it on the simple table beside the bed when she asked for water richard came back with the cup and a full waterskin and set them both on the windowsill as he called to cara outside he rushed out telling kahlan as he went that he and cara had to go check the fishing lines and they would be back as soon as they could before kahlan could ask him to put the water closer he was gone kahlan lay fuming in the silence hardly able to believe that richard had been so inconsiderate as to leave the water out of her reach it was unusually warm for late summer her tongue felt swollen she stared helplessly at the wooden cup setting in the windowsill on the verge of tears she let out a moan of selfpity and smacked her fist against the bed she rolled her head to the right away from the window and closed her eyes she decided to take a nap in order not to think about her thirst richard and cara would be back by the time she awoke and they would get the water for her and richard would get a scolding sweat trickled down her neck outside a bird kept calling its repetitious song sounded like a little girl with a high pitched voice saying who me once a who me bird started in it was a long performance kahlan could think of little else besides how much she wanted a drink she couldnt make herself fall asleep the annoying bird kept asking its question over and over again more than once she found herself whispering yes you in answer she growled a curse at richard she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to forget her thirst the heat and the bird and go to sleep her eyes kept popping open kahlan lifted her sleeping gown away from her chest ruffling it up and down to cool herself she realized she was staring at the water in the window it was out of her reachclear over on the other side of the room the room wasnt very big but still she couldnt walk richard knew better she thought that maybe if she could sit up and move to the bottom of the bed she might be able to reach the cup with an illtempered huff she threw the light cover off her bony legs she hated seeing them why was richard being so inconsiderate what was the matter with him she intended to give him a piece of her mind when he got back she eased her legs over the side of the bed the mattress was a pliable woven mat stuffed with grasses and feathers and tow padding it was quite comfortable and kahlan was pleased with her snug bed with a great effort she pushed herself up for a long time she sat on the edge of the bed holding her head in her hands as she caught her breath her whole body throbbed in pain it was the first time she had sat up all by herself she understood very well what richard was doing still she didnt appreciate his way of forcing her to get up it was cruel she wasnt ready she was still badly hurt she needed to rest in bed in order to recover her oozing wounds had finally closed up and healed over but she was sure she was still too injured to be getting up she feared to test broken bones accompanied by a lot of groaning and grunting she worked herself to the bottom of the bed sitting there one hand holding the footboard to steady herself she was still too far from the window to reach the water she was going to have to stand she paused for a while to have dark thoughts about her husband after a day many weeks before when she had called for a long time and richard hadnt heard her weak voice he had left a light pole beside her so she would be able to use it to reach out and knock on the wall or door if she was in urgent need of their help now kahlan worked her fingers around the pole lying alongside her bed and lifted it upright she planted the thicker end on the ground and leaned on the pole for support as she carefully slid off the bed her feet touched the cool dirt floor putting weight on her legs made her gasp in pain she half stood half leaned on the bed prepared to cry out but realized she was gasping more at the brutal pain she expected than from the actual pain it did hurt but she realized it wasnt too much to endure she was a bit disgruntled to learn it wasnt nearly as bad as it had been she had been planning on reducing richard to tears with the torturous suffering he had so cavalierly forced upon her she put more weight on her feet and pulled herself up with the aid of the pole finally she stood in wobbling triumph she was actually on her feet and she had done it by herself kahlan couldnt seem to make her legs walk the way she wanted them to in order to get to the water she was going to have to make them do her biddingat least until she reached the window then she could collapse to the floor where richard would find her she luxuriated in her mental picture of it he wouldnt think his plan to get her out of bed so clever then with the aid of the stout pole for support and her tongue poked out the corner of her mouth for balance she slowly shuffled to the window kahlan told herself that if she fell she was going to lie there in a heap on the floor without any water until richard came back and found her moaning through cracked lips dying of thirst he would be sorry he had ever tried such a pitiless trick he would feel guilty for the rest of his life for what he had done to hershe would see to it almost wishing every difficult step of the way that she would fall she finally made it to the window kahlan threw an arm over the sill for support and closed her eyes as she panted in little breaths so as not to hurt her ribs when she had her wind back she drew herself up to the window she snatched the cup and gulped down the water kahlan plunked the empty cup down on the sill and peered out as she caught her breath again richard was sitting on the ground just outside his arms hooked around his knees his hands clasped hi there he said with a smile cara sitting right beside him gazed up without emotion i see youre up kahlan wanted to yell at him but instead she found herself trying with all her might not to laugh she felt suddenly and overwhelmingly foolish for not trying sooner to get up on her own tears stung her eyes as she looked out at the expanse of trees the vibrant colors the majestic mountains and the huge sweep of blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds marching off into the distance the size of the mountains their imposing slopes their luscious color was beyond anything she had ever encountered before how could she possibly not have wanted more than anything to get up and see the world around her you know of course that youve made a big mistake richard said what do you mean kahlan asked well had you not gotten up wed have kept waiting on youat least for a time now that youve shown us that you can get up and move on your own were only going to keep doing thisputting things out of your reach to make you start moving about and helping yourself while she silently thanked him she was unwilling just yet to tell him out loud how right he had been but inside she loved him all the more for braving her anger to help her cara turned to richard should we show her where she can find the table richard shrugged if she gets hungry shell come out of the bedroom and find it kahlan threw the cup at him hoping to wipe the smirk off his face he caught the cup well glad to see your arm works he said you can cut your own bread when she started to protest he said its only fair cara baked it the least you can do is to cut it kahlans mouth fell open cara baked bread lord rahl taught me cara said i wanted bread with my stew real bread and he told me that if i wanted bread i would have to learn to make it it was easy really a little like walking to the window but i was much more goodnatured about it and didnt throw anything at him kahlan could not help smiling knowing it must have been harder for cara to knead dough than for kahlan to get up and walk she somehow doubted that cara had been goodnatured about it kahlan would like to have seen that battle of wills give me back my cup and then go catch some fish for dinner im hungry i want a trout a big trout along with bread richard smiled i can do that if you can find the table kahlan did find the table she never ate in bed again at first the pain of walking was sometimes more than she could tolerate and she took refuge in her bed cara would come in and brush her hair just so kahlan wouldnt be alone she had no power in her muscles and could hardly move by herself brushing her own hair was a colossal task just getting to the table was exhausting and all she could accomplish at first richard and cara were sympathetic and continually encouraged her but they pushed her too kahlan was joyous to be out of the bed and that helped her to ignore the pain the world was again a wondrous place she was more than joyous to be able at last to go out to the privy while she never said so kahlan was sure cara was happy about that too as much as she liked the snug home going outside felt like finally being freed from a dungeon before richard had frequently offered to take her outside for the day but she had never wanted to leave her bed fearing the pain she realized that because she was so sick her thinking had slowly become dull and foggy along with her summer she had for a time lost herself now at long last she felt clearheaded she discovered that the view outside her window was the least impressive of the surrounding sights snowcapped peaks towered around the small house richard and cara had built in the lap of breathtaking mountains the simple house with a bedroom at either end one for richard and kahlan and one for cara with a common room in the middle sat at the edge of a meadow of velvety green grasses sprinkled with wildflowers even though it was late in the season when they had arrived richard managed to start a small garden in a sunny place outside caras window growing fresh greens for the table and some herbs to add flavor to their cooking right behind the house huge old white pines towered over them sheltering them from the full force of the wind richard had continued his carving to pass the time as he sat by kahlans bed talking and telling stories but after she had at last gotten out of bed his carvings changed instead of animals richard began sculpting people and then one day he surprised her with his most magnificent carving yet in celebration he said of her getting well enough to finally come out into the world astonished by the utter realism and power of the small statue she whispered that it could only be the gift that had guided his hand in carving it richard regarded such talk as nonsense people without the gift carve beautiful statues all the time he said theres no magic involved she knew though that some artists were gifted and able to invoke magic through their art richard occasionally spoke wistfully about the works of art hed seen at the peoples palace in dhara where he had been held captive growing up in hart land he had never before seen statues carved in marble and certainly none carved on such a grand scale or by such talented hands those works had in some ways opened his eyes to the greater world around him and had made a lasting impression on him who else but richard would remember fondly the beauty he saw while held captive and being tortured it was true that art could exist independent of magic but richard had been taken captive in the first place only with the aid of a spell brought to life through art art was a universal language and thus an invaluable tool for implementing magic kahlan finally stopped arguing with him about whether the gift helped him to carve he simply didnt believe it she felt though that having no other outlet his gift must be expressing itself in this way magic always seemed to find a way to seep out and his carvings of people certainly did seem magical to her but the figure of the woman that he carved for her as a gift stirred profound emotion within her he called it an image nearly two feet tall carved from buttery smooth rich aromatic walnut spirit the feminity of her body its exquisite shape and curves bones and muscle were clearly evident beneath her flowing robes she looked alive how richard had accomplished such a feat kahlan couldnt even imagine he had conveyed through the woman her robes flowing in a wind as she stood with her head thrown back her chest out her hands fisted at her sides her back arched and strong as if in opposition to an invisible power trying unsuccessfully to subdue her a sense of spirit the statue was obviously not intended to look like kahlan yet it evoked in her some visceral response a tension that was startlingly familiar something about the woman in the carving some quality it conveyed made kahlan hunger to be well to be fully alive to be strong and independent again if this wasnt magic she didnt know what was kahlan had been around grand palaces her whole life exposed to any number of pieces of great art by renowned artists but none had ever taken her breath with its thrust of inner vision its sense of individual nobility as did this proud vibrant woman in flowing robes the strength and vitality of it brought a lump to kahlans throat and she could only throw her arms around richards neck in speechless emotion chapter now kahlan went outside at every opportunity she placed the carving of spirit on the windowsill so she could see it not only from bed but also when she was outdoors she turned the statue so that it always faced outside she felt it should always be facing the world the woods around the house were mysterious and alluring intriguing trails went off into the shadowy distance and she could just detect light off at the end of the gently curving tunnel through the trees she ached to explore those narrow tracks animal trails enlarged by richard and cara on their short treks to tend fishing lines and forays in search of nuts and berries kahlan with the aid of a staff hobbled around the house and the meadow to strengthen her legs she wanted to go with richard on those treks through the filtered sunlight and gentle breezes over the open patches of ledge and under the arched enclosing limbs of huge oaks one of the first places richard took her when she insisted she could walk for a short distance was through that tunnel in the thick dark wood to the patch of light at the other end where a brook descended a rocky gorge the brook was sheltered on the hillside above them by a dense stand of trees an enormous weight of water continuously plunged over that stepped tumble of rocks surging around boulders and pouring in glassy sheets over ledges many of the bearsized rocks sitting in the shady pools were flocked in a dark green velvet of moss and sprinkled with long tawny needles from the white pines that favored the rock slope flecks of sunlight winking through the dense canopy shimmered in the clear pools at the bottom of that gorge in that sunny mountain glen off behind their house where the trail emerged from the woods the brook broadened and slowed as it meandered through the expansive valley surrounded by the awesome jut of the mountains sometimes kahlan would dangle her bony legs over a bank and let the cool water caress her feet there she could sit on the warm grass and soak up the sun while watching fish swim through the crystalclear water flowing over gravel beds richard had been right when he told her that trout liked beautiful places she loved watching the fish frogs crayfish and even the salamanders oftentimes she would lie on her stomach on the low grassy bank with her chin resting on the backs of her hands and watch for hours as the fish came out from under sunken logs from beneath rocks or from the dark depths of the larger pools to snatch a bug from the surface of the water kahlan caught crickets grasshoppers and grubs and periodically tossed them in for the fish richard laughed when she talked to the fish encouraging them to come up out of their dark holes for a tasty bug sometimes a graceful gray heron would stand on its thin legs in the shallow marshes not far away and occasionally spear a fish or a frog with its daggerlike bill kahlan could not recall in the whole of her life ever being in a place with such a vibrancy of life to it surrounded by such majesty richard teased her telling her she hadnt seen anything yet making her curious and ever eager to get stronger so she could explore new sights she felt like a little girl in a magical kingdom that was theirs and theirs alone having grown up a confessor kahlan had never spent much time outdoors watching animals or water tumbling down over rocks or clouds or sunsets she had seen a great many magnificent things but they were in the context of travel cities buildings and people she had never lingered in one place in the countryside to really soak it all in still the thoughts in the back of her mind hounded her she knew that she and richard were needed elsewhere they had responsibilities richard casually deflected the subject whenever she broached it he had already explained his reasoning and believed he was doing what was right they hadnt been visited by messengers for a very long time that worry played on her mind too but richard said that he couldnt allow himself to influence the army so it was just as well that general reibisch had stopped sending reports besides he said it only needlessly endangered the messengers who made the journey for the time being kahlan knew she needed to get better and her isolated mountain life was making her stronger by the day probably as nothing else could once they returned to the waronce she convinced him that they must returnthis peaceful life would be but a cherished memory she resolved to enjoy what she couldnt change while it lasted once when it had been raining for a few days and kahlan was missing going out to the brook to watch the fish richard did the most unheardof thing he started bringing her fish in ajar live fish fish just for watching after hed cleaned an empty lampoil jug and several widemouthed glass jars that had held preserves herbs and unguents for her injuries along with other supplies he had purchased on their journey away from anderith he put some gravel in the bottom and filled them with water from the stream he then caught some blacknose dace minnows and put them in the glass containers they were yellowish olive on top speckled with black with white bottoms and a thick black line down each side he even provided them with a bit of weed from the brook so they could have a place to hide and feel safe kahlan was astonished when richard brought home the first jar of live fish she set the jarseventually four jars and one jug in allon the windowsill in the main room beside several of richards smaller carvings richard kahlan and cara sat at the small wooden table when they ate and watched the marvel of fish living in ajar just dont name them richard said because eventually theyre going to die what she had at first thought was an entirely daft idea became a center of fascination for her even cara who cited fishinajar as lunacy took a liking to the little fish it seemed that every day with richard in the mountains held some new marvel to turn her mind away from her own pains and troubles after the fish became accustomed to people they went about their little lives as if living in ajar were perfectly natural from time to time richard would pour out part of their water and add fresh water from the brook kahlan and cara fed the little fish crumbs of bread or tiny scraps from dinner along with small bugs the fish ate eagerly and spent most of their time pecking at the gravel on the bottom or swimming about looking out at the world after a while the fish learned when it was lunchtime they would wiggle eagerly on the other side of the glass whenever anyone approached like puppies happy to see their masters the main room had a small fireplace richard had built with clay from stream banks hed formed into bricks and dried in the sun and then cooked in a fire they had the table hed made and chairs constructed of branches intertwined and lashed together hed woven the chair bottoms and backs from leathery inner bark in the corner of the room was a wooden door over a deep root cellar against the back wall were simple shelves and a big cupboard full of supplies theyd bought a lot of supplies along the way and carried them either in the carriage with kahlan or strapped on the back and sides for the last part of the journey richard and cara had lugged everything in since the carriage couldnt make it over narrow mountain passes where there were no roads richard had blazed the trail in cara had her own room opposite theirs once up and about kahlan was surprised to find that cara had a collection of rocks cara bristled at the term collection and asserted that they were there as defensive weapons should they be attacked and trapped in the house kahlan found the rocksall different colorssuspiciously pretty cara insisted they were deadly while kahlan had been bedridden richard had slept on a pallet in the main room or sometimes outside under the stars a number of times at first when she was in so much pain kahlan had awakened to see him sitting on the floor beside her bed dozing as he leaned against the wall always ready to jump up if she needed anything or to offer her medicines and herb teas he hadnt wanted to sleep in bed with her for fear of it hurting her she almost would have been willing to endure it for the comfort of his presence beside her finally though after she was up and about he was at last able to lie beside her that first night with him in bed she had held his big warm hand to her belly as she gazed at spirit silhouetted in the moonlight listening to the night calls of birds bugs and the songs of the wolves until her eyes closed and she drifted into a peaceful slumber it was on the next day that richard first killed her they were at the stream checking the fishing lines when he cut two straight willow switches he tossed one on the ground beside where she sat and told her it was her sword he seemed in a playful mood and told her to defend herself feeling playful herself kahlan took up the challenge by suddenly trying to stab him just to put him in his place he stabbed her first and declared her dead she fought him again more earnestly the second time and he quickly dispatched her with a convincingly feigned beheading by the third time she went after him she was a little irked she put all her effort into her assault but he smoothly thwarted her attack and then pressed the tip of his willowswitch sword between her breasts he announced her dead for a third time out of three thereafter it became a game kahlan wanted to win richard never let her win not even just to be nice when she was feeling low because of her slow progress at getting stronger he repeatedly humbled her in front of cara kahlan knew he was doing it to make her push herself to use her muscles to forget her aches to stretch and strengthen her body kahlan just wanted to win they each carried their willowswitch swords sheathed behind a belt always at the ready every day she would attack him or he would attack her and the fight was on at first she was no challenge to him and he made it clear she was no challenge that of course only made her determined to show him that she was no novice that it was not so much a battle of strength but of leverage advantage and swiftness he encouraged her but never gave her false praise as the weeks passed she slowly began making him work for his kills kahlan had been taught to use a sword by her father king wyborn at least he had been king before kahlans mother took him for her mate king was an insignificant title to a confessor king wyborn of galea had had two children with his queen and first wife so kahlan had both an older half sister and a half brother kahlan wanted very much to make a good show of her training under her father it was frustrating to know she was far better with a weapon than she was showing richard it wasnt so much that she didnt know what to do but that she simply couldnt do it her muscles were not yet strong enough nor would they respond nearly quickly enough something about it though was still unsettling richard fought in a way kahlan had never encountered in her training or in the real combat she had seen she couldnt define or analyze the difference but she could feel it and she didnt know what to do to counter it in the beginning richard and kahlan had most of their battles in the meadow outside their house so that kahlan wouldnt be as likely to trip over something and if she did not as likely to hit her head on anything granite cara was their everpresent audience as time passed the battles lasted longer and grew more strenuous they became furious and exhausting a couple of times kahlan had been so upset by richards relentless attitude toward their sword fights that she didnt speak to him for hours afterward lest she let slip words she didnt really mean and which she knew she would regret richard would then sometimes tell her save your anger for the enemy here it will do you no good there it can overcome fear use this time now to teach your sword what to do so later it will do it without conscious thought kahlan well knew that an enemy was never kind if richard gave in to kindnessawarded her false prideit could only serve her ill as aggravating as such lessons sometimes were it was impossible to remain angry with richard for very long especially because she knew she was really only angry with herself kahlan had been around weapons and men who used them all her life a few of the better ones in addition to her father were on occasion her teachers none of them had fought like richard richard made fighting with a blade look like art he gave beauty to the act of dealing death there was something about it though tickling at her something she knew she still wasnt grasping richard had told her once before she had been hurt that he had come to believe that magic itself could be an art form she had told him she thought that was crazy now she didnt know from the bits of the story shed heard she suspected that richard had used magic in something of that way to defeat the chimes he had created a solution where it had never before existed or even been imagined one day in one of their fierce sword fights she had been positive she had him dead to rights and that she was delivering the stroke of victory he effortlessly evaded what she had been sure was her killing strike and killed her instead he made what had seemed impossible look natural it was in that instant that the whole concept came clear for her she had been looking at it all wrong it wasnt that richard could fight well with a sword or that he could create beautiful statues with a knife and chisel it was that richard was one with the bladethe blade in any form sword knife chisel or willow switch he was a masternot of sword fighting or carving as such but in the most fundamental way of the blade itself fighting was but one use of a blade his balance for using his sword to destroy magic always sought balancewas using a blade to carve things of beauty she had been looking at the individual parts of what he did trying to understand them separately richard saw only one unified whole everything about him the way he shot an arrow the way he carved the way he used a sword even the way he walked with such fluid reasoned intentthey werent separate things separate abilities they were all the same thing richard paused whats the matter your face is turning white kahlan stood with her willow sword lowered youre dancing with death thats what youre doing with your sword richard blinked at her as if she had just announced that rain was wet but of course richard touched the amulet hanging at his chest in the center surrounded by a complex of gold and silver lines was a teardropshaped ruby as big as her thumbnail i told you that a long time ago are you just now coming to believe me she stood gaping yes i think i am kahlan recalled all too clearly his chilling words to her when she had first seen the amulet around his neck and she had asked him what it was the ruby is meant to represent a drop of blood it is the symbolic representation of the way of the primary edict it means only one thing and everything cut once committed to fight cut everything else is secondary cut that is your duty your purpose your hunger there is no rule more important no commitment that overrides that one cut the lines are a portrayal of the dance cut from the void not from bewilderment cut the enemy as quickly and directly as possible cut with certainty cut decisively resolutely cut into his strength flow through the gaps in his guard cut him cut him down utterly dont allow him a breath crush him cut him without mercy to the depths of his spirit it is the balance to life death it is the dance with death it is the law a war wizard lives by or he dies the dance was art it was no different really from carving art expressed through a blade it was all one and the same to him he saw no distinction for within him there was none they shared the meadow with a red fox who hunted it for rodents mostly but wasnt averse to chewing on whatever juicy bugs she could catch there their horses didnt mind the fox so much but they didnt like the coyotes that sometimes visited kahlan rarely saw them but she knew they were about when the horses snorted their displeasure she often heard the coyotes barking at night higher up in the surrounding slopes they would let out long flat howls followed by a series of yips some nights the wolves sang their long monotone howls without the yapping of the coyotes echoing through the mountains once kahlan saw a black bear off in the trees ambling along giving them only a passing look and once a bobcat passed near their house sending the horses off in a panic it took richard the better part of a day to find the horses chipmunks begged at their door and regularly invited themselves into the house for a look around kahlan often caught herself talking to them and asking questions as if they could understand her every word the way they paused and cocked their heads at her made her suspect they really could in the early mornings small herds of deer often visited the meadow some leaving fresh inverted heartshaped tracks near the door as they passed lately aggressive bucks in rut bearing huge racks had been showing up one of the hides kahlan wore was from a wolf injured by one of those bucks up in an oak grove not far away richard had spared the wounded animal a lingering suffering death beside the sword fights they went on marches up into the mountains to help kahlan strengthen her limbs those walks were taxing on her leg muscles sometimes leaving her so sore she couldnt sleep richard would rub oil into her feet calves and thighs when they hurt too much for her to sleep that usually worked relaxing her and making her drowsy and able to fall asleep she distinctly remembered the rainy night after walking home in the wet and cold when she lay on her back in bed eyes shut as richard rubbed warm oil into her leg muscles he whispered that her legs finally seemed to have gotten back all their tone and shape kahlan looked up and saw desire in his eyes it was an almost forgotten thrill to know his hunger for her she had been so startled that she felt tears trickle down her cheeks with the joy of suddenly feeling like a woman againa desirable woman richard raised her leg to his mouth and gently kissed her bare ankle by the time his soft warm kisses reached her thighs she was panting with suddenly and unexpectedly awakened desire he laid open her nightshirt and rubbed the warm oil on her exposed belly his big hands moved up her body to caress her breasts he breathed through his mouth as he rolled her nipples until they were hard between his finger and thumb why lord rahl she said in a breathy whisper i do believe you are going to get carried away he paused seeming to check himself and what he was doing and then pulled back i wont break richard she said as she caught his hand and pulled it back im all right now id like it if you got carried away she clutched his hair in her fists as his kisses covered her breasts and then her shoulders and then worked up her neck his panting warmed her ear his exploring fingers made her frantic with need his body against hers felt wildly erotic she no longer felt weary finally he tenderly kissed her lips she let him know by the way she returned the kiss that he neednt be all that tender as the rain drummed on the roof as lightning lit the lines and the clenchedfist strength of the statue in the window and thunder rumbled through the mountains kahlan without fearing it without worrying about it without wondering if she would be able held richard tightly as they made quiet gentle fierce love they had never needed each other as much as that night all her fears and worries evaporated in the heat of overpowering need welling up through her she wept with the strength of her pleasure and the release of her emotions when later richard lay in her arms she felt a tear roll off his face and she asked him if something was wrong he shook his head and said distantly that he had for so long feared losing her that sometimes he had believed he might go mad it seemed as if he could finally allow himself release from his private terror the pain kahlan had first seen in his eyes when she couldnt remember his name was at last banished their marches into the mountains ranged farther and farther sometimes they took packs and spent the night in the woods often in a wayward pine when they could find one the rugged terrain offered a neverending variety of vistas in places sheer rock cliffs towered over them in other places they stood at the brink of sheer drops and watched the sun turn the sky orange and purple as it went down while wispy clouds drifted through quiet green valleys below they went to towering waterfalls with their own rainbows there were clear sunlit pools up in the mountains where they swam they ate on rocks overlooking rugged sights no one but they ever saw they followed animal trails through vast woods of gnarled trees and others among the dark forest floor where grew trees with trunks like huge brown columns so big twenty men couldnt have joined hands around them richard had kahlan practice with a bow to help strengthen her arms they hunted small game for stews or for roasting some they smoked and dried along with the fish they caught richard usually didnt eat meat but occasionally he did not eating meat was part of the balance needed by his gift for when he was forced to kill that need of balance was lessening because he wasnt killing he was at peace perhaps the balance was now being served by his carving as time passed he was able to eat more meat when they were out on journeys they usually ate rice and beans along with bannock and any berries they collected along the way in addition to game they caught kahlan helped clean fish and salt them down and smoke yet others for their winter stores it was a job that she had never before undertaken they collected berries nuts and wild apples and put a lot of those away in the root cellar along with root crops he had purchased before coming up into the mountains richard dug up small apple trees when he found any and planted them in the meadow by the house so that he said someday they would have apples close at hand kahlan wondered how long he intended to keep them away from where they were needed the silent question always hung there seen by all but unspoken cara never asked him but she sometimes made some small mention of it to kahlan when they were alone she was lord rahls guard and glad to be close at hand so she generally offered no objection he was after all lord rahl and he was safe kahlan had always felt the weight of their responsibilities like the towering mountains all around looming over them always shadowing them that responsibility could never be completely forgotten as much as she loved the house richard had built on the edge of the meadow and as much as she loved exploring the rugged beautiful imposing and everchanging mountains with each passing day she more and more felt that weight and the anxious need to be back where they were needed most she fretted at what could be going on that they werent aware of the imperial order was not going to stay put an army that size liked to move soldiers especially soldiers of that ilk became restless in long encampments and sooner or later started causing trouble she worried about all the people who needed the reassurance of richards presence his guidanceand hers there were people who their whole lives had depended on the mother confessor always being there to stand up for them with winter coming on richard had made kahlan a warm mantle mostly out of wolf fur the other two pelts were coyotes richard had found one of the coyotes with a broken leg probably from a fall and had put it out of its misery the other had been a rogue chased off by the local pack it had taken to raiding food from their little smokehouse richard had taken the sly looter with a single arrow they had collected most of the wolf pelts from injured or old animals richard kahlan and cara often tracked wolf packs as a way of helping to build kahlans strength kahlan came to recognize their tracks and even learned to know at a glance if the prints were in mud or soft dirt their front paws from the rear richard showed her how the toes of the front spread out more with a more welldefined heel pad than the rear paw he had located several packs in the mountains and the three of them often followed one group or family to see if they could do so without the wolves knowing richard said it was a kind of game guides used to play to keep in practiceto keep their senses sharp after kahlans mantle was completed they had turned to collecting pelts for caras winter fur cara who always wore the clothes of her profession had liked the idea of lord rahl making something for her to wearthe same as he had made for kahlan while she had never said as much kahlan had always felt that cara saw the mantle he was making for her as a mark of his feelings his respectproof that she was more than just his bodyguard this had been a journey to find pelts for caras mantle and she had been eager she had even cooked for them now coming down off the ridge where kahlan had finally bested richard in a sword fight kahlan was in a good mood for the last two days they had been following the wolf pack up in the mountains to the west of their house it was not simply a hunt and not simply to get a pelt for cara but part of the neverending pressure richard put on kahlan to keep up almost every day for the last two months richard had her marching over the most difficult terrain the kind of terrain that made her strain every muscle in her body as kahlan had gotten stronger the marches had gotten longer at first they were only across the house now they were across mountains on top of that he frequently attacked her with his willow sword and poked fun at her if she didnt put in her absolute hardest fight in a way finally beating richard in one of their mock sword fights puzzled her he might have been tired from carrying the heaviest pack and scouting some of the steeper trails by himself first and then coming back for them but he hadnt slacked off and she had still killed him she couldnt help but be pleased with herself even if she did question her victory out of the corner of her eye she had caught him smiling as he looked at her kahlan knew richard was proud of her for besting him in a way his losing was a victory for him kahlan thought that she must be stronger now after all richard had put her through than at any time in her life it had not been easy but it had been worth at last feeling like the carving in the window of her bedroom kahlan put a hand on richards shoulder as he followed cara down broken granite blocks placed by chance like big irregular steps richard how did i beat you he saw in her eyes the seriousness of the question you killed me because i made a mistake a mistake you mean perhaps you had gotten too confident perhaps you were just tired or were thinking of something else doesnt really matter does it whatever it was it was a mistake that cost me my life in the game in a real fight i would have died youve taught me a valuable lesson to redouble my resolve to always put in my absolute full effort it just goes to remind me though that i could make a mistake at any time and lose kahlan couldnt help but to be struck by the obvious question was he making a mistake in staying out of the effort to keep the midlands free from the tyranny of the imperial order she couldnt help feeling the pull to help her people even though richard still felt that if the people didnt want his leadership his efforts could do no good as mother confessor kahlan knew that while people didnt always understand that what a leader did was done in their best interest that was no reason to abandon them with winter coming on she hoped the imperial order would choose to stay put in anderith kahlan needed to convince richard to return to help the midlands but she was at a loss to know how he was firm in his reasoning and she could find no chink in the armor of his logic emotion did not sway him in this cara led them down the craggy precipice having to backtrack only twice it was a difficult descent cara was pleased with herself and that richard had let her pick the route it was her pelt they were going after so he let her lead them across the tangle of undergrowth in the ravine at the bottom and then up the following lip of the notch where trees clung with roots like talons to the rocky rise the wind coming up the ravine had turned bitter the clouds had thickened until they snuffed out the golden rays of sunlight their ascent took them up into a gloomy dark wood of towering evergreens far over their heads the treetops swayed in the wind but down on the ground it was still their footfalls were hushed by a thick spongy mat of brown needles the climb was steep but not arduous as they ascended the big trees grew farther and farther apart the boughs became scraggly allowing more of the somber light to seep in for the most part the rocks higher up were bare of moss and leaves in places they had to use handholds on the rock or else roots to help them climb kahlan pulled deep breaths of the cold air it felt good to test her muscles they came out of the forest into the steelgray light of late afternoon and the moaning voice of the wind they were in the crooked wood the scree and rock were naked of the thick moss common lower down the mountain but they bore yellowgreen splotches of lichen outlined in black only a bit of scraggly brush clung to the low places here and there but it was the trees that were the most odd and gave the place at the top of the tree line its name they were all stuntedfew taller than kahlan or richard most of the branches grew to one side because of the prevailing winds leaving the trees looking like grotesque running skeletons frozen in torment above the crooked wood few things other than sedges and lichens grew above that the snowcap held sway here it is cara said they found the wolf sprawled on the scree beside a low boulder with a dark stain of dried blood at the sharp edge up higher the pack of gray wolves had been trying to take down a woodland caribou the old bull had grazed the unlucky wolf with a kick that in itself would likely not have been anything more than painful but the wolf had slipped from the higher ledge and fallen to its death kahlan ran her fingers through the thick yellowgray coat tipped in black it was in good condition and would be a warm addition to caras winter mantle richard and cara started skinning the goodsized female animal as kahlan went out to the edge of an overhang she drew her own mantle up around her ears as she stood in the bitter wind surveying the approaching clouds she was somewhat startled by what she saw richard its not drizzle coming our way kahlan said its snow he looked up from his bloody work do you see any wayward pines down in the valley she squinted down to the valley floor spread out before her yes i see a couple the snow is still a ways off if youre not long at that we can probably make it down there and collect some wood before it gets wet were almost done cara said richard stood to have a quick look for himself with a bloody hand he absently fifted his real sword a few inches and then let it drop back a habit he had of checking to make sure the weapon was clear in its scabbard it was an unsettling gesture he had not drawn the weapon from its hilt since the day he had been forced to kill all those men who had attacked them back near hartland is something wrong what richard saw where her eyes were looking and glanced down at the sword on his hip oh no nothing just habit i guess kahlan pointed theres a wayward pine there its the closest and goodsized too richard wiped the back of his wrist across his brow swiping his hair away from his eyes his fingers glistened with blood well be down there sheltered by a wayward pine sitting beside a cozy fire having tea before dark i can stretch the hide on the branches inside and scrape it there the snow will help insulate us inside the trees boughs well have a good rest before heading back in the morning down a little lower it will only be rain kahlan snuggled her cheek inside her wolf fur as a shiver tingled through her shoulders and up the back of her neck winter had snuck up on them chapter when they arrived home two days later the little fish in the jars were all dead they had used the same easier route over the pass that they had originally used to enter the valley when they had first come in with the horses months before of course kahlan didnt recall that trip she had been unconscious it seemed a lifetime ago there was now a shorter trail to their home one they had blazed down from the pass they could have used that alternative route but it was narrow and difficult and would have saved them only ten or fifteen minutes they had been out for days and as they had wearily stood in the windswept notch at the top of the pass looking down at their cozy home far below at the edge of the meadow they had decided to take the easier passage even though it took a little longer it had been a relief to finally get inside the house out of the wind and drop all their gear as richard brought in firewood and cara fetched water kahlan pulled out a little square of cloth with some small bugs shed caught earlier that day intending to give her fish a treat since they were sure to be hungry she let out a little groan when she saw that they were dead whats the matter cara asked as she walked in lugging a full bucket she came over to see the fish looks like they starved kahlan told her little fish like that dont often live long in a jar richard said as he knelt and started stacking birch logs atop kindling in the fireplace but they did live a long time kahlan said as if to prove him wrong and somehow talk him out of it you didnt name them did you i told you not to name them because they would die after a time i warned you not to let yourself get emotionally attached when it can only come to no good end cara named one did not cara protested i was just trying to show you which one i was talking about thats all after the flames took from his flint richard looked up and smiled well ill get you some more kahlan yawned but these were the best ones they needed me richard snorted a laugh youve got quite the imagination they only depended on us because we artificially altered their lives just like the chipmunks would stop hunting seeds for their winter stores if we gave them handouts all the time of course the fish had no choice because we kept them in jars left to their own initiative the fish wouldnt need any help from us after all it took a net to catch them ill catch you some more and theyll come to need you just as much two days later on a thinly overcast day after theyd had a big lunch of thick rabbit stew with turnips and onions along with bread cara had made richard went off to check the fishing lines and to catch some more of the blacknose dace minnows after hed left cara picked up their spoons and put them in the bucket of wash water on the counter you know she said looking back over her shoulder i like it here i really do but its starting to make me jumpy kahlan scraped the plates off into a wooden bowl with the cooking leavings for the midden heap jumpy she brought the plates to the counter what do you mean mother confessor this place is nice enough but its starting to make me go daft i am mordsith dear spirits im starting to name fish in jars cara turned back to the bucket and bent to cleaning the spoons with a washcloth dont you think its about time we convinced lord rahl that we need to get back kahlan sighed she loved their home in the mountains and she loved the quiet and solitude most of all she treasured the time she and richard were able to spend together without other people making demands of them but she also missed the activity of aydindril the company of people and the sights of cities and crowds there was a lot not to like about being in places like that but there was an excitement about it too shed had a lifetime to become used to the way people didnt always want or understand her help and forging ahead anyway because she knew it was in their best interest richard never had to learn to face that cold indifference and go about his duty despite it of course i do cara kahlan placed the bowl of scraps on a shelf reminding herself to empty it later she wondered if she was to be a mother confessor who forever lived in the woods away from her people a people struggling for their liberty but you know how richard feels he thinks it would be wrongmore than that he thinks it would be irresponsible to give in to such a wish when reason tells him he must not caras blue eyes flashed with determination you are the mother confessor break the spell of this place tell him that you are needed back there and that you are going to return whats he going to do tie you to a tree if you leave he will follow he will have to return then kahlan shook her head emphatically no i cant do that not after what hes told us thats not the kind of thing you do to a person you respect i may not exactly agree with him but i understand his reasons and know him well enough to dread that hes right but going back doesnt mean he would have to lead our side you would only be making him follow you back not making him return to leadership cara smirked but maybe when he sees how much he is needed he will come to his senses thats part of the reason hes brought us so far out in the mountains he fears that if hes near the struggle or if he goes back he will see all thats happening and be drawn in i cant use his feelings for me to force him into such a corner even if we did go back and he resisted the temptation to help people fighting for their lives and wasnt drawn into the struggle against the brutality of the imperial order such an overt act of coercion on my part would create an enduring rift between us kahlan shook her head again this is something he believes too strongly i wont force him into returning cara gestured with the dripping washcloth maybe he doesnt really believe it not really not deep down inside maybe he doesnt want to go back because he doubts himselfover the anderith thingand so he thinks its just easier for him to stay away i dont believe richard doubts himself in this not in this not for a second not one tiny little bit i think that if he had any doubt whatsoever he would return because that is really the easier path staying away is harderas you and i can attest but you can leave at any time cara if you feel so strongly about going back he has no claim on your life you dont have to stay here if you dont wish to i am sworn to follow him no matter what foolish thing he does foolish you follow him because you believe in him so do i thats why i could never walk away forcing him to follow cara pressed her lips tight her blue eyes lost their fire as she turned away and flopped the cloth back into the bucket of water then we will be stuck here condemned to live out our lives in paradise kahlan smiled in understanding of caras frustration while she wouldnt try to force richard into something he was dead set against that didnt preclude her from trying to change his mind she drained her teacup and plunked it down on the counter that would be different maybe not you know ive been thinking the same thingthat we need to go back i mean cara peered over with a suspicious sidelong glance so what do you think we can do to convince him richard is going to be gone for a while without him here to bother us how about we have a bath a bath yes a bath ive been thinking about how much id like to get cleaned up im tired of looking like a backcountry traveler id like to wash my hair and put on my white mother confessors dress your white mother confessors dress cara smiled conspiratorially ah now that will be the kind of battle a woman is better equipped to fight out of the corner of her eye kahlan could see spirit standing in the bedroom window looking out at the world her robes flowing in the wind her head thrown back her back arched her fists at her sides in defiance of anything that would think to bridle her well not exactly a battle the way youre thinking but i believe i can state the case better if im dressed properly that wouldnt be unfair i will be putting the issue to him as the mother confessor i believe that in some ways his judgment has been clouded its hard to think about anything else when youre worried sick about someone you love kahlans fists tightened at her sides as she thought about the danger hanging over the midlands hes got to see that all of that is in the past that im healthy now and that the time has come to return to our duties to our people smirking cara swiped back a wisp of her blond hair he will see that and more if you were in that dress of yours thats for sure i want him to see the woman who was strong enough to win against him with a sword i want him to see that mother confessor in the dress too from the corner of her mouth cara puffed another strand of hair off her face to tell you the truth i wouldnt mind a bath myself you know i think that if i stand beside you in a proper mordsith outfit and my hair is washed and my braid is done up fresh and im looking properly mordsithlike and i speak my agreement with what you say lord rahl will be all the more convinced that were right and inclined to see that the time has come for us to return kahlan set the plates into the bucket of water its settled then weve enough time before he comes back richard had made them a small wooden tub big enough to sit in and have a nice bath it wasnt big enough to lie back and luxuriate in but it was still quite the luxury for their mountain home cara towed the tub from the corner leaving drag marks across the dirt floor ill put it in my room you go first that way if he comes back sooner rather than later you can keep your nosy husband busy and out of my hair while i wash it together kahlan and cara hauled in buckets of water from the nearby spring heating some in a kettle over a roaring fire when kahlan finally sank into the steaming water she let out a long sigh the air was chilly and the hot bath felt all the better for it she would have liked to linger but decided not to she smiled at recalling all the trouble richard had had with women in bathwater it was a good thing he wasnt there later after they had their talk she thought she would ask him to take a bath before bed she liked the aroma of his sweat when it was clean sweat with the knowledge that she would face richard with her hair washed and sparkling and in her white dress kahlan felt more confident about the real possibility of their return than she had in a long time she dried and brushed her hair by the heat of the fire as cara boiled some more water while cara went in to take her bath kahlan went to her room to slip into her dress most people feared the dress because they feared the woman who wore it richard had always liked her in the dress as she tossed the towel on the bed her eye was caught by the statue in the window kahlan fisted her hands at her sides and standing naked arched her back and threw her head back mimicking spirit letting the feeling of it overcome her letting herself be that strong spirit letting it flow through her for that moment she was the spirit of the statue this was a day of change she could feel it it seemed a little odd after being a woods woman for so long to be back in her mother confessors dress to feel the satiny smooth material against her skin mostly though the feeling was the comfort of the familiar as mother confessor kahlan felt sure of herself on a fundamental level the dress was a form of battle armor wearing the dress kahlan also felt a sense of importance in that she carried the weight of history of exceptional women who had gone before her the mother confessor bore a terrible responsibility but also had the satisfaction of being able to make a real difference for the better in peoples lives those people depended on her kahlan had a job to do and she had to convince richard that she needed to do it they needed him too but even if he would not issue orders he needed to at least willingly return with her those fighting for their cause deserved to know the mother confessor was with them and that she had not lost faith in them or their cause she had to make richard see that much of it once she was back out in the main room kahlan could hear cara splashing in the tub need anything cara she called out no im fine cara called from her room this feels so good i think theres enough dirt in this water to plant potatoes kahlan laughed knowingly she saw a chipmunk casting about outside the house im going to go feed chippy some apple cores if you need anything call out their universal name for all the chipmunks was chippy they all answered to it they knew the name augured well for a handout all right cara said from her tub if lord rahl gets back though just kiss him or something to keep him busy but wait until im done before you talk to him i want to be with you to help you convince him i want to be sure we make him see the light kahlan smiled i promise she plucked an apple core from the wooden bucket of little animal snacks they kept hanging on a piece of twine where the chipmunks couldnt get to them on their own the squirrels loved apple cores too the horses preferred their apples whole here chippy kahlan called out through the door in the voice she always used with them she raised the bucket back toward the ceiling and hooked the line to the peg on the wall chip chip you want an apple outside kahlan saw the chipmunk off to the side foraging through the grass the chill breeze caressed the long folds of her dress to her legs as she walked it was almost cold enough to need the fur mantle the bare branches of the oaks behind the house creaked and groaned as they rubbed together the pines reaching toward the sky where the wind was stronger bowed deeply with some of the gusts the sun had taken refuge behind a steelgray overcast that made her white dress all the more striking in the gloom near the window where spirit stood watching out kahlan called the chipmunk again the chipmunks were held spellbound by the soft voice kahlan used when she talked to them when he heard her the furry little striped creature stood on his hind legs for a moment stiff and still checking that all was clear and when he was sure it was safe scurried to her kahlan squatted and rolled the apple core out of her hand onto the ground here you go sweetheart she cooed a nice apple for you chippy wasted no time starting in on his treat kahlans cheeks hurt from smiling at the way the chipmunk nibbled his way around the apple core as it rolled along the ground she rose to her feet brushing her hands clean as she watched captivated by the little creature at his feverish work he suddenly flinched with a squeak and froze kahlan looked up she was staring right into a womans blue eyes the woman stood not ten feet away in a pose of cool scrutiny kahlans throat locked the gasp in her lungs the woman had seemed to appear in the middle of nowhere out of nowhere icy gooseflesh prickled up the backs of kahlans arms the womans long blond hair cascaded over the shoulders of an exquisite black dress she was of such shapely beauty her face of such pure perfection but especially her eyes were of such intelligent lucid witnesses to all around her that she could only be a creature of profound integrity or unspeakable evil kahlan knew without doubt which it was this woman made kahlan feel as ugly as a clod of dirt and instinctively as helpless as a child she wanted nothing so much as to shrink away instead she stared into the womans blue eyes for what couldnt have been more than a second or two but in that span of time an eternity seemed to pass in those knowing blue eyes flowed some formidable frightful current of contemplation kahlan remembered captain meifferts description of this woman for the life of her though kahlan couldnt just then recall her name it seemed trivial what mattered was that this woman was a sister of the dark without speaking a word the woman lifted her hands out a little and turned her palms up as if humbly offering something her hands were empty kahlan committed to the vault through space necessary to close the distance she committed to unleashing her power with her resolution the act had in a way already commenced but she desperately needed to get closer if it was to be meaningful or effective as she began to move to make that reckless leap the world went white in a bloom of pain chapter richard heard an odd sound that stopped him in his tracks he felt a thump through the ground and deep in his chest he thought hed seen a flash in the treetops but it had been so quick he wasnt sure it was the sound though as if some great hammer had struck off the top of a mountain that made his blood go cold the house wasnt far off through the trees he dropped the string of trout and the jar of minnows and ran at the edge of the woods where it opened into the meadow he skidded to a halt his pounding heart felt as if it had risen up into his throat richard saw the two women not far away in front of the house one dressed in white and one in black they were connected by a snaking undulating crackling line of milky white light niccis arms were lifted slightly with her hands turned palms up and a little farther apart than the width of her hips the milky light went from niccis chest across the space between the two women and pierced kahlan through the heart the wavering aurora between the two turned blindingly bright as if twisting in an agony it was unable to escape seeing kahlan trembling with the fury of that lance of light pinning her to the wall richard was paralyzed by fear for her fear he knew all too well from when she had been on the cusp of death that bolt pierced niccis heart too connecting the two women richard didnt understand the magic nicci was using but he instinctively recognized it as profoundly dangerous not only to kahlan but to nicci as well for she too was in pain that nicci would put herself at such risk gripped him with dread richard knew he had to remain calm and keep his wits about himself if kahlan was to have a chance he viscerally wanted to do something to strike nicci down but he was certain that it wouldnt be as simple as that zedds oftrepeated expressionnothing is ever easyflashed into richards mind with sudden and tangible meaning in a desperate search for answers everything richard knew about magic cascaded in a torrent through his mind none of it told him what to do but it did tell him what he must not do kahlans life hung in the balance just then cara came flying out of the house she was stark naked it somehow didnt look all that odd richard was accustomed to the shape of her body in her skintight leather outfits other than the color this didnt look all that different she was dripping wet her hair was undone which seemed more outlandishly indecent to him than her naked body he was used to seeing her with a braid all the time caras fist clutched the red leather rodher agielas she crouched the muscles of her legs arms and shoulders strained with tension demanding release cara no richard cried out he was already tearing across the meadow as cara sprang and slammed her agiel against the side of niccis neck nicci shrieked in pain that dropped her to her knees kahlan cried out in equal pain and crumpled to her knees as well her movement a close match to niccis cara seized niccis hair in a fist and yanked her head back time to die witch nicci was doing nothing to stop cara as the agiel hung only inches from her throat richard dove toward the mordsith desperately hoping he wouldnt be too late caras agiel just grazed niccis throat as richard tackled her around the middle ramming her backward the feel of her was briefly surprisingsilky soft flesh over ironhard muscle the impact drove the wind from her when they hit the ground cara was so enraged and in such a combative state that she lashed out with her agiel at richard not really realizing it was him knowing only that she was being prevented from protecting kahlan the violent impact of the weapon to the side of richards face felt like a blow by an iron bar followed immediately by a lightning strike the crack of pain through his skull was momentarily blinding his ears rang the jolt took his breath staggering him and brought back in a single instant an avalanche of macabre memories cara was riveted on the kill and furious at any interference richard regained his senses just in time to seize her wrists and pin her to the ground before she could pounce on nicci a mordsith was formidable to be sure but such a woman was instilled with the ability to counter magic not muscle that was why she had been trying to goad nicci into using her power only in that way could she capture the enemys magic and so overpower her caras writhing naked body under him hardly registered in richards mind he tasted blood in his mouth his attention was focused on her agiel and making sure she couldnt use it on him his head throbbed with a painful ringing and he had to fight not only cara but encroaching unconsciousness it was all he could do to hold cara down at that moment the mordsith was more of a threat to kahlans life than nicci was if nicci intended to kill kahlan he was sure she could have already done so richard might not have understood specifically what nicci was doing but by what he had already seen he grasped the general nature of it blood dripped down onto caras bare chest vivid red against the expanse of her white skin cara stop his jaw worked if painfully so he reasoned it wasnt broken its me stop youll kill kahlan cara stilled under him staring up in angry confusion what you do to nicci happens to kahlan too you had better listen to him nicci said from behind him in that velvety voice of hers cara reached up when richard released her wrists and touched the side of his mouth im sorry she whispered realizing what she had done her tone told him she meant it richard nodded and then stood pulling her up by her hand before rounding on nicci nicci stood tall in that proud and proper posture she had her attention and her magic was focused on kahlan the calm but violent power from within him had awakened waiting to be commanded richard didnt know how to use it to stop nicci he held back fearing that anything he did would only make kahlans peril worse kahlan was on her feet too but once again pinned to the wall of the house by the milky rope of light her green eyes were wide with the trembling torment of whatever it was nicci was doing niccis hands lifted she laid her palms to her heart over the light her back was to richard but he could see the light through her like fire eating through the center of a piece of paper the incandescent hole expanding outward appearing to consume her the twisting flare of light was doing the same thing to kahlan seeming to burn through her yet richard could see that she was not being killed by it she was still breathing still moving still alivenot reacting at all the way a person would if they were really having holes burned through them with magic he knew better than to believe his eyes at the center of niccis chest under her hands she began to become solid again reforming where the light had spent itself in glowing rays working out toward the edges of her the light cut off kahlan her own hands pressed to the wall behind her sagged in relief as it extinguished her eyes closing as if it was too much to endure looking at the woman standing before her richard was restrained fury his muscles screamed to be released the magic within was a coiled viper waiting to strike he wanted almost more than anything to cut down this woman the only thing he wanted more was for kahlan to be safe nicci smiled pleasantly at kahlan before turning to richard her calm blue eyes momentarily took in his whiteknuckled fist on the hilt of his sword richard its been a long time you look well what have you done he growled through gritted teeth she smiled it was a smile a mother gave a childa smile of indulgence she took a breath as if recovering from a difficult bit of labor and lifted a hand to indicate kahlan i have spelled your wife richard richard could hear caras breath close behind his left shoulder she was staying out of the way of his sword arm to what end he asked why to capture you of course whats going to happen to her what harm have you done harm why none any harm that comes to her will only be by your hand richard frowned understanding her but wishing he were wrong you mean if i hurt you kahlan will suffer it too nicci smiled with the same discerning disarming smile she used to have when she came to give him lessons he could hardly believe that he used to imagine that she must look like nothing so much as a good spirit in the flesh richard could sense the magic crackling around this woman he had come to know in most cases through his own gift when a person had the gift what others couldnt see he saw he could see it in their eyes and sometimes sense the aura of it around them he had rarely met gifted women who made the very air about them sizzle with their power worse though nicci was a sister of the dark yes and more much more you see we are now linked by a maternity spell odd name for a spell yes the name in part is derived from the spells nurturing aspects as in lifegiverthe way a mother nurtures her child and keeps it alive that light you saw was an umbilical cord of sorts an umbilical cord of magic by bending the nature of this world it links our lives no matter the distance between us just as i am the daughter of my mother and nothing could ever change that so neither can this magic be altered by anyone else she spoke as an instructor as she had once spoken to him at the palace of the prophets when she had been one of his teachers she always spoke with a quiet economy of words that he had once thought added an air of nobility to her bearing back then richard couldnt have imagined coarse words coming from niccis mouth but the words she spoke now were vile she still moved with an unmatched slow elegance he had always thought her movements seductive he now saw them as the sinuous movements of a snake the magic of his sword thundered through him screaming to be loosed the swords magic had been created specifically to combat what the swords wielder considered evil at that moment nicci fit the requirement to such an extent that the magic of the sword was close to overpowering him near to taking command in order to destroy this threat with the pain from the agiel still throbbing in his head it was a struggle to maintain his control over the power of the sword richard could feel the raised gold letters of the word truth on the hilt pressing into his palm this was a time perhaps more than any other that he knew had to be faced with truth and not his raw wishes life and death hung in the balance richard kahlan said in a level voice she waited until his eyes met hers kill her she spoke with a quiet authority that demanded obedience in her white mother confessors dress her words carried the unequivocal weight of command do it dont wait another moment kill her dont think about it do it nicci calmly watched to see what he might do what he would finally decide seemed no more than a matter of curiosity to her richard had no need to think or to decide i cant he said to kahlan that would kill you too nicci lifted one eyebrow very good richard very good do it kahlan shrieked do it now while you still have the chance keep still he said in a calm voice he looked back at nicci lets hear it she clasped her hands in the way the sisters of the light were wont to do only she was not a sister of the light there looked to be something deeply felt behind that blueeyed gaze but what those feelings could be he didnt know and feared to imagine it was one of those intense gazes that held a world of emotion everything from longing to hatred one thing he was sure he saw was a dead serious determination that was more important to her than life itself its like this richard you are to come with me as long as i live kahlan will live if i die she dies its as simple as that what else he demanded what else nicci blinked nothing else what if i decide to kill you then i will die but kahlan will die with meour lives are now finked thats not what i mean i mean you must have some purpose what else will it mean if i decide to kill you nicci shrugged nothing its up to you to decide our lives are in your hands should you choose to preserve her life you will have to come with me and what do you intend to do with him kahlan asked as she edged her way over to richards side torture a sham confession out of him so that jagang can put him on some kind of show trial followed by a very public execution if anything nicci looked surprised as if such a thought had never occurred to her and she found it abhorrent no none of that i intend him no harm for now anyway eventually of course i will most likely have to kill him richard glared of course when kahlan made a move forward he caught her arm and restrained her he knew what she intended he didnt know exactly what would happen if kahlan unleased her confessors power on nicci while they were both linked by the spell but he had no intention of finding out since he was sure it could come to no good end kahlan was far too ready as far as he was concerned to forfeit her life to save his just hold on for now he whispered to her kahlan threw her arm out pointing she just admitted she intends to kill you nicci smiled reassuringly dont worry about that for now if it comes to that it will not likely be for a long time perhaps even a lifetime and in the meantime kahlan asked what plans do you have for him before you discard his life as if it were insignificant insignificant nicci opened her hands in an innocent gesture i have no plans i expect only to take him away richard had thought he understood what was going on but he was less and less sure with everything nicci said you mean you want to take me away so that i cant fight against the imperial order her brow twitched if you wish to think of it in those terms i admit it is true that your time as the leader of the dharan empire is over but that is not the point the point is that everything about your life up until nownicci glanced pointedly at kahlanis over her words seemed to chill the air they surely chilled richard whats the rest of it he knew there had to be more something that would make sense of it all what other terms are there if i want to keep kahlan alive well no one is to follow us of course and if we do kahlan snapped i might follow you and kill you myself even if it means the end of my own life kahlans green eyes shone with icy resolve as she cast a threatening glare on the woman nicci lifted her brows deliberately as she leaned ever so slightly toward kahlan the way a mother would in cautioning a child then that will be the end of it unless richard stops you from doing such a thing that is all part of what he must decide to do but you make a miscalculation if you think i care one way or the other i dont you see not at all what is it you intend me to do richard said pulling nicci s unsettlingly calm gaze from kahlan what if i get where youre taking me and i dont do as you wish you misunderstand richard if you believe that i have some preconceived notion of what it is i wish you to do i dont you will do as you wish i imagine as i wish well naturally you wont be allowed to return to your people she tossed her head flicking back strands of her long blond hair that the wind had pulled across in front of her blue eyes her gaze never left his and i suppose if you were to be in some way impossibly and defiantly contrary then in that case such would obviously be an answer in and of itself it would be a shame of course but i would then have no use for you i would kill you you would have no further use you mean jagang would have no further use no once again nicci looked surprised i do not act on behalf of his excellency she tapped her lower lip you see i removed the ring he put through my lip marking me as his slave i do this on behalf of myself a yet more disturbing thought surfaced how is it that he cant enter your mind that he cant control you you dont need me to answer that question richard rahl it made no sense to him the bond to the lord rahl worked for those loyal to him he could see no way that this could be construed as an act of loyalty this was unequivocally an act of aggression and against his will the bond shouldnt work for her he reasoned that perhaps jagang was in her mind and she unaware of it the thought occurred to him that maybe jagang was in her mind and it had driven her insane look richard said feeling like they werent even speaking the same language i dont know what you think enough talk we are leaving her blue eyes watched him without anger it almost seemed to richard that for nicci kahlan anal cara were not there this doesnt make any sense you want me to go with you but you arent acting on behalf of jagang if thats true then i believe ive made it as clear as possible and quite simple besides if you wish to be free you may kill me at any opportunity if you do kahlan will also die those are your only two choices although i believe i know what you will do i am in no way certain two paths now lie before you you must take one richard could hear caras angry breath behind him she was a coiled spring ready to strike fearing she might do something of irredeemable harm he lifted his hand just to be sure she knew he meant for her to stay behind him oh and one additional matter should you think to resort to some plot or treachery or for that matter refuse to do the simple things i ask of you through the spell that joins us i can at any time end kahlans life i have but to will it it is not necessary for me to die she lives every day from now on only by my grace and thus yours i wish her no harm and have no feelings one way or the other about her life in fact if anything i wish it to be long she has brought you a measure of happiness and in return for that i hope she will not have to forfeit her life but then you have some influence over that by your behavior nicci cast a deliberate glare over richards shoulder to cara she then reached out and with her fingers gently wiped blood from his mouth she finished cleaning his chin with her thumb your mordsith has hurt you i can help you if you wish no very well she wiped her bloody fingers clean on the skirt of her black dress unless you want to risk other people causing kahlans death without your intending it i suggest you insure that others dont act without your consent mordsith are resourceful and determined women i respect their devotion to duty however if your mordsith follows usand my magic will tell me if she doeskahlan will die and just how will i know kahlan is all right we could get a mile away from here and you could use that magic link to kill her i would never know niccis brow creased together she looked genuinely puzzled why would i do that a storm of rage and panic pushed his emotions first one way and then the other why are you doing any of this she regarded him in silent curiosity for a moment i have my reasons im sorry richard that you must suffer in this making you suffer is not my purpose i give you my word that i will not harm kahlan without informing you you expect me to believe your word ive told you the truth i have no reason to lie to you in time you will come to understand everything better kahlan will come to no harm from me as long as i am safe and you come with me for reasons he couldnt fathom richard found himself believing her she seemed dead honest and completely sure of herself as if she had reasoned it all out a thousand times he didnt believe that nicci was telling him everything she was making it simple so that he could grasp the important elements and have an easier time deciding what to do whatever the rest of it was it couldnt be as devastating as this much of it the thought of being taken from kahlan was agony but he would do almost anything to save her life nicci knew that the enigma resurfaced it was somehow linked to this the spell that protects a persons mind from the dream walker works only for those loyal to me you cant expect to be safe from jagang if you do this its an act of treachery jagang does not frighten me dont fear for my mind richard im quite safe from his excellency in time perhaps you will come to see how wrong you have been in so many things youre deceiving yourself nicci you only see part of it richard she lifted an eyebrow in a cryptic manner at heart your cause is the cause of the order you are too noble a person for it to be otherwise i may die at your hands but i will die hating everything you and the order stand for richards fists tightened youll not get what you want nicci whatever it is youll not get it she regarded him with great compassion this is all for the best richard nothing he said seemed to hold any sway with her and he could make no sense of the things she said the fury inside boiled up the magic of the sword fought him for control he could barely contain it do you really expect me to ever come to believe that niccis blue eyes seemed to be focused somewhere beyond him possibly not her gaze fixed on him once more she put two fingers between her lips as she turned and whistled in the distance a horse whinnied and trotted out of the woods i have another horse for you waiting up on the other side of the pass terror clawed at his bones kahlans fingers tightened on his arm caras hand touched his back memories of being captured before and all it meant all the things he had endured made his pulse race and his breath come in rapid pulls he felt trapped everything was slipping through his fingers and there didnt seem to be anything he could do about it he wanted more than anything to fight but he couldnt figure how he wished it were as simple as striking down his adversary he reminded himself that reason not wishing was his only chance he seized the calm center within and used it to quell the rising storm of panic nicci stood tall her shoulders square her chin up she looked like someone facing an execution with courage he realized then that she truly was prepared for whichever way it was to go i have given you your choice richard you have no other options choose there is no choice to make ill not allow kahlan to die of course not niccis posture eased almost imperceptibly a small smile of reassurance warmed her eyes she will be fine the horse slowed from its trot as it approached when the handsome dappled mare halted beside her nicci took ahold of the reins near the bit its gray mane ruffled in the cold breeze the mare snorted and tossed her head uneasy before strangers and eager to be away but but richard stammered as nicci stepped up into the stirrup but what am i allowed to take nicci swung her leg over the horses rump and settled into the saddle she squirmed herself into position and adjusted her shoulders setting them back her black dress and blond hair stood out in stark relief against the iron sky you may bring anything you like as long as it isnt a person she clicked her tongue urging her horse around to face him i suggest you take clothes and such whatever you wish to have with you take all you can carry if you want her voice took on an edge leave that sword of yours though you wont be needing it she leaned down her expression for the first time turning cold and threatening you are no longer the seeker or lord rahl leader of the dharan empire or for that matter you are no longer the husband of the mother confessor from now on you are nobody but richard cara stepped out beside him a thunderhead of dark fury i am mordsith if you think im going to allow you to take lord rahl youre crazy the mother confessor has already stated her wishes my duty above all else is to kill you nicci curled three fingers around the reins her thumbs holding them tight do as you must you know the consequences richard held out a restraining arm to prevent cara from going up after nicci and dragging her off the horse take it easy he whispered time is on our side as long as were all still alive we have the chance to think of something the strain of caras weight against his arm eased she reluctantly backed a step i have to get some things richard said to nicci trying to buy that time wait at least until i can get my pack together nicci laid the reins over and stepped her horse back toward him she rested her left wrist across the saddles pommel im leaving with a long graceful finger of her other hand she pointed you see that pass up there you be with me by the time im at the top and kahlan will live if i cross over and you arent with me kahlan will die you have my word it was all happening too fast he needed to think of a way to stall then what good will any of this have done you it will have told me what means more to you she sat back up in her saddle when you think about it that is quite a profound question it is yet to be answered by the time i get to the top of the pass i will have the answer nicci rocked her hips in the saddle urging the horse ahead into a walk dont forgettop of the pass you have until then to say your goodbyes pack what you wish to take and then catch up with me if you wish kahlan to live or if you choose to stay you have until then to say your goodbyes before she dies understand though when making your choice that the first will be as final as the second kahlan struggled to run toward the horse but richard clutched her around her waist where are you taking him she demanded nicci stopped her horse momentarily and gazed down at kahlan with a look of frightening finality why into oblivion chapter as she watched nicci turn her dappled mare toward the pass and the distant blue mountains beyond kahlan was still struggling to overcome her dizziness from what the woman had done to her off near the distant trees a doe and her nearly grown fawn two of the small herd of deer that frequented the meadow stood at alert their ears perked watching nicci waiting to see if she might be a threat spooked by what they saw when nicci turned their way both deer flicked their tails straight up and bounded for the trees kahlan refused to allow herself to give in to the disorientation but for richards iron arms around her waist she would have thrown herself at the sister of the dark kahlan had desperately wanted to unleash her confessors power no one had ever deserved it more had her senses not still been floundering in a daze she might have been able to invoke her power through the con dar the blood rage of an ancient ability she possessed such rare magic would have bridged the relatively small distance but reeling from the lingering force of niccis conjuring the attempt had been futile it was all kahlan could do to keep her feet under her and her last meal in her stomach it was frustrating infuriating and humiliating but nicci had surprised her and with magic as swift as kahlans confessors power had taken her before she could react once niccis talons clutched her kahlan had been powerless she had grown up being trained not to be taken by surprise confessors were always targets she knew better any number of times in similar situations she had prevailed lulled by months of tranquillity kahlan had lost her edge she vowed never to let it happen again but that would do her no good now she could still feel niccis vital magic sizzling through her as if her soul itself had been scorched in the heat of the ordeal her insides roiled as waves of the onslaught had yet to settle down the cold air rushing across the meadow bending the brown grass swept up to chill her burning face the wind carried an unfamiliar scent into the valley something that her jumbled senses perceived as vaguely portentous the big pines behind the house bowed and twisted but stood tall as the wind broke against them with a sound not unlike waves rushing against stone cliffs whatever sort of magic had been unleashed in her kahlan was convinced nicci had told the truth about its consequence despite how much she hated the woman because of the maternity spell kahlan felt a connection to her a connection that she could only interpret as affection it was a bewildering sensation while positively disturbing it was also in a way a comforting connection to the woman beyond her vile magic and twisted purpose there seemed to be something deep within nicci worth loving regardless of kahlans farfetched feelings her perception and reasoning told her the truth of the matter such impressions were illusion if she got the opportunity she would not again hesitate for an instant to kill nicci cara richard said glaring at niccis back as she walked her horse across the meadow i dont want you even thinking about trying to stop her im not going to allow i mean it i mean it more than any order ive ever given you if you ever brought kahlan to harm in such a way well i trust youd never do such an evil thing to me why dont you go get dressed cara growled a curse under her breath richard turned to kahlan as the mord sith marched off into the house kahlan only then really noticed that cara was naked she must have been interrupted in her bath the magic nicci used had fogged kahlans mind blurring her memory of recent events kahlan did recall quite clearly though the feel of the agiel the shattering torture of the mordsiths weapon had spiked through niccis magic like a lance through straw even though cara had used her agiel on nicci kahlan felt it as if it had been used directly against the side of her own neck kahlan gently touched richards jaw in sympathy then took hold of his upper arms instead when he gave her a look that suggested no need for sympathy his big hands closed on her waist she stepped into his embrace and rested her forehead against his cheek this cant be she whispered it just cant but it is im so sorry sorry that i let her take me by surprise kahlan trembled with anger at herself i should have been alert if id done as i should have and killed her first it would never have come to this richard ran a hand gently down the back of her head holding her to his shoulder remember how you killed me in a sword fight the other day she nodded against him we all make mistakes get caught off guard dont blame yourself no one is perfect it could even be that she cast a web of magic to dull your awareness so she could slip up to you like like some silent unseen mosquito kahlan had never considered that caught off guard or not though it made her furious with herself if only she had not been paying attention to the stupid chipmunk if only she had looked up sooner if only she had acted without waiting a split second to analyze the true nature of the threat to decide if it warranted the unleashing of her devastating magic almost from birth kahlan had been instructed in the use of her power with the mandate of unleashing it only upon being certain of the need much like killing a confessors power was the destruction of who a person was afterward the person acted exclusively on behalf of the confessor and at the direction of the confessor it was as final as death kahlan looked up into richards gray eyes they looked all the more gray with the gray sky behind him my life is a precious and sacred thing to me she said yours is no less to you dont throw yours away to be a slave to mine i couldnt stand it its not come to that yet ill figure something out but for now i have to go with her well follow but stay well back he was already shaking his head but she wont even be aware no for all we know she could have others with her they could be waiting to catch you if you follow i couldnt bear the thought of knowing that at any moment she could use magic or somehow find out you were following if that happened you would die for nothing you mean you think she could hurt you to make you tell her i planned to follow lets not let our imaginations get the better of us but i should be close for when you make a movefor when you figure a way to stop her richard cupped her face tenderly in his hands he had a strange look in his eyes a look she didnt like listen to me i dont know whats going on but you mustnt die just to free me tears of desperation stung her eyes she blinked them away she fought to keep her voice from becoming a wail dont go richard i dont care what it means for me as long as you can be free i would die happy if doing so would keep you from the enemys cruel hands i cant allow the order to have you i cant allow you to endure the slow grinding death of a slave in exchange for my life i cant allow them to she bit off the words of what she feared most she couldnt bear the thought of him being tortured it made her even more dizzy and sick to think of him being maimed and mutilated of him suffering all alone and forgotten in some distant stinking dungeon with no hope of help but nicci said they wouldnt kahlan told herself that for her own sanity she had to believe niccis word kahlan realized richard was smiling to himself as if trying to commit to memory every detail of her face while at the same time running a thousand other things through his thoughts theres no choice he whispered i must do this she clutched his shirt in her fist youre doing just as nicci wantsshe knows youll want to save me i cant allow you to make that sacrifice richard looked up briefly gazing out at the trees and mountains behind their house taking it all in like a condemned man savoring his last meal his gaze more earnest settled once more on hers dont you see i am making no sacrifice i am making a fair trade the reality that you exist is my basis for joy and happiness i make no sacrifice he repeated stressing each word to be a slave even if that is what happens to me and yet know youre alive is my choice over being free in a world in which you dont exist i can live with the first i cant with the second the first is painful the second unbearable kahlan beat a fist against his chest but you will be a slave or worse and i cant bear that kahlan listen to me i will always have freedom in my heart because i understand what it is because i do i can work toward it i will find a way to be free i cannot find a way to bring you back to life the spirits know that in the past ive been willing to forfeit my life for a just cause and if my life would truly make a difference in the past i have knowingly imperiled both our lives been willing to sacrifice both our livesbut not in return for nothing dont you see this would be a fools bargain ill not do it kahlan pulled her breaths in small gasps trying to told back the tears as well as her rising sense of panic youre the seeker you must find a way to freedom of course you will you will know she forced a swallow past the constriction in her throat as she tried to reassure richard or perhaps herself youll find a way i know you will youll find a way and youll come back you did before you will this time the shadows of richards features seemed dark and severe cast as they were in a mask of resignation kahlan you must be prepared to go on what do you mean you must find joy in the fact that i too live you must be prepared to go on with that knowledge and nothing else what do you mean nothing else he had a terrible look in his eyessome kind of sad grim tragic acceptance she didnt want to look into his eyes but standing there with her hand against his chest feeling the warmth of him the life within him she couldnt make herself look away as he spoke i think its different this time kahlan pulled her hair back when the wind dragged it over her eyes different theres something very different about the feel of this it doesnt make sense in the way things in the past have made sense theres something deadly serious about nicci something singular shes planned this out and shes prepared to die for it i cant lie to you to deceive you something tells me that this time i may never be able to find a way to come back dont say that in weak fingers trembling with dread kahlan gathered his dark shirt into a wrinkled knot please dont say that richard you must try you must find a way to come back to me dont ever think i wont be doing my best his voice was impassioned almost to the point of sounding angry i swear to you kahlan that as long as there is a breath in my lungs ill never give up ill always try to find a way but we cant ignore the possibility just because its painful to contemplate i may never be back you must face the fact that it looks like you must go on without me but with the knowledge that im alive just as i will have that awareness of you in my heart where no one can touch it in our hearts we have each other and always will that was the oath we swore when we were marriedto love and honor each other for all time this cant change it distance cant change it time cant change it richard she choked back her wail but she couldnt keep the tears from coursing down her face i cant stand the thought of you being a slave because of me dont you see that dont you see what that would do to me ill kill myself if i must so that she cant do this to you i must he shook his head the wind ruffling his hair then i would have no reason to escape her nothing to escape for you wont need to escape thats just it she wont be able to hold you shes a sister of the dark he threw open his hands she will simply use another means i wont know how to counterand if youre dead i wont care to but dont you see he seized her by her shoulders kahlan you must live to give me a reason to try to escape her your own life is your reason she said to be free to help people will be your reason the people be cursed he released her and gestured angrily even people where i grew up turned against us they tried to murder us remember the lands that have surrendered into the union with dhara will likely not remain loyal either when they see the reality of the imperial orders army moving up into the midlands eventually dhara will stand alone people dont understand or value freedom the way it now stands they wont fight for it theyve proven it in anderith and in hartland where i grew up what more clear evidence could be seen i hold out no false hope most of the rest of the midlands will quail when it comes time to fight against the imperial order when they see the size of the orders army and their brutality with those who resist they will surrender their freedom he looked away from her as if regretting his flash of anger in their last moments together his tall form so stalwart against the sweep of mountains and sky sagged a little seeming to huddle closer to her as if seeking comfort the only thing i have to hope for is to get away so i can come back to you his voice had lost all traces of heat as he spoke in a near whisper kahlan please dont take that hope from meits all i have in the distance she could see the fox trotting across the meadow its thick whitetipped tail followed out straight behind as the fox made its inspection for any rodents that might be about as kahlans gaze tracked its movement from the corner of her eye she caught a glimpse of spirit standing proud and free in the window how could she lose the man who had carved that for her when she needed it most she could she knew because now he needed what only she could give him looking back up into his intense gray eyes she realized she could not hope to deny him his earnest plea and only request not at a time like this all right richard i wont do anything rash to free you ill wait for you ill endure it i know you i know you wont ever give up you know i expect no less from you when you get awayand you willill be waiting for you and then well be together again well never be apart in our hearts as you said our oath of love is timeless richard closed his eyes with relief he tenderly kissed her brow he lifted her hand from his chest and pressed soft kisses to her knuckles she saw then how much her pledge meant to him kahlan pulled her hand back and quickly removed her necklace the one shota had given her as a wedding gift it was meant to prevent her from getting pregnant she turned richards hand over and pushed the necklace into his palm he frowned in confusion at the small dark stone hanging from the gold chain draped over his fingers whats this about i want you to take it kahlan cleared her throat to keep her voice she could only manage a whisper i know what she wants of youwhat she will make you do no thats not what he shook his head he said im not taking this as if turning it away would somehow deny the possibility kahlan put her hand to the side of his face his face wavered before her in a watery blur please richard please take it for me i couldnt bear the thought of another woman having your child or even the thought of the attempt at its creationbut she didnt say that part of it especially not after mine he looked away from her eyes kahlan words failed him just do it for me take it please richard im doing as you ask and will endure your captivity please honor my request in return i couldnt stand the thought of that bewitching blond beast having your childthe child that should be mine donyou see how could i ever love something i hated and how could i ever hate something that was part of you please richard dont let it come to that the cold wind lifted and twisted her hair her whole life it seemed was twisting out of her control she could hardly believe that this place of such joy peace and redemption a place where she had come to live again could be a place where it would all be taken away richard held the necklace out to her as if it were a thing that might bite him the dark stone swung under his fingers gleaming in the gloom kahlan i dont think thats what this is about i really dont but anyway she could simply refuse to wear it and threaten your life if i didnt kahlan pulled the gold chain from his fingers and laid it all in a small neat mound in his palm the dark stone glimmered from its imprisonment behind the veil of tiny gold links she closed his fingers around the necklace and held his fist shut with both of her hands youre the one who demands we not ignore those things that are painful to contemplate but if she refuses kahlan gripped his fist tighter in her trembling fingers if it comes to a time when she makes that demand of you you must convince her to wear the necklace you must for me its bad enough for me to think she might take my love my husband from me like that but to also fear his big hand felt so warm and familiar and comforting to her her words came choked with desperate tears she could do no more than beg please richard he pressed his lips tight then nodded and stuffed the necklace in a pocket i dont believe those are her intentions but if it should turn out to be so you have my word she will wear the necklace kahlan sagged against him with a sob he took her by the arm come on hurry i have to get whatever i need to take ive only got a few minutes or all this will be for nothing i can take the shorter trail and still catch up with her at the top of the pass but i dont have much time chapter kahlan was aware of cara wearing her bloodred leather standing in the doorway to their bedroom watching richard cram his things into his pack kahlan nodded as she and richard exchanged brief stilted instructions they had already come to terms with the lifeanddeath issues it seemed they both feared to say anything of consequence for fear of disturbing the delicate desperate difficult agreements they had reached the meager light coming in the small window did little to brighten the gloom cara over in the doorway blocked some of the light the room had the feel of a dungeon richard dressed in dark clothes looked like a shadow so many times as she lay in bed recovering kahlan had thought of it that wayas her dungeon now it had the palpable sense of a dungeon but with the clean aroma of pine walls instead of the stench of a stone cell from where trembling sweating prisoners were taken to their death cara looked forlorn one moment and the next like lightning seeking ground kahlan knew that the mordsiths emotions had to be as torn as her own balancing on a knifes edge with despair and grief on one side and rage on the other mordsith were not used to being in such a position but then cara was now more than simply mordsith kahlan watched richard pack the black trousers black undershirt black and gold tunic silver wristbands overbelt with its pouches and golden cloak into his pack where they took up a good portion of the available space he was wearing his dark forest garb he didnt have time to change kahlan hoped a time would soon come when he would escape and again wear the clothes of a war wizard to toad them against the order they all needed him to lead the dharan empire against the invading horde from the old world for reasons that werent always entirely clear richard had become the linchpin of their struggle kahlan knew his feelings about thatthat people must be willing to fight for themselves and not only for himwere valid if an idea was sound it had to have a life beyond a leader or the leader had failed as he threw other clothes and small items into his pack richard told kahlan that maybe she could find zedd that he might have some ideas she nodded and said she would knowing zedd wouldnt be able to do anything this terrible triangle was not liable to be susceptible to influence by outsidersnicci had seen to that it was just a hope richard was giving her the only bouquet he could offer in the desolate void of reality kahlan didnt know what to do with her hands she stood twining her fingers together as tears dripped off her chin there must be something to say something important some last words while she had the chance but she couldnt think of them she supposed he knew what she felt what was in her heart and words couldnt add anything to that she pressed her fist against the aching knot of anxiety in the pit of her stomach a sense of doom crowded in the room like a fourth person a grim guard waiting to take richard away this was the heart of terror being controlled by what you couldnt see couldnt reason with couldnt persuade or battle the doom waited implacable immune indifferent as cara vanished from the doorway richard pulled a fistful of gold and silver from an inside pocket in his leather pack he hastily dropped roughly half back in the pack and then held out the rest take this you might need it im the mother confessor i dont need gold he tossed it on the bed for her anyway apparently not wanting to argue with her in their last moments together do you want any of the carvings she asked it was a stupid question and she knew it but she had to fill the awful silence and it was the only thing to come into her head other than a hopeless plea no ive no need for them when you look at them think of me and remember i love you he rolled a blanket tight wrapped it with a small patch of oiled canvas and tied it with leather thongs to the bottom of his pack i guess if i were to want any i could always carve some kahlan handed him a cake of soap i dont need your carving to remind me of your love ill remember carve something to make nicci see that you should be free richard glanced up with a grim smile i plan on seeing to it that she knows i wont ever give in to her and the order carvings wont be necessary she thinks she has this all planned out but shes going to find out im bad company richard jammed a fist in his pack making more room very bad company cara rushed back in carrying small bundles with the corners tied in knots at the top she plopped them down one at a time onto the bed i put together some food for you lord rahl things that will keep for traveling dried meat and fish and such some rice and beans i i put a loaf of bread that i made on top so eat it first while its still good he thanked her as he put the small bundles into his pack he put the bread to his nose for a deep whiff before packing it away he gave cara a smile of appreciation richard straightened his smile evaporated in a way that for some reason made kahlans blood go cold looking like he was in the throes of committing himself to some last grim deed richard pulled the baldric off over his head he held the goldandsilver wrought scabbard in his left hand and drew the sword of truth in his whiteknuckled right fist the blade rang out with its unique metallic sound announcing its freedom richard drew his sleeve up his arm and wiped the sword across his forearm kahlan winced as she watched she didnt know if he cut deeply accidentally or on purpose with an icy sensation she recalled that richard cut very precisely with any sharp steel edge he turned the blade and wiped both sides in gouts of vivid red blood he bathed the blade in it giving it a voluptuous taste wetting its appetite for more kahlan didnt know what he was doing or why he was doing it now but it was a frightening ritual to witness she wished he had drawn it before and cut down nicci her blood kahlan would not fear seeing richard picked up the scabbard and slammed the sword of truth home blood running over his hand left greasy red smears across the scabbard as he slid his hand down the length of it to the tip and then seized the sheathed weapon at its center point in his fist his head bowed his eyes on the dull silver and gold reflections lustrous even through his own blood he loomed closer to her richard looked up and kahlan saw the lethal rage of magic dancing in his eyes he had invoked the swords terrible wrath called it forth and then put it away shed never seen him do such a thing before he lifted the sword in its scabbard to her the tendons in the back of his fist stood out in the strain the white of his knuckles showed through the blood take it he said in a hoarse voice that betrayed the struggle within spellbound kahlan lifted the scabbard in her palms for that instant until he pulled away his bloody hand she felt a jolting shock as if she were suddenly welded to the weapon by hot fury unlike anything she had ever experienced she half expected to see a burst of sparks she could feel such rage emanating from the cold steel that it nearly dropped her to her knees she might have dropped the weapon itself in that first instant had she been able to let go of it she could not once richard removed his hand the sheathed sword lost the passionate rage and felt no different from any other weapon richard lifted a finger in caution the dangerous magic still glazed his eyes the muscles of his jaw tightened until she could see it standing out all the way up through his temples dont draw this sword he warned in that awful hoarse whisper unless its a matter of your life you know the ghastly things this weapon can do to a person not only the one under the power of the blade but the one under the power of the hilt kahlan arrested by the intensity of his gaze could only nod she clearly recalled the first time richard had used the sword to kill a man the first time he came to learn the horror of killing had been to protect her using the weapon that first time unleashing the magic the first time had nearly killed richard as well it had been a struggle for him to learn how to control such a storm of magic as the sword of truth freed without the rage of the swords magic richards eyes were capable of conveying menace kahlan could recall several times when his raptors glare by itself had brought a roomful of people to silence there were few things worse than the need to escape the look in those eyes now those eyes hungered to deliver death be angry if you must use this he growled be very angry that will be your only salvation kahlan swallowed i understand she nodded i remember righteous rage was the only defense against the crippling pain the sword exacted as payment for its service life or death no other reason i dont know what will happen and id just as soon you not find out but id prefer that to you being without this terrible defense if you need it ive given it a taste of blood it will come out voracious when it comes out it will be in a blood rage i understand his eyes cooled at last im sorry to give you the terrible responsibility of this weapon especially in this way but its the only protection i can offer with a hand on his arm to gently reassure him kahlan said i wont have to use it dear spirits i hope not he glanced over his shoulder taking a last look at their room and then at cara i have to get going she ignored his words give me your arm first he saw she had bandages left over from when kahlan was still recovering without objection he held out his bloodsoaked arm cara used a wet cloth to quickly swab his arm before she wound it in clean bandages richard thanked her as she was finishing cara split the end put the tails around his wrists and tied a quick knot we will come part of the way with you no you will stay here richard pulled down his sleeve i dont want to risk it but cara i want you to protect kahlan im leaving her in your hands i know you wont let me down caras big beautiful blue eyes glistening with tears reflected the kind of pain kahlan was sure cara never allowed anyone to see i swear to protect her as i would protect you lord rahl if you swear to get away and return richard flashed her a brief smile trying to ease her misery im lord rahli dont need to remind you that ive wiggled out of tighter spots than this he kissed her cheek cara i swear ill never give up trying to get awayyou have my word kahlan realized he hadnt really sworn to caras words he wouldnt she knew want to make a promise he might not be able to keep bending to the bed he pulled his pack close i have to go he held the strap in a stranglehold i cant be late kahlans fingers tightened on his arm cara laid a hand on his shoulder richard turned back and gripped kahlans shoulders listen to me now i wish you would stay here in this house in these mountains where its safe for you but i dont think anything short of my dying request could convince you to do that at least stay for four or five days in case im able to figure out whats going on and can escape nicci she may be a sister of the dark but im no longer exactly a stranger to magic ive escaped powerful people before ive sent darken rahl back to the underworld ive gone to the temple of the winds in another world in order to stop the plague ive escaped worse than this who knowsthis might be simpler than it seems if i do escape her ill come back here so wait for a while at least if i cant get away from nicci for now try to find zedd he might have some idea of what to do ann was with him the last time we saw him shes the prelate of the sisters of the light and knew nicci for a very long time perhaps she knows something that along with what zedd might be able to come up with could help richard dont worry about me just take care of yourself ill be waiting for you when you get away so just be at ease about that much of it and put all your effort into escaping from her well wait here for a whilei promise i will watch over her lord rahl dont worry about the mother confessor richard nodded he turned back to kahlan his fingers on her arms tightened his brow drew down i know you and i know the way you feel but you have to listen to me the time has not yet come it may never come you may think im wrong in this but if you close your eyes to the reality of what is in favor of what you would wish just because youre the mother confessor and feel responsible for the people of the midlands then there is no reason for us to bother hoping well be together again because we wont we will be dead and the cause of freedom will be dead his face loomed closer above all else our forces must not attack the heart of the orders army its too soon if theyif youcarry an assault directly into the heart of the order thinking you can win it will be the end of our forces and the end of our chances all hope for the cause of freedom and all hope to defeat the order will be lost for generations to come its the same way we must use our heads with nicci and not fight her in a direct attack or we will both die you promised you would not kill yourself to free me dont throw that promise away by going against what im telling you now it all seemed so unimportant at the moment the only thing that mattered was that she was losing him she would have cast the rest of the world to the wolves if she could just keep him all right richard promise me his fingers were hurting her arms he shook her i mean it you could throw it all away if you dont heed my warning you could destroy the hope of people for the next fifty generations you could be the one who destroys freedom and brings a dark age upon the world promise me you wont a thousand thoughts swirled in chaotic turmoil through her mind kahlan stared up into his eyes she heard herself say i promise richard until you say so well make no direct attack he looked like a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders a smile spread on his face as he pulled her into an embrace his fingers combed into her hair and cradled her head as she rose to his kiss her hands slipped up the backs of his shoulders as she held him it only lasted a moment but in that moment of stolen bliss they shared a world of emotions all too soon the kiss the embrace was over his warm presence swirled away from her allowing the awful weight of doom to settle firmly down atop her richard briefly hugged cara before he hefted his pack onto a shoulder he turned back at the bedroom doorway i love you kahlan never anyone before you nor ever after only you his eyes said it even better youre everything to me richard you know that i love you too cara he winked at her take good care of the both of you until im back i will lord rahl you have my word as mordsith he gave her a crooked smile i have your word as cara and then he was gone i love you too lord rahl cara whispered to the empty doorway kahlan and cara ran into the main room and stood in the doorway watching him running across the meadow cara cupped her hands around her mouth i love you too lord rahl she shouted richard turned as he ran and acknowledged her words with a wave together they watched richards dark figure flying through the dead brown grass his fluid gait swiftly carrying him away just before he disappeared into the trees he stopped and turned kahlan shared a last look with him a look that said everything he turned and vanished into the woods his clothes making him impossible to distinguish from the trees and undergrowth kahlan collapsed to her knees sitting back on her heels as she lost control of her emotions she wept helplessly her head in her hands at what seemed the end of the world cara squatted beside her to put an arm around her shoulders kahlan hated to have cara see her cry that way cry in such weakness she felt a distant gratitude when cara held her head to her shoulder and didnt say anything kahlan didnt know how long she sat on the dirt floor in her white confessors dress sobbing but after a time she was able to make herself stop her heart continued to spiral down into hopeless gloom each passing moment seemed unendurable the bleak future stretched out before her a wasteland of agony she finally looked up and gazed about at the house without richard it was empty he had given it life now it was a dead place what do you wish to do mother confessor it was getting dark whether it was the sunset or the clouds getting thicker kahlan didnt know she wiped at her eyes lets begin to get our things together well stay here a few days like richard asked after that anything the horses cant carry that will spoil wed better bury we should board up the windows well close up the house good and tight for when we return to paradise someday kahlan nodded as she looked about trying desperately to focus her mind on a task and not on that which would crush her the worst part she knew was going to be night when she was alone in bed when he wasnt with her now the valley seemed more like paradise lost she had trouble believing that richard was really gone it seemed as if he were just off to catch some fish or hunt berries or scout the hills it seemed as if surely he would be coming back soon yes for when we return then it will be paradise again i guess when richard returns wherever we are will be paradise kahlan noticed that cara didnt hear her answer the mordsith was staring out through the doorway cara what is it lord rahl is gone kahlan rested a comforting hand on caras shoulder i know it hurts but we must put our minds to no cara turned back her blue eyes were strangely troubled no thats not what i mean i mean that i cant sense him i cant feel the bond to lord rahl i know where he ishes going up the trail up to that passbut i cant feel it she looked panicked dear spirits its like going blind i dont know how to find him i cant find lord rahl kahlans first flash of fear was that he fell and was killed or that nicci had executed him she used reason to force the fear aside nicci knows about the bond she probably used her magic to cloak it or to sever it cloaked it somehow cara rolled her agiel in her fingers thats what it has to be i can still feel my agiel so i know that lord rahl has to be alive the bond is still there but i cannot feel it to sense where he is kahlan sighed with relief that has to be it then nicci doesnt want to be followed so she cloaked his bond with magic kahlan realized that to be protected from the dream walker by the bond to richard people would now have to believe in him without the reassurance of feeling the bond their link would have to remain true in their hearts if they were to survive could they do that could they believe in that way cara stared out the doorway across the meadow to the mountains where richard had disappeared the blueviolet sky behind the bluegray mountains was slashed with blazing orange gashes the snowcaps were lower than they had been winter was racing toward them if richard didnt soon escape and return kahlan and cara would have to be gone before it arrived bouts of dizzying grief threatened to drown her in a flood of tears needing to do something she went to her room to take off her confessors dress she would set to work with the task of closing up the house and preparing to leave as kahlan pulled her dress off cara appeared in the doorway where are we going to go mother confessor you said we were going to leave but you never said where we were going to go kahlan saw spirit standing in the window fists at her sides as she looked out at the world she lifted the carving off the sill and trailed her fingers over the flowing form seeing the statue touching it feeling the power of it made kahlan want to reach deep inside for resolve once before she had been hopeless and richard carved this for her her other hand fell to her side and her fingers found richards sword lying across their bed kahlan focused her mind ordering the turbulent swirl of despair thickening into wrath to destroy the order destroy the order those beasts took my unborn child and now theyve taken richard i will make them regret it a thousand times over and then another thousand i once swore an oath of death without mercy to the order the time has come if killing every last one of them is the only way to get richard back then thats what i will do you swore an oath to lord rahl richard said nothing about not killing them just about how my oath was not to try to drive a sword through their heart he said nothing about bleeding them to death with a thousand cuts i wont break my oath but i intend to kill every last one of them mother confessor you must not do that why caras blue eyes gleamed with menace you must leave half for me chapter richard had stopped to turn back and look at her only once as he ran just before he went into the trees she was standing in the doorway in her white confessors dress her long thick hair tumbling down her form the embodiment of feminine grace looking as beautiful as the first time he saw her they held each others gaze for a brief moment he was too far away to see the green of her eyes a color hed never beheld on anyone else a color of such heartpiercing perfection that it sometimes would stop his breathing and at other times quicken it but it was the mind of the woman behind those eyes that in reality captivated him richard had never met her equal he knew he was cutting the time close as much as he hated the idea of turning his gaze away from kahlan her life hung in the balance his purpose was clear richard had plunged into the woods he had traveled the trail often enough he knew where he could run and where he had to be careful now with little time left he couldnt afford to be too careful he didnt try for a glimpse of the house he was alone in the woods as he ran his thoughts but salt in a raw wound for once he felt out of place in the woodspowerless insignificant hopeless bare branches clattered together in the wind while others creaked and moaned as if in mock sorrow to see him leaving he tried not to think as he ran fir and spruce trees took over as the ground rose out of the valley his breath came in rapid pulls in the cold shadows of the forest floor the wind was a distant pursuer far overhead chasing after him shooing him along hounding him away from the happiest place he had ever been spongy mounds of verdant moss lay dotting the forest floor in the low places where mostly cedars grew looking like wedding cakes done up in an intense green sprinkled over with tiny chocolate brown scalelike cedar needles richard tiptoed on rocks sticking up above the water as he crossed a small stream as the little brook tumbled down the slope it went under rocks and boulders in places making an echoing drumming sound announcing him to the stalwart oaks along his march into imprisonment in the flat gray light he failed to see a reddish loop of cedar root it caught his foot and sent him sprawling facedown in the trail a final humiliation on his judgment and sentence of banishment as richard lay in the cold damp discarded leaves dead branches and other refuse of the forest he considered not getting up ever again he could just lie there and let it all end let the indifferent wind freeze his limbs stiff let the sneaky spiders and snakes and wolves come to bite him and bleed him to death and then finally the uncaring trees would cover him over never to be missed except by a few his vanishing a good riddance to most a messenger with a message no one wanted to heed a leader come too soon why not just let it end let silent death take them both to their peace and be done with it the scornful trees all watched to see what this unworthy man might do to see if he had the courage to get to his feet and face what was ahead he didnt know himself if he did death was easier and in that bottomless moment less painful to consider even kahlan as much as he loved her wanted something from him he could not give her a lie she wanted him to tell her that something he knew to be so was not he would do anything for her but he couldnt change what was at least she had enough faith in him to let him lead her away from the shadows of tyranny darkening the world even if she didnt believe him she was probably the only one willing of her own free will to follow him in truth he lay on the ground for only seconds regaining his senses from the fall and catching his breath as the thoughts flooded through his mindbrief seconds in which he allowed himself to be weak in exchange for how hard he knew everything to come would be weakness to balance the strength he would need doubt to balance his certainty of purpose fear to balance the courage he would have to call upon even as he wondered if he could get up he knew he would his convulsion of selfpity ended abruptly he would do anything for her even this a thousand times over even this with renewed resolve richard forced his mind away from the dominion of dark thoughts it wasnt so hopeless he knew better after all he had faced trials much more difficult than this one sister of the dark he had once gotten kahlan out of the clutches of five sisters of the dark this was but one he would defeat her too anger welled up at the thought of nicci thinking she could make them dance at the end of her selfish strings despair extinguished rage flooded in and then he was running again dodging trees as he cut corners off the trail he hurdled fallen trees and leaped over gaps in the rock shelves rather than taking the safe route down and up each shortcut or leap saved him a few precious seconds a broken tree limb snagged his pack yanking it from his shoulder he tried to hang on to it as he flew past but it slipped from his grasp and spilled across the ground richard exploded in fury as if the tree had done it on purpose just to taunt him in his rush he kicked the offending branch snapping it out of its dry socket he fell to his knees and scooped his things back into the pack clawing up moss along with gold and silver coins and a pine seedling along with the soap kahlan had given him he didnt have time to care as he shoved it all back in this time he put the pack onto his back rather than letting it hang from one shoulder he had been trying to save time before and it had cost him instead the path which in places was no more than sections of animal trails began to rise sharply occasionally requiring that he use both hands to hold on to rocks or roots as he climbed hed been up it enough times to know the sound handholds as cold as the day was richard had to wipe sweat from his eyes he skinned his knuckles on rough granite as he jammed his fingers into cracks for handholds in his minds eye nicci was riding too swiftly covering too much ground getting too far ahead he knew it had been foolhardy to take so much time before leaving thinking he could make up for it on the trail he wished he could have taken more time though to hold kahlan his insides were in agony at the thought of how heartbroken kahlan was he felt somehow that it was worse for her even if she was free and he was not that made it worse for her because in her freedom she had to restrain herself when she wanted nothing more than to come after him in bondage to a master richard had it easy he had only to follow orders he burst out of the trees onto the wider trail at the top of the pass nicci was nowhere to be seen he held his breath as he looked to the east fearing to spot her going down the back side of the pass beyond the high place where he stood he could see forests spread out before him with mountains to each side lifting the carpet of trees in the distance greater mountains yet soared to dizzying heights their peaks and much of their slopes stark white against the gloom of heavy gray sky richard didnt see any horse and rider but since the trail twisted down into the trees not far beyond where he stood that didnt really prove anything the top of the pass was a bald bit of open ledge with most of the rest of the horse trail winding through deep woods he quickly inspected the ground casting about for tracks hoping she wouldnt be too far ahead of him and he could catch her before she did something terrible his sense of doom eased when he found no tracks he peered out at the valley far below across the strawbrown meadow to their house it was too far away to see anyone he hoped kahlan would stay there for a few days as he had asked he didnt want her going to the army going to fight a losing war endangering her life for nothing richard understood kahlans desire to be with her people and to defend her homeland she believed she could make a difference she could not not yet maybe not ever richards vision was really nothing more than the acceptance of that reality shaking your sword at the sky didnt keep the sun from setting richard cast an appraising squint at the clouds for the last two days he had thought that the signs pointed to the first snow of the season soon rolling down onto their valley home by the look of the sky and the scent in the wind he judged he was right he knew he wasnt going to be able to escape nicci so easily as to be able to get back to kahlan within a few days he had invented that story for another reason once the weather shitted and the snow arrived up in these mountain highlands it tended to come in an onslaught if the storm was as big as he estimated by the signs it could be kahlan and cara would end up being stuck in their house until spring with all the food theyd put up as well as the supplies hed brought in they had plenty to last the two of them the firewood hed cut would keep them warm there she would be safe with the army she would be in constant danger the dappled mare walked out of the trees coming around a bend not far away niccis blue eyes were on richard from the first instant she appeared at the time the sisters of the light had taken him to the palace of the prophets in the old world richard had mistakenly believed kahlan wanted him taken away he didnt know or understand she had sent him away to save his life richard thought she didnt ever want to see him again while in captivity at the palace richard thought nicci was the personification of lust he was hardly able to find his voice when around her he had hardly been able to believe a creature of such physical perfection existed other than in daydreams now as he watched her swaying gently in her saddle as she walked her horse up the trail her intense blue eyes locked on his it seemed to him she wore her beauty with a kind of grim acceptance she had so completely lost her stunning presence that he couldnt even envision any reason for his onetime sentiment about her richard had since learned the true depths of what a real woman was what real love was and what real fulfillment was in that light nicci paled into insignificance as he watched her coming closer he was surprised to realize she looked sad she seemed almost to be sorry to find him there but more than that there seemed to be a shadow of relief passing across her countenance richard you lived up to my faith her voice suggested that it had been tenuous as best youre in a sweat would you like to rest her feigned kindness drove hot blood all the way up to his scalp he pulled his glare from her gentle smile and turned to the trail walking ahead of her horse he thought it best if he not say anything until he could get a grip on his rage not far down the trail they came to a black stallion with a white blaze on its face the big horse was picketed in a small grassy patch of open ground among towering pines your horse as i promised she said i hope you find him to your liking i judged him to be big and strong enough to carry you comfortably richard checked and found the smooth snaffle bit to his approval she wasnt abusing the animals with cruel bits used to dominate as he knew some of the sisters did the rest of the tack appeared sound the horse looked healthy richard took a few moments to introduce himself to the stallion he reminded himself that the horse was not the cause of his problems and he shouldnt let his attitude toward nicci affect how he treated this handsome animal he didnt ask the horses name he let it sniff his hand beneath its curled muzzle then stroked the stallions sleek black neck he patted its shoulder conveying a gentle introduction without words the powerful black stallion stamped his front hooves he was not yet all that pleased to meet richard for the time being there was no choice of routes there was only the one trail and it ran from the direction of the house where kahlan was back to the east richard took the lead so that he wouldnt have to look at nicci he didnt want to jump right on the stallion at first sight and make a bad impression that would take a lot of work to overcome better to let the horse get to know him first if just for a mile or so he held the reins slack under the stallions jaw and walked in front of him letting him get comfortable with following this strange new man putting his mind to the task of working with the horse helped divert him from thoughts that threatened to drag him under a sea of sorrow after a time the stallion seemed at ease with his new master and richard mounted without any ado the narrow trail precluded nicci walking her horse beside his her dappled mare snorted its displeasure at having to follow the stallion richard was pleased to know that he had already upset the order of things nicci offered no conversation sensing he supposed his mood he was going with her but there was no way she could hope to make him happy about it when it started getting dark richard simply dismounted beside a small brook where the horses could have a drink and tossed his things on the ground nicci wordlessly accepted his choice of campsite and unstrapped her bedroll from her saddle after shed taken it down off her horse she sat on her bedroll looking a little downcast more than anything else and ate some sausage along with a hard biscuit washed down with water after her first bite she lifted the sausage to him meeting his gaze in a questioning manner he didnt acknowledge the offer nicci assumed he declined and went back to eating when she was finished and had washed in the brook she went behind the thick undergrowth for a time when she came back she crawled into her bedroll without a word turned away from him and went to sleep richard sat on the mossy ground arms folded leaning the small of his back against his saddle he didnt sleep the entire night he sat watching nicci sleep in the light of the overcast sky lit from the other side by a nearly full moon watching her slow even breathing her slightly parted lips the slow pulse in the vein at the side of her throat thinking the whole time how he might overcome what she had done to them he thought about strangling her but he knew better he had used magic before he had in the past not only felt but unleashed incredible power through his gift he had faced situations of enormous danger involving a wide variety of magic richard had called upon his gift to conjure such power as no one living had ever seen and he had watched as it was brought to life at his conscious direction his gift was invoked mostly through anger and need he had an abundant supply of both he just didnt know how it could help him he didnt understand well enough what nicci had done to begin to think of what he might do to counter it with kahlans life at the other end of niccis invisible cord of magic he dared not do anything until he was sure of it he would be though he just had to figure it out experience told him that it was a reasonable supposition he told himself it was only a matter of time if he wanted to keep his sanity he knew he had to believe that the next morning without speaking a word to nicci he saddled the horses she sat watching him tighten the cinch straps making sure they werent pinching the horses as she sipped from a waterskin she took bread from her saddlebag lying beside her and asked if he would like a piece richard ignored her he would have been tired from not sleeping the whole cold night but his anger kept him wide awake under a leaden sky they rode at an easy but steady pace all that day through forests that seemed endless it felt good to have a warm horse under him throughout the day they continued their gradual descent from the higher country where the house was down into the lowlands toward dark the snow arrived at first it was just a few furtive flakes swirling through the air as it steadily increased it seemed to leach the color from trees and ground alike until the world turned white visibility steadily diminished as the snow thickened into a disorienting drifting solid wall he had to keep blinking the fat flakes from his eyes for the first time since leaving with nicci richard felt a sense of relief kahlan and cara up higher in the mountains would wake in the morning to several feet of snow they would decide that it was foolish to try to leave when they would believe it was only an early snow that would melt down enough in a few days for them to have an easier time of traveling up in those mountains that would be a mistake it would stay cold a storm would follow on the heels of this one and they would soon have snow up to the shutters they would be nervous about waiting but would probably decide that it was now more important for them to delay until a break in the weatherafter all there was no urgency in all likelihood they would end up safely stuck in the house for the winter when he eventually escaped from niccis talons richard would find kahlan snug in their home he decided that it would be foolish to let his anger dictate that they sleep on the open ground they could freeze to death he recalled all too well that if nicci died kahlan died when he spotted a big wayward pine he walked his horse off the trail brushing against branches dumped wet snow on him richard flicked it off his shoulders and shook it from his hair nicci glanced around confused but didnt object she dismounted as she waited to see what he was doing when he held a heavy bough to the side for her she frowned at him before poking her head inside for a look she straightened with an expression of childlike delight richard didnt return her wide grin inside under the thick boughs caked with snow was a still frigid world with the snow crusting the tree it was dark inside in the dim light richard dug a small fire pit and soon caught fire to the deadwood hed carefully stacked over shavings when the crackling flames built into a warm glow nicci gazed around in wonder at the inside of the wayward pine the spokelike branches over their heads were cast in a soft orange blush by the flickering light the lower trunk was bare of limbs leaving the inside of the tree a hollow cone with ample open space at the bottom for them nicci quietly warmed her hands by the fire looking contentednot like she was gloating that hed given in and found shelter and built a fire but contented she looked as if she had been through a great ordeal and now she could be at peace she looked like a woman expecting nothing but grateful for what she had richard hadnt had breakfast with her or anything the day before his bitter resolve gave way to his hunger so he boiled water from melted snow and cooked rice and beans starving wouldnt do him or kahlan any good without words he offered nicci half the rice and beans poured into the crust of one end of his loaf of bread she took the bread bowl and thanked him she offered him a sundried slice of meat richard stared at her thin delicate fingers holding out the piece of meat it reminded him of someone feeding a chipmunk he snatched the meat from her hand and tore off a chunk with his teeth to avoid her gaze he watched the fire as he ate his rice and beans out of the heel of bread other than the crackle of the fire the only sound was the thump of snow falling in clumps from limbs not stout enough to hold the load snowfalls often turned a forest to a place of eerie stillness sitting by the low fire after hed finished his meal feeling the warmth of the flames on his face the exhaustion from the long ride on top of his vigil the night before finally caught up with him richard stacked thicker wood on the dwindling fire and banked the coals around it he unrolled his bedroll on the opposite side of the fire from nicci as she silently watched him climbed in and as he thought about kahlan safe in their house fell soundly asleep the next day they were up early nicci said nothing but once they were mounted decisively cut her dappled mare in front of the black stallion and took the lead the snow had changed to a cold drizzling mist what snow was left on the ground had melted down to gray slush the lowlands were not quite ready to relinquish themselves to winters grip up higher where kahlan was it was colder and would be snowing in earnest as they rode carefully along a narrow road at the side of a mountain richard tried to watch the woods to keep his mind on other things but he couldnt help occasionally looking at nicci riding right in front of him it was cold and damp she wore a heavy black cloak over her black dress with her back straight her head held high and her blond hair fanned out over her cloak she looked regal he wore his dark forest clothes and hadnt shaved niccis dappled mare was dark gray almost black with lighter gray rings over its body its mane was dark gray as were the lightly feathered legs and the tail was a milky white it was one of the most handsome horses richard had ever seen he hated it it was hers by afternoon they intersected a trail running to the south nicci leading the way continued to the east before the day was out they would encounter a few more paths used mainly by an occasional hunter or trapper the mountains were inhospitable even if you cleared the ground of trees the soil was thin and rocky in a few places closer to hartland or other population centers to the north or south there were grassy slopes that were able to support thin flocks of sheep or goats as he felt the stallions muscles moving beneath him richard looked out at land he knew and loved he didnt know how long it would be until he was home againif ever he hadnt asked where they were going figuring nicci wouldnt likely tell him this soon that they were headed east didnt mean much just yet because their choice of routes was limited in the passive rhythm of the ride richards mind kept returning to his sword and how he had given it to kahlan at the time it had seemed the only thing to do he hated that he had given it to her the way he had yet he could think of no other way to afford her any protection he prayed she would never have to use the sword if she did hed given it a measure of his rage too at his belt he wore a fine knife but he felt naked without his sword he hated the ancient weapon the way it pulled dark things from within him and at the same time he missed it he often reminded himself of zedds words that it was merely a tool it was more too the sword was a mirror albeit one bound in magic capable of raining terrible destruction the sword of truth would annihilate anything before itflesh or steelas long as what stood before it was the enemy yet it could not harm a friend therein lay the paradox of its magic evil was defined solely by the perceptions of the person holding the sword by what he believed to be true richard was the true seeker and heir to the power of the sword created by the wizards in the great war it should be with him he should be protecting the sword a lot of things should be he told himself late in the afternoon they left the eastern path they were on and took one tending east and south richard knew the trail it would pass through a village in another day and then become a narrow road since nicci had deliberately taken the new route she must have known that too near dark they skirted the north shore of a goodsized lake a small raft of seagulls floated out near the middle of the rainswept water seagulls werent common in these parts but they were not unheard of either he recalled all the seabirds he had seen when he had been in the old world the sea had fascinated him in a cove on the far shore richard could just make out two men fishing on that side of the lake there was a trail worn to a deep rut over many generations by people coming up to fish from a hamlet to the south the two men sitting on a broad flat rock jutting out into the lake waved in greeting it wasnt often one encountered riders out here richard and nicci were too far away for the men to make them out the men probably assumed they were trappers nicci returned the wave in a casual manner as if to say good luck with the fishing wish we could join you they rounded a bend and finally disappeared from the men richard wiped his wet hair off his forehead as they rode along beside the lake listening to the small waves lapping at the muddy shore leaving the lake behind they cut into the forest as the trail rose on its way across a gentle slope nicci had put her hood up against the intermittent rain and drizzle purring through the trees a darkening gloom descended on the woods richard didnt want to do anything that would get kahlan killed the time had finally come when he had to speak when we come upon someone what am i to say i dont suppose you want me telling people youre a sister of the dark out snatching victims or do you wish me to play the part of a mute nicci gave him a sidelong glance you will be my husband as far as everyone is concerned she said without hesitation i expect you to adhere to that story under all circumstances for all practical purposes from now on you are my husband i am your wife richards fists tightened on the reins i have a wife you are not she im not going to pretend you are swaying gently in her saddle nicci seemed indifferent to his words or the emotion behind them she gazed skyward taking in the darkening sky it was too warm down in the lowlands for snow through occasional breaks in the low clouds though richard had caught glimpses of windswept mountain slopes behind them cloaked in thick white drifts kahlan was sure to be dry warm and stuck do you think you could find us another of those shelter trees nicci asked where it would be dry like last night id dearly love to get dry and warm between sporadic gaps in the pine trees and through the scramble of bare branches of the alder and ash richard surveyed the hillside descending before them yes good we need to have a talk chapter as richard dismounted near one of his shelter trees at the edge of a small slanted open patch of grassy ground nicci took the reins of his horse she could feel his smoldering glare on her back as she picketed the horses to the thick branches of an alder heavy with catkins the horses were hungry and promptly started cropping the wet grass without a word richard began casting about collecting deadwood from under dense thickets of spruce trees where she supposed it might be a little dryer she watched him not openly but casually covertly from the corner of her eye as he went about his chore he was everything she remembered and more it was not so much that he was just big physically but he had a commanding presence that had matured since she had last seen him before she had been tempted at times to think of him as little more than a boy no more now he was a powerful wild stallion trapped in a pen of his own construction she kept her distance letting him kick at the walls of that pen it would bring her no gain to taunt this wild beast taunting him torturing him in his anguish was the last thing in the world she wanted nicci could understand his smoldering anger it was to be expected she could plainly see his feelings for the mother confessor and hers for him the integrity of the walls of his pen consisted of nothing more than the gossamer fence rails of his feelings for her while nicci sympathized with his pain she knew that she of all people could do nothing to alleviate it it would take time for his hurt to heal over time the rails of his fence would be replaced by others someday he would come to terms with what had to be someday he would come to understand the truth of the things she intended to show him someday he would come to understand the necessity of what she was doing it was for the best at the edge of the clearing nicci settled herself on a gray slab of granite that by the unique angles of its broken face had once belonged to the ledge poking out from under the deep green of balsam and spruce behind her but over time had been moved away from it by the inexorable effort of nature leaving a gap the shape of a jagged lightning bolt between their oncemated edges nicci sat with her back straight a habit instilled in her from a young age by her mother and watched richard going about unsaddling the horses he let them both eat some oats from canvas nosebags while he collected rocks from the clearing at first she couldnt imagine what he was doing when he took them along with the wood he had collected in under the boughs of the shelter tree she realized he must be going to use the rocks to ring a fire pit he was inside a long time so she knew he must be working on building a fire out of the wet wood she could have used her gift to help had her gift enough power left to light wet wood it didnt richard seemed up to the task though she had watched him light a fire the night before starting it in birch bark shavings and twigs nicci had never been one for such outdoor activities she left him to it and set about the small chore of repairing her horses cinch strap the rain had let up for the time being leaving behind the tingle of a fine mist against her cheeks as she worked at knotting the loose cords of the heavy twine strap back onto its buckle she heard little crackling sounds coming from under the tree the sputtering and popping told her that richard had gotten the fire going she heard the clang of a pot on rock so she reasoned that we was leaving water to boil when the fire got hot enough sitting on the slab of granite nicci quietly worked a tangle out of the cinch strap as he came back out to care for the horses free of the nosebags the horses drank from a pool of water in a depression in the smooth tan ledge though richard wore dark clothes appropriate for the woods they could not diminish his bearing his grayeyed gaze swept over her taking in what she was doing he left her to her knot work as he went about his chore of currying the horses his big hands worked smoothly with a sure touch she was certain the horses would appreciate having all the caked mud cleaned from their legs she would were she they you said we needed to talk richard finally said to her as he stroked the curry comb over the mares rump whisking away a last spatter of mud i presume a talk consists of you dictating the terms of my imprisonment i imagine you have rules for your captives by his icy inflection it sounded as if he had decided to provoke her a little to test her reaction nicci set the cinch strap aside she met his challenging tone with one of genuine sympathy instead just because something has happened to you before richard dont assume that means it will again fate does not give birth to the same child over and over each is different this is not like the two times before her response as well as the compassion in her eyes appeared to have caught him off guard he stared at her a moment before crouching to replace the curry comb in a pocket in the saddlebag and take out a pick two times before there was no way he could miss her meaning his blank expression didnt betray what he might be thinking as he lifted the stallions right forefoot to pick its hoof clean i dont know what youre talking about just as he probed the hoof with his pick she knew he was probing her as well wanting to know just how much she knew of those two times and what she thought was different this time he would surely want to know how she intended to avoid the mistakes of his past captors any warrior would he was not yet ready to accept how fundamentally different this was richard worked his way around the big black horse cleaning its hooves until he ended at the left forefoot close to her as he finished and let the stallions leg down nicci stood when he turned around she was close enough to feel his warm breath on her cheek he fixed her with his glare a look that was no longer as unsettling to her as it had been at first she found herself instead of shrinking back staring into that penetrating gaze of his marveling that she had him she finally had him it could have been no more wondrous to her had she somehow managed to bottle the moon and stars you are a prisoner nicci said your anger and resentment are entirely understandable i would never have expected you to be pleased about this richard but it is not the same as those times before she gently gripped his throat he was surprised but sensed he was in no immediate danger before she said in quiet solace you had a collar around your neck both times you were at the palace of the prophets where i was taken she felt him swallow but the other she released his throat i do not use a collar as did the sisters of the light to control you to give you pain in order to make you obey or to put you through their ridiculous tests my purpose is nothing like that she pulled her cloak forward over her shoulders as she smiled distantly remember when you first came to the palace of the prophets remember the speech you gave richards words were brittle with caution not exactly she was still staring off into the memories i do it was the first time i saw you i remember every word richard said nothing but in his eyes she could see the shadows of his mind working you were in a ragenot unlike now you held out a red leather rod hanging around your neck remember richard i guess i did his suspicious glare broke a lot has happened since then i guess id put it out of my mind you said that you had been collared before you said that the person who had once put that collar around your neck had brought you pain to punish you to teach you his posture shifted to stiff wariness what of it she focused once more on his gray eyes eyes that watched her every blink her every breath as he weighed her every word it was all going into some inner calculation she knewsome inner master analysis of how high was his fence and if he could jump it he could not i always wondered about that she said about what you had said about having been in a collar before some months back we captured a woman in red leather a mordsith his color paled just a little she said she was searching for lord rahl to protect him i persuaded her to tell me everything she knew about you im not from dhara his voice sounded confident nevertheless she sensed a subterranean torrent of dread a mordsith would know next to nothing about me nicci reached inside her cloak for the thing she had brought with her she let the small red leather rod roll from her fingers to fall to the ground at his feet he stiffened oh but she did richard she knew a great deal she smiled a small smile not pleasure nor mockery but in distant sadness at the memory of that brave woman she knew denna she had been at the peoples palace in dhara where you were taken after denna captured you she knew all about it richards gaze fell away on bended knee he reverently picked the red leather rod off the wet ground he wiped the thing clean on his pant leg as if it were priceless a mordsith would not tell you anything he stood and boldly met her gaze a mordsith is a product of torture she would say only enough to make you believe she was cooperating she would feed you a clever lie to deceive you she would die before speaking any words to harm her lord rahl with one long finger nicci pulled a sodden strand of blond hair off her cheek you underestimate me richard that woman was very brave i felt great sorrow for her but there were things i wanted to know she told it all she told me everything i wanted to know nicci could see the rage rising in him bringing a flush to his cheeks that was not what she had intended or wanted she was telling him the truth but he rejected it trying to overlay it instead with his own false assumptions a moment passed and that truth finally found its way into his eyes the rage departed reluctantly replaced by the weight of sadness that made him swallow at his grief for this woman nicci had expected no less from him apparently nicci whispered denna was very talented at torture i neither need nor want your sympathy but i did feel sympathy richard for what that woman put you through for no purpose but to give pain thats the worst kind of pain isnt itpain to no benefit no confession the pointlessness of it only adds to its torture that was what you suffered nicci gestured to the red leather weapon in his fist this woman did not suffer that kind of pain i want you to know that he pressed his lips tight in mistrust as he looked away from her eyes gazing out at the gathering darkness you killed her this mordsith named denna but not before she did unspeakable things to you so i did richards expression hardened with the implied menace of his words you threatened the sisters of the light because they too collared you you told them they were not good enough to lick the boots of that woman denna and so they were not you told the sisters that they thought they held the leash to your collar but you promised them that they would find that what they held was a bolt of lightning dont think for one moment that i dont understand your feelings in this or your resolve nicci reached out and tapped the center of his chest but this time richard the collar is around your heart and it is kahlan who will be forfeit should you make a mistake his fists at the ends of his rigid arms tightened kahlan would rather die than have me be a slave at her expense she begged me to forfeit her life for my freedom a day may dawn when it becomes necessary for me to honor her request nicci felt a weary boredom at his threats people so often resorted to threatening her that is entirely up to you richard but you make a great mistake if you think i care she couldnt begin to recall how many times jagang had made solemn threats on her life or how many of those times his hands had tightened around her throat choking the life out of her after he had beaten her senseless kadar kardeef had at times been no less brutal shed lost count of the times she fully expected to die starting with the time when she was little and the man pulled her into the alley to rob her but such men were not the only ones who promised her suffering i cannot tell you the promises the keeper of the underworld has made to me in my dreams promises of unending suffering that is my fate so please richard do not think to frighten me with your petty threats more savage men than you have made credible promises as to my doom i long ago accepted my fate and ceased to care her arms felt heavy at her sides she felt empty of feeling thoughts of jagang of the keeper reminded her that her life was meaningless only what she had seen in richards eyes gave her a hint that there might be something more something she had yet to discover or understand what is it you want richard demanded nicci returned her mind to the here and now i told you your part in life now is as my husband that is the way it is going to beif you wish kahlan to live ive told you the truth about all of it if you come with me and do the simple things i ask such as assuming the role of my husband then kahlan will live a long life i cant say it will be entirely happy of course for i know she loves you how long do you think you can hold me nicci in frustration richard ran his fingers back through his wet hair it isnt going to work whatever it is you want how long until you tire of this absurd sham her eyes narrowed studying his profound innocence if not ignorance my dear boy i was born into this wretched world one hundred and eightyone years past you know that do you suppose i have not learned a great deal of patience in all that time though our bodies may look about the same age and in many ways i am no older than you i have lived near to seven of your lifetimes do you honestly believe that you would have patience to exceed mine do you think me some young foolish girl for you to outwit or outwait his demeanor cooled nicci i and dont think to make friends with me or win me over i am not denna or verna or warren or even pasha for that matter im not interested in friends he turned a little and ran a hand over the stallions shoulder when the horse snorted and stamped a hoof at the smell of the woodsmoke curling out from the upper limbs of the shelter tree i want to know what vile thing you did to that poor woman to make her tell you about denna the mordsith told me in return for a favor frowning his incredulity he turned to her once more what favor could you possibly do for a mordsith i cut her throat richard closed his eyes as his head sank with grief for this unknown woman who had died because of him he clenched her weapon in his fist to his heart his voice lost its fire i dont suppose you know her name it was this his empathy for others even others he didnt know that not only made him the man he was but shackled him his concern for others would also be the thing that eventually brought him to understand the virtue in what she was doing he too would then willingly work for the righteous cause of the order i do nicci said hania hania he looked heartsick i didnt even know her richard with a finger under his chin nicci gently brought his face up i want you to know that i did not torture her i found her being tortured i was not happy about what i saw i killed the man who did it hania was beyond any help i offered her release from her pain a quick end if she would tell me about you i never asked her to betray you in any way that the order would want i asked only about your past about your first captivity i wanted to understand what you said that first day at the palace of the prophets thats all richard didnt look relieved as she had intended you withheld that quick release as you call it until she had given you what you wanted that makes you a party to her torture in the gloom nicci looked away in pain and anguish at the memory of that bloody deed it had long since lost its ability to make her feel anything more than a ghost of emotions there were so many needing release from their sufferingso many old and sick so many wailing children so many destitute and hopeless and poor this woman had merely been another of lifes victims needing release it was for the best nicci had renounced the creator in order to do his work and sworn her soul to the keeper of the underworld she had to only one as evil as she would fail to feel any fitting feelings any proper compassion for all the suffering and desperate need it was grim ironyfaithfully serving the needy in such a way perhaps you see it that way richard nicci said in a hoarse voice as she stared into the numb nightmare of memories i did not neither did hania before i cut her throat for her she thanked me for what i was about to do richards eyes offered no mercy and why did you make her tell you about meabout denna nicci snagged her cloak tighter on her shoulders isnt it obvious you couldnt possibly make the same mistake denna made you arent the woman she was nicci she was tired the first night he had not slept she knew she had felt his eyes on her back she knew how much he hurt turned away from him she had wept silently at the hate his eyes held at the burden of being the one to have to do what was best the world was such an evil place perhaps richard she said in a soft voice you will someday teach me the difference she was so very tired the night before when he had succumbed to his weariness and turned away from her to sleep nicci had in turn stayed awake all night watching him in his sound sleep as she felt the connection of magic to the mother confessor the connection brought nicci great empathy for her as well it was all for the best for now nicci said lets get inside out of this foul weather im cold and im hungry we need to get some rest too and as ive told you we have things to discuss first she couldnt lie to him she knew she couldnt tell him everything of course but she dared not lie to him in the things she did tell him the dance had begun chapter richard broke up the sausage nicci gave him from her saddlebag and tossed it in the pot with the simmering rice the things she had told him kept shouting in his mind as he tried to fit them into their proper order he didnt know how much of what she had said he dared to believe he feared it was all true nicci just didnt seem to need to lie to himat least not about what she had told him so far she didnt seem as hostile as he thought she would have to be if anything she seemed melancholy perhaps because of what she had donealthough he had trouble believing that a confessed sister of the dark would suffer a guilty conscience it was probably just some bizarre part of her act some artifice directed toward her ends he stirred the pot of rice with a stick hed peeled the bark off of you said there were things to discuss he rapped the stick clean on the edge of the pot i assume that means there are orders you wish to issue nicci blinked as if hed caught her thinking about something else she looked out of place sitting prim and straight in a wayward pine dressed as she was in her fine black dress richard would never before have ever thought of nicci outofdoors much less sitting on the ground the very idea had always seemed ludicrous to him her dress constantly made him think of kahlan not only because of it being so completely opposite that it evoked the comparison but also because he so vividly recalled nicci connected to kahlan by that awful rope of magic that memory twisted him in agony orders nicci folded her hands in her lap and met his gaze oh yes i have a few requests i wish you to honor first you may not use your gift not at all not in any way is that clear since as i recall you have no love of the gift this should be neither a burden nor a difficult request for you to follow especially because there is something you do love which would not survive such a betrayal do you understand her cold blue eyes conveyed the threat perhaps even better than her words richard gave her a single nod committing himself to what exactly he wasnt entirely sure at the moment he poured her steaming dinner in a shallow wooden bowl and handed it to her along with a spoon nicci smiled her thanks he set the pot on the ground between his legs and took a spoonful of rice blowing on it until it was cool enough to eat he watched her from the corner of his eye as she took a dainty taste beyond her physical perfection nicci had a singularly expressive face she seemed to go cold and blank when she was unhappy or when she meant to convey anger threat or displeasure she didnt really scowl the way other people did when they felt those emotions rather a look of cool detachment descended on her that look was in its own way far more disturbing it was her impenetrable armor on the other hand she was expressively animated when she was pleased or thankful even more than that though such pleasure or gratitude appeared genuine he remembered her as aloof and while she still possessed a noble bearing to some extent her air of reticence had lifted to reveal an innocent delight in any kindness or even simple courtesy richard still had bread cara had baked for him he hated sharing that bread with this evil woman but it now seemed a childish consideration he tore off a piece and offered it to nicci she took it with the reverence due something greater than mere bread i also expect you to keep no secrets from me she said after another bite you would not like me to discover you were doing so husbands and wives have no need for secrets richard supposed not but they were hardly husband and wife rather than say so he said instead you seem to know a lot about how husbands and wives behave rather than rising to his bait she gestured with her bread at her bowl this is very good richard very good indeed what is it you want nicci what is the purpose of this absurd pretense the firelight played across her alabaster face and lent her hair a torrid color it didnt in reality possess i took you because i need an answer which i believe you will provide richard broke a stout branch in two across his knee you said husbands and wives have no need for secrets he used half the branch to push the burning wood together before placing the branch atop the fire then arent wives too supposed to be honest of course her hand with the bread lowered she rested her wrist over her knee i will be honest with you too richard then whats the question you said you took me because you need an answer you think i can provide whats the question nicci stared oft again once more looking anything but the grim captor she looked as if memories or perhaps fears haunted her it was somehow more unsettling than the sneer of an armed guard outside of the bars of his cage the rain outside had increased to a dull roar theyd made camp just in time richard couldnt help but remember the cozy times hed had in wayward pines huddled beside kahlan at the thought of kahlan his heart sank i dont know nicci finally said i honestly dont richard i seek something but i will only know it when i find it after nearly all my one hundred and eighty one years without knowing it existed i finally saw the first hint of it not long ago she seemed to be looking through him again to some point beyond her voice too seemed to be addressed to that distant place her vision beheld that was when you stood in a collar before all those sisters and defied them perhaps i will find the answer when i understand what it was i saw that day in that room it was not just you but you were its center her eyes focused once more on his face she spoke with gentle assurance until then you will live i have no intention of harming you you need fear no torture from me im not like themthat woman denna or like the sisters of the light using you for their games dont patronize me you are using me for your own game no less than they used me for theirs she shook her head i want you to know richard that i have nothing but respect for you i probably have more respect for you than any person you have ever met thats why i took you you are a rare person richard im a war wizard youve just never seen one of those before she spurned the notion with a dismissive flick of her hand please dont try to impress me with your power im not in the mood for such silliness richard knew it was no idle boast on her part she was a sorceress of remarkable ability he doubted he had any hope of outsmarting her knowledge of magic she was not acting the way he had expected a sister of the dark would act though richard put his anger hurt and heartache aside for the moment knowing he had to face what was rather than putting his hope in wishes and spoke to nicci in the same gentle fashion she used with him i dont understand what it is you want of me nicci she shrugged in an involuntary gesture of frustration neither do i until i do you will do as i ask and everything will be fine i will not harm you considering the circumstances do you really expect me to take your word im telling you the truth richard if you were to twist your ankle i would like a good wife put my shoulder under your arm and help you to walk from now on i am devoted to you and you to me he could only blink at how crazy this was he almost thought she might be mad almost he knew that would be too easy an answer as zedd always said nothing was ever easy and if i choose not to go along with your wishes again she shrugged then kahlan dies i understand that but if she dies then you lose the collar around my heart she fixed him with cold blue eyes your point then you couldnt get what you wanted from me you would have no leverage i dont have what i want now so i would be losing nothing besides if you were to do that then emperor jagang would welcome your head as a gift i would no doubt be showered with gifts and riches richard didnt think nicci wanted gifts or riches showered on her she was a sister of the dark after all and he supposed she could manage to be so showered if she really wished it even so he was sure his head would have a price and she could salvage that much out of it if he proved ungovernable she might not care for gifts and riches but if there was one thing she did want it had to be power he was pretty sure she could gain a good measure of that should she slay the enemy of the imperial order he bent over the pot between his legs and went back to his dinner and his dark thoughts talking to her was useless they just went around in circles richard she said in a quiet tone drawing his eyes to her gaze you think im doing this to hurt you or to defeat you because you are the enemy of the order i am not i told you my true reasons so when you finally find this answer you seek in return for my help then you will let me go it was not really meant as a question but as trenchant incrimination go she stared down into her bowl of rice and sausage stirring it around as if it might reveal a secret she looked up no richard then i will kill you i see he hardly thought that was a way to encourage his cooperation in her search but he didnt say so and kahlan after you kill me i mean you have my word that if i decide i must kill you as long as i live she will too i have no ill will toward her he tried to find solace in that much of it for some reason he believed nicci knowing that kahlan would be all right gave him courage he could endure what was to happen to him if only she would be all right it was a price he was willing to pay so wife where are we going where is it youre taking me nicci didnt look at him but instead used her bread to sop up some of her dinner she considered his question as she nibbled who are you fighting richard who is your enemy she took another small bite of her bread jagang jagang and his imperial order like an instructor correcting him nicci slowly shook her head no you are wrong i think perhaps you are in need of answers too games she was playing foolish games with him richard ground his teeth but held his temper in check then who nicci who or what am i fighting if it is not jagang that is what i hope to show you she watched his eyes in a way he found unsettling i am going to take you to the old world to the heart of the order to show you what you are fightingthe taste nature of what you believe to be your enemy richard frowned why nicci smiled lets just say it amuses me you mean were going back to tanimura back to where you lived all that time as a sister no we are going to the heart and soul of the old world alturrang jagangs homeland the name means roughly the creators chosen richard felt a chill run up his spine you expect to take me richard rahl there into the heart of enemy territory i hardly doubt we will be living as husband and wife for long besides not using your magic you will not use the name associated with that magicrahlbut instead the name you grew up with richard cypher without your magic or your name no one will know you are anyone but a humble man with his wife that is exactly what you shall bewhat we both shall be richard sighed well if the enemy should find im more i guess a sister of the dark can exert her influence no i cant richards eyes turned up what do you mean i cant use my power gooseflesh prickled his arms what its devoted to the link with kahlan to keeping her alive that is how a maternity spell works it requires a prodigious amount of power to even establish such a complex spell much less maintain it my power must be invested into the labor of preserving the living link a maternity spell leaves nothing to spare i doubt i could make a spark if we have any trouble you will have to handle it of course i can at any time call upon my ability as a sorceress but to do so i would have to draw the power from our link if i do that without her near kahlan dies alarm raced through him but what if you accidentally i wont as long as you take good care of me kahlan will be safe enough if however i should fall off my horse and break my neck her neck snaps too as long as you take good care of me you are taking good care of her this is why its important that we live as husband and wifeso that you can be close at hand and so that i can guide and help you too it will be a difficult life with both of us living without our power just as any other married couple but believe this to be necessary if i am to find what i seek from you do you understand he wasnt sure he really did but he said yes anyway numb dismay swamped him he would never have believed this woman would have willingly given up her power for some unspecified knowledge the very idea of it unleashed cold panic through his veins richard couldnt make sense of it with his mind groping blindly in a world gone insane he spoke without even considering his words im already married ill not sleep with you as your husband nicci blinked in surprise then let out a dainty titter covering it with the back of her hand not in shyness but at his presumption richard felt his ears heating that is not the way in which i want you richard richard cleared his throat good in the quiet of the wayward pine with the rain outside falling in a gentle patter and the glowing checkered wood hissing softly niccis focused intense resolute expression turned very cold and very still but if i should decide i do richard you will comply with that too nicci was a beautiful woman the kind of woman most any man would eagerly accept it was hardly that though that made him believe her it was the look in her eyes never had the vague possibility of the act of sex seemed so vicious her voice lost the conversational quality it went on in a lifeless drone a thing not human pronouncing a sentence on his life a sentence he himself would enforce or kahlan would die you will act as my husband you will provide for us as any husband would you will care for me and i for you in the sense of worldly needs i will mend your shirts and cook your meals and wash your clothes you will provide us with a living niccis leaden words slammed into him with the deliberate methodical force of a beating delivered with an iron bar you will never see kahlan againyou must understand thatbut as long as you do as i wish you will know she lives in that way you will be able to show your love for her every day she wakes she will know you are keeping her alive you have no other way to show her your love he felt sick to his stomach he stared off into memories of another place and time and if i choose to end it the weight of such madness was so crushing that he earnestly considered it rather than be your slave then perhaps that is the form the knowledge i seek will take maybe that senseless end will be what i must learn she brought her first and second fingers together in a snipping motion simulating the cutting of the umbilical cord of magic that sustained kahlans life one last evil convulsion to finally confirm the senselessness of existence it dawned on richard that this woman could not be threatened because she was a creature who he was beginning to understand welcomed any terrible outcome of all there is to me in this world he whispered in dim agony more to himself and to kahlan than to his implacable captor there is only one thing that is irreplaceable kahlan if i must be a slave in order for kahlan to live then i shall be a slave richard realized nicci was silently studying his face he met her gaze briefly then looked away unable to bear the terrible scrutiny of her beautiful blue eyes while he held the image of kahlans love in his mind whatever you shared with her whatever happiness joy or pleasure will always be yours richard nicci seemed almost to be peering inside him reading the pages of his past written in his mind treasure those memories they will have to sustain you you will never see her again nor she you that chapter of your life is ended you both have new lives now you may as well get used to it because that is the reality of the situation the reality of what was not the world as he would wish it he himself had told kahlan that they must act according to the reality of what was and not waste their precious lives wishing for things that could not be richard ran his fingertips across his forehead as he tried to hold his voice steady i hope you dont expect me to learn to be pleased with you i am the one richard who expects to learn fists at his side richard shot to his feet and what is it you wish this knowledge for he demanded in unrestrained violent bitterness why is it so important to you as punishment richard stared in stunned disbelief what i wish to hurt richard she smiled distantly richard sank back to the ground why he whispered nicci folded her hands in her lap pain richard is all that can reach that cold dead thing within me that is my life pain is the only thing for which i live he stared numbly at her he thought about his vision there was nothing he could do to fight the advance of the imperial order he could think of nothing he could do to fight his fate with this woman if not for kahlan he would at that moment have thrown himself into a battle with nicci that would have decided it once and for all he would have willingly gone to his death fighting this cruel insanity except his reason denied him that he had to live so that kahlan would live for that and that alone he had to put one foot in front of the other and march into oblivion chapter kahlan yawned as she rubbed her eyes squinting she arched her back and stretched her sore muscles the terrible desperate memories swooped in from the sleepdarkened corners of her mind leaving little chance for any other thoughts to long survive she was beyond the realm of merciless anguish and crying she had entered the sovereign dominion of unbridled anger her fingers found the cold steel scabbard of his sword lying at her side it felt alive with icy rage that the carving of spirit and her memories were about all she had of him there wasnt a lot of firewood but since they wouldnt be needing much more anyway kahlan put another stick of what was left into the fire she squatted holding her hands close over the top of the feeble flames hoping to bring feeling to her numb fingers the wind shifted a little pungent smoke billowed up into her face making her cough the smoke rolled past her face and followed the rock overhang up and out from their shelter cara was gone so kahlan pushed the little pot of water back onto the fire to warn it for tea for when the mordsith returned cara was probably visiting their makeshift privy or maybe she was checking the traps theyd set the night before for rabbits kahlan didnt hold out any real hope that they would catch a rabbit for their breakfast not in this weather they had brought enough provisions in any event through slits in the clouds the crimson light of a cold crisp dawn penetrated gaps in the snowcrusted limbs of trees to slant in under the rock overhang casting everything in their little campsite in a blush glow the two of them had tried without avail to find a wayward pine the screen of trees along with a short wall of boughs she and cara had cut and placed the night before to protect them from the wind as richard had taught them to do shielded the secluded spot with their improvements it had proven a fit shelter they had been lucky to find it in the driving snow outside the snow was fairly deep but in the shelter they had had a relatively dry if cold night kahlan and cara had huddled together under blankets and their thick wolf fur mantles to keep each other warm kahlan wondered where richard was and if he was cold too she hoped not probably since he had started out a few days sooner he had been lucky and had made it down to the lowlands already avoiding the snow cara and kahlan had stayed in their home as he had asked for three days snow had arrived the morning after hed left kahlan had been tempted to wait for a break in the weather before they started out but she had learned a bitter lesson from sister nicci dont wait act when richard didnt return kahlan and cara had immediately struck out it was hard going at first they struggled through the drifts leading the horses at times riding them occasionally they couldnt see very far and most of the time had to keep the wind from the west at their right shoulder as their only clue as to which direction they faced it was dangerous traveling over the passes in such conditions for a time they feared that they had made a terrible mistake leaving the safety of their house through a break in the clouds just before dark the night before as they were gathering boughs for their shelter theyd caught a glimpse of the lower hills they were green and brown not white they would be below the snow line before long kahlan was confident that they were through the worst of it as she stuffed an arm into a sleeve pulling another shirt on over the top of the two she was wearing kahlan heard the crunch of snow underfoot when she realized it was more than one pair of footsteps she stood up in a rush cara pushed her way through the boughs of the sheltering trees we have company she announced in a grim voice kahlan saw that caras fist held her agiel a bundled up squat woman came through the trees following in caras footsteps under layers of cloaks scarves and other dangling corners of thick cloth kahlan was surprised to recognize ann the old prelate of the sisters of the light behind ann came a taller woman her scarves pushed back to reveal graying brown hair loose to her shoulders she had an intense steady calculating gaze that had earned her an enduring network of fine wrinkles radiating out from the corners of her deepset eyes her brow was less steady twitching down several times toward her prominent nose she looked like a woman who used a switch to teach children kahlan ann rushed forward seizing kahlans arms oh my dear its so good to see you she looked back when kahlan glanced up behind her this is one of my sisters alessandra alessandra may i introduce the mother confessorand richards wife the woman stepped forward and smiled the pleasant grin completely altered her face instantly erasing the severity of it with open good nature it was a somewhat disorienting transformation making her seem like two different people sharing one face or kahlan thought perhaps one person with two faces mother confessor its so good to meet you ann has told me all about you and what a wonderful person you are her eyes took in the campsite with a quick glance im so happy for you and richard anns eyes turned left and right searching her gaze snagged on the sword wheres richard cara wouldnt say a word she looked up into kahlans eyes dear creator she whispered whats wrong whats happened wheres richard kahlan finally managed to unclench her teeth one of your sisters took him ann pushed her scarves back off her gray hair and took ahold of kahlans arm again the top of anns head came up only to kahlans chest but she looked at least twice as wide what are you talking about what do you mean a sister took him which sister nicci kahlan growled ann pulled back nicci sister alessandra gasped sister nicci she crossed both hands over her heart sister nicci isnt one of anns nicci is a sister of the dark oh im well aware of that kahlan said we have to go get him back ann said at once hes not safe with her theres no telling what nicci might sister alessandras mouth snapped shut the wind carried a sparkling gust into their faces momentarily whiting out the red dawn kahlan blinked the snow away cara in her red leather with both a cloak and her heavy fur mantle over top ignored it the other two women brushed their heavy woolen mittens across their eyes kahlan everything will be all right ann said in a reassuring voice tell us now whats happened tell us everything is he hurt kahlan swallowed against her rising rage nicci used what she called a maternity spell on me anns mouth fell open sister alessandra gasped again are you sure ann asked in a careful tone are you sure that was what it was how do you know for sure she slammed some kind of magic into me ive never heard of such a spell all i know is that it was definitely powerful magic and she said it was called a maternity spell she said that it connects us somehow through that magic alessandra took a step forward that doesnt make it a maternity spell when cara used her agiel on nicci kahlan said it dropped me to my knees just the same as if cara had used the agiel on me ann and alessandra shared a silent look but but if she were to ann stammered kahlan voiced what ann was trying to say without saying it if she were to desire it nicci could snip that cord of magic and i would die that was the means by which she captured richard she promised i would live if richard went with her richard surrendered himself into slavery to save my life it cant be ann said touching mittencovered fingers to her chin nicci wouldnt know how to use such an unusual spellshes too young besides such a rare spell requires great power she must have done something else and just said that it was a maternity spell nicci couldnt do a maternity spell yes she could sister alessandra said in reluctant disagreement she has the power and ability it would only have required someone with the specialized knowledge teaching her nicci doesnt have any great passion for magic but she is as able as they come lidmila ann whispered to alessandra in sudden realization jagang has lidmila kahlan turned a suspicious glare on sister alessandra and how do you know so much more about niccis ability than the prelate herself sister alessandra gathered her open cloak back together her face lost its warmth and reverted to a scowlthis time though with bitterness in the set of her mouth i brought nicci in to the palace of the prophets when she was but a child i was responsible for her upbringing and i guided her training in the use of her gift i know her better than anyone i know her darker powers because i too was a sister of the dark im the one who brought her to the keeper kahlan could feel herself rocking with the force of her hammering heart so you too are a sister of the dark was ann said lifting a cautionary hand before kahlan the prelate came into jagangs camp and rescued me not just from jagang but from the keeper too i once again serve the light the incandescent smile again transformed alessandras face ann brought me back to the creator as far as kahlan was concerned the claim was not worth the effort of confirmation how did you find us ann ignored the terse question we must hurry we must get richard away from nicci before she delivers him to jagang kahlan kept her glare on alessandra while she answered ann she isnt taking him to jagang she said she isnt acting on behalf of his excellency but on behalf of herself those were her words she said she had removed jagangs ring from her lip and that she wasnt afraid of him did she say why then she was taking richard ann asked or at least where kahlan moved her scrutiny back to ann she said she was taking him into oblivion oblivion ann gasped i asked you a question kahlan said anger seeping into her voice how did you find us ann tapped her waist i have a journey book i used it to communicate with verna back with our forces verna told me about the messengers coming to see you thats how i knew where to find you lucky i came as soon as i did we nearly missed you i cant tell you how happy i am to see you have recovered kahlan we were so worried kahlan saw that cara standing behind the two women still had her agiel clenched in her fist kahlan didnt need an agiel her confessors power boiled but an impulse away she wouldnt again make an error for the sake of caution the journey book of course then verna would have told you about richards vision that he must not lead our troops against the order ann nodded reluctantly apparently not eager to discuss such a vision then a few days ago verna sent a message when we were almost here that the dharans are in quite a state because they suddenly lost their sense of direction to richard she said they are still protected from the dream walker by the bond to their lord rahl but they suddenly lost their sense of where he is nicci cloaked his bond from us cara said in a growl well we have to find him ann said we have to get him away from nicci hes our only chance whatever hes thinking its nonsense and we will have to set him straight but first we must get him back he has to lead our forces against the imperial order he is the one named in prophecy thats why youre here kahlan whispered to herself you heard from verna about his declining to lead the army or even to give orders you journeyed here in hopes of forcing him to fight he must ann insisted he must not kahlan said he has come to realize that if he leads us into battle we will lose the cause of liberty for generations to come he said he came to realize that people dont yet understand freedom and wont fight for it he must simply prove himself to the people anns scowl reddened he must prove himself their leader which he has already begun to do and they will follow him richard says that he has come to understand that it is not he who must prove himself to the people but the people who must now prove themselves to him ann blinked in astonishment why thats nonsense is it of course it is the boy was named in prophecy centuries ago ive been waiting hundreds of years for him to be born in order for him to lead us in this struggle really then who are you to try to countermand richards decisionif you are so set on following him he has come to his decision if he is the leader you want then you must abide by his lead and therefore his decision but this is not what prophecy demands richard doesnt believe in prophecy he believes we make our own destiny im coming to see the grounds of his assertion that the belief in prophecy artificially alters events it is the misplaced faith in prophecy itselfin some mystical outcomethat harms peoples lives anns eyes grew round with dismay and then narrowed richard is the one named in prophecy to lead us against the imperial order this is a struggle for the very existence of magic in this worlddont you understand that richard was born to fight this fight we have to get him back this is all your fault kahlan whispered what anns frown changed to a tolerant smile kahlan what are you talking about her voice backslid to genial you know me you know our struggle for the survival of freedom of magic if richard does not lead us we have no chance kahlan threw her arm out and seized a startled sister alessandra by the throat the womans eyes went wide dont move kahlan said through gritted teeth or i will unleash my confessors power ann held her hands up imploring kahlan have you lost your mind let her be calm down with her other hand kahlan pointed down at the fire the journey book throw it in the fire what im not going to do any such thing now kahlan said through her clenched teeth or sister alessandra will be mine when i finish with her cara will see to it you throw that journey book in the fire if you have to do so with broken fingers ann glanced at the mordsith towering over her shoulder kahlan i know youre upset and i completely understand but were on the same side in this we love richard too we too wish to stop the imperial order from taking the whole world we we if it wasnt for you and your sisters none of this would be happening this is all your fault not jagangs fault not the imperial orders fault but yours have you lost your you alone bear responsibility for what is befalling the world just as jagang has his ring through the lip of his slaves youve had yours through the nose of yoursrichard you alone bear responsibility for the lives already lost and those yet to be lost in bloody slaughters that will sweep across the land you not jagang are the one who has brought it despite the cold beads of sweat dotted anns brow what in the name of creation are you talking about kahlan you know me i was at your wedding i have always been on your side i have only followed the prophecies to help people you create the prophecies without your help they would not have come to pass they only come about because you have fulfilled them you pull the ring through richards nose ann presented a face of calm to the stone of kahlans rage kahlan i can only imagine how you must feel but now you are truly losing all sense of reason am i am i prelate why does sister nicci have my husband answer me why anns expression drew tight in a darkening glower because she is evil no kahlans grip tightened on alessandras throat its because of you had you not sent verna into the new world in the first place ordering her to take richard back across the barrier into the old world but the prophecies say the order will rise up to take the world and extinguish magic if we fail to stop them the prophecies say richard is the only one to lead us that richard is the only one with a chance and you brought that dead prophecy to life all by yourself all because of your faith in bloodless words rather than your own reasoned choices youre here today not to back the choices of your proclaimed leader not to reason with him but to enforce prophecy upon himto give that ring a tug had you not sent verna to recover richard what would have happened prelate why why the order the order the order would still be trapped back in the old world behind the barrier wouldnt they for three thousand years that wizardcreated barrier has stood invincible against the pressure of the orderor those like themand their wish to swarm up here into the new world bent on conquest because you had richard captured against his will and ordered him brought back to the old world all in slavish homage to dead words in dusty old books he was forced to destroy the barrier and thus the order now can flood into the new world into the midlands my midlands slaughtering my people taking my husband all because of you and your meddling without you none of this would be happening no war no mounds of butchered people in cities of the new world no thousands of dead men women and children slaughtered at the hands of imperial order thugsnone of it because of you and your precious prophecies the veil was breached and a plague was unleashed on the world it would never have happened without your actions to save us all from prophecy i dont even dare to recall all the children i saw suffering and dying from the black death because of you children who looked up into my eyes and asked if they would be all right and i had to say yes when i knew they would not survive the night no one will ever know the tally of the dead no one is left to remember all the small places wiped out of existence by that plague without your meddling those children would be alive their mothers would be smiling to themselves as they watched them play their fathers would be teaching them the ways of the worlda world denied them by you for the sake of your faith in prophecy you say this is a battle for the very existence of magic in this worldyet your work to fulfill prophecy may have already doomed magic without your intervention the chimes would never have come to be loosed upon the world yes richard managed to banish them but what irreversible harm was done we may have our power back bent during the time the chimes withdrew magic from this world creatures of magic things dependent on magic for their very existence surely died out magic requires balance to exist the balance of magic in this world was disturbed the irrevocable destruction of magic may have already begun all because of your slavish service to prophecy if not for you prelate jagang the imperial orders army and all your sisters would be back there behind the barrier and we would be here safe and at peace you cast blame everywhere but where it belongs if freedom if magic if the world itself is destroyed it will all be by your hand prelate the low moan of the wind was the only sound and made the sudden silence all that much more agonizing ann stared with tearfilled eyes up at kahlan snow sparkled in the rays of a cold dawn it isnt like that kahlan it only seems that way to you in your pain it is that way kahlan said with finality anns mouth worked but this time no words came out kahlan thrust out her hand palm up the journey book if you think i would not destroy this womans life then you dont know the first thing about me shes one of your sisters helping to destroy the world in the name of good or else she is still one of the keepers sisters helping to destroy the world in the name of death either way if you dont give me the journey book and right now her life is forfeit what do you think this will accomplish ann whispered in despair it will be a start at halting your meddling in the lives of the people of the midlands and the rest of the new worldin my life in richards life its the only beginning i can think to make short of killing you both you would not like to know how close i am to that alternative now give me the journey book ann stared down at kahlans hand open before her she blinked at her tears finally she pulled off a woolen mitten and worked the little book out from behind her belt she paused a moment reverently gazing at it but in the end laid it on kahlans palm dear creator ann whispered forgive this poor hurting child of yours for what she is about to do kahlan tossed the book in the fire with ashen faces ann and sister alessandra stood staring at the book in the hissing flames kahlan snatched up richards sword cara lets get going the horses are ready i was saddling them when these two showed up kahlan dumped the hot water to the side while cara started quickly collecting their belongings they both stuffed items in the saddlebags other gear they slung over their shoulders and carried to the horses to be strapped back on the saddles without looking back at ann or alessandra kahlan swung up into her cold saddle with a grim cara at her side she turned her mount and cantered off into the swirling snow chapter as soon as she saw kahlan and cara vanish like vengeful spirits into the whiteness ann fell to her knees and thrust her hands into the fire to snatch the burning journey book from its funeral pyre in the whitehot coals prelate alessandra cried youll burn yourself flinching back from the ferocity of the pain ann ignored the gagging stench of burning flesh and thrust her hands again into the wavering heat of the fire she saw rather than felt that she had the priceless journey book in her fingers the entire rescue of the burning book took only a second but through the prism of pain it seemed an eternity biting down on her lower lip against the suffering ann rolled to the side alessandra came running back with her hands full of snow she threw it on anns bloody blackened fingers and the journey book clenched in them she let out a low wail of agony when the wet snow contacted the burns alessandra fell to anns side taking her hands by the wrists gasping in tears of fright prelate oh prelate you shouldnt have ann was in a state of shock from the pain alessandras shrill voice seemed a distant drone oh ann why didnt you use magic or even a stick ann was surprised by the question in her panic over the priceless journey book burning there in the fire her mind was filled only with the single thought to get it out before it was too late her reckless action she knew was precipitated by her bitter anguish over kahlans accusations hold still alessandra admonished through her own tears hold still and let me see what i can do about healing you it will be all right just hold still ann sat on the snowy ground dazed by the hurt and by the words still hammering her from inside her head as she let alessandra work at healing her hands the sister could not heal her heart she was wrong alessandra said as if reading anns thoughts she was wrong prelate was she ann asked in a numb voice after the searing pain in her fingers finally began to ease replaced by the achingly uncomfortable tingling of magic coursing into her flesh doing its work was she alessandra yes she doesnt know so much as she thinks shes a childshe couldnt be a paltry three decades yet people cant learn to wipe their own noses in that much time alessandra was prattling ann knew prattling with her worry over the journey book and with her worry over the anguish caused by kahlans words shes just a foolish child who doesnt know the first thing about anything theres much more to it much more it isnt so simple as she thinks not so simple at all ann wasnt so sure anymore everything seemed dead to her five hundred years of workhad it all been a mad task driven on by selfish desires and a fools faith wouldnt she in kahlans place have seen it the same way endless rows of corpses lay before her in the trial going on in her mind what was there to say in her defense she had a thousand answers for the mother confessors charges but at that moment they all seemed empty how could ann possibly excuse herself to the dead youre the prelate of the sisters of the light alessandra rambled on during a pause in her work she should have been more considerate of who she was talking to more respectful she doesnt know everything involved theres a great deal more to it a great deal after all the sisters of the light dont casually choose their prelate nor did confessors casually choose their mother confessor an hour passed and then another before alessandra finally finished the difficult and tedious work of healing anns burns burns were difficult injuries to heal it was a tiring experience being helpless and cold while magic sizzled through her while kahlans words sliced her very soul ann flexed the aching fingers when alessandra had finished a shadow of the burning pain lingered as she knew it would for a good long time but they were healed and she had her hands back when the matter was weighed though she feared she had lost a great deal more of herself than she had recovered exhausted and cold ann to alessandras worry lay down beside the hissing remnants of the fire that had so hurt her at that moment she had no desire to ever rise again her years nearly a thousand of them seemed to have all caught up with her at once she missed nathan terribly right then the prophet doubtless would have had something wise or foolish to say either would have comforted her nathan always had something to say she missed his boastful voice his kind childlike knowing eyes she missed the touch of his hand weeping silently ann cried herself to sleep her dreams kept the sleep from being either restful or deep she awoke in late morning to the feel of alessandras comforting hand on her shoulder the sister had added more wood to the fire so it offered warmth are you feeling better prelate ann nodded her lie her first thought was for the journey book she gazed at it lying in the protection of alessandras lap ann sat up and carefully lifted the blackened book from the sling of alessandras dress prelate im so worried for you with a sour wave of her hand ann dismissed the concern while you slept ive looked at the book ann grunted looks bad alessandra nodded thats what i thought i dont think it can be salvaged ann used an easy gentle flow of her han to hold the pageslittle more than ashtogether as she carefully turned them it has endured three thousand years were it ordinary paper it would be beyond helpendedbut this is a thing of magic alessandra forged in the fires of magic by wizards of power not seen in all those three thousand years until richard what can we do do you know a way to restore it ann shook her head as she inspected the curled charred journey book i dont know if it can be restored im just saying that its a thing of magic where there is magic there is hope ann pulled a handkerchief from a pocket deep under the layers of her clothes laying the blackened book in the center of the handkerchief she carefully folded the handkerchief up to hold it together she wove a spell around it all to protect and preserve it for the time being i will have to try to find a way to restore itif i can if it can even be restored alessandra drywashed her hands until then our eyes with the army are lost ann nodded we wont know if the imperial order decides to finally leave their place in the south and move up into the midlands l can give no guidance to verna prelate what do you think will happen if the order finally decides to attackand richard isnt there with them what will they do without the lord rahl to lead them ann did her best to move the terrible weight of kahlans words to the side as she considered the immediate situation verna is the prelate nowat least as far as the sisters with the army are concerned she will guide them wisely and zedd is with them helping the sisters prepare for battle should it come they could have no better counsel than to have a wizard of zedds experience with them as first wizard he has been through great wars before we will have to place our faith in the creator that he will watch over them i cant advise them unless i can restore the journey book unless i can do that i wont even know their situation you could go there prelate ann brushed snow from the side of her shoulder where she had been lying on the ground as she considered that possibility the sisters of the light think im dead theyve put their faith in verna now as their prelate it would be a terrible thing to do to vernaand to the rest of the sistersto come back to life in the middle of such trying circumstances certainly many would be relieved to have me back but it also sows the seeds of confusion and doubt battle is a very bad time for such seeds to sprout but they would all be encouraged by your ann shook her head verna is their leader such a thing could forever undermine their trust in her authority they must not lose their faith in her leadership i must put the welfare of the sisters of the light above all else must keep their best interests at heart now but ann you are the prelate ann stared off what good has that done anyone alessandras eyes turned down the wind moaned sorrowfully through the trees gusts kicked up bluegray trailers of snow and whipped them along through the campsite the sunlight had vanished behind somber clouds ann wiped her nose on the edge of her icy cloak alessandra laid a compassionate hand on anns arm you brought me back from the keeper back into the light of the creator i was in jagangs hands and treated you terribly when they captured you yet you never gave up on me who else would have cared without you my soul would be lost for all time i doubt you could fathom my gratitude for what you did prelate despite alessandras apparent return to the creators light ann had been fooled by the woman before years before alessandra had turned to the keeper becoming a sister of the dark and ann had never known how could one have faith in a person after such a betrayal ann looked up into alessandras eyes i hope so sister i pray such is really true it is prelate ann lifted a hand toward the shrouded sun and perhaps when i go to the creators light in the next world that one good act will erase the thousands of lives lost because of me alessandra looked away rubbing her arms through the layers of clothes she turned and put two sticks of wood on the fire we should have a hot meal that will make you feel better prelate it will make us both feel better ann sat on the ground watching alessandra prepare her hearty camp soup ann doubted that even the pleasant aroma of soup would arouse her appetite why do you think nicci took richard alessandra asked as she put dried mushrooms from a pouch into the soup ann looked up at alessandras puzzled face i cant imagine except to think that she may be lying and she is taking him to jagang alessandra broke up dried meat and dropped it into the boiling pot of soup why if she had him and he was forced to do as she askedwhy lie what would be the purpose shes a sister devoted to the keeper ann lifted her hands and let them flop back into her lap thats excuse enough to lie isnt it lying is wrong its wicked thats reason enough alessandra shook her head in admonition prelate i was a sister of the dark remember i know better that isnt the way it is at all do you always tell the truth just because you are devoted to the creators light no one lies for the keeper just as you would lie for the creatorto his ends if lying is necessary why would nicci lie about that she was in control of the situation and had no need to lie i cant imagine ann had difficulty caring enough to consider the question her mind was in a morass of hopeless thoughts it was her fault richard was in the hands of the enemy not niccis i think she did it for herself ann looked up what do you mean i think nicci is still looking for something looking for something what ever do you mean with a finger alessandra brushed a measure of spices into the pot from a waxed paper shed unfolded ever since the first day i took her from her home and brought her to the palace of the prophets nicci continually grew more detached somehow she always did whatever she could to help people but she was always a child who made me feel as if i was inadequate at fulfilling her needs such as alessandra shook her head i dont know she always seemed to me to be looking for something i thought she needed to find the light of the creator i pushed her mercilessly hoping it would open her eyes to his way and fill her inner need i allowed her no room to think about anything else i even kept her away from her family her father was a selfish lover of money and her mother well her mother was well intentioned but always made me feel uncomfortable i thought the creator would fill that private void within nicci alessandra hesitated and then i thought it was the keeper she needed so you think she took richard to fill some inner need how does that make sense i dont know alessandra breathed out heavily in frustration she stirred the soup as she drizzled in a pinch of salt prelate i think i failed nicci in what way i dont know perhaps i failed to involve her adequately in the needs of othersgave her too much time to think of herself she always seemed devoted to the welfare of her fellow man but maybe i should have rubbed her nose in other peoples troubles more to teach her the creators way of virtue through caring more for her fellow man rather than her own selfish wants sister i hardly think that could be it once she asked me for an extravagant black dress to wear to her mothers funeral and of course i refused such a profligacy because it was unfitting for a novice needing to learn to put others first but other than that one time i never knew nicci to once ask for anything for herself you did an admirable job with her alessandra ann recalled that after that nicci started wearing black dresses i remember that alessandra didnt look up when her father died i went with her to his funeral i always felt sorry for taking her away from her family but i explained to her that she was so talented that she had great potential for helping others and must not waste it its always hard to bring young ones to the palace its difficult to part a child from loving parents some adapt better than others she told me she understood nicci was always good that way she never objected to anything any duty perhaps i assumed too much because she always threw herself into helping others never once complaining at her fathers funeral i wanted to help her over her grief even though she had that same cool exterior she always had i knew her i knew she was hurting inside i tried to comfort her by telling her not to remember her father like that but to try to remember him as he was when he was alive those are kind words to one in such grief sister you offered wise advise alessandra glanced up she was not comforted prelate she looked at me with those blue eyes of hersyou remember her blue eyes ann nodded i remember well she looked at me with those piercing blue eyes like she wanted to hate me but even that emotion was beyond her and she said in that lifeless voice of hers that she couldnt remember him as he was when he was alive because she had never known him when he was alive isnt that the strangest thing youve ever heard ann sighed it sounds like nicci she always was one to say the strangest things at the strangest times i should have offered her more guidance in her life i should have taken more interest in her but there were so many matters needing my attention no prelate that was my job i tailed in it somehow i failed nicci ann pulled her cloak righter against a bitter gust of wind she took the bowl of soup when alessandra handed it to her worse prelate i brought her to the shadow of the keeper ann looked over the rim of the bowl as she took a sip she carefully set the steaming bowl in her lap whats done is done alessandra while alessandra sipped at her soup anns mind wandered to kahlans words they were words spoken in anger and as such were to be forgiven or were they to be considered in an honest light ann feared to say kahlans words were wrong she feared they were true for centuries ann had worked with nathan and the prophecies trying to avoid the disasters she saw and the ones he pointed out to her what if nathan had been pointing out things that were only dead words as kahlan said what if he only pointed them out so as to bring about his own escape after all what ann had set in motion with richard had also resulted in the prophets escape what if she had been duped into being the one to bring about all those terrible results could that be true grief threatened to overwhelm her she was beginning to greatly fear that she had been so absorbed in what she thought she knew that she had acted on false assumptions kahlan could be right the prelate of the sisters of the light might be personally responsible for more suffering than any monster born into the world had ever brought about alessandra ann said in a soft voice after she finished her bowl of soup we must go and try to find nathan its dangerous for the prophet to be out there in the world that is defenseless against him where would we look ann shook her head in dismay at the enormity of the task a man like nathan does not go unnoticed in the world i must believe that if we set our minds to it we could find him alessandra watched anns face well as you say it is dangerous for the prophet to be loose in the world it is indeed we must find him it took verna twenty years to find richard so it did but part of that was by my design i hid facts from verna then again nathan is no doubt hiding facts from us nonetheless we have a responsibility verna is with the sisters and with the army they will do what they can in that capacity we must go after nathan that part of it is up to us alessandra set her bowl aside prelate i understand why you believe the prophet must be found but just as you feel you must find him i feel i must find nicci im responsible for bringing her to the keeper of the underworld i may be the only one who can bring her back to the light i have a unique understanding of that journey of the heart i fear what will happen to richard if i dont try to stop nicci worse alessandra added i fear what will happen to the world if richard dies kahlan is wrong i believe in what youve worked for all these years kahlan is making a complex thing sound simple because her heart is broken but without what you did she would never even have met richard ann considered alessandras words the seduction of acquittal was undeniable but alessandra we dont have the slightest idea where they went nicci is as smart as they come if as she says she is acting on her own behalf she will be clever about not being found how would you even go about such a search nathan is a prophet loose in the world you remember the trouble hes caused in the past he could by himself bring about such calamity as the world has never seen nathan boasts when hes around people he will surely leave such traces where he goes with nathan i believe we at least have a chance of success but hunting for nicci alessandra met anns gaze with grim resolution prelate if richard dies what chance have the rest of us ann looked away what if alessandra was right what if kahlan was right she had to catch nathan it was the only way to find out alessandra you dont completely trust me do you prelate ann met the other womans eyes this time with authority no alessandra i admit that i dont how can i you deceived me you lied to me you turned your back on the creator and gave yourself to the keeper of the underworld but ive come back to the light prelate have you would not one acting for the keeper lie for him as you yourself only moments ago suggested alessandras eyes filled with tears thats why i must try to find nicci prelate i must prove that your faith in me was not misplaced i need to do this to prove myself to you or you need to help nicci and the keeper i know im not worthy of trust i know that you said we must find nathanbut we must also help richard two tasks of the utmost importance ann said and no journey book to call for help alessandra wiped at her eyes please prelate let me help im responsible for nicci going to the keeper let me try to make amends let me try to bring her back i know what the return journey is like i can help her please let me try to save her eternal soul anns gaze sank to the ground who was she to question the value of another what had her life been for had she herself been the keepers best ally ann cleared her throat sister alessandra you are to listen to me and you are to listen well i am the prelate of the sisters of the light and it is your duty to do as i command ann shook a finger at the woman ill have no arguments do you hear i must go find the prophet before he does something beyond foolish richard is of utmost importance to our causeyou know that im getting old and would only slow the search for him and his captor i want you to go after him no arguments now you are to find richard rahl and put the fear of the creator back into our wayward sister nicci alessandra threw her arms around ann sobbing her thanks ann patted the sisters back feeling miserable about losing a companion and afraid that she might have lost her faith in everything for which she stood alessandra pushed away prelate will you be able to travel alone are you sure youre up to this bah i may be old but im not useless who do you think came into the center of jagangs army and rescued you child alessandra smiled through her tears you did prelate all by yourself no one but you could have done such a thing i hope i can do half as well for nicci when i find her you will sister you will may the creator cradle you in his palm as you go on your journey ann knew that they were both going off on difficult journeys that could take years hard times lie ahead alessandra said but the creator has two hands does he not one for me and one for you prelate ann couldnt help but smile at such a mental picture chapter come in zedd grouched to the persistent throatclearing outside his tent he poured water from the ewer into the dented metal pot that served as his washbasin sitting atop a log round when he splashed some of the water up onto his face he gasped aloud he was astonished that water that cold would still pour good morning zedd still gasping zedd swiped the frigid water from his eyes he squinted at warren good morning my boy warren blushed zedd reminded himself he probably shouldnt call someone twice his own age boy it was warrens own fault if the boy would just stop looking so young zedd sighed as he bent to forage for a towel among the litter of maps dirty plates rusty dividers empty mugs blankets chicken bones rope an egg hed lost in the middle of a lesson weeks back and other paraphernalia that seemed to collect over time in the corner of his small field tent warren was twisting his purple robes into a small wad at his hip i just came from vernas tent zedd halted his search and looked back over his shoulder any word warren shook his head of curly blond hair sorry zedd well zedd scoffed that doesnt mean anything that old woman has more lives than a cat i once had that was hit by lightning and fell down a well both in the same day did i ever tell you about that cat my boy well yes you did actually warren smiled but if you like i wouldnt mind hearing it again zedd dismissed the story with a feeble wave as he turned more serious im sure ann is fine verna knows ann better than i do but i do know that that old woman is downright hard to harm verna said something like that warren smiled to himself ann always could scowl a thunderstorm back over the horizon zedd grunted his agreement as he went back to digging through his pile tougher than bad meat she is he tossed two outdated maps over his shoulder warren leaned down a little what is it youre looking for if you dont mind my asking my towel i know i had right there warren said zedd looked up what your towel warren pointed again right there on the back of the chair oh zedd snatched up the wandering towel and dried his dry face he scowled at warren you have the eyes of a burglar he tossed the towel in the pile with everything else where it belonged warrens grin returned ill take that as a compliment zedd cocked his head do you hear that warrens grin melted away as he joined zedd in listening to the sounds outside horses clogged along the hard ground men talked as they passed the tent other called orders fires crackled wagons squeaked and gear clanged and rattled hear what zedds face twisted in vague unease i dont know like maybe a whistle warren lifted a thumb over his shoulder the men whistle now and again to get the attention of their horses and such sometimes its necessary they all did their best to keep the whistling and other noise down whistles especially carried in such open terrain it was hard to miss something the size of the dharans encampment of course so they moved camp from time to time to keep the enemy from getting too confident about their location sound could give away more than they would like zedd shook his head must have been that someones long whistle but still zedd warren went on its long past time when ann would have sent verna a message there were times when i was with ann that she couldnt send messages zedd waved an arm expansively bags there was a time when i wouldnt let her use that confounded journey book the thing gave me the shivers i dont know why she couldnt just send letters like normal people his face he knew was betraying his concern confounded journey books lazy way of doing things i got to be first wizard and i never needed a journey book she could have lost it thats what verna suggested anyway zedd held up a finger thats right she very well could have its smallit could have fallen from her belt and she didnt nonce until she and alessandra made camp shed never find the book in a circumstance like that he shook the finger makes my point too you shouldnt depend on little trick things of magic like that it just makes you lazy thats what verna thought too about it falling from her belt i mean warren chuckled or a cat could even have eaten it from beneath a furrowed brow zedd peered at warren a cat what cat any cat warren cleared his throat i just meant oh never mind i never was any good at jokes zedds knotted brow lifted oh i see a cat could have eaten it yes yes i see he didnt but zedd forced a chuckle for the boys sake very good warren anyway she probably lost it its probably something as simple as that if thats the case zedd reasoned she will likely end up coming here to let us know that shes all right or at least she will send a letter or messenger or something ever more likely though she probably had nothing to tell us and simply saw no need to bother with sending a message in her journey book warren made a skeptical face but we havent had a message from her for nearly a month zedd waved a hand dismissively well she was way north up almost to where richard and kahlan are last we heard if she did lose the book and started right out to come here from there she wont show up for yet another week or two if she went on to see richard first then it will be longer i imagine ann doesnt travel all that fast you know i know warren said she is getting up there in years but thats just another reason why im so worried what really worried zedd was the way the journey book went silent just as ann was about to reach richard and kahlan zedd had been eagerly anticipating hearing that richard and kahlan were safe that kahlan was all healed maybe even that richard was ready to return ann knew how eager they were for word and would certainly have had something to report zedd didnt like the coincidence that the journey book went silent right at that time he didnt like it one bit the whole thing made him want to scratch as if hed been bitten by a white mosquito now look here warren a month isnt so long not to hear from her in the past its sometimes been weeks and weeks between her messages its too early to start getting ourselves all worked up with worry besides we have our own concerns which require our attention zedd didnt know what they could do even if ann were in trouble somewhere they had no idea how to find her warren flashed an apologetic smile youre right zedd zedd moved a map and found a half loaf of bread left from the night before he took a big bite giving himself an excuse to chew instead of talk when he talked he feared he only let out the true level of his worry not just about ann but also about richard and kahlan warren was an able wizard and smarter than just about anyone zedd had ever met zedd often had trouble finding something to talk about that warren hadnt already heard of or was intimately familiar with there was something refreshing about sharing knowledge with someone who nodded knowingly at esoteric points of magic that no one else would fathom someone who could fill in little gaps in the odd spell or delighted at having his own little gaps filled in by what zedd knew warren retained more about prophecy than zedd thought anyone had a right to know in the first place warren was a fascinating mix of obstinate old man and callow youth he was at once set in his ways and at the same time openly infinitely innocently curious the one thing that made warren fall silent though was when they discussed richards vision warrens face would go blank and he would sit without comment while others argued over what richard had said in his letters and if there was any validity to it whenever zedd had warren alone and asked him what he thought warren would say only i follow richard he is my friend and he is the lord rahl warren would not debate or discuss richards instructions to the armyor more specifically richards refusal to give instructions richard had given his orders as far as warren was concerned and they were to be swallowed not chewed zedd noticed that warren was twisting his robes again zedd waved his bread you look like a wizard with his pants full of itching spells do you have something you need to let out warren warren grinned sheepishly am i that obvious zedd patted the boy on the back no warren im just that good warren laughed at zedds joke zedd gestured with his bread toward the folding canvas chair warren looked behind himself at the chair but shook his head zedd figured it must be important if warren felt he needed to stand to say it zedd with winter upon us do you believe the imperial order will attack or wait until spring well now thats always a worry the not knowing leaves your stomach all in knots but youve all worked hard youve all trained and practiced youll do just fine warren the sisters too warren didnt seem to be interested in hearing what zedd was saying he was scratching his temple waiting his turn to speak yes well thank you zedd we have been working hard umm general leiden thinks winter is our best friend right now he his keltish officers and some of the dharans believe that jagang would be foolhardy to start a campaign with winter just setting in kelton isnt all that far north of here so general leiden is familiar with the difficulty of winter warfare in the terrain we would fall back to hes convinced the order is waiting for spring general leiden in a good man and may be secondincommand after general reibisch zedd said in an even voice as he watched warrens blue eyes but i dont agree with him warren looked crestfallen oh the general had brought his keltish division down south a couple of months before to reinforce the dharan army at general reibischs request regarding kahlan as their queen since richard had named her so the keltish forces still had an independent streak even if they were now part of the dharan empire as everyone had taken to calling it zedd didnt do anything to discourage such talk it was better for everyone in the new world to be one mighty force than a collection of tribes as far as zedd was concerned richard had clearly had the right instincts in that a war of this scale would have been ungovernable were the new world not one having everyone think of themselves as part of the dharan empire first and foremost could only help make it so zedd cleared his throat but thats just a guess warren i could be wrong general leiden is an experienced man and no fool i could be wrong but so could leiden be wrong i guess that puts you with general reibisch hes been pacing his tent every night for the last two months zedd shrugged is there something important to you warren that hinges on what the imperial order does are you waiting for them to make up your mind for you about something warren held up his hands as if to ward the very notion nono of course not its just that its just that it would be a bad time to be thinking about such things is all but if they were going to lie low for the winter warren fussed with his sleeve thats all i meant if you thought they were going to wait until spring or something his voice trailed off and if they were then warren stared at the ground while he twisted his robes at his stomach into a purple knot if you think they might decide to move this winter then it wouldnt be right for mefor usto be thinking about such things zedd scratched his chin and changed his approach lets say i believe the order is going to sit tight for the winter then what might you do in that case warren threw his hands up zedd will you marry verna and me zedds brow went up as he drew back his head bags my boy thats a mouthful to swallow first thing in the morning warren took two big strides closer will you zedd i mean only if you really think the order is going to sit down there in anderith for the winter if they are then well then it would be i mean we might as well do you love verna warren of course i do and does verna love you well of course she does zedd shrugged then ill marry the both of you you will oh zedd that would be wonderful warren turned reaching one hand toward the tents opening lifting his other back toward zedd wait wait there a moment well i was about to flap my arms and fly to the moon but if you want me to wait warren was already out the tent zedd heard muffled voices coming from outside warren came back inright on vernas heels verna beamed from ear to ear which zedd found unsettling in its own way being so unusual thank you for offering to marry us zedd thank you warren and i wanted you to do the ceremony i told him you would do it but warren wanted to ask you and give you a chance to say no i cant think of anything more meaningful than being wedded by the first wizard zedd thought she was a lovely woman a little fussy about rules and such at times but well intentioned she worked hard she didnt shy from some of the things zedd had asked of her and she obviously held warren in warm regard as well as respecting him when verna asked when do you think would be an appropriate time zedd screwed up his face do you two think you can wait until ive had a proper breakfast they both grinned we were thinking more along the lines of an evening wedding verna said maybe we could have a party with music and dancing warren gestured nonchalantly we were thinking something to make a pleasant break in all the training a break how much time do you two think you will be needing away from your duties oh no zedd warren had gone as purple as his robes we didnt mean we wouldi mean we would still be doingwe would only like we dont want any time away zedd verna put in bringing warrens bashful babbling to an end we just thought it would be a nice opportunity for everyone to have a wellearned party for an evening we wont be leaving our posts zedd put a bony arm around vernas shoulders you two can have all the time away you want we all understand im happy for you both thats great zedd warren said with a sigh we really a redfaced officer burst into the tent without so much as announcing himself wizard zorander two sisters charged in right behind him prelate sister philippa called theyre coming sister phoebe cried both women were whitefaced and looked to be on the verge of losing their breakfast sister phoebe was trembling like a wet dog in winter zedd then saw that sister philippas hair was singed on one side and the shoulder of her dress was blackened she had been one of those on far watch for the enemy gifted now zedd knew what the whistling sound he thought hed heard was it was very distant screams rolling up from the distance came the note of the secondary waypoint alarm horns zedd felt the faint tingle of magic woven through them so he knew they were genuine outside the tent the muted sounds of camp life rose into a din of activity weapons were being yanked from where they were stacked fires hissed as they were dowsed swords were being strapped on others were being drawn horses whinnied at the sudden racket warren seized sister philippas arm and started issuing orders get the line coordinated dont let them be seenkeep behind the third ridge set the trips closewe need to give the enemy confidence cavalry the woman nodded coming in two wings the officer put in but they arent charging yetthey dont want to get out too far ahead of their foot soldiers start the first fire behind themonce theyre past the blast point just like weve drilled warren told sister philippa as she nodded heedfully to his instructions the intention was to trap any cavalry charge between walls of violent magic it had to be focused properly to have any hope of piercing the enemys shields prelate sister phoebe said still panting you cant imagine the numbers dear creator it looks like the ground is moving like the hills are melting men toward us verna put a comforting hand to the young sisters shoulder i know phoebe i know but we all know what to do verna was already ushering the two sisters out and calling for her other aides as yet more officers and returning scouts leaped from horses a big bearded soldier sweat running down his face barged into the tent gasping for his breath the whole blasted force all of em cavalry with lancesenough to break their way and then some another man shouted into the tent from atop a lathered horse pausing only long enough to deliver the news to zedd before charging off archers zedd asked the two soldiers still in his tent the officer with the beard shook his head too far to tell he gulped air but id bet my life theyre right behind the pikemens shields no doubt zedd said when they get close enough theyll show themselves warren grabbed the bearded officers sleeve and pulled him along behind as he trotted out of the tent dont worry when they show themselves well have something to put out their eyes the other man ran on to his duties in an instant zedd was standing alone in his tent lit from the outside by earlymorning winter sun it was a cold dawn it would be a bloody day outside the tent the racket exploded into the uproar of practiced pandemonium everyone had a job and knew it well these were mostly battletested dharans zedd had snuck close and had seen how fearsome the imperial order troops looked but the dharans were their match in gristle for generations dharans prided themselves on being the fiercest fighters in existence for a good part of his life zedd had battled dharans who had proven their boasts true zedd could hear someone shouting move move move it sounded like general reibisch zedd dashed to the tents opening pausing at the brink of a river of men flowing past in a great churning mass general reibisch skidded to a halt just outside the tent zeddwe were right zedd nodded his disappointment to have surmised the enemys plans this was one time he wished hed been wrong were breaking camp general reibisch said weve not much time ive already ordered the advance guard to shift their positions north to cover the supply wagons is it all of themor just a jab to test us its the whole bloody lot dear spirits zedd whispered at least he had made what plans for this eventuality as could be made he had trained the gifted to expect this so they wouldnt be thrown off balance it would come just as zedd told them it would that would aid their confidence and give them courage the day hinged on the gifted general reibisch swiped his meaty hand across his mouth and jaw as he looked to the south toward an enemy he couldnt yet see the early sun made his rustcolored hair look red and the scar that ran from his left temple to his jaw stand out like a streak of frozen white lightning our sentries pulled back along with the outer lines no use in them standing ground since its the whole imperial order zedd quickly nodded his agreement well be the magic against magic for you general the man had a lusty glint in his grayishgreen eye were the steel for you zedd well show them bastards a lot of both today just dont show them too much too soon zedd warned im not about to change our plans now he said over the sound of the tumult good zedd snatched the arm of a soldier running past you i need your help pack up my things in there for me would you lad i need to get to the sisters general reibisch gestured the young soldier into zedds tent and the young man leaped to the task the scouts said theyre all staying on this side of the drun river just as we hoped good we wont have to worry about them flanking us at least not from the west zedd swept his gaze over the dissolving camp as the men swiftly set about their jobs he looked back to the generals weathered face just get our men north into those valleys in time general so that we cant be surrounded the gifted will cover your tails well plug up the valleys dont you worry the river isnt frozen over yet is it general reibisch shook his head maybe enough for a rat to skate on but not the wolf thats after him that should keep them from crossing zedd squinted off to the south i have to go check on adie and her sisters may the good spirits be with you general they wont need to watch your backwell do that general reibisch caught zedds arm theres more than we thought zedd twice the number at least if my scouts werent just stuttering there may be three times the number think you can slow that many down while keeping them focused on trying to sink their teeth into my backside the plan was to draw the enemy north while staying just out of their reach close enough to make them salivate but not close enough to let them get a good bite crossing the river at this time of year would be impractical for an army that size with the river on one side and mountains on the other a force the size of the imperial order couldnt so easily surround and overwhelm the dharan empire troops who were outnumbered ten or twenty to one the plan too was designed to keep in mind richards admonition about not attacking directly into the order zedd wasnt sure about the validity of richards warning but knew better than to so openly tempt ruin hopefully once they enticed the enemy into that tighter terrain terrain more defensible the order would lose some of their advantage and their advance could be halted once the imperial order was stalled the dharans could begin working the enemy down to size the dharans thought nothing of being outnumbered it just gave them a better opportunity to prove themselves zedd stared off imagining the hillsides darkened with the enemy pouring forth he was already seeing the lethal powers he would unleash he knew too that in battle things rarely went as planned dont you worry general today the imperial order is going to begin paying a terrible price for its aggression the grinning general clapped zedd on the side of the shoulder good man general reibisch charged off calling for his aides and his horse collecting a growing crowd of men around him as he went it had begun chapter arms resting on his thighs richard crouched in the belly of the beast well nicci asked from atop her horse richard stood beside a rib bone that towered to well over twice his height he shielded his eyes against the golden sunlight as he briefly scanned the empty horizon behind himself he looked back at nicci her hair honeyed by the low sun id say it was a dragon when her mare began to dance sideways trying to put distance between itself and the expanse of bones nicci took the slack out of the reins dragon she repeated in a flat voice here and there dried scraps of meat stuck to the bones richard swished a hand at the cloud of flies buzzing around him the faint stench of decay hung over the site as he stepped out of the cage of giant rib bones standing bellyup he gestured toward the head nestled in a bed of brown grass there was enough room to walk between the ribs without them touching his shoulders i recognize the teeth i had a dragons tooth once nicci looked skeptical well whatever it is if youve seen enough lets be on our way richard brushed his hands clean the stallion snorted and stepped away from him when he approached the horse didnt like the smell of death and didnt trust richard after having been near it richard stroked the glossy black neck steady boy he said in a comforting voice easy now when she saw richard finally mount up nicci turned her dappled mare and started off once more the lateafternoon light cast long clawed shadows of the rib bones toward him as if reaching out calling him back to the ghost of some terrible end he glanced back over his shoulder at the length of the skeletal remains stretched out in the middle of an empty gently rolling grassland before urging his stallion into a trot to catch up with nicci his horse needed little encouragement to be away from the dying place and happily sprang into his easy loping gallop instead in the month or so richard had spent with the horse the two of them had become used to each other the horse was willing enough but never really friendly richard wasnt interested enough to go to the effort of doing more making friends with a horse was just about the last of his concerns nicci hadnt known if the horses had names and didnt seem interested in naming animals so richard simply called the black stallion boy and niccis dappled gray mare girl and left it at that nicci seemed neither pleased or displeased about him naming the horses she simply went along with his convention do you actually believe its the remains of a dragon nicci asked when he caught up with her the stallion slowed and glad to be back in the herd gave the mares flanks a nuzzle girl merely turned her closest ear toward him in recognition its about the right size as i remember nicci tossed her head to flick her hair back over her shoulder youre serious arent you richard frowned his puzzlement you saw it what else could it possibly be she conceded with a sigh i just thought it was the bones of some longextinct beast with flies still buzzing around it it still had a few bits of sinew dried to the bones its not some ancient thing it couldnt be much older than six monthspossibly much less she was watching him from the corner of her eye again so they really do have dragons in the new world in the midlands anyway where i grew up there were none dragons as i understand it have magic there was no magic in westland when i came here i saw a red dragon from what i heard theyre very rare and now there was at least one less nicci was little concerned about the remains of an animal even if it was a dragon richard had long ago decided that as much as he lusted to crush her skull he would have a better chance of figuring a way out of his situation if he didnt antagonize her battling another person sapped your own strength making it more difficult to reason your way out of the trouble he kept his mind focused on what was most important to him he couldnt force himself to pretend to befriend nicci but he tried to give her no cause to become angry enough to hurt kahlan so far it had been successful nicci didnt seem easily inclined to anger anyway when she became displeased she submerged back into an indifference which seemed to smother her distant rancor they finally reached the road from where they had spotted the white speck that had turned out to be the remains of the dragon what was it like growing up in a place with no magic richard shrugged i dont know thats just the way it was it was normal and you were happy growing up without magic i mean yes very happy the frown returned to his face why and yet you fight to keep magic in the world so other children will have to grow up with it am i right yes the order wishes to rid the world of magic so that people can grow up happy without the poisonous fog of magic always outside their door she glanced over at him they want children to grow up much like you did and yet you fight this it was not a question so richard chose not to turn it into one for her what the order chose to do was not his concern he turned his thoughts to other things they were traveling eastsoutheast on a road traversed by the odd trader they had smiled and nodded at two that day the road as it took the easiest route across the rolling hills had that afternoon begun to turn more to the south as they crested a rise richard spotted a flock of sheep in the far distance not far ahead they had been told was a town where they could pick up some needed provisions the horses could use some grain too over his left shoulder to the northeast snow capped mountains turning pink in the late sunlight rose up out of the foothills to his right the ground rolled off into the wilds beyond the town it wouldnt be too far until they crossed the kern river they were not far at all from what used to be the wasteland where the great barrier had stood they were close to cutting south into the old world even though there was no longer a barrier to prevent his return once they crossed over he felt downhearted about leaving the new world it was like leaving kahlans world like leaving her by one more degree as fiercely as he loved her he could feel her slipping farther and farther into the distance niccis blond hair fluttered in the breeze as she turned toward him its said they used to have dragons in the old world too richard brought himself out of his brooding but no more he asked she shook her head how long ago was that long ago no one living has ever seen oneand that includes sisters living at the palace he thought about it as he rode listening to the rhythmic clop of hooves nicci had proven forthcoming so he asked do you know why not i can only tell you what was taught to me if you would like to hear it when richard nodded she went on during the great war at the time when the barrier between the old and new worlds was raised the wizards in the old world worked toward revoking magic from the world dragons could not exist without magic so they went extinct but they still existed here on the other side of the barrier it may be that the old wizards suppression of magic on their side had only a local or even temporary effect after all magic still exists so obviously they failed to achieve their ends richard was getting an uneasy feeling as he considered both niccis words and the bones he had seen nicci may i ask you a question a serious question about magic she gazed over at him as she slowed her horse to an easy walk what is it you wish to know how long do you think a dragon could exist without magic nicci considered his question for a moment but in the end let out a sigh i only know about the history of the dragons in the old world as it was taught as you know words written that long ago are not always dependable it would only be an educated guess i would say it could be mere moments possibly daysor even longer but not a great deal longer its a much simplified version of asking how long a fish could live out of water why do you ask richard raked his fingers back through his hair when the chimes were here in this world they drew away magic all of the magic or nearly all anyway was withdrawn from the world of life for a time she turned her eyes back to the road my estimation is that the withdrawal was total for a time at least that was what he had feared richard considered her words along with what he knew not all creatures of magic depend on it us for example we are in a way creatures of magic but we can live without it too im wondering if creatures that depended on magic for their very existence might not have made it through until the chimes were banished and magic was restored to the world of life magic was not restored richard pulled his horse up short what not in the way you are thinking about it nicci circled around to face him richard while i have no direct knowledge with precisely what happened such an event could not be without consequence tell me what you know she frowned in curiosity why do you look so concerned nicci please just tell me what you know she folded her wrists over the horn of her saddle richard magic is a complex matter so there can be no certainty she held up a hand to forestall his cascade of questions this much though is certain the world doesnt stay the same it changes continuously magic is not merely part of this world magic is the conduit between worlds do you understand he thought he might i accidentally used magic to call forth the spirit of my father from the underworld i banished him back to the underworld with the use of magic the mud people for example use magic to communicate with their spirit ancestors beyond the veil in the underworld i had to go to the temple of the winds in another world when jagang sent a sister there to start a plague which she brought back from that world and what do all of those things have in common they used magic to bridge the gap between worlds yes but there is more those worlds exist but they are dependent on this one to define them are they not you mean like life is created into this world and after death souls are taken by the keeper to the underworld yes but more do you see the connection richard was getting lost he hadnt grown up knowing anything about magic were caught between the two realms no not exactly her blue eyes flashed with intensity she waited until his gaze steadied on hers then she held up a finger to mark the importance of her words magic is a conduit between worlds as magic diminishes those other worlds are not just more distant to us but the power of those worlds in this world diminishes do you see richard was getting goose bumps you mean the other worlds have less influence like like a child who has grown and his parents have less influence over him yes in the fading light her eyes seemed more blue than usual as the worlds grow more separate it is something like a child growing and leaving home but there is more to it yet she leaned forward ever so slightly in her saddle you see those other worlds can be said to exist only by their relationship to lifeto this world at that moment she seemed like nothing to him so much as what she really was a onehundredandeightyyearold sorceress it might even be said she whispered in a voice that sounded like the shadows speaking that without magic to link those other worlds to this those other worlds cease to exist richard swallowed you mean just as the child grows and leaves home the parents become less important to his existence when they eventually grow old and die even though they were once vital and strongly linked to him when they now cease to exist he lives on without them exactly she hissed the world changes he said almost to himself the world doesnt stay the same thats what jagang wants he wants magic and those other worlds to cease to exist so that he will have this one all for himself no she said in a soft voice he wishes it not for himself but for mankind richard started to argue but she cut him off i know jagang im telling you what he believes he may enjoy the spoils but in his heart he believes he is doing this for mankind not himself richard didnt really believe her but he didnt see any point in quarreling with her either way because of the changes taking place such creatures as dragons might have already become extinct those white bones could very well have been the remains of the last red dragon because of events like the chimes the world may already have irrevocably changed to a point where creatures of magic have died out she said as she stared out over the empty twilight in an evolving world such as i describe magic even such as ours would soon die out too do you see now without that conduit to other worlds worlds that may no longer exist magic would not come into existence when offspring of the gifted are born one thing was sure when the time came he was going to make nicci extinct as they rode on richard gazed back over his shoulder at bones he could no longer see it was well after dark when they rode into the town when richard inquired of a passerby he was told that the town ripply was named after the rippling foothills it was a quiet place off in a nearly forgotten corner of the midlands its back to what used to be the wasteland from where no one ever returned many of the people grew wheat and raised sheep to provide themselves with trade goods while keeping small animals and gardens for themselves there was a road coming in from the southwest from renwold and other roads going off to the north ripply was a crossroads for trade between renwold the people of the wilds who traded at that outpost city and villages to the north and east now of course renwold was gone the imperial order had sacked the city now with only ghosts inhabiting the streets of renwold the people of the wilds who traded their goods there would suffer the people from the towns and villages who came to ripply would suffer too ripply was falling on hard times richard and nicci created a small sensation strangers traveling through had become a sporadic event what with renwold gone the two of them were tired and there was an inn but raucous drinking was going on there and richard didnt want to have to deal with that kind of trouble there was a wellkept stable at the other end of town from the inn and the man who owned it offered to let them stay in the hayloft for a silver penny each the night was cold and it would be warmer in the hayloft out of the wind so richard paid the man the penny each for themselves and three more for the horses to be cared for and fed the taciturn stable owner was so pleased with the extra penny for the horses that he told richard he would tend their shoes while he had them when richard thanked him and told him they were tired the man smiled for the first time and said ill be seeing to your horses then i hope you and your wife sleep well good night then richard followed nicci up the rough wooden ladder at the back of the barn they had a cold dinner sitting in the hay as they listened to the stable owner fetching grain and water for their horses richard and nicci had only the bare bones of necessary conversation before they rolled themselves up in their cloaks and went to sleep when they woke a little after dawn they discovered a small gathering of skinny children and hollowcheeked adults come to see the rich folks traveling through apparently their horses better than any that had boarded at the stable in a long time had been the source of gossip and speculation when richard greeted the people he got back only vacant looks when he and nicci walked to the supply store not far away past a few drab buildings the people all followed as if it were a king and queen come to town and they all wanted to see what such highborn people did with their day goats and chickens wandering ripplys main street scattered before the procession a milk cow cropping brown grass behind the leather shop paused for a look a rooster atop a stump flapped his wings in annoyance when the bolder children asked who they were nicci told them that they were only travelers husband and wife looking for work such news was greeted with skeptical tittering in her fine black dress the people took nicci for a queen looking for a kingdom they thought only a little less of richard when an older boy asked where they were going to look for work as there was little to be found in ripply nicci told them that they were going to the old world some of the adults snatched up children and hurried away yet more remained close on richard and niccis heels an older man who owned the supply store gently shooed the people away from his door when richard went in once richard had gone inside he watched the people grow bolder and begin pawing at nicci begging for money for medicine for food nicci stayed outside with the people asking them about their troubles and their needs she moved through the crowd inspecting the children she had that blank look on her face that richard didnt like what can i get you the proprietor asked ah what about those people richard asked instead he glanced out the sparklingclean little window to see nicci standing in the middle of the ragged group talking about the creators love for them they all listened as if she were a good spirit come to comfort them well theyre all sorts the shop owner said most wandered in from the old world after the barrier came down some are just nogood localsdrunks and suchwhod just as soon beg or steal as work when strangers from the old world came in some of the people here joined their ways we get traders through here and men like that with goods to protect find they have less trouble if theyre generous with that sort some of them out there are folks whove had troublewidows with children who cant find a husband things like that a few of them will work for me when i have work but most wont richard was about to give the man a list of their needs when nicci glided in the door richard i need some money rather than argue with her he passed her the saddlebag with the money she reached in and pulled out a handful of gold and silver the shop owners eyes went wide when he saw how much she had in her fist she paid him no heed richard stood slack jawed as he watched nicci back out with the crowd giving away all the money arms waved and reached for her people cried out all the louder a few ran off with what she had given them richard pulled open the saddlebag peering in to see how much they had left it wasnt much he could hardly believe what nicci had just done it made no sense how about some barley flour some oatmeal some rice some bacon lentils dried biscuits and salt he asked the waiting proprietor no oatmeal but ive got the rest how much do you want richard was running calculations through his head they had a long journey and nicci had just given away most of their money theyd used up the better portion of the supplies they had he laid six silver pennies on the counter just what that will buy us he pulled his pack off his back and set it on the counter beside the money the man scooped up the coins and sighed at the money he had almost made he began pulling the items down from a shelf and placing them in the pack as he worked richard requested a few other small things he remembered as the man was going about getting the order he parted with another penny richard had only a few silver pennies two silver crowns and no gold left nicci had handed out more money than most of those people had ever seen in their entire lifetimes worried about what they were going to do for supplies in the future richard slung his pack onto his back when the shop proprietor had finished and rushed out to see if he couldnt slow nicci down she was lecturing on the creators love of every man and asking the people to forgive the cruelty of heartless and uncaring people as she handed the last gold coin to an unshaven man without teeth he grinned his thanks and then licked his parched lips richard knew how he would wet them there were yet more pleading hands thrusting toward her worried richard seized niccis arm and pulled her back she turned toward him we have to get back to the stables she said thats what im thinking richard said holding his anger in check lets hope the stableman is done with them by now so we can get out of here no she said with a look of grim finality in her eye we need to sell the horses what richard blinked in angry astonishment may i at least ask why to share what we have with those who have nothing richard was beyond words he just stared at her how were they going to travel he considered the question briefly and decided that he didnt really care how soon they got to wherever it was she was taking him but they would have to carry everything he was a woods guide and used to walking with a pack so he guessed he could walk he let out his breath and turned toward the stables we need to sell the horses richard told the stable owner the man frowned looked at the horses standing in their stalls and then back at richard he looked thunderstruck those are mighty fine horses mister we dont have horses like this around here you do now nicci said he glanced uneasily at her most people were uneasy gazing at nicci either because of her startling beauty or because of her cool often denunciative presence i cant pay what horses like this are worth we didnt ask you to nicci said in a dull voice we only asked to sell them to you we need to sell them well take what you can give us the mans eyes shifted from richards to niccis and back richard could tell the man was uneasy about cheating them in such a way but he couldnt seem to figure out how to turn down such an offer all i can pay is four silver marks for the both of them richard knew they were worth ten times that much and the tack nicci said the man scratched his cheek i guess i could throw in another silver but thats all i got to my name im sorry i know theyre worth more but if youre bound and determined for me to buy them off you thats all i got is there anyone else in town who might buy them for more richard asked i dont believe so but to tell you the truth son it wouldnt be hurting my feelings if you were to go ask around i dont like swindling folks and i know you couldnt call five silver marks for the horses and tack anything else but a swindle the man kept glancing at nicci seeming to suspect that this transaction was beyond richards ability to control her steady blue eyes could make any man fidget we accept your offer nicci said without any hesitation or uncertainty im sure its quite fair the man sighed unhappily at his windfall i dont have that much money on me ill go in the househe lifted a thumb over his shoulderout back of the barn and get it if youd be so good as to wait a minute nicci nodded and he hurried on his way not so much eager to consummate the deal richard thought as he was eager to be out from under niccis gaze richard turned to her feeling his face heating whats this all about he saw through the partly open stable doors that the crowd of people who had followed them were still out there she ignored his question get your thingswhatever you can carry as soon as he comes back its time we were on our way richard pulled his glare from her he stalked over to his gear sitting outside boys stall and began stuffing everything he could into his pack he strapped the waterskins around his waist and flipped the saddlebags over his shoulders he was sure the stable owner wouldnt complain about not having the saddlebags with the rest of the tack richard thought that when they reached a more prosperous town he could at least sell the saddlebags while he worked nicci put her belongings into a pack she could carry when the man came back with the money he offered it to richard nicci held out her hand ill take it she said he glanced to richards eyes once and then handed nicci the money i threw in the silver pennies you paid me last night thats all i have i swear thank you nicci said that was very generous of you to share what you have that is the creators way without another word nicci turned and strode through the dimly lit stable and out the door its my way the man muttered under his breath to her back creator had no say in it outside in the sunlight nicci began doling out the money she had just gotten for the horses the people vied for her favor as she walked among them speaking to them asking questions until she was out of sight past the edge of the barn door richard gave boy a quick rub on the blaze of his forehead hoisted his saddlebags onto his shoulder and turned to the dumbfounded expression on the stable owners face he and richard shared a helpless look i hope shes a good wife to you the man finally said richard wanted to say that nicci was a sister of the dark and that he was her prisoner but in the end he decided that it could serve no purpose nicci had made it clear to him that he was richard cypher her husband and she was nicci cypher his wife she had told him to stick to that storyfor kahlans sake shes just generous richard said thats why i married her shes good to people richard heard a womans cry and shouting he bolted for the partly open door and ran out into the bright morning sunlight he didnt see anyone he raced around to the side of the barn to where he heard scuffling a half dozen men had nicci down on the ground some swinging at her with their fists as she tried to fend them off with her bare hands others pawed at her searching for a money pouch they were fighting over the unearned before it was even out of her hands a crowd of women children and other men stood around the scene in a circle vultures waiting to pick the bones richard crashed through the ring of people seized the closest man by the back of his collar and heaved him back he was skinny and flew through the air crashing into the wall of the barn the whole building shook richard kicked another in the ribs tumbling him off nicci and through the dirt a third man spun and took a mighty swing at richard richard caught the fist and bent it down until he felt a snap as the man cried out at that the men all scattered in every direction richard started after one of them but nicci suddenly flew at him restraining him richard no in his rage to get at the men richard nearly smashed her face but when he realized it was her lowered his fists to his sides as he glared at the crowd please my lord please my lady one of the women wailed have mercy on us woeful folk wes just the creators miserable wretches have mercy on us youre a bunch of thieves richard yelled thieving from someone who was trying to help you he made an effort to go after the lot of them but nicci held his wrists down richard no the people vanished like mice before a hissing cat nicci let richards fists drop he saw then that she had blood on her mouth whats the matter with you giving money to people who would rather rob you than wait for you to hand it to them willingly why would you give money to such vermin thats enough ill not stand here and listen to you insult the creators children who are you to judge who are you with a full belly to say whats right you have no idea what those poor people have been through and yet you are quick to judge richard took a purging breath he reminded himself yet again of what he had to keep uppermost in his mind it was not really nicci he had been protecting he pulled a shirtsleeve from the corner of his pack wet it with water from a waterskin hanging around his waist and carefully wiped her bloody mouth and chin she winced as he worked but without protest let him inspect her injury its not bad he told her just a cut in the corner of your mouth hold still now she stood quietly as he held her head in one hand while he cleaned the blood off the rest of her face with the other thank you richard she hesitated i was sure one of them was going to cut my throat why didnt you use your han to protect yourself have you forgotten to do that i would have to take power from the link keeping kahlan alive he looked into her blue eyes i guess i forgot in that case thank you for restraining yourself nicci said nothing as they walked out of the town of ripply carrying everything they owned on their backs as cold as the day was it wasnt long before his brow was dotted with sweat finally he could stand it no longer do you mind telling me what that was all about her brow twitched those people were needy richard pinched the bridge of his nose pausing in an effort to remain civil to her and so you gave them all our money are you so selfish that you would not share what you have are you so selfish that you would ask the hungry to starve the unclothed to freeze the sick to die does money mean more to you than peoples lives richard bit the inside of his cheek to check his temper and the horses you virtually gave them away it was all we could get those people were in need under the circumstances it was the best we could do we acted with the most noble of intentions it was our duty to not be selfish and to joyfully give these people what they needed there was no road going their way as they walked on into what had not long ago been the wasteland from which no one returned we needed what we had he said nicci glanced up into his eyes there are things you need to learn richard is that right you have been lucky in life you have had opportunities ordinary people never have i want you to see how ordinary people must live how they must struggle just to survive when you live like them you will understand why the order is so necessary why the order is the only hope for mankind when we get to where were going we will have nothing we will be just like all the other miserable people of this wretched worldwith little chance to make it on our own you dont have any idea what thats like i want you to learn how the compassion of the order helps ordinary people live with the dignity they are entitled to richard returned his gaze to the empty land stretching out before them a sister of the dark who couldnt use her power and a wizard who was forbidden from using his he guessed they couldnt get any more ordinary than that i thought it was you who wanted to learn he said i am also your teacher teachers sometimes learn more than their students chapter zedd lifted his head when he heard the distant horns he struggled to regain his senses he was well past dread into a world of little more than numb awareness the horns were those meant to signal the approach of friendly forces probably some of the scouting patrols or perhaps yet more wounded being brought in zedd realized he was slumped on the ground his legs sprawled out to the side he saw that he had been sleeping with his head on the burly chest of a cold corpse in despair he recalled that he had been trying everything he knew to heal the horribly wounded man in mournful revulsion he pushed away from the cold body and sat up he rubbed his eyes against the darkness from within as well as the night he was beyond aching acrid smoke hung thick as fog the air reeked with the heavy throatclenching stink of blood from various places around him he could see the drifting haze illuminated around glowing orange fists of firelight the moans of the wounded lifted from the bloodsoaked ground to drift through the frigid night air in the distance men cried out in pain when zedd wiped a hand across his brow he realized he wore gloves of crusted blood from those he had been trying to heal it was an endless task not far away the ground was littered with shattered tree trunks blasted asunder by the enemy gifted men lay sprawled torn apart or impaled by huge splintered sections of those trees it had been two of jagangs sisters who had done it just before dark as the dharan forces were all collecting into the valley thinking the battle had ended zedd and warren had ended it by taking those two sisters down with wizards fire by the dull ache in his head zedd knew he hadnt been asleep for more than a couple of hours at most it had to be the middle of the night people passing by had let him sleepor maybe they thought him one of the dead the first day had gone as well as could be expected the battle had dragged on sporadically throughout the first night with relatively minor skirmishes and then had erupted with full force at dawn of the second day as night had fallen on the second day the fighting had finally ended looking around zedd thought it seemed to be overat least for the time being they had made the valley and succeeded in drawing the order after them away from other gateways up into the midlands but at a terrible price they had little choice if they were to engage the enemy with any chance of success rather than allow them unhindered access into the midlands for the moment anyway the order was stalled zedd didnt know how long that would last unfortunately the order had gotten the better of the battle by far zedd peered about it was not so much a camp as simply a place where everyone had dropped in exhaustion here and there arrows and spears stuck up from the ground they had fallen like rain as zedd had worked throughout the night the night before trying to heal wounded soldiers during the day in the battles he had unleashed everything he had what had started out as skillful calculated focused use of his ability had in the end degenerated into the magic equivalent of a brawl zedd staggered to his feet worried about the distant thunder of horses horns closer into camp repeated the warning to hold arrows and spears that it was friendly forces it sounded like too many horses for any patrol they had out in the back of his mind zedd tried to recall if he felt the twinge of magic that would tell him the horns were genuine in the fog of fatigue he had forgotten to pay attention that was how people ended up dead he knewinattention to such details men were rushing all about carrying supplies water and linen for bandages or messages and reports here and there zedd saw a sister working at healing other men struggled with repairs to wagons and gear in case they had to depart in a hurry some men sat staring at nothing a few wandered as if in a daze it was difficult to see in the poor light but zedd was able to see well enough to tell that the ground was littered with the dead the wounded or the simply spent fires both the common orange and yellow flames of burning wagons and the unnatural green blazes that were the remnants of magic were left to burn out on their own horses as well as men lay everywhere still and lifeless torn open by ghastly wounds the battlefields changed but battle didnt now was a time of helpless shock he remembered from his youth the stench of blood and death mingled with greasy smoke it was still the same he remembered in battles past thinking the world had gone mad it still felt the same the rumble of horses was getting closer he could hear quite a commotion but he couldnt tell what sort of ruckus it was off to his right he spotted a stooped woman shuffling toward him he recognized adies familiar limp a woman more distant catching up to adie from behind was probably verna a little farther off zedd saw captain meiffert being lectured to by general leiden both men turned to look toward the clatter of hooves zedd squinted into the murk and saw in the distance soldiers scattering before a mass of approaching riders men waved their arms as if in greeting a few offered weak cheers many pointed in zedds direction funneling the horsemen his way as first wizard he had become a focal point for everyone the dharans in richards absence relied on zedd to be their magic against magic the sisters relied on his experience in the nasty art of magic in warfare in the wavering glow of fires still burning out of control zedd watched the column of horsemen coming relentlessly onward points of light glinting off row upon row of armor and weapons shimmering off chain mail and polished boots as they each in turn passed the burning wagons and barricades the thundering column slowed for nothing expecting men to get out of its way at their fore long pennons flew atop perfectly upright lances standards and flags flapped in the cold night air the ground thundered with thousands of horses charging over the bloodsoaked ground they rolled onward like a ghost company riding out of the grave orange and green smoke lit from behind by the eerie light of fires curled away to each side as the column of riders charged though the middle of the camp at an easy gallop zedd saw then who was leading them dear spirits he whispered aloud sitting tall atop a huge horse at the head of the column was a woman in leather armor with fur billowing out behind her like an angry pennant it was kahlan even at that distance zedd could see sticking up behind her left shoulder the gleam of light off the silver and gold hilt of the sword of truth his flesh went cold with tingling dread he felt a hand on his arm and turned to see adie her completely white eyes transfixed by the sight she beheld through her gift alone verna was still weaving her way through the wounded captain meiffert and general leiden rushed to follow in vernas footsteps the column stretched out behind kahlan as far as zedd could see they charged onward collecting cheering men as they came zedd waved his arms as they all bore down on him so that kahlan would notice him but it seemed as if she had had her eyes on him the whole time the horses skidded to a halt before him snorting and stamping tossing their armored heads plumes of steam rose from their nostrils when they blew great hot breaths in the icy air powerful muscles flexed beneath glossy hides as they pawed the ground the eager beasts stood at the ready their tails lashing side to side slapping their flanks like whips kahlan swept the scene with a careful gaze men were rushing up from all directions those gathering around stared in wonder the horsemen were galeans kahlan had provisionally taken the place of her half sister cyrilla as queen of galea until cyrilla was well againif that ever happened kahlans half brother harold was the commander of the galean army and didnt want the crown feeling himself more fit to serve his land in the soldiers life kahlan had galean blood in her veins although to a confessor matters of blood were irrelevant they were not so irrelevant to galeans kahlan swung her right leg forward over the horses neck and dropped to the ground her boots resounded like a hammer strike announcing the mother confessors arrival cara in her red leather and similarly cloaked in a fur mantle likewise jumped down off her horse battleweary men all around stood in rapt silence this was not merely the mother confessor this was lord rahls wife for just an instant as zedd stared into her green eyes he thought she might run into his arms and break down in helpless tears he was wrong kahlan pulled off her gloves report she wore stealthblack light leather armor a royal galean sword at her left hip and a long knife at her right her thick fall of hair cascaded boldly over the wolfs fur mantle topping a black wool cloak in the midlands the length of a womans hair denoted rank and social standing no midlands woman wore hair as long as kahlans but it was the hilt of the sword sticking up behind her shoulder that held zedds gaze kahlan he whispered as she stepped closer wheres richard whatever pain he had seen for that instant was gone she swept a brief glare vernas way as the young prelate still hurried toward them between the wounded then met zedds gaze with eyes like green fire the enemy has him report the enemy what enemy again her glare slid to verna its power straightened vernas back and slowed her approach kahlan returned her attention to zedd her eyes softened with a vestige of sympathy for the anguish she must have seen on his face a sister of the dark took him zedd the respite of warmth in her voice and eyes faded as her countenance returned to the cold empty mask of a confessor i would like a report please took him but is heis he all right you mean she took him as a prisoner do they want ransom hes still all right she touched the side of her mouth and zedd saw then that she had a swollen cut hes all right as far as i know well whats going on zedd threw up his skinny arms whats this about what does she intend verna finally made it up to zedds left side captain meiffert and general leiden ran up to the other side of adie on his right what sister verna asked still getting her breath back you said a sister took him what sister nicci nicci captain meiffert gasped deaths mistress kahlan met his gaze thats the one now is someone going to give me a report there was no mistaking the command or the rage in her voice captain meiffert lifted an arm to the south mother confessor the imperial order forces all of them finally moved up from anderith he rubbed his brow as he tried to think yesterday morning i guess it was we wanted to pull them up here into the valley country zedd put in our idea was to get them out of the grassland where we couldnt contain them up into country where we had a better chance to do so we knew captain meiffert went on that it would be a fatal mistake to let them get by us and stream into the midlands unopposed we had to draw them into action to prevent them from unleashing their might against the populace we had to engage them and bog them down the only way to do that was to taunt them into following us out of the open where they had the advantage into terrain that helped even the odds kahlan nodded as she scanned the dismal scene how many men did we lose id guess maybe fifteen thousand captain meiffert said but thats just a guess it may be more they flanked you didnt they it didnt sound like a question thats right mother confessor what went wrong the galean troops behind her formed a grim wall of leather chain mail and steel officers with incisive eyes watched and listened what didnt zedd growled somehow the captain explained they knew what we planned although i guess it wouldnt be all that hard to figure out since anyone would know it was our only chance against their numbers they were confident they could defeat us regardless so they obliged our plan like i asked what went wrong what went wrong general leiden interrupted heatedly we were outnumbered beyond all hope thats what went wrong kahlan settled her cool gaze on the man he seemed to catch himself and fell to one knee my queen he added in formal address before falling silent kahlans gaze lost some of its edge as it moved back to captain meiffert zedd noticed the captains fists tightening as he went on with his report somehow mother confessor near as we can tell they managed to get a division across the river were pretty sure they didnt use the open ground to the eastwe had preparations should they try that as we feared they might so kahlan said they reasoned you would think it impossible so they sent a division across the riverprobably a great deal more willing to bear their losses in the crossingwent north through the mountains unsuspected unseen and undetected and crossed back to this side of the river when you got here they were waiting for you holding the ground you had planned to hold with the order hot on your heels you had nowhere else to go the order intended to crush you between that division holding this defendable ground and their army on your tail thats the gist of it captain meiffert confirmed what happened to the division waiting here she asked we wiped them out the captain said with a cool rage of his own once we realized what had happened we knew it was our only chance kahlan gave him a nod she knew full well what a mighty effort his simple words conveyed they cut us to pieces from behind as we did so general leidens temper was getting frayed around the edges we had no chance apparently you did she answered you gained the valley what of it we cant fight a force their size it was insane to throw men into that meat grinder what for we gained this valley but at a terrible price we wont be able to hold a force that huge they had their way with us from the first until the last we didnt stop them they just got tired of hacking us to pieces for the night some men looked away some stared at the ground only the crackle of fires and the moans of the wounded filled the frigid night air kahlan glanced around again what are you doing sitting here now zedds brow went up along with his own anger weve been at it for two days kahlan fine but i dont allow the enemy to go to bed with victory is that clear captain meiffert clapped a fist to his heart in salute clear mother confessor he glanced over his shoulders fists of attentive men near and far likewise went to their hearts mother confessor general leiden said dropping her title of queen the men have been up for two days now i understand kahlan said we have been riding without pause for three days now neither changes what must be done in the harsh reflection of firelight the creases in general leidens face looked like angry gashes he pressed his lips together and bowed to his queen but when he came up he spoke again my queen mother confessor you cant seriously be expecting us to carry out a night attack theres no moon and clouds mostly hide the stars in the dark such an attack would be a disaster its lunacy kahlan finally withdrew her cold glare from the keltish general and passed a gaze among those assembled around her where is general reibisch zedd swallowed im afraid thats him she looked where zedd pointed at the corpse he had fallen asleep atop while trying to heal the rustcolored beard was matted with dried blood the grayishgreen eyes stared without seeing no longer showing pain it had been a fools task zedd knew but he couldnt help trying to heal what could not be healed giving it everything he had left it hadnt been enough who is next in command kahlan asked that would be me my queen general leiden said as he took a stride forward but as the ranking officer i cant allow my men to kahlan lifted a hand that will be all lieutenant leiden he cleared his throat general leiden my queen she fixed him with an implacable stare to question me once is a simple mistake lieutenant twice is treason we execute traitors caras agiel spun up into her fist step aside lieutenant even in the haunting orange and green light of fires zedd could see the mans face pale he took a step back and wisely if belatedly fell silent who is next in command the mother confessor asked again kahlan zedd said im afraid the order used their gifted to single out men of rank despite our best efforts i believe we lost all our senior officers it cost them dearly at least then who is next in command captain meiffert looked around and finally lifted his hand im not positive mother confessor but i believe that would be me very well general meiffert he inclined his head mother confessor he said in a quiet confidential voice that isnt necessary no one said it was general the new general softly struck a fist to his heart zedd saw cara smile in grim approval of the thousands of faces watching that was the only smile it wasnt that the men disapproved but rather that they were relieved to have someone so firmly in command dharans respected iron authority if they couldnt have lord rahl they would take his wife and an iron one at that they might not have smiled but zedd knew they would be pleased as i said i dont allow the enemy to go to bed with victory kahlan scanned the faces watching her i want a cavalry raid ready to go within the hour and who do you intend to send on such an attack my queen everyone knew what the former general leiden meant by the question he was asking who she was sending to their death there will be two wings one to make their way unseen around the orders camp so as to come in from their south where they will least expect it and another wing to hold back until the first is in place and then come in from this side from the north i intend to have us spill some of their blood before bed she looked back to the new lieutenant leidens eyes and answered his question i will be leading the southern wing everyone except the new general began voicing objections leiden spoke up louder my queen why would you want us to get our men together for a calvary raid he pointed to the wall of men all on horses behind her all galeanstraditional adversaries of the keltans leidens homeland when we have these these men will be helping get this army back together relieving those on duty to get needed rest helping dig defensive ditches and filling in wherever they are needed the men who were bloodied are the ones who need to go to bed with the sweet taste of vengeance i would not dare to deny dharans that to which they are so entitled a cheer went up zedd thought that if war was madness madness had just found its mistress general meiffert took a step closer to her ill have my best men ready within the hour mother confessor everyone will want to go ill have to disappoint a lot of volunteers kahlans face softened when she nodded pick your man for the northern wing then general i will be leading the northern wing mother confessor kahlan smiled very well she ordered the galean troops off to their duties with a sweep of her finger she dismissed everyone but the immediate group and called that inner circle closer what about richards admonition not to directly attack the order verna asked i remember well what richard said im not going to directly attack their main force zedd supposed she did remember it well she had been there with richardthey hadnt zedd brought up a touchy issue the main force will be in the center well protected at their edges where you attack will be defenses of course but mostly the camp followers will be at the tail end of the orders campthe fringe to the south mostly i dont really care she said with cold fury if theyre with the order then they are the enemy there will be no mercy she was looking at her new general as she spoke her orders i dont care if we kill their whores or their generals i want every baker and cook dead as much as i want every officer and archer dead every camp follower we kill will deprive them of the comforts they enjoy i want to strip them of everything including their lives is that understood general meiffert gave his nod no mercy youll get no argument from us mother confessor that is the dharan code of warfare zedd knew that in war kahlans way was usually the only way to prevail the enemy would grant no mercy and would need none themselves had they not invaded every whore and hawker chose to be a part of that invasion to make what they could off the blood and plunder spilled at the orders feet verna spoke up mother confessor ann was going to see you and richard we last heard from her over a month ago have you seen her yes verna licked her lips in caution at the steely look in kahlans eyes was she all right the last i saw her she was would you know why she hasnt sent any word to us i threw her journey book in the fire verna stepped forward making to snatch kahlan by the shoulder caras agiel came up like lightning barring her way no one touches the mother confessor caras cold blue eyes were as deadly as her words is that clear no one you have one mordsith and one mother confessor here both in very bad moods kahlan said in a level voice i would suggest you not give us an excuse to lose our temper or we may never find it again in your lifetime zedds fingers found vernas arm and gently urged her back were all tired he said we have enough troubles with the order he shot kahlan a scowl no matter how tired or distraught we are though lets remember were all on the same side here kahlans eyes told him she challenged that statement but she said nothing verna changed the subject i will get together some of the gifted to escort you on the raid thank you but we will be taking no gifted but you will at least need them to help you find your way in the dark we will have the enemy campfires to show us our way kahlan zedd said hoping to interject some reason the order will have giftedincluding sisters of the dark you will need protection from them no i dont want any gifted with us they are expecting any attack to be accompanied by our gifted their gifted will be watching for shields of magic any riders they do see without detecting magic they will be more likely to discount well be able to get in deeper and draw more blood without gifted along verna sighed at such foolishness but didnt argue general meiffert liked her plan zedd knew she was right about getting in deeper but he knew too that getting back out would be more difficult once the enemy was on to them zedd i would like one bit of magic he scratched his brow in resignation what would you like me to do kahlan gestured at the ground make that dust glow i want it to show up in the dark and i want it sticky for how long she shrugged the rest of the night would be enough after zedd had spun a web over the dusty patch of ground giving it a green glow kahlan bent and rubbed her hand in it she walked around back of her horse and slapped the hand on each flank leaving a glowing green handprint on each hindquarter what are you doing zedd asked its dark i want them to be able to see me they cant come after me if they cant find me in the dark zedd sighed at the madness general meiffert squatted and rubbed his hand in the glowing dust id also hate for them to miss me in the dark be sure to wash your hand clean before we go she said after she had explained her plan to the new general kahlan cara and general meiffert started off to their tasks before they could get far zedd halted kahlan with a softly spoken question kahlan do you have any idea how we can get richard back she gazed boldly into his eyes yes i have a plan would you mind sharing it with me its simple i plan on killing every imperial order man woman and child until i get to the very last one left alive and then if she doesnt give him back im going to kill her too chapter kahlan focused past the black void to the glowing points of the fires as she leaned forward over the withers of her galloping horse urging him onward faster and faster the muscles in her thighs strained as she pressed her weight against the stirrups and squeezed her legs against the feverish warmth of the massive body rhythmically incessantly frantically flexing and stretching feeling its every pounding strike against the ground her ears were filled with the hammering of her own heart and the thunder of yet more hooves behind her she was distantly aware of the weight of the sword of truth sheathed in its scabbard an everpresent reminder of richard she gripped the reins in one fist with her other she lifted her royal galean sword high the lights were coming unexpectedly the first came out of nowhere and exploded into her vision racing past what looked to be the light of a single candle she was there at last crying out with the sudden power of emotions that could no longer be stifled she slammed her sword down against the dark shape of a man the impact of the blade against bone jarred her wrist the hilt stung against her palm on their way by the men behind her unleashed their fury against the remaining sentries at the outpost kahlan held tight knowing the greater unleashing of her need was yet to come she would not be denied now the fires of the outer fringes of the camp flew toward her her muscles were rigid with expectation she felt at the brink of control and then she was upon them at last she was there she met them with all her strength her blade came down again and again lashing against their bodies slashing anyone within her reach the outer fires shot past the sides of her horse with dizzying speed she gasped for breath laying the reins over kahlan pulled her big warhorse around in a tight circle he was not as agile as she would have preferred but he was well trained and for this job he would do he bellowed with the excitement of battle begun tents and wagons were scattered everywhere with little apparent order kahlan could hear the merry laughter of those not yet aware of the enemy in their midst she had brought a small attack force keeping them tight and close on the way in so it wouldnt raise the kind of alarm a broad attack would it had worked she saw men around fires tipping up bottles or eating meat off skewers she saw men sleeping with their feet sticking out of tents she saw a man walking with his arm around the waist of a woman in the dim light she saw men in tents between the legs of other women the couple arm in armundoubtedly at a pricewas close the man was on the far side of the woman as kahlan raced up behind them so with a mighty swing she took off the womans head instead the stupefied man clutched the headless body as it began to fall the cavalry man right behind kahlan took the startled man down kahlan dug in her heels and charged her big warhorse over a haphazard row of tents with men and women inside she could feel the huge hooves crushing bone screams rose around her and her mount a soldier with a pike stood with his legs spread in a stance of sudden alarm on her way past kahlan snatched the pike from his grip stabbed it into a small tent twisting it getting the canvas tangled up on its barbs and then backed her horse hauling the tent off a man and woman her men following behind stabbed the exposed couple as kahlan pulled the remnants of the tent through a fire as soon as it lit she dragged the flaming canvas to a wagon setting that wagons tarp afire and then threw the blazing remains in another wagon full of supplies with a backhanded swing of her sword kahlan smashed the face of a burly man who ran up to pull her off her horse she had to yank the blade free of his skull before more men could snatch at her she dug in her heels again and charged off toward another fire where men were just jumping to their feet the horse knocked down several and her sword cut another by now the shrieks of women sent up an effective alarm and men were rushing out of tents and wagons with weapons in their fists the whole scene was one of erupting pandemonium kahlan wheeled her mount stabbing anyone within reach many were not soldiers her sword felled leatherworkers and wagon masters whores and soldiers highstepping at her command her horse trampled down a line of big tents where wounded were being cared for beside a lamp kahlan spotted a surgeon with needle and thread working on a mans leg she drove her horse around to trample the surgeon and the man he was sewing up the surgeon held his arms up before his face but his arms were no good at warding the weight of a huge warhorse kahlan signaled her men in army surgeons were valuable the dharans killed every one they saw she knew that killing each was as good as killing untold numbers of enemy soldiers kahlan and her men wreaked havoc through the whores tents toppled cook wagons cut down soldiers and civilians alike when her men saw lamps they leaped off their horses and snatched them up to use to start fires kahlan hacked at an enraged cook who came at her with a butcher knife it took three rapid cuts to dispatch him to her left caras horse cut off a man about to throw a spear cara coolly went about killing him and anyone else within her reach a twist of her agiel usually seized up their hearts and if not kahlan could at least hear bones snap their cries of death and pain seemed frightful enough to send a shiver up the spines of the dead and did add to the general confusion and panic it was glorious music to kahlans ears the agiel would only function through the bond to the lord rahl because it worked she and cara knew richard was alive that alone gave kahlan heart it was almost as if he were there with her his sword strapped to her back was like his hand touching her encouraging her to throw herself into the fight telling her to cut the indiscriminate nature of the killing in among the camp followers confused the enemy soldiers and terrorized the people who commonly believed themselves impervious to the violence they ultimately fed off of now rather than being the vultures picking at the carcasses they were the hapless prey life in the imperial orders camp would never be the samekahlan would see to that no more would the enemy soldiers enjoy the comforts provided by these people they would now know they were no less targets than officers they would know the price of their participation the price was a merciless death and payment had come due slashing her way through the running crowds of screaming people kahlan kept an eye on a large group of the imperial orders horses stabled not far off watching as soldiers threw saddles on their mounts she drove her horse over men and tents getting closer until she was sure she was within earshot of those cavalry men saddling their horses kahlan stood in her stirrups waving her sword high in the air men paused to stare i am the mother confessor for the crime of invading the midlands i condemn you all to death every one of you the hundred men with her sent up a cheer their voices joined in a chant death to the order death to the order death to the order kahlan and her men charged their horses around in an everwidening circle trampling anyone they could hacking anyone within reach stabbing anyone who rushed them setting fire to anything that would burn these dharan soldiers were the best at what they did and they did it with brilliant effectiveness when they found a wagon with oil they broke the barrels open and tossed on flaming logs they plucked up with lances from fires night whooshed into day everyone could plainly see kahlan now as she charged through their midst screaming her pronouncement of death kahlan saw the orders cavalry mounting up pulling their lances from racks drawing their swords she reared her horse holding her sword high you are all cowards you will never catch me or best me you will all die like the cowards you are at the hands of the mother confessor when her horse came down she thumped its ribs with her boots the horse charged off at a dead run cara right at her side her hundred men at her heels a few thousand infuriated imperial order cavalry right behind them with more mounting up all the time being at the edge of the orders camp they wouldnt have much ground to cover before they were out of the camp again and into the open countryside as they raced away kahlan took the opportunity to kill anyone who presented themselves it was too dark to tell if they were men or woman and it didnt matter anyway she wanted them all dead each time her sword made contact slashing muscle or breaking bone was a delicious release running at full speed past the last of the campfires they plunged suddenly into the black void of night kahlan leaned forward over her horses muscular neck as they ran west hoping there were no holes in the ground if they hit one it would be all over not just for her horse but most likely for her as well she knew this land well enough the gentle hills the bluffs ahead she knew where she was even in the dark and she knew where she was going she was counting on the enemy not knowing in the disorienting sweep of darkness they would fixate on following the glowing handprints on her horses rump thinking one of their gifted had gotten close enough to mark her horse for them they would be gleeful with the blinding anticipation of having her naked to their swords kahlan used the flat of her own sword to smack her horses flanks urging him on whipping him into a wild state they were away from the excitement of battle now and out in the lonely openness of the countryside horses dreaded predators nipping at their flanks especially in the dark she encouraged him to think teeth were snapping at his hindquarters her men were right behind her but as instructed rode to each side so there was a gap allowing the enemy to see the glowing marks on her horse when kahlan feared she was as close as they dared get she signaled with a whistle over her shoulders she watched her men her protection peeling away off into the night she would not see them again until she returned to the dharan camp with her advantage of the distant fires of the orders camp in back of them kahlan was able to see the silhouette of the enemy cavalry close behind coming at a full charge their hungry gazes no doubt fixed on the glowing handprints on her horses flanks the only thing they could see out in the wideopen countryside on a moonless night how far cara called over from close beside her should be kahlans words cut off when she suddenly spotted briefly what was right there before her now cara kahlan pulled her leg up just in time as cara rammed her horse over the two huge animals jostled dangerously kahlan threw her arm around caras shoulders caras arm seized kahlans waist and yanked her over off her horse kahlan gave her horse one last smack with the flat of her sword the horse snorted in panic as it charged onward at full speed into the blackness kahlan threw her leg over the rump of caras horse sheathed her sword and then held tight to caras waist as the mordsith pulled her horses head hard to the left forcing it at a full gallop to turn away just in time for an instant through a break in the clouds kahlan spied the dull slur of starlight reflecting off the churning icy waters of the drun river below she felt a pang of sorrow for her startled bewildered terrified horse as it sailed out over the bluff it was giving its life to take many more with it the beast would probably never know what had happened neither would the imperial order cavalry as they followed the glowing handprints on into the dark this was her midlands kahlan knew what was there they were invaders and did not even if they did see it coming in the last twinkling of their lives at a full charge into pitch blackness they would never have a chance to avert their doom she hoped though that those men did realize what was happening just before they gasped in the frigid dark waters or before their lungs burst with the need of air as the merciless river dragged them down into its inky embrace she hoped every one of those men suffered a horrifying death in the dark depths of those treacherous currents kahlan turned her thoughts away from the heat of battle the forces of the dharan empire could sleep now with a victory over their enemy and with the sweet taste of vengeance kahlan found that it did little though to quell the fires of her raging anger after a brief time caras horse slowed to a canter and then a walk they heard no hoofbeats behind them only winters vast silence after the crush of people the noise and the turbulence of the imperial orders camp the isolation of the empty grasslands seemed somehow oppressive kahlan felt as if she were a speck of nothing in the middle of nowhere cold and exhausted kahlan pulled her fur mantle around her shoulders her legs trembled from the effort finally finished she felt as if everything had been washed out of her her head slumped forward to rest against caras back kahlan was aware of the weight of richards sword lying against her own back well cara said over her shoulder after they had ridden for a time through the hushed expanse of countryside we do this every night for a year or two and that should just about wipe them all out for the first time in what seemed an eternity kahlan almost laughed almost chapter by the time kahlan and cara rode in among the wounded the exhausted and the sleeping dharan troops it was only a few hours from dawn kahlan had thought they might have to find a safe place out in the grasslands to sleep and wait for daylight in order to find their way back but they had been fortunate a break in the cloud cover had allowed the stars to show them the way in the shimmering sweep of stars alone they had been able to see the black drape of mountains at the horizon with that visual guide they were able to make their way far out into the empty country so that they could safely get around the imperial order and then head back north to their own troops a reception party awaited them men rushed up to form cheering rows as they passed into camp kahlan felt a distant sense of pride that she had given these men what they needed most right then a measure of retribution from the back of caras horse kahlan lifted a hand to wave at the men she passed she smiled for them alone near the area where the horses were picketed general meiffert having heard the cheering was waiting impatiently he trotted over to meet them beside the gate of the temporary corral one of the soldiers took the reins to the horse as kahlan and then cara jumped down kahlan winced at the ache in her muscles from the recent days of hard riding and the night of fighting her right arm socket throbbed from the blows she had landed she mused to herself that her sword arm never hurt like that in her mock battles with richard for the benefit of anyone watching she forced herself to walk as if she had just had a threeday rest general meiffert looking no worse for the battle he had seen that night clapped a fist to his heart mother confessor you cant imagine how relieved i am to see you and i you general he leaned forward please mother confessor you arent going to do anything that foolhardy again are you it wasnt foolhardy cara said i was with her watching out for her he frowned over at cara but didnt argue with her kahlan wondered how one could fight a war without doing anything foolhardy the entire thing was foolhardy how many men did we lose kahlan asked instead general meifferts face split with a grin none mother confessor can you believe it with the creators help they all came back i dont recall the creator wielding a sword with us cara said kahlan was dumbfounded thats the best news i could have general mother confessor i cant tell you what a boost that was to the men but please you wont do anything like that again will you im not here to smile and wave and look pretty for the men general im here to help them send those murderous bastards into the eternal arms of the keeper he sighed in resignation we have a tent for you im sure youre tired kahlan nodded and let the general lead her and cara through the now quiet camp men not sleeping stood and silently saluted with fists to their hearts kahlan tried to smile for them she could see in their eyes how much they appreciated what she had done to turn the tide of the grim battle back a little in their favor they probably thought she had done it for them that was only partly true arriving at a wellguarded group of a halfdozen tents general meiffert gestured to the one in the center this was general reibischs tent mother confessor i had your things put inside i thought you should have the best tent if it bothers you to sleep in his tent though ill have your belongings moved to anywhere you wish it will be fine general kahlan took stock of the mans young face seeing the shadow of sorrow she reminded herself that he was about the same age as she we all miss him his expression showed only some of the pain she thought he must feel i cant replace a man like that mother confessor he was not just a great general but a great man too he taught me a lot and honored me with his trust he was the best man i ever served under i dont want you to have any illusions about my replacing him i know i cant no one asked you to your best effort is all we expect and will serve us well im sure he smiled at her generosity youll have that mother confessor i promise you youll have that he turned to cara and changed the subject i had your things put in this tent here mistress cara it was the one right beside kahlans tent cara scanned the scene taking note of the patrolling guards when kahlan told her that she was going to go right to bed and that she should get some sleep too cara agreed and bade the two of them a good night before disappearing into her tent i appreciated your help tonight general you should get some sleep too he bowed his head turned to leave but then turned back you know i always hoped to someday become a general ever since i was a boy ive dreamed of it i imagined he looked away from kahlans eyes i guess i imagined it would make me proud and happy he hooked his thumbs in his pockets and gazed out over the dark camp perhaps seeing all those dreams from his past or maybe seeing all his new duties it didnt make me feel happy at all he finally said i know she answered in sincere sympathy this wasnt the way any good man would want to gain rank but sometimes challenges arise and we must face them she let out a silent sigh and tried to envision how he must feel someday general the pride and satisfaction will come it comes from doing the job well and knowing that you are making a difference he nodded i know it felt pretty good tonight mother confessor when i saw you on the back of caras horse returning safely to camp i look forward to the day when i see lord rahl ride into camp too he started away sleep well dawn is in a couple of hours then well find out what the new day will bring ill have reports ready for you inside her tent zedd was sitting alone waiting kahlan groaned inwardly she was dead tired and didnt want to face the old wizards questioning sometimes especially if you were tired his nettling questions could become irksome she knew he meant well but she was in no mood for it she didnt think she could even be civil to him if he started down his road of a thousand questions it was so late and she was so tired she simply wished he would let her be she stood just inside saying nothing watching him as he rose to his feet his wavy white hair was more disorderly than usual his heavy robes were filthy and spattered with blood around his knees the robes were dark with dried blood he gave her a long look and then enclosed her in his skinny arms she just wanted to sleep he silently held her head to his shoulder maybe he thought she might be about to start crying but there seemed no tears left she felt numb she supposed it was the constant rage but she just couldnt cry anymore she seemed only able to feel anger zedd finally held her out at arms length squeezing her shoulders in his surprisingly strong fingers i just wanted to wait until you were back and safe before i went to bed i wanted to let my eyes take you in he smiled in a sad way im so very relieved youre safe sleep well kahlan her bedroll still tied up with its leather thongs lay atop a pallet with a strawfilled mattress saddlebags were draped over her pack sitting in the corner opposite the bed there was a small folding table and chair beside them a basket with rolls of maps another little folding table held a ewer and basin a clean towel was draped over the table legs stretcher bar the tent was spacious by army standards but it was still cramped the canvas looked heavy enough to keep out most any weather lamps hanging at each end of the tent from a rod forming the peak of the roof cast a warm glow inside the snug tent kahlan tried to imagine the burly general reibisch pacing in such a small space tugging his rustcolored beard worrying over the problems of an army bigger than many cities zedd looked exhausted creases etched an inner anguish on his bony face she reminded herself that he had only just learned that his grandson the only family he had left in the world was in the cruel hands of the enemy besides that zedd had been fighting for two days and healing soldiers at night she had seen him when she arrived staggering to his feet beside the corpse of what turned out to be general reibisch she knew that if zedd couldnt save the man he was beyond saving with her fingers kahlan combed back her hair and then gestured to the chair you could sit for a minute zedd couldnt you he looked at the chair then at her bedroll for a minute i suppose while you get your bed ready you need some rest kahlan couldnt argue with that she realized her head was throbbing the passions of battle masked little things like a pounding headache the strawfilled mattress looked as good as a feather bed to her right then she tossed her wolffur mantle and her cloak on the bed they would keep her warm without comment zedd watched as she unstrapped the sword of truth and pulled it off her back he had given the weapon to richard kahlan had been there and begged zedd not to do it but he said he had no choice that richard was the one zedd had been right richard was indeed the one she felt her face flush when just before she laid the sword down she kissed the top of the hilt where richards hand had so often rested zedd if he even noticed said nothing and she laid the gleaming scabbard and sword to rest beside her mattress in the awkward quiet kahlan took off the royal galean sword she saw then that there was blood running down the scabbard she unstrapped and removed the layer of light leather armor and laid it beside her pack when she leaned the royal sword and scabbard against the plates of leather armor she saw then that they were splattered with blood she noticed too that the leather leg armor had bloody handprints here and there on it and there were long gouges in the leather from mens fingernails she remembered men grabbing for her trying to unhorse her but she didnt recall their hands actually clawing at her the images that started flooding back threatened to make her nauseated so she directed her mind to other things cara and i crossed over the rangshada mountains north of agaden reach and came down through galea she said into the uncomfortable silence i gathered he said she gestured vaguely to suggest the surrounding camp i thought id better bring some troops with me we can use them kahlan glanced up at his hazel eyes i brought all i could without waiting i didnt want to wait zedd nodded that was wise prince harold wanted to come but i asked him to gather together a larger force and then bring them down if were to defend the midlands well need more troops he thought that was a good idea sounds so prince harold will be here to help just as soon as he can gather his army from their defensive positions zedd only nodded she cleared her throat i wish we could have gotten here sooner zedd shrugged you came as fast as possible youre here now kahlan turned away to the bedroll she sank down to her knees and bent to the work of undoing the leather thongs holding the bedding all rolled up together for some reason the knots looked blurryshe guessed it was because she was so tired she glanced over her shoulder briefly in the dim lamplight and then went back to picking at the knot i suppose youd like to know how that sister of the dark managed to capture richard he was silent for a moment his voice finally came soft and gentle theres time enough for that later kahlan theres no need tonight as she picked at the stubborn knot her hair fell forward over her shoulder she had to push it back in order to see what she was doing the stupid leather thong was tightly knotted she wanted to yell at the person who had tied it but she had done it up herself and had no one else to blame she used a maternity spell on me it links us she said she couldshe could kill me if richard didnt do as she said and go with her at the news zedd only let out a desolate sigh richard cant kill her or i die too she waited for his voice behind her it finally came ive only read about such spells but from what i know it sounds as if she told you the truth of it i have a cut on my mouth i didnt do it it happened to me the other daythrough that link what happens to her happens to me i hope richard struck her it was worth it i dont think richard would do that she knew he wouldnt it was only a wish one of the little lamps was flickering making shadows waver the other was hissing softly kahlan wiped her nose on her sleeve richard gave up his freedom to keep me alive i wish i could die to free him but he made me promise i wouldnt do that kahlan felt a comforting hand on her shoulder zedd said nothing it was the greatest kindness he could have given her at that momentnot burying her heart under an avalanche of questions enjoying the calming effect of his hand kahlan finally managed to get the knot undone zedd sat back in his chair as she unfurled her bedding the carving of spirit was rolled up inside for safekeeping its height was just right to fit crosswise in her bedroll kahlan lifted it out and held it to her heart a moment she turned then and set spirit on the little table zedd slowly rose to his feet he was a collection of bony angles under his maroon robes with one arm crooked to point while he gaped at spirit standing proudly atop the small table his lanky body looked as stiff as a spindly tree in winter where else did you stop on your way here he cast a suspicious look in her direction have you been looting treasures from palaces she realized then that the look wasnt so much meant to be suspicious as teasing kahlan ran a finger down spirits flowing robes letting her gaze follow the strength in the lines of the womans strong pose something felt so right about the way her head was thrown back with her fists at her sides and her back arched standing against the invisible power trying to subdue her no kahlan swallowed richard carved it for me zedds brow drew lower he stared at the carving for a time before reaching out a sticklike finger to touch it as if it were some priceless antiquity dear spirits kahlan pretended a smile almost its called spirit he said richard carved it for me when i was feeling like i would never get better it helped me in the awful silence zedd finally turned from the woman with her fists at her sides and her head thrown back to peer into kahlans eyes he frowned in the oddest way its you he said half to himself dear spirits the boy carved a statue of your spirit i recognize it its as plain as day zedd was not only richards grandfatherhe was now hers too he was not merely the first wizard he was also the man who had helped raise richard zedd had no family left save richard other than a half sister and brother who were strangers but for blood neither did she she was as alone in the world as was zedd now through richard zedd was her family but even if he wasnt she realized he could mean no less to her well get him back dear one he whispered in tender compassion his sticklike hand reverently cupped her face well get him back everything seemed to be swimming kahlan fell into his protective arms and dissolved into tears chapter warren carefully pulled the snowladen pine bough aside for her kahlan peered through the gap there he said in a low voice you see kahlan nodded as she squinted off into the narrow valley far below the scene was frosted whitewhite trees white rocks white meadows enemy troops moving up the distant valley floor looked like a dark line of ants marching across powdered sugar i dont think you need to whisper warren cara said from behind kahlans other shoulder they cant hear you not from this far warrens blue eyes turned to the mordsith caras red leather would have stood out like a beacon were she not sheathed in wolf fur that made her melt into the background of snowdusted brush kahlans own fur mantle was soft and warm against the sides of her face sometimes since richard had made it for her the feel against her skin was evocative of his gentle caress protecting her and keeping her warm oh but their gifted can hear us cara even from this distance if we are too vociferous caras nose wrinkled whats that mean loud kahlan whispered in a way as if to suggest cara should use a little more caution and be more quiet caras face distorted with her displeasure at the thought of magic she shifted her weight to her other foot went back to watching the line of troops slowly flowing up the valley and kept silent after shed seen enough kahlan gestured and the three of them started back through the ankledeep snow at their elevation in the mountains they were right at the base of oppressive gray clouds making it feel as if they were looking down from another world she didnt like the world she had seen they trudged up the slope dense with pine and naked aspen to the thickly wooded top of the ridge where the backbone of rock broke through the snow here and there like halfburied bones their horses waited a good distance back down off the rocky slope farther back down the mountain where warren and kahlan were sure they would not be detected by any gifted who might be protecting the order troops waited an escort of dharan guards general meiffert had handpicked to protect kahlan and the two with her who were also protecting her so you see warren asked in little more than a whisper theyre still at itmoving more and more men up this way trying to get around us without us being aware of it kahlan held up the fur to shelter her face as a light breeze dragged a curtain of snow past them at least it wasnt snowing again yet i dont think so warren his questioning handsome face turned her way then what i think they want it to look like theyre sending troops past us so we will send men way out here after them a diversion i think so its just close enough to us to be likely we would discover them yet far enough away and through difficult enough terrain that it would require us to split our forces in order to do anything about it besides every one of our scouts came back isnt that good sure it is but what if they have gifted with them as you believe how is it that not one of our scouts failed to make it back to report these massive troop movements warren thought that over a moment as the three of them carefully made it over a high spot sliding on their bottoms down the far side of the slippery sloping rock i think theyre fishing cara said as her boots thumped down on solid ground behind them their gifted dont try to net the small fry hoping to draw bigger fish close kahlan brushed the snow from her backside like us warren looked skeptical you think this is all just some sort of elaborate trap to snare officers or gifted well no kahlan said that would only be a bonus for them i think their main intent is to spur us into splitting our forces to deal with what they want us to believe is this threat warren scratched his head of curly blond hair his blue eyes twitched back in the direction the three of them had come down off the ridge as if trying to look again at what he could not see but if theyre sending great numbers of troops northeven if it is to draw away some of our forcesshouldnt that concern us of course it should kahlan said if it were true warren glanced over at her as they struggled through deeper snow drifted under crags they passed beneath on their way up a steep little rise her legs were weary with the effort warren held out his hand to help her up a high step he did the same for cara cara gestured that she didnt need the hand but she didnt level a scowl at him either kahlan was always pleased to see evidence that cara was learning that offers of modest aid were simply a courtesy and not necessarily accusations of weakness then im confused warren said as he panted kahlan came to a halt to let them all catch their breath she lifted an arm back toward the enemy troops off beyond the ridge yes if it were true that great numbers of troops were going out around us and heading north that would concern us but i dont believe they are warren swiped a blond lock off his forehead you dont think all those men are heading north where then nowhere kahlan said that many men youve got to be joking she smiled at the look on his face i believe its a trick i think its only a small number of men but the scouts have been reporting mass numbers of men moving north for three days now hush cara warned getting even with an air of mock scolding warren covered his mouth with both hands when he realized hed shouted they had their breath back so kahlan started out again taking them over the top of the little rise onto flatter ground following their footsteps back the way they had come remember what the scouts said yesterday she asked him they tried to go over to the mountains on the other side to have a look at the lay of the land beyond and the enemy troops moving north through it but the passes were too heavily guarded i remember i think ive just figured out why she gestured by looping her hand around as she went on i think what were seeing is a relatively small group of the same men just going around in a big circle were only seeing them at the point where they pass up this valley we see troops marching by continuously for days and we assume theyre moving a lot of men but i think its just a circle of the same ones going round and round warren stopped to stare at her his face turned grave at the implications so if were tricked into thinking theyre moving an army up this way then we will split our army in response and send part of them out after this phantom force were already outnumbered cara said as she nodded to herself but we have the advantage of defending terrain that suits our purpose however if they could reduce our numbers substantially simply by getting us to send a large percentage off on some mission first their entire army might finally be able to overrun a smaller number of remaining defenders makes sense warren stroked his chin in thought looking back at the ridge what if youre wrong kahlan turned to look back toward the ridge too well if im wrong then kahlan frowned at a fat old maple tree not ten feet away she thought she saw the bark move the dusting of snow on the scaly gray furrowed bark began disappearing melting away in an ever widening area like dross floating on the surface of a boiling cauldron the bark moved kahlan gasped as warren seized her and cara by the collar and flung them both down on their backs the wind knocked from her lungs kahlan tried to sit up but warren dived to the ground between them pinning them both down before kahlan had a chance to get her breath or ask what was wrong blinding light flashed in the still woods a deafening boom rent the air and jolted the ground beneath her splintered wood from toothpicksize fragments to fencepostsize sections howled past inches above her face huge sections of wood thanked as they rebounded off rocks others spun caroming off tree trunks pieces tumbling along the ground kicking up snow peppered with frozen chunks of dirt the air went white as the shock from the blast blew a wall of snow up into the air if any of them had been standing they would have been torn to shreds as soon as the last pieces of timber trailing smoke thudded to ground warren rolled toward her gifted he whispered kahlan frowned at him what gifted he whispered again they focused their power to boil the frozen tree inside and make it explode thats how we lost so many men when we gathered back in that valley during the first battle back just before you came to us they surprised us kahlan nodded she peeked up but saw no one she glanced over to see if cara was all right wheres cara she asked in an urgent whisper warren cautiously peered off searching the empty scene kahlan lifted herself a little on an elbow and saw only the disturbed snow where cara had been dear creator warren said you dont suppose theyve snatched her do you kahlan saw tracks where there had been none before leading off to the side i think a scream that would have made a brave man blanch reverberated through the trees it trailed off in an agonizing echo cara warren asked i dont think so kahlan carefully sat up and saw that a hole had been torn open in the crowded growth of the forest crown letting harsh light penetrate the shaded woodland sanctuary below the ground all around was littered with splintered wood broken branches huge limbs fallen to ground and boughs ripped from other trees gouges down through the white layer of snow into the dark forest floor radiated from a ragged bowlshaped depression where the tree had been fragments of wood and root lay on the ground everywhere and were even caught up in the surrounding trees warren put a hand to her shoulder urging kahlan to stay down as he rolled into a crouch she flipped over onto her stomach and cautiously rose up onto her hands and knees kahlan jumped up and pointed there through the trees she saw cara returning the mordsith was herding a small man in obvious pain along before her each time he stumbled and fell she kicked him in the ribs rolling him through the snow before her he cried out his words coming as a whining cry that kahlan couldnt make out because of the distance the words werent hard to imagine though cara had captured one of the gifted it was for tasks such as this that mordsith had been created for someone with the gift trying to use magic against a mord sith was a mistake that cost them their control over their own ability kahlan stood brushing snow from herself warren his violet robes crusted with snow rose beside her transfixed by the sight this was one of the wizards responsible for killing so many men when the dharans had gathered in the valley after the order began moving north this was the vicious animal who did jagangs bidding he didnt seem like a vicious animal now as he wept and begged before the implacable captor driving him on before her he was a bundle of rags flinging out around him as he rolled through the snow with a final mighty kick that deposited him at kahlan and warrens feet he lay facedown whimpering like a child cara bent seized him by his tangled mat of dark hair and yanked him to his feet it was a child lyle warren stared incredulously lyle it was you tears ran from wintery eyes he wiped his nose on the back of a tattered sleeve as he glared at warren young lyle looked to be a boy of perhaps ten or twelve years but since warren knew him kahlan realized he was probably from the palace of the prophets too lyle was a young wizard warren reached out to cup the boys bloody chin kahlan snatched warrens wrist the boy lunged to bite warrens hand cara was quicker she snatched him back by the hair as she rammed her agiel into his back shrieking in pain he crumpled to the ground she kicked the injured lad in the ribs warren held his hands out imploring cara dont her icy blue eyes turned up to challenge him he tried to kill us he tried to kill the mother confessor she ground her teeth and while looking warren in the eye kicked the whimpering boy again warren licked his lips i know but but what hes so young it isnt right and so it would be better if we just let him kill us would that make it right for you kahlan knew cara was right as difficult as it was to witness cara was right if they died how many men women and children would the imperial order go on to slaughter child though he was he was a tool of the order nonetheless kahlan gestured cara that that was enough when kahlan signaled cara again seized his tangled mat of dirty hair in her fist and hauled him to his feet with caras thighs at his back he stood shivering blood running down his face pulling short ragged breaths as kahlan stared down into terrified tearfilled brown eyes she put on her confessors face the face her mother had taught her when she was but a little girl the face that masked her inner tumult i know youre there jagang she said in a quiet voice devoid of emotion the boys bloody mouth turned up in a smile that was not his own you made a mistake jagang well have an army soon on its way to stop them the boy smiled a vacant bloody smile but said nothing lyle warren said his voice brittle with anguish you can be free of the dream walker you must only swear loyalty to richard and you will be flee believe me lyle try i know what its like try lyle and i swear ill help you kahlan thought that with warren there a man he knew he might throw himself toward the unexpected light coming from the open dungeon door the boy behind the smile that was not his own watched warren with longing that slowly curdled to loathing this was a child who had seen the struggle for freedom bring horror and death and knew that servile obedience brought rewards and life he was not old enough to understand what more there was to it with a gentle touch of her fingers kahlan urged warren to back away he reluctantly complied this isnt the first of jagangs wizards weve captured she said offhandedly to warren her words though were not meant for warren kahlan looked up into caras stern blue eyes and then glanced off to the side hoping the mordsith understood the instruction marlin pickard kahlan said as if recalling the name for warren but her words were still meant for cara he was grown and even with this pompous pretend emperor directing him marlin still wasnt able to give us much trouble marlin had in fact given them a great deal of trouble he had nearly killed cara and kahlan both kahlan hoped cara remembered how tenuous was her control over someone possessed by the dream walker the mood in the quiet woods was still and tense as the boy glared up at kahlan we discovered your scheme in time jagang you made a mistake thinking you could get by our scouts i hope youre with those men so that when we wipe them out we can cut your throat the bloody grin widened a woman like you is wasted on the side of the weak the boy said in the menacing voice of a man youd have a much better time serving strength and the order im afraid my husband likes me right where i am and where is your husband darlin i was hoping to say hello hes around kahlan said in the same dispassionate voice she saw warren when she had spoken the words move in a way that was a little too much like surprise is he now the boys eyes turned from warren back to kahlan why is it i dont believe you she wanted to kick the boys teeth in as she watched his cruel grin kahlans mind raced trying to figure out what jagang could possibly know and what he was trying to discover youll see him soon enough when we get this poor child back to camp im sure richard rahl will want to laugh in your cowardly face when i tell him how we discovered the great emperors plan to sneak troops north hell want to personally tell you what a fool you are the boy tried to take a step toward her but caras fist in his hair restrained him he was a cougar on a leash still testing its chains the bloody smile remained but it was not as selfsatisfied as it had been in the brown eyes kahlan thought she saw hesitation ah but i dont believe you he said as if losing interest we both know hes not there at all dont we darlin kahlan resolved to take a risk youll see him for yourself soon enough she made to look as if she were going to turn away but turned back to him instead kahlan let a sarcastic smile taint her lips ohyou must mean nicci the smile vanished from the boys face the brow drew down but he managed to keep any anger out of his voice nicci i dont know what youre talking about darlin sister of the dark shapely blond hair blue eyes black dress surely you would remember a woman that hauntingly beautiful or besides your other shortcomings are you also a eunuch the eyes watched and in them kahlan could see careful calculations weighing her every word but it was niccis words about jagang that kahlan was remembering i know who nicci is i know every private inch of her one day i will come to know you as intimately as i know nicci such an obscene threat was somehow more chilling coming as it did from the mouth of a boy it made her sick to her stomach to hear a child express jagangs vile thoughts the boys arm gestured for his master one of my beauties and quite the lethal lady besides kahlan thought she detected in jagangs gravelly growl a hint of the false bravado of a bluff almost in afterthought he added you havent really seen her kahlan heard in the assertion the ghost of a question he dared not ask and knew by it that there was something more to this she wished she knew what she shrugged again lethal i wouldnt know he licked the blood from his lips thats what i thought i wouldnt know because she didnt seem all that lethal she didnt manage to harm any of us the grin returned you lie darlin if you really saw nicci she would have killed at least some of you even if she didnt manage to kill you all you couldnt best that one without her scratching someones eyes out first really so sure are we the boy let out a belly laugh darlin i know nicci im sure kahlan smiled her contempt into the boys brown eyes you know im telling you the truth really he said still chuckling hows that you know its the truth because shes one of your slaves so you should be able to enter her mind you cant though i know why you cant even though you arent too bright i dont suppose youll need to think too long to imagine why not fierce rage fired the boys eyes i dont believe you kahlan shrugged suit yourself if you saw her then where is she now as she turned her back on him kahlan told him the brutal bitter truth and let him interpret it his own way last i saw her she was on her way into oblivion kahlan heard the bellow behind her she spun back to see cara trying to stop him with her agiel kahlan heard the bone in his arm snap it didnt even slow him the boy in a wild rage his hands clawed his teeth bared lunged for kahlan half turned back to him kahlan lifted her hand against the full weight of the boy crashing toward her as he leaped for her throat his small chest contacted her hand his feet were clear of the ground it felt not as if he were throwing himself at her but no more than dandelion fluff floating to her on a breath of air time was hers it was not necessary for kahlan to invoke her birthright but merely to withdraw her restraint of it her feelings could provide her no safe haven only the truth would serve her now this was not a small boy hurt alone afraid this was the enemy the inner violence of her powers cold coiled force slipping its bounds was breathtaking it surged up from that deep dark core within obediently inundating every fiber of her being she could count each small rib under her fingers she contained no hate no rage no horror no sorrow in that infinitesimal spark of time her mind was in a void where there was no emotion only the allconsuming rush of time suspended he had no chance he was hers kahlan did not hesitate she unleashed her power from an ethereal state as part of her innermost essence that power became all thunder without sound jolted the airexquisite violent and for that pristine instant sovereign the boys face was twisted by the hate of the man who had controlled him in that singular moment if she was the absence of emotion then he was the embodiment of it kahlan stared back into that lost childs face knowing that he saw only her merciless eyes his mind who he was who he had been was already gone trees all around shook from the force of the concussion snow dropped from branches and boughs the terrible shock to the air lifted a ring of snow that grew around the two of them in an everexpanding circle kahlan had known that jagang could slip into and out of a persons mind between thought when time itself did not exist she had no choice but to do as she had done she could not afford to hesitate with jagang in a persons mind even cara could not control them jagang had burned his bridges behind him as he fled the young mind the boy fell dead at kahlans feet chapter kahlan swayed on her feet as she stood over the crumbled body of the boy feeling her emotions flood back in as always happened using her confessors power left her drained and exhausted in the aftermath the forest sat in silent judgment here and there the virgin snow around the small body exhibited its red evidence only then did kahlan even pause to consider if she might have killed cara too a mordsith would not live long after the touch of a confessor there had been no choice she had done her best to warn cara to let her know to get clear but in the end kahlan couldnt allow her decision to be influenced by any consideration other than what had to be done hesitation could have meant disaster now that it was over though dread roiled through kahlan looked around and to the right saw cara sprawled in the snow if she had been touching the boy when kahlan unleashed her power cara groaned kahlan staggered to her and dropped to a knee she clutched the fur at caras shoulder and with a mighty effort pulled her over caraare you all right cara squinted up with a look of disgust working its way to the surface of pain well of course im all right you didnt think i would be foolish enough to hang on to him did you kahlan smiled in thankful relief no of course not i only thought you might have broken your neck jumping away cara spat snow and dirt nearly did warren helped them both to their feet grimacing he rubbed his shoulders and then his elbows from what kahlan had often been told being too close to a confessor unleashing her power was a painful experience sending a shock of agony through every joint fortunately it did no real damage and the suffering faded quickly as warren glanced over at the dead boy she knew that there was other pain that would not leave so quickly dear creator warren whispered to himself he looked back at kahlan and cara he was just a boy was it really necessary yes kahlan said in a forceful voice im positive cara and i have encountered this situation beforewith marlin but marlin was grown lyle was so small so young what real harm warren dont start down the path of whatmighthavebeen jagang controlled his mind just as he controlled marlins mind we know about this he was a deadly threat if i couldnt hold him cara said nothing could warren sighed in misery he sank to his knees at the boys side warren whispered a prayer as his fingers stroked the boys temple i guess the blame rightly lies at jagangs feet warren stood and brushed the snow from his knees ultimately jagang is the one who brought this about kahlan could see the distant figures of their men rushing up the hillside to rescue her she started down toward them if it pleases you to think so cara stayed right with her warren struggled through the snow to catch up he snatched kahlans arm and pulled her to a stop you mean ann dont you kahlan schooled her anger as she studied warrens blue eyes warren you were a victim of that woman too you were taken to the palace of the prophets when you were young werent you i guess so but but nothing they came and took you they came and took that poor dead child back there kahlans fingernails dug into her palms they came and took richard warren pressed his hand gently to the side of kahlans arm i know how it seems prophecy is often there kahlan angrily pointed back at the corpse there is prophecy death and miseryall in the sacred name of prophecy warren didnt try to answer her rage kahlan forced control into her voice if not the emotion behind it how many are going to die needlessly in a perverted devotion to seeing prophecy carried out had ann not sent verna here for richard none of this would be happening how do you know that kahlan i can understand how you feel but how can you be sure the barrier stood for three thousand years it could only be brought down by a wizard born with both sides of the gift there has been none until richard ann sent verna to get him had she not the barrier would still be there jagang and the order would be on the other side the midlands would be safe that boy would be playing ball somewhere kahlan its not so simple as you make it seem warren opened his hands in an expression of frustration i dont want to argue this with you but i want you to understand that prophecy gets fulfilled in many ways it often seeks its own solution it could be that had ann not sent for richard he would have for some other reason ventured down there and brought down the barrier who is to know the reason dont you see it could be that it was bound to happen and ann was simply the means if not her then another kahlan pulled angry breaths through gritted teeth how much blood how many corpses how much grief will it take before you see the harm prophecy has inflicted upon the world warren smiled sadly i am a prophet ive always wanted to be a prophet in order to help people i wouldnt put my faith in it if i truly thought it was the cause of harm he smiled more brightly with a memory dont forget without prophecy you would never have come to meet richard arent you better off having had him come into your life i know i am kahlans look of cold fury took the warm smile from his face iwould rather have been condemned to a lonely life without love than to know that harm has come to him because he came into my life i would rather never have met him than to have come to know his value and know that that value is being dashed on the rocks of this mad faith in prophecy warren stuck his hands in the opposite sleeves of his purple robes as his gaze sank to the ground i understand how you can feel that way please kahlan talk to verna why shes the one who carried out anns orders just talk to her i almost lost verna because she felt the same way as you do now verna warren nodded she came to believe she had been used maliciously by ann for twenty years she was on a fruitless search for richard when all the while ann knew right where he was can you imagine how verna felt when she discovered that there were other things too ann tricked us into believing she was dead she maneuvered verna into being prelate warren pulled a hand from his sleeve and held his first finger and thumb an inch apart she was once this close to throwing her journey book into a fire she should have warrens sad smile returned im just saying it might make you feel better to talk to her she will understand how you feel what good is that going to do warren shrugged even if youre right so what whats done is done we cant undo it nicci has richard the imperial order is here in the new world whatever caused the events they are upon us and we must now deal with that reality kahlan appraised his sparkling blue eyes you learned this studying prophecy his smile widened into a grin no that was what richard taught me and a pretty smart woman i know just told me not to start down the path of whatmighthavebeen as much as she was of a mind to hold on to it kahlan felt her anger slipping away im not so sure how smart she is warren waved down at the troops charging up the hill with their swords drawn signaling the allclear the men slowed to a fast walk but didnt sheathe their weapons well warren said she was smart enough to figure out jagangs plan and in the middle of being attacked by his gifted minion to keep her wits about her and to trick him into thinking she had fallen for his scheme kahlan drew her face into a peevish scowl how old are you warren he looked surprised by the question i turned one hundred fiftyeight not long ago that explains it cara griped starting off down the hill stop looking so young and innocent all the time warren its just plain irritating by the time kahlan cara warren and their escort of guard troops arrived back in camp several hours later it was a scene of furious activity wagons were being loaded horses hitched and weapons readied tents were not yet being taken down but soldiers in their leather and chainmail armor and still eating the remnants of their dinners were gathered around officers listening to instructions for when the order was given to send a force out to intercept the enemy moving north other officers in tents kahlan passed were bent over maps the aroma of stew drifting through the afternoon air reminded her how hungry she was winter darkness came early and the overcast made it feel like it was already evening the endless cloudy days were getting to be depressing there was little chance to see much of the sun soon heavier snow would make it down this far south kahlan dismounted and let a young soldier take her horse she no longer rode a big warhorse she and most of the cavalry had switched to smaller more agile mounts for a clash between large units big warhorses added weight to a charge but since the dharan empire forces were so outnumbered they had decided it would be best to trade weight far speed and maneuverability by changing tactics in such a way not just with the cavalry but with their entire army kahlan and general meiffert had been able to keep the order off balance for weeks they let the enemy put a huge effort into a crushing attack and then dodged it just enough to save themselves while letting the order being tantalizingly close wear themselves out when the order tired from the effort of such massive attacks and paused to rest general meiffert sent in glancing attacks to step on their toes and make them dance once the order dug in for the expected attack kahlan withdrew their forces to a more distant spot rendering useless the orders effort at building defenses if the order tried the same thing again the dharans continued to harry them day and night buzzing around them like angry hornets but staying out of reach of a heavy swat if the imperial order tired of not being able to sink their teeth into their enemy and turned their forces to go after population centers then kahlan had her men jump on their tails and put arrows in their backs as they struggled to get free eventually they would have to forget their thoughts of plunder and turn back toward the threat the imperial order was maddened by the dharans constant badgering tactics jagangs men were insulted by that kind of fighting they believed real men met facetoface in the field of battle and exchanged blow for blow of course it didnt trouble their dignity that they greatly outnumbered the dharans kahlan knew such a meeting would be bloody and only to the orders advantage she didnt care what they thought only that they died the more angry and frustrating the imperial order became the more recklessly they behaved launching impetuous attacks into wellordered defenses or heedlessly pressing men into doomed attacks trying to take ground they couldnt possibly take in such a fashion it sometimes stunned kahlan to watch so many of the enemy march into range below their archers fall dead only to have yet more men march right in behind them continuously adding corpses to a battlefield already choked with the dead and dying it was insanity the dharans had suffered several thousand dead or seriously wounded on the other hand kahlan and general meiffert estimated that they had killed or wounded in excess of fifty thousand of the enemy it was the equivalent of stepping on one ant as the colony poured out of its anthill she could think of nothing else to do but to keep at it they had no choice kahlan with cara at her side crossed a river of men to get to the command tents sporting blue cloth strips unless you knew the days color code finding the command tents would be nearly impossible because of the fear of an infiltrator or an enemy gifted finding and being able to kill a group of senior officers gathered together they met in nondescript tents colored cloth strips marked many of the tentsthe men used them as as system of finding their units when they had to move on short notice and so oftenso kahlan got the idea of using the same system to identify the command tents they changed the color code often so no one color would become known as the officers colors inside the cramped tent general meiffert looked up from where he bent over a table with a map unfurled at a cockeyed angle lieutenant leiden of kelton was there along with captain abernathy the commander of the galean forces kahlan had brought down with her weeks before adie was sitting quietly in the corner as the representative of the gifted watching the goingson with her completely white eyes blinded as a young woman adie had learned to see using her gift she was a remarkably talented sorceress adie was quite proficient at using that talent to do the enemy harm now she was there to help coordinate the sisters abilities with the needs of the army when kahlan inquired adie told her zedd be down at the southern lines checking on details kahlan nodded her thanks warren went down there to help too kahlan scrunched up her freezing toes in her boots trying to bring feeling back to them she blew warm air into her cupped hands and then turned her attention to the waiting general we need to get together a goodsized forcemaybe twenty thousand men general meiffert sighed his frustration so they are moving an army up past us no she said its a trick the three officers frowned their puzzlement as they waited for an explanation i ran into jagang you what general meiffert shouted in unbridled panic kahlan waved a hand allaying his fears not like youre thinking it was through the body of one of his slaves she stuck her hands under her arms to warm them the important thing is that i played along with jagangs scheme so that he would think we were falling for his plan kahlan explained how jagangs ruse of troop movements was meant to work and how its true design was to draw away a goodsized force so as to leave those remaining behind weaker the men listened as she laid it all out while pointing to the locations on the map if we were to send that many men out lieutenant leiden asked wouldnt that be just what emperor jagang wanted it would be she told him but thats not what were going to do i want those men to ride out of camp to make it look as if we were doing what he expected she leaned over the map using a piece of charcoal to sketch in some of the nearby mountains she had just traveled through and showedthem a lowland pass around several captain abernathy spoke up we have my galean troopstheyre close to the number you need to serve as the decoy thats what i was thinking general meiffert said done kahlan said she pointed at the map again circle around these mountains here captain so that when the order attacks our camp thinking to roll over us your men can stick them in their soft side right here where they wont expect it captain abernathy a trim man with a graying bushy mustache that matched his eyebrows nodded as he watched kahlan pointing out the route on the map dont worry mother confessor the order will believe were gone but well be standing ready to drive right into their ribs when they come for you kahlan turned her attention back to the general well also need to secretly trickle another force out of camp to wait at the opposite side of the valley from captain abernathy so that when the order comes up the valley in the middle we can drive into their ribs from both sides at once they wont want to let us cut off and trap part of their force so theyll turn tail then our main force can drive steel into their vulnerable backs the three officers considered her plan in silence while outside the confusion of noise went on horses galloped past wagons creaked and bounced along snow underfoot crunched as soldiers shuffled past and men called out orders lieutenant leidens eyes turned up toward kahlan mother confessor my keltans could be that other force theyve all served together a long time and work well in our own units under my command we could begin slipping out of camp at once and gather down there to wait for the attack you could send a sister with us to verify a prearranged signal and then i could take my men in when captain abernathy attacks from the opposite side kahlan knew the man wanted to redeem himself in her eyes he was also looking to establish for kelton a measure of autonomy within the dharan empire that will be a dangerous spot lieutenant if anything goes wrong we cant come to your aid he nodded but my men are familiar with the area and were used to traversing mountainous country in the winter the imperial order is from a warmer land we have the advantage of weather and terrain we can do the job mother confessor kahlan straightened letting out a breath as she appraised the man general meiffert she knew would like the idea captain abernathy would too galea and kelton were traditional rivals so the two would just as soon fight their own way and separately richard had brought the lands together so that they would all come to feel they were one now that was vital if they were to survive she supposed that they were fighting for the same goal so in that way they were working togetherthey would have to coordinate their attacks lieutenant leiden did make sense too his troops were mountain fighters all right lieutenant thank you mother confessor kahlan thought to add some insurance if you acquit yourself well in this lieutenant it could move you up in command lieutenant leiden clapped a fist to his heart in salute my men will make their queen proud kahlan acknowledged his pledge with the nod of the mother confessor she addressed them all we had better get under way general meiffert grunted his agreement this will be a good opportunity to knock down their numbers if it goes even half right this time well bleed them good he turned to the other two officers lets get started we need to have your men moving at once to give them enough time to be in position by morning theres no telling how long they might wait to attack but if it comes as soon as dawn i want you in position and ready the order favors attacking at dawn captain abernathy said we can be on our way within the hour well be in place and ready by dawn should they come in early as can we lieutenant leiden agreed the two officers bowed and started to leave captain kahlan called the men turned back mother confessor do you have any idea what could be keeping prince harold and the rest of your army he should have been here long ago we could really use the rest of your men captain abernathys thumb twiddled a bone button on the front of his dark coat im sorry mother confessor i too thought they should have been here by now i cant imagine what could be keeping the prince he should have been here by now she repeated under her breath to herself she looked up at the captain weather perhaps mother confessor if there are storms that could have delayed him that is probably the reason and in that case i dont imagine he should be much longer our men train in the mountains in such conditions kahlan sighed lets hope hes here soon then captain abernathy confidently met her gaze i know for a fact that the prince was eager to collect his men and get down here to help galea spans the callisidrin valley the prince personally told me that it was to our own best interest to halt the imperial order down here rather than letting them advance further up into the midlands where our lands and our families would come under the terror of the enemy kahlan could see in lieutenant leidens eyes that he was thinking that if prince harold instead decided to make a stand in the callisidrin valley in order to selfishly protect his homeland of galea such an obstacle very well could force the order to instead bear toward the northeast in their advance around the intervening mountains and over into the kern plainright toward leidens homeland of kelton if lieutenant leiden was imagining such treachery he had the wisdom not to voice it i know the weather was bad when i came down kahlan said it is winter after all im sure prince harold will soon be here to help his queen and the fellow people of the dharan empire kahlan offered them a smile to soften the subtle threat thank you gentlemen youd best get to your tasks may the good spirits watch your backs after the men had saluted and horned off to their work adie put her hands to her knees and levered herself to her feet if you do not need me i must see to informing the sisters zedd and warren of our plans kahlan nodded wearily thank you adie adie her eyes completely white saw with the aid of her gift kahlan could feel that gifted gaze on her you have used your power the old sorceress said i be able to see it in your face you must rest i know kahlan said but there are things needing to be done they will not get done if you fall ill or worsewhich could happen adies thin fingers gripped caras arm see to it that the mother confessor be left alone for a while so she can at least rest her head on the table if nothing else cara swung the folding chair around and set it behind the table she pointed at it while leveling a stern look at kahlan sit i will stand watch kahlan was exhausted using her confessors ability sapped her strength she needed time to recover the hard ride back had only made matters worse she went around the table and sat down heavily in the folding chair she opened her fur mantle and set it back on her shoulders richards sword was still strapped to her back its hilt jutting up above her shoulder she didnt bother to remove the sword adie at seeing kahlan comply without complaint smiled to herself and went on her way cara took up guard at the entrance as kahlans head sank down into her pillowed arms trying not to let the terrible events of the day overwhelm her she instead thought of richard remembering his handsome smile his penetrating gray eyes his gentle touch her own eyes closed in her weariness the chair and table felt as if they were spinning her around in moments though as she held her thoughts of richard in her minds eye she felt herself sliding into sleep chapter mother confessor kahlan squinted up at a dark shape above her she blinked clearing her vision and saw that it was verna the gold sunburst ring of the prelate of the sisters of the light reflected a glimmer of lamplight behind her twilight tainted the tent canvas with a rusty glow kahlan rubbed the sleep from her eyes verna wore a long gray wool dress and a dark brown cloak at her throat the dress had a bit of white lace that softened the austerity of the outfit vernas brown hair had a carefree wave and spring to it but her brown eyes held a troubled look what is it verna if you have a moment i would like to talk to you no doubt verna had been talking to warren whenever kahlan saw them together the shared intimate glances the chance furtive touch reminded her of the way she and richard felt about each other it softened kahlans feelings about vernas stern exterior to know she was in loveknowing for that matter that she was capable of tenderness kahlan knew that she too must be regarded with the same sort of curiosity if not amazement where tender feelings were concerned she sighed wondering if this was going to be a talk about ann and prophecy kahlan wasnt in the mood cara how long have i been asleep a couple of hours it will soon be dark as tight and sore as kahlans shoulders and neck were from sleeping with her head on the table the lateness of the hour didnt come as a surprise she stretched to the side and then saw the frail looking sorceress sitting on a short bench she had a dark blanket over her lap how do you feel adie asked im fine kahlan could see her breath in the frigid air the men we sent out both groups be on their way more than an hour ago adie said the first group the galeans all left together in big columns the keltans dribbled out in small groups not as likely to be noticed by any spies watching kahlan yawned good she knew they had to fear an attack by the imperial order as soon as morning at least that should give their men enough time to travel to their positions and be ready waiting for an attack made her stomach feel queasy she knew the men too would be on edge and likely get little sleep adie idly ran a thin finger back and forth along the red and yellow beads at the neckline of her modest robes i came back after the galeans left to help cara keep people away so you would not be disturbed while you rested kahlan nodded her thanks apparently either adie thought kahlan had rested enough or she thought vernas visit was important what is it then verna we have discovered something not so much discovered it as had an idea who is we verna cleared her throat under her breath she beseeched the creators forgiveness before she went on actually mother confessor i thought of it some of my sisters helped me with it but im the one who thought it up the blame falls to me kahlan thought that was an odd way of putting it she didnt think verna looked at all pleased by her own idea whatever it was kahlan waited silently for her to go on well you see we have a problem getting things past the enemys gifted they have sisters of the light but also dark and we dont have their power when we try to send things send things verna pursed her lips weapons when kahlans brow twitched with a questioning look verna bent and gathered something from the ground she held out her open hand showing kahlan a collection of small pebbles zedd showed us how to turn simple things into devastating weapons we can use our power to fling them or even with our breath blow on some small thing like these pebbles and use our magic to send them out faster than any arrow even an arrow from a crossbow the pebbles we flung out in this way cut down waves of advancing soldiers the pebbles traveled so swiftly that sometimes each would pierce the bodies of half a dozen men i remember those reports kahlan said but that stopped working because their gifted caught on to the artifice and now defend against such things kahlan recognized the weary look of the weight of responsibility in vernas brown eyes thats right the order learned how to look for things of magic or even things propelled by magic most of our conjuring that is in any way similar has become useless thats what zedd told methat in war magic is most often unseen that each side manages only to balance the other verna nodded it is so we do the same against them things they used at first we now know how to counter so we can protect our men our warning horns for example we learned that we must code them with a trace of magic to know they are genuine kahlan drew her fur mantle up around her neck she was chilled to the bone and couldnt seem to get warm not surprising seeing as how she was spending all of her time outdoors it was insanity to be carrying on a war in such conditions she guessed that war in fine weather was no more sane still she ached to be inside beside a cozy fire so what is this thing you thought up as if reminded of the cold verna pulled her cloak tighter around her shoulders well i got the notion that if the enemy gifted are in a sense filtering for anything magic or even anything being propelled by magic then what we need is something not magic kahlan gave verna a grim smile we do theyre called soldiers verna didnt smile no i meant something the gifted could do to disable enemy troops without risk to our own men adie shuffled forward to stand behind kahlans left shoulder as verna reached into her cloak and pulled out a small leather pouch closed with a drawstring she tossed it on the table before kahlan then set a piece of paper beside it pour a little on the paper please verna was holding her stomach as if she were having indigestion but be careful not to touch it with your finger or get it on your skinand whatever you do dont blow on it be careful not to even breathe on it adie leaned in to watch as kahlan carefully poured a small quantity of a sparkling dust from the pouch onto the square of paper she pushed at the little pile with the corner of the pouch there were hints of pallid colors but it was mostly a pale glimmering greenishgray what is it some kind of magic dust glass kahlans eyes turned up glass you thought up glass verna let out a tsk at herself for how foolish she must have sounded no mother confessor i thought of breaking it you see this is just simple glass that has been broken and crushed into fine piecesalmost dust but we used our han to aid us when we crushed the glass with a mortar and pestle by using our gift we were able to break the glass into very tiny fragments but in a special way verna leaned over her finger hovering above the little greenishgray mound cara leaned in beside her in order to look down at the dangerous thing on the piece of paper this glassevery pieceis sharp and jagged even though each piece is very tiny each piece is hardly bigger than dust so it weighs nothing almost like dust dear spirits adie said before whispering a prayer in her own language kahlan cleared her throat i dont understand mother confessor we cant get our magic past the defenses of the orders gifted they are prepared for magic even if its a simple pebble but uses magic to hurl it at their troops this glass however even though we used magic to break it has no magic propertiesnone at all its just inert material the same as the dust kicked up by their feet they cant detect it as magic because it isnt magic through their gift they will sense this as simple as dust or mist or possibly fog depending on atmospheric conditions at the time but we sent dust clouds at them before kahlan said dust to make them sick and such they mostly countered it verna held up a finger to note her point as she smiled a grim smile but those were dust clouds containing magic mother confessor this does not dont you see its so light it floats in the air for a long time we could use simple magic to cast it up into the air and then withdraw the magic or we could simply fling it up into the breeze for that matter either way we have only to let their troops run through it all right kahlan scratched an eyebrow but what will it do to them it will get in their eyes adie said in her raspy voice from behind kahlans shoulder thats right verna said it gets in their eyes just as any dust would at first it will feel like dust in their eyes and they will try to blink it away however since the fragments are all still jagged and razor sharp they will instead embed themselves in the bodys tissue it will stick in their eyes and build up under their eyelids where it will make thousands of tiny cuts across their eyes with each blink the more they blink the more it eats away at their delicate eyes verna straightened and pulled her cloak together it will blind them kahlan sat in numb disbelief at the madness of it all are you sure cara asked might it just irritate them like gritty dust we know for sure verna said we had an accident and know all too well what it does it may do more damage when it gets in the throat the lungs and the gutwe dont know about that yetbut we do know for sure that such special glass if we grind it to just the right size particles will float in the air and people passing through the cloud will be blinded in remarkably short order as long as we can blind a man he cant fight it may not kill them but as long as they are blind they cant kill us or fight back as we kill them cara usually gleeful at the prospect of killing the enemy did not seem so now we would have but to line them up and butcher them kahlan put her head in her hands covering her eyes you want me to approve its use dont you thats why youre here verna said nothing kahlan looked up at last thats what you want isnt it mother confessor i need not tell you that the sisters of the light abhor harming people however this is a war for our very existence for the very existence of free people we know it must be done if richard were here i just thought that you would want to be made aware of this and be the one to give such orders kahlan stared at the woman understanding then why she was holding her hand over a pain in her stomach do you know prelate kahlan said in a near whisper that i killed a child today not by accident but on purpose i would do it again without hesitation but that wont make me sleep any better a child it was truly necessary to kill a child his name was lyle i believe you know him he was another one of the victims of anns sisters of the light verna her face gone ashen closed her eyes against the news i guess if i can kill a child kahlan said i can easily enough give the orders for you to use your special glass against the monsters who would use a child as a weapon i have sworn no mercy and i meant it adie laid a gnarled hand on kahlans shoulder kahlan verna said in a gentle voice i can understand how you feel ann used me too and i didnt understand why i thought she used everyone for her own selfish purposes for a time i thought her a despicable person you have every reason to believe as you do but i would be wrong verna is that what you were going to add id not be so sure were i you you didnt have to kill a little boy today verna nodded in sympathy but didnt argue adie kahlan asked do you think there would be anything you might be able to do for the woman who was accidentally blinded perhaps you could help her adie nodded that be a good idea verna take me to her and let me see what i can do kahlan cocked her head as the two women moved toward the tent opening did you hear that the horn verna asked yes it sounds like alarm horns verna squinted in concentration she turned her head to the side listening attentively yes it does sound like alarm horns she finally declared but it doesnt have the right trace of magic through it the enemy does that oftentries to get us to act based on false alarms weve been having more and more lately kahlan frowned we have why why what kahlan stood if we know theyre false alarms and they dont work then why would the order increase the attempts that makes no sense vernas gaze roved about as as if searching in vain for an answer well i dont know i cant imagine im no expert in the tactics of warfare cara turned to go have a look maybe its just some scouts coming back in kahlan turned her head listening she heard horses running but that wasnt so rare it could be as cara suggested scouts returning with reports but by the sound of the hooves the horses sounded big she heard men yelling the clash of steel rang outalong with cries of pain kahlan drew her galean royal sword as she started around the table before any of them could get more than a step the tent shuddered violently as something crashed against its walls for an instant the whole thing tipped at an impossible angle then steeltipped lances burst through the canvas with a rush of wind the tent collapsed around them the heavy canvas drove kahlan to the ground as it caved in she couldnt get a grip on anything solid as the tent rolled her over and began dragging her along hooves thundered past pounding the ground right beside her head she could smell lamp oil as it sloshed across the canvas with a whoosh the oil and the tent ignited kahlan coughed on the smoke she could hear the crackle of flames she could see nothing she was trappedrolled up in the bucking tent as it slid across the ground chapter tightly shrouded in stiff canvas kahlan couldnt see anything she choked and gagged on the thick acrid smoke burning her lungs she pulled frantically at the canvas trying to disentangle herself but as she bounced and tumbled along the ground she couldnt make any headway gaining her liberty the heat of flames close to her face ignited in her a sense of panic her weariness forgotten she kicked and struggled madly as she gasped for air where are you it was caras voice it sounded close as if she too was being dragged along and strenuously engaged in her own fight for life cara was smart enough not to shout kahlans name or title when surrounded by the enemy hopefully verna knew better as well here kahlan shouted in answer to cara kahlans sword was trapped pressed to her legs by the rolled canvas she managed to wiggle her left hand up onto the knife at her belt she yanked it free she had to turn her face to try to keep away from the heat of the oily flames the smothering smoky blindness was terrifying with angry resolve kahlan stabbed at the canvas punching her knife through just then the tent hit something and they were bounced into the air the hard landing knocked the wind from her lungs a gasp pulled in suffocating smoke again kahlan plunged her knife into the heavy canvas and slashed an opening as her entire shroud erupted into flame she yelled again to cara i cant get the tent hit something solid her shoulder whacked hard into what felt like a tree stump and she was flipped up and over the top of it had she not been wearing her stiff leather armor the blow surely would have broken her shoulder crashing down on the other side kahlan tumbled free and across the snow she spread her arms to stop herself from rolling kahlan saw general meiffert reach up seize a fistful of chain mail and unhorse the man who had been dragging her tent the mans eyes gleamed from behind long curly greasy hair his stout body was covered with hides and furs over chain mail and leather armor he was missing his upper teeth as he lunged at the general he lost his head too yet more order troops wheeled their big warhorses striking down at the dharans scrambling both to escape the blows and to mount a defense one of the warhorses charged kahlans way its rider leaning out swinging a flail kahlan sheathed both her knife and sword she snatched up the lance of the man who had been dragging the tent she brought the long weapon up and spun around just in time to plant the butt end in a frozen rut and let the charging warhorse take the steeltipped point in his chest as the grinning order soldier with the flail leaped from the staggering horse he drew his sword with his free hand kahlan didnt wait as he was still alighting on his feet she spun while drawing her own sword and landed a solid backhanded blow across the left side of his face without pause she dove under the legs of another horse to dodge a blade when the horses rider slashed down at her she sprang up on the other side and hacked the riders leg open to the bone twice before turning just in time to ram her sword up to its hilt into the chest of another horse sidling in trying to crush her against the first as the animal reared with a wild scream kahlan yanked her sword free and tumbled away just before the big horse crashed to the ground the riders leg was trapped and he was at an awkward angle to defend himself kahlan made the best of the opportunity for the moment the immediate area was clear enabling her to scramble over to the tent where the general was on his knees yanking at the snarled mess of canvas and rope more order cavalry were thundering past threatening to trample verna adie and cara still trapped in the tangle of tent at least the burning section had pulled away kahlan worked beside general meiffert to tug and cut the canvas at last they ripped open the heavy material freeing adie and verna the two women were rolled up together nearly in each anothers arms adies head was bleeding but she pushed away kahlans concerned hands verna emerged from the cocoon and stumbled to her feet still dizzy from the wild ride kahlan helped adie up the scrape on her brow didnt look too serious general meiffert pulled frantically at the canvas cara was still inside somewhere but they no longer heard her kahlan seized verna by the arm i thought they were false alarms they were verna insisted obviously they tricked us all around soldiers were engaged in pitched battle with imperial order cavalry men shouted in fury as they threw themselves into battle some screamed as they were wounded or killed others called out orders commanding a defense while the men on horseback ordered in their attack some of the cavalry were setting fire to wagons tents and supplies others charged past trampling men and tents pairs of riders teamed up to single out soldiers and take them down then charged after another victim they were using the same tactics the dharans had used they were doing what kahlan had taught them to do when a soldier draped in filthy fur and weapons cried out in bravado as he rushed at her wielding a raised mace studded with glistening bloody spikes kahlan took his hand off with a lightningswift blow he staggered to a stop and stared a her in surprise without missing a beat she drove her sword into his gut and gave it a wrenching twist before pulling it free she turned her attention elsewhere as he crashed down atop a fire his screams melted in with all the others kahlan fell to her knees once more to help general meiffert free cara he had found her amid the snare of rope and folds of canvas from time to time one of them had to turn to fight off sporadic attackers kahlan could see caras red boots sticking out from under the canvas but they were still tent line was tangled around caras legs with kahlan and the general working together they cut through the mire of rope and were finally able to unroll cara she held her head as she moaned she wasnt unconscious but she was groggy and unable to get her bearings kahlan found a lump in her hair at the right side of her head but it wasnt bleeding cara tried to sit up kahlan pressed her down on her back stay there you were hit on the head i dont want you to get up just yet kahlan looked over her shoulder and saw verna nearby singling out imperial order troops each twitch of her hands casting a fiery spell to blast them from their horses or a focused edge of air as sharp as any blade yet more swift and sure to slice them down without the gift themselves or one of the gifted to protect them the enemys simple armor was no defense kahlan caught vernas attention and motioned for her help seizing the womans cloak at her shoulder kahlan pulled verna close to speak into her ear so as to be heard above the noise of battle see how she is will you help her verna nodded and then huddled at caras side as kahlan and the general turned to a fresh charge of cavalry as one man galloped in close wielding his lance around general meiffert dodged the strike and then leaped up onto the side of the horse catching hold of the saddles horn with a grunt of angry effort he drove his sword through the rider the surprised man clawed at the blade in his soft middle the general yanked his sword free then grabbed the man by the hair and dragged him out of the saddle as the dying man fell away general meiffert sprang up into the saddle in his place kahlan snatched up the fallen cavalrymans lance the big dharan general wheeled the huge horse into the way of charging enemy cavalry protecting verna and cara kahlan sheathed her sword and used the lance to good effect against the warhorses horses even welltrained warhorses didnt appreciate being stabbed in the chest many people considered them just dumb beasts but horses were smart enough to understand that driving themselves onto a pointed lance was not what they wanted to do and reacted accordingly as horses bucked and reared when kahlan stabbed them with her lance many of their riders fell some were injured from the fall onto scattered equipment or the frozen ground but most came under the swarming attack of the dharans from atop his imperial order warhorse general meiffert commanded his men to form a defensive line after directing them into place he charged off roaring a string of orders as he went he didnt tell his men who to protect so as not to betray kahlan to the enemy but they quickly saw what it was he intended them to do dharans grabbed up the enemy lances or came running with their own pikes and soon there was a bristling line of steeltipped pole weapons presenting a deadly obstacle to any approaching cavalry kahlan called out orders to men on either side and as she joined the line commanded them into position to block an imperial order cavalry unit of about two hundred who were trying to make good their escape the enemy might have been emulating the raids the dharan cavalry had made on the imperial orders camp but kahlan wasnt about to allow them to succeed at it she intended them to fail the enemys horses balked when they encountered a solid line of advancing pikes brandished by men shouting battle cries soldiers coming from behind the order cavalry rained down arrows dharans dragged trapped riders from their saddles down into the bloody handtohand fighting on the ground i dont want one of them escaping camp alive she yelled to her men no mercy no mercy every dharan within earshot called out in answer the enemy so confident and arrogant as they had charged in relishing the prospect of spilling d haran blood were now nothing more than pathetic men in the ungainly grip of despair as the dharans hacked them to death kahlan left the soldiers with the lances and pikes now that a defensive line had been established and the enemy was trapped and ran back through the fires and choking smoke to find verna adie and cara she had to dodge wounded soldiers of both armies on the ground the fallen attackers who still had fight in them snatched at her ankles she had to stab several who tried to rise up to grab her others afoot who suddenly appeared she had to cut down the enemy knew who she was or at least they were pretty sure jagang had seen her and no doubt had described the mother confessor to his men kahlan was sure to have a heavy price on her head there seemed to be imperial order men scattered throughout the camp she doubted there had been an attack by foot soldiers they were probably cavalrymen who had lost their mounts horses were often easier moving targets to hit with arrows and spears than were men in the gathering darkness it was hard to make out enemy soldiers they were able to sneak through the camp undiscovered as they hunted targets of value such as officers or maybe even the mother confessor when the lurking enemy spotted kahlan making her way through the chaos they came out from their hiding places to go after her with wild abandon others she came upon and surprised remembering not only her fathers training but richards admonition kahlan cut fiercely into the enemy soldiers she gave them no opening no chance no mercy her training under her father had been a good foundation for the esoteric tactical precepts that richard had taught her when she was recovering from her wounds back in hartland richards way had seemed so strange then now it seemed so natural in much the same way a lighter horse could outmaneuver a big warhorse her lighter weight became her edge she didnt need the weight because she simply didnt clash with the enemy in the traditional manner as they expected she was a hummingbird floating out of their reach swooping in between their ponderous moves to efficiently deliver death such moves were not at odds with the manner of fighting that her father had taught but complemented it in a way that fit her richard had trained her not with a sword but with a willow switch a mischievous smile and a dangerous glint in his eyes now richards sword strapped over the back of her shoulder was an everpresent reminder of those playful lessons that had been not only unrelenting but deadly serious she finally found verna bent over cara but didnt see the general anywhere kahlan snatched vernas sleeve how is she she threw up but that seemed to have helped once it passed she will probably be woozy for a while but i think shes otherwise all right i she has a thick skull adie said it not be cracked but she should lie still for a timeat least until she recovers her balance caras hands groped as if having trouble finding the ground beneath her despite her obvious dizziness she was cursing the prelate and trying to sit up kahlan squatting beside cara pressed her shoulder to the ground cara im right here im fine lie still for a few minutes i want at them later kahlan said dont worry youll get your chance she saw that the blood was cleaned from adies head adie how are you how is your head the old sorceress gestured dismissively bah i be fine my head be thicker than caras soldiers had gathered forming a protective wall of steel verna adie and kahlan crouched over cara keeping an eye on the surrounding area but the fighting immediately around them seemed to have ended even if pockets of battle remained with the large number of dharan soldiers who had protectively closed ranks the four women were safe for the time being general meiffert finally returned charging through the line of dharan defenders as they parted for him he leaped from his enemy warhorse the horse tossed his head at the indignity of being ridden by the enemy and ran off the young dharan general crouched down on the opposite side of cara winded he started talking anyway ive been down checking with the front lines this is a raid much like what weve been doing to them it looked bigger than it really was when they spotted the mother confessor they called their men into this area so the damage was mostly focused in this section why didnt we know kahlan asked what went wrong with the alarm not sure he was shaking his head still getting his breath zedd thinks that they learned our codes and that when we blew the alarm they must have used subtractive magic to alter the magic woven into the sound that tells our gifted that its a real attack kahlan let out an angry breath it was all starting to make sense to her thats why there have been so many false alarms they were numbing us to them so that when they attacked we would be unconcerned falsely believing our own alarms were just another enemy false alarm im guessing youre right he flexed his fist in frustration he looked down then and noticed cara scowling up at him cara are you all right i was soi mean we thought you might be badly hurt no she said casting a cool glare at verna and kahlan each of whom used a hand to hold her shoulders down she casually crossed her ankles i just thought you could handle it so i decided to take a nap general meiffert gave her a quick smile and then turned a serious face to kahlan it gets worse this cavalry attack was a diversion they hoped it might get you im sure but it was meant to make us believe it was just a raid kahlan felt her flesh go cold with dread theyre coming arent they he nodded the entire force theyre still a distance out but youre right theyre coming this was just to throw us into confusion and keep us distracted kahlan stared dumbfounded the order had never attacked at sunset before the prospect of the onslaught of hundreds of thousands upon hundreds of thousands of imperial order troops storming in from the darkness was bloodcurdling theyve changed their tactics kahlan whispered to herself hes a quick study i thought id tricked him but i was the one who was taken in what are you mumbling about cara asked her fingers locked together over her stomach jagang he counted on me not being fooled by those troops going around in a circle he wanted me to think i had outsmarted him he played me for a fool cara made a face what kahlan felt sick at the implications she pressed a hand to her forehead as the awful truth inundated her jagang wanted me to think i had his scheme figured out so we would pretend to play along and send out our troops he probably figured they wouldnt be sent after his decoy but would be used instead against his real plan of attack he didnt care about that though all along he was planning on changing his tactics he was waiting only until those troops left so that he could attack before they were in place and while our numbers were reduced you mean cara asked that whole time you were talking to him pretending to believe he was moving troops north he knew you were pretending im afraid so he outsmarted me maybe maybe not general meiffert said he hasnt succeeded yet we dont have to let him have it his way we can move our forces before he can pounce cant we call back the men we sent out verna asked their numbers would help theyre hours away general meiffert said traveling through back country on the way to their assigned locations they would never get back here in time to help us tonight rather than dwell on how gullible she had been kahlan put her mind to the immediate problem we need to move fast the general nodded his agreement we could fall back on our other plansabout breaking up and scattering into the mountains he ran his fingers back through his blond hair the gesture of frustration unexpectedly reminded kahlan of richard but if we do that we would have to abandon most of our supplies in winter without supplies a number of our men wouldnt last long either way killed in battle or dying of hunger and coldyoure just as dead broken up like that we would be easy pickings kahlan agreed thats a last resort it may work later but not now for now we need to keep the army together if were to survive the winterand if were to keep the order distracted from its designs at conquest we dare not allow them to go uncontested into a city it would not only be a bloodbath but if they picked the right city we would face a near impossible task of dislodging them the general shook his head it could end up being the end of our hopes of driving them back to the old world kahlan gestured over her shoulder what about that valley we talked about back there the high pass is narrowit can be defended on this side by two men and a dog if need be thats what i was thinking he said it keeps the army togetherand keeps the order having to contend with us rather than being able to turn their attention on any cities if they try to move around us up into the midlands there are easy northern routes out of the valley from which we can strike we have more men on the way and we can send for others we need to stay together and maintain our engagement with the orders army until those forces arrive then what are we waiting for verna asked lets get moving he gave her a worried look the problem right now is that if were to make it into that valley before the order can pounce on us were going to need more time to do it the pass is too narrow for wagons the horses can make it but not the wagonstheyll have to be dismantled most of our equipment is designed to be knocked down so the parts can be portaged if need be well have to leave a few that arent it wont take long to get started but were going to need time to funnel all the men and supplies over that narrow passespecially in the dark torches will work well enough with a steady line of men adie said they must only follow the one in front and even if the fight be bad they can do it kahlan remembered the handprint made of glowing dust the gifted could lay down a glowing track to guide the men that would help the general said were still left with our basic problem though while our men are trying to break down and move all our equipment and supplies and waiting their turn to go over the pass the order will arrive well find ourselves in a pitched battle trying to defend ourselves while withdrawing at the same time a withdrawal requires the ability to move faster than the enemy or at least keep him at bay while pulling back the pass doesnt provide that weve kept ahead of them before verna said this isnt the first attack youre right he pointed to his left we could try to withdraw up this valley instead but in the dark and with the order attacking i think that would be a mistake darkness is the problem this time theyre going to keep coming in daylight we could establish defenses and hold them offnot at night we already have defenses set up here cara said we could stand where we are and fight them headon general meiffert chewed his lower lip that was my first thought cara and still an option but i dont like our chances in a headon direct confrontation like this not at night when they can sneak great numbers of men in close we couldnt use our archers to advantage in the dark we cant see their numbers or movements accurately so we wouldnt be able to position our men properly its a problem of numbers theirs are almost unlimited ours arent we dont have enough gifted to cover every possibilityand in war its always what you dont cover that gets hit the enemy could pour through a gap get in behind us in the dark without us even realizing it and then were finished everyone was silent as the implications truly sank in i agree kahlan said the pass is the only chance we have to keep from losing a major battle tonightalong with a huge number of our men the risk without real benefit of standing and fighting is a poor choice the general appraised her eyes that still leaves us with the problem of how were going to get over that pass before they annihilate us kahlan turned to verna we need you to slow the enemy down to give us the time we need to get our army over that pass what do you wish me to do use your special glass the general screwed up his face her what a weapon of magic cara said to blind the enemy troops verna looked thunderstruck but im not ready we only made up a small batch im not ready kahlan turned back to the general what did the scouts say about how much time we have until the order is upon us the order could be here within an hour at the soonest two at the latest if we dont slow them down well never make it out of this valley with our men and supplies if we cant find a way to delay them we can only run for the hills or stand and fight neither is a choice i would make except in desperation if we just run for the hills adie said we be as good as dead together we be alive and at least be a threat to the enemy if we scatter the order will take the opportunity to attack and capture cities if our only choice is to scatter or stand our ground and fight then we can only choose to stand and fight better to try than to die one at a time out in the mountains kahlan rubbed her fingers across her brow as she tried to think jagang had changed his tactics and decided to engage them in a night battle he had never done that before because it would be so costly for him but with his numbers he apparently wasnt concerned about that jagang held life in little regard if we have to fight him in a full battle here now kahlan said in resignation we will probably lose the war by dawn i agree the general finally said as far as i see it we have no choice we have to act quickly and get as many of our men over the pass as we can well lose all those who dont get over before the order arrives but well manage to preserve some the four of them were silent a moment each considering the horror of that reality of who would remain behind to die furious activity continued around them men were rushing around putting out fires collecting panicked horses tending to wounded and battling the few remaining invaders they had trapped the order soldiers were greatly outnumbered not for long though kahlans mind raced she couldnt help being furious with herself at being gulled richards words echoed through her mind think of the solution not the problem the solution was the only thing that mattered now kahlan looked again to verna we have an hour before theyre upon us you have to try verna do you think you have any chance at making your special glass and then deploying it before the enemy is upon us i will do my bestyou have my word on that i wish i could promise more verna scrambled to her feet ill need the sisters who are tending the wounded of course what about the ones working at the front lines the ones countering enemy magic can i have any of them take them all kahlan said if this doesnt work nothing else is going to matter ill take them all then every one verna said its the only chance we have you get started adie told verna go down near the front lines on this side of the valley where you will be upwind from the attack i will begin collecting the sisters and get them down there to help you we need glass verna said to the general any kind at least a few barrels full ill have men down there with the first barrel right away can we at least help to break it up for you no it wont matter if what you throw in the barrels breaks but beyond that it must be done by the gifted just bring whatever glass you can collect that will be all you can do the general promised her he would see to it holding her hem up out of her way verna ran off to the task adie was close on her heels ill get the men moving now the general told kahlan as he scrambled to his feet the scouts can mark the trail then we can start moving the heavier supplies first if it worked they would slip out of jagangs grasp kahlan knew that if verna failed they could all very well lose their lives and the war by morning general meiffert paused with one last hesitant look one last chance for her to change her mind do it she said to the general carawe have work chapter kahlan pulled her horse up short she felt the heat of blood rushing to her face what are you doing cara asked as kahlan threw her leg over the horses neck and leaped to the ground the moon lit a layer of lacy clouds scudding past giving a faint serene illumination to the surrounding countryside the thin layer of snow gathered the muted light of the moon to make it more luminous than it otherwise would be kahlan pointed in the direction of the small figure she could just make out in the dim light the skinny girl surely not much past ten years was standing at a barrel ramming a metal rod down inside to smash the glass in the bottom kahlan handed the reins to cara as soon as she had dismounted kahlan stalked over to the sisters working on the snowy ground running off in a haphazard line to keep the wind at their backs were over a hundred of the women all focused intently on the work before them many had their cloaks tented around themselves and their work not far down that line kahlan bent put a hand under the prelates arm and lifted her to her feet mindful of the serious nature of the work going on kahlan at least kept her voice quiet since she wasnt able to make it congenial verna what is holly doing down here verna glanced over the heads of a dozen intervening sisters kneeling before a long board breeze at their backs carefully griding glass chips with pestles in mortars there being not nearly enough pestles and mortars many of the women to the other side were using dished rocks and round stones to carefully crunch the glass chips the concentration showed on each womans face the accident that had blinded a sister had happened when the wind had changed and a gust had blown her work back up in her face the same thing could happen again at any time although as darkness had settled in the wind had at least died down to a steady breeze holly was bundled in an oversized cloak she had a determined grimace as she lifted the rod and then let it drop down in the barrel set away from the sisters dangerous work kahlan saw that the rod had a faint greenish glow to it shes helping mother confessor shes a child verna pointed off into the darkness to what kahlan hadnt seen so are helen and valery kahlan pinched the bridge of her nose between her first finger and thumb and took a purging breath what madness would possess you to have children down here near the front helping toto blind people verna glanced at the women working nearby she took kahlans arm by the elbow and led her out of earshot of the others alone where they were less likely to be heard she folded her hands before herself as she assumed the stern visage that came so naturally to her kahlan holly may be a child but she is a gifted child and she is far from stupid besides that goes for helen and valery as well holly has seen more in her young life than any child should see she knows whats going on tonight with that attack and with the attack thats coming she was terrifiedall the children were so you bring her to the frontto the greatest danger what would you have me do send her back somewhere to be watched over by soldiers do you wish me to force her to be alone at a time like this so she could only tremble in terror but this is shes gifted despite how horrific it seems this is better for her as it is for the others shes with the sisters who understand her and her ability as other people cant dont you recall the comfort you derived from being with older confessors who knew the way you felt about things kahlan did but said nothing the sisters are the only family she and the other novices have now holly is not alone and afraid she may still be afraid but shes doing something to help us so that her fear is channeled into something that will assist in overcoming the cause of her fear kahlans brow was still set in a glare verna shes a child and you had to kill a child today i understand but dont let that terrible event make it harder on holly yes this is an awful thing she is helping to do but this is the reality of the way things are she could die tonight along with the rest of us can you even imagine what those brutes would do to her first at least that much is beyond the imagination of her young mind what she can comprehend though is fear enough if she wanted to hide somewhere i would have let her but she has a rightif she so choosesto contribute to saving herself she is gifted and can use her power to do the simple part of what needs doing she begged me to give her the chance to help in anguish kahlan gathered her fur mantle at her throat as she glanced back over her shoulder at the little girl using both her spindly arms to lift the heavy steel rod and drop it again to break the glass in the bottom of the barrel hollys features were drawn tight as she concentrated on using her gift while at the same time lifting the weight of the rod dear spirits kahlan whispered to herself this is madness cara impatiently shifted her weight to her other foot it wasnt indifference to the situation but a matter of priorities madness or not there was little tine left and as verna said they could all die before the night was finished as cruel as it sounded there were more important matters than the life of one child or for that matter three how is the work going are you going to be ready vernas bold expression finally faltered i dont know she lifted a hand hesitantly motioning out over the dark valley before them the wind is right but the valley approach to our forces is quite broad its not that we wont have some its that we need to have enough so that when the enemy gets close we can release the glass dust to float across the span of the entire field of battle but you have some surely what you have will do damage to the enemy if there isnt enough then they may skirt it or it may not be concentrated enough to do the damage necessary to bring their forces to a halt their attack will not be turned back by a small number of casualties verna squeezed one fist in her other hand if the creator will just slow the imperial order enough to grant us another hour at the least then i believe we may have enough kahlan wiped a hand across her face that was asking a lot but with the darkness she thought that it just might be possible that the order would have to go slow enough to give verna and her sisters the time they needed and youre sure we cant help there is nothing any but the gifted can do to assist you vernas mask of authority again emerged in the moonlight well yes there is one thing what is it then you could leave me alone so i can work kahlan sighed just promise me one thing verna raised an eyebrow as if willing to listen prudently when the attack comes and you have to use this special glass get the children out of here first get them to the rear where they can be taken over the pass to safety verna smiled with relief we are of like minds in that mother confessor as verna hurried back to her work kahlan and cara returned along the line of sisters past the end to where holly was preparing glass to supply those gifted women kahlan couldnt help but to stop for a word holly how are you getting along when the girl rested the rod against the side of the barrel cara absent any fondness for magic aimed a suspicious frown at the faintly glowing metal as holly took her small hands from the metal the greenish glow faded as if a magical wick had been turned down im fine mother confessor except im cold im getting terribly tired of being cold kahlan smiled warmly as she ran a gentle hand down the back of hollys fine hair as are we all kahlan crouched down beside the girl when we get over into another valley you can get warm by a nice fire that would be splendid she cast a furtive glance at her steel rod i have to get back to work mother confessor kahlan couldnt resist pulling the girl close and kissing her frigid cheek hesitant at first the thin little arms surrendered to desperately encircle kahlans neck im so scared holly whispered me too kahlan whispered back as she squeezed the girl tight me too holly straightened really you get scared too that those awful men will murder us kahlan nodded i get frightened but i know we have a lot of good people who will keep us safe like you they work as hard as they can so that we can all someday be safe and not have to be scared anymore the girl stuck her hands under her cloak to warm them her gaze sank to the ground at her feet i miss ann too she looked up again is ann safe kahlan groped for words of comfort i saw ann not long ago and she was fine i dont think you need worry for her she saved me i love her and miss her so will she be with us soon kahlan cupped the girls cheek i dont know holly she had important business she was taking care of im sure though that well see her again pleased with that news and seemingly relieved to know that she was not alone in her fears holly turned back to her work with renewed determination as kahlan and cara collected their horses they heard a horse approaching at a gallop before she recognized the rider kahlan saw and recognized the black splotch on its rump when he saw her waving zedd trotted spider around to her he slid down off the animals bare back theyre coming the wizard announced without preamble verna rushed up having seen zedd ride in its too soon they werent supposed to be here this soon he gaped at her in astonishment bags woman shall i tell them that it would be rather inconvenient for them to attack right now and to please come back to kill us later you know what i mean she snapped we dont have enough yet how long till they get here kahlan asked ten minutes that thin sliver of time was the only bulwark between them and catastrophe kahlan felt as if her heart rose into her throat recalling suddenly the forsaken feeling of being mobbed and beaten to death verna sputtered in wordless frustration anger and dread do you have any ready zedd asked as calmly as if he were inquiring about dinner yes of course she said but if they will be here that soon weve not enough dear creator we dont have nearly what well need in order to drift it out all across the front too little is as good as none weve no choice now zedd gazed off into the darkness perhaps seeing what only a wizard could see his jaw was set in bitter disappointment he spoke in a disembodied voice a man going through the motions when he knew he had come to the end of his options perhaps even his faith start releasing what you have well just have to hope for the best i have messengers with me ill send word of the situation back to general meiffert he will need to know to see zedd seemly relinquish hope cast their fate in the most frightening light possible zedd was always the one who kept them focused and gave them courage conviction and confidence he gathered up spiders reins in one hand and gripped her mane with the other wait kahlan said he paused and looked back at her his eyes were a window into an inner weariness she couldnt imagine all the struggles he had faced in his life or even in the last few weeks kahlan ran through seemingly a thousand thoughts as she searched frantically for some way of turning away their grim fate kahlan couldnt let zedd down he had so often carried them now he needed another shoulder to help endure the weight she presented him a look of fierce determination before she turned to the prelate verna what if we didnt release it in the way we planned what if we didnt simply let it drift out hoping for the breeze to carry it where we need it verna opened her hands in a bewildered gesture what do you mean wont it take more of the glassthe amount you say you needsimply so that there is enough to let it drift all the way across the valley and yet have enough to hang in the air too well yes of course but what if kahlan asked we released it in a line along the face of the front right where it was needed then it would take less wouldnt it well i suppose verna threw up her hands but i told you we cant use magic to help us or they will detect our conjuring and then they will shield for the glass as fast as we release it it will be useless better to release what we have and hope for the best kahlan glanced out over the empty plain faintly lit by the placid clouds veiling the moon there was nothing to be seen out in the valley soon there would be soon the virgin snow would be trampled by the boots of over a million men only the sound of glass being crushed on stone and the thump of the steel rods in the barrels disturbed the quiet darkness soon bloodcurdling battle cries would inundate the hush of the night kahlan felt the suffocating dread she had felt when she first realized that all those men had caught her alone she felt the anger too collect what youve made so far she said let me have it they all stared at her zedds brow drew together in a wrinkled knot just what are you thinking kahlan pulled her hair back from her face as she rapidly pieced together her plan so that it was whole in her own mind first the enemy is attacking into the windnot directly but close enough for our purpose im thinking that if i ride along the front of our line right in front of the advancing enemy troops and i release the glass dust letting it dribble out as i go then it will flow out in the wind behind me right into the faces of the enemy delivering it right where its needed it wont take as much as it would were we to let it drift out from here hoping to spread it all across the valley she looked from one startled face to another do you see what im saying closer to the enemy wouldnt it take much less to do the job dear creator verna protested do you have any idea how dangerous that would be yes kahlan answered in grim resolve a lot less dangerous than facing a direct attack by their entire force now would that work wouldnt it take considerably less if i were to ride along the front trickling it out as i went than letting it drift out to them from here well were running out of time youre rightit wouldnt take nearly as much verna touched her lip as she stared off into the darkness while considering its better than the way we were going to do it that much is sure kahlan started pushing her get it together now hurry verna abandoned her protests and ran off to collect what they had cara was about to unleash a tirade of objections when zedd lifted a hand as if to ask she let him do the objecting instead kahlan it sounds like you might have something here but someone else can do this its foolish to risk ill be needing a diversion she said cutting him off something to distract their attention ill be riding by in the dark so they probably wont notice me but it would be best if there were something to occupy their attention just in case something to make them look elsewherefor the last time as i was saying someone else can no she said in quiet finality ill not ask someone else to do this it was my idea im doing it i wont allow someone to take my place kahlan deemed herself responsible for the peril they were in it was she who had blundered and fallen for jagangs trick it was she who had come up with the plan and ordered the troops out it was she who made jagangs night attack possible kahlan knew all too well the terror everyone felt waiting for the attack she felt it herself she thought of holly fearful of being murdered by the marauding beasts coming out of the night for her the fear was all too real it would be kahlan who had lost the war for them this very night if they didnt get their army back across that pass to safety im doing this myself she repeated thats the way its going to be standing here arguing about it can only cost us our chance now i need a diversion and i need one quickly zedd let out an angry breath the fire was back in his eyes he flicked out his hand pointing warren is back there waiting for me the two of us will move to separate locations and give you your diversion what will you do at last zedd surrendered to a grim cunning grin nothing fancy this time no clever devious tricks like they no doubt expect this time well give them a good oldfashioned firefight kahlan gave a sharp tug to the strap at her ribs holding her leather armor on her shoulders chest and back cinching it down tight she nodded once to seal the pact wizards fire it is then keep an eye to your right to our side as you ride i dont want you to get in the way of what i mean for the enemy you must also watch for what their gifted send back at me as she secured her cloak she nodded assent to zedds brief instructions she checked the straps on her leg armor making sure they were tight remembering how the enemys strong fingers had clawed at her legs trying to unhorse her verna camerushing back a big bucket at the end of each arm pulled down straight by the weight some of the sisters were scurrying along beside her all right the winded prelate said lets go kahlan reached for the buckets ill take verna yanked them back how do you propose to ride and sprinkle this out its too much besides you dont know its properties verna im not letting you stop acting like an obstinate child lets go cara snatched one of the buckets verna is right mother confessor you cant hold on to your horse release the glass dust and carry both buckets all at the same time you two take that one ill take this one the willowy sister philippa rushed to caras side and lifted the bucket mistress cara is right prelate you and the mother confessor cant do both buckets you two take one mistress cara and i will take the other there was no time to argue with the three determined women kahlan knew that no one would be able to talk her out of what she had to do and they probably felt the same besides they had a valid point all right kahlan said as she pulled on her gloves she lashed tight the fur mantle she wore over the top of the wool cloak she didnt want anything flapping in the wind the hilt of her sword was covered but she figured she wouldnt be needing it the hilt of richards sword stuck up behind her shoulder her everpresent reminder of himas if she needed one she quickly tied her hair back with a leather thong verna tossed a handful of the fluffy snow checking the wind it had held its direction and was light but steady at least that much was in their favor you two go first kahlan said to cara verna and i will wait maybe five minutes to let what you release drift in toward the enemy so that we wont ride through it then well follow you across the valley that way well be sure to overlap what you release with ours so as not to have any gaps we need to make sure theres no safe place for the order to get through we need the ruin and panic to be as uniform and widespread as possible sister philippa noting what kahlan had done fastened her cloak securely at her neck and waist that makes sense it would be more effective doubled like that verna agreed i guess theres no time to argue this foolishness zedd grumbled as he seized spiders mane and pulled himself up laying across the horses back on his belly he swung a leg over spiders rump and sat up let me have a minute or two to get ahead of you and let warren know then well start showing the imperial order some real wizard work he pulled his horse around and smiled it was heartening to see it again after all this work someone had better have some dinner waiting for me on the other side of that pass back there if i have to cook it for you myself kahlan promised the wizard gave them a jaunty wave and galloped off into the darkness chapter kahlan stuffed a boot in the stirrup grabbed the saddle horn and sprang up into her seat the cold leather creaked as she leaned over and held a hand down in order to help verna up once the prelate squirmed in close behind kahlan two sisters carefully handed the heavy wooden bucket up to her cara and sister philippa were on their horse and ready the sister balancing her bucket on her thigh get the children back across the pass verna ordered sister dulcinia bobbed her head of gray hair i will see to it prelate whatever more of the glass you can have ready by the time the mother confessor and i ride out you should release into the wind for good measure then get yourselves spread out behind our lines to help if the order breaks through if we fail the sisters must do their best to hold the enemy off while as many as possible make it across the pass to safety sister dulcinia again promised to carry out the prelates orders they all waited a few minutes in silence while giving zedd the head start he needed to reach warren with instructions there seemed nothing else to say kahlan concentrated on what she had to do rather than worrying whether or not it would work in the back of her mind though she was aware of how notoriously imperfect were such lastminute battle plans judging that they had waited as long as they dared kahlan motioned with her arm signaling cara to start out the two of them shared a last look cara offered a brief smile good luckthen raced away sister philippa holding tight to the mordsiths waist with one arm and balancing the bucket on her thigh with the help of her other hand as the sound of hoofbeats from caras horse faded into the night kahlan for the first time realized that in the distance she could hear the collective yells of hundreds of thousands of imperial order troops the countless voices fused into one continuous roar as their attack drew ever closer it almost sounded like the moan of an ill wind through a canyons rocky fangs her horse snorted and pawed the frozen ground the awful drone made kahlans pulse race even faster she wanted to race away before the men got too close but she had to wait to give the glass dust cara and sister philippa released time to drift out of the way i wish we could use magic to protect ourselves verna said in a quiet voice almost as if in answer to what kahlan was thinking we cant of course or they would detect it kahlan nodded hardly hearing the woman verna was just saying anything that came to mind so as not to have to sit and listen to the enemy coming for them the bitter cold long forgotten her heartbeat throbbing in her ears kahlan sat still as death staring out into the empty night trying to envision every aspect of the task at hand trying to go through it all in her mind first so she wouldnt be surprised by anything that might happen and then have to decide what to do better to anticipate if you could than to react as she quietly sat her horse she let her anger build too anger made a better warrior than fear kahlan fed that anger with images of all the terrible things she had seen the imperial order do to the people of the midlands she let the memories of all the bodies she had seen pass through her mind as if they came before the mother confessor to plead with stilled tongues for vengeance she remembered the women she had seen wailing over murdered children husbands sisters brothers mothers and fathers she remembered strong men in helpless anguish over the senseless slaughter of their friends and loved ones in her minds eye she saw those men women and children suffering at the hands of a people to whom they had done no harm the imperial order was but a gang of killers without empathy they merited no pity they would get none she thought about richard in the hands of that enemy she savored her promise to kill every one of them if she had to until she got richard back its time kahlan said through gritted teeth without looking back over her shoulder she asked are you ready ready dont slow for anything or we will end up its victims too our only chance is to keep fresh air streaming over us to carry the glass dust all away from our bodies when we get to the opposite side after ive dumped it all then well be safe by that time the order should be in a state of mass confusion if not complete panic kahlan nodded hold tight here we go the horse already in an excited state probably from the approaching cries sprang away too fast nearly dumping verna off the back her arm jerked tight around kahlans middle at the same time kahlan reached back and caught vernas sleeve holding her on as they raced away and verna fought to regain her balance the bucket lurched but verna was able to steady it fortunately it didnt spill even as the muscular gelding was obeying her command and racing away his ears were turned to the approaching clamor he was skittish carrying the unfamiliar burden of two riders he was well trained and had seen battle often enough so he probably was also edgy because he knew what the war cries signified kahlan knew he was strong and quick for what she had to do speed was life kahlans heart galloped as fast as the horse as they thundered through the blackness of the valley the enemy was much closer now than they had been when cara passed through not long before the horses hoofbeats partly drowned out the battle cries of countless enemy soldiers to their left terrifying bits of memories of fists and boots flashed unbidden into her mind as she heard men coming toward her in the dark screaming for blood she felt her vulnerability as never before kahlan turned those memories from fear to anger at the outrage of these brutes coming into her midlands and murdering her people she wanted every one of them to suffer and every one of them dead there was no telling precisely how far the enemy had already advanced or with the moonlight behind her even her own exact direction kahlan worried that she might have sliced it too close to the bone and that they could unexpectedly encounter a wall of bloodthirsty men she wanted to be close though to deliver the blinding dust right in their faces to be sure it had the best chance to work to turn back the attack she resisted the urge to guide her horse to the right away from the enemy the night suddenly ignited with harsh yellow light the clouds went from gray to bright yelloworange white snow blazed with garish color an awful droning sound vibrated deep under her ribs a hundred feet in front of her and maybe ten feet above the ground tumbling liquid yellow and blue light roared headlong across her route dripping honeyed fire trailing billowing black smoke the seething sphere of wizards fire vividly illuminated the ground beneath it as it shot past even though not directed at her the sound alone was enough to make kahlan ache to cringe away in dread she knew enough about wizards fire how it clung tenaciously to the skin to be more than wary of it once that living fire touched you it couldnt be dislodged even a single droplet of wizards fire would often eat through flesh down to bone there was no one either brave or foolish enough not to fear it few people touched by such conjured flame lived to recount the horror of the experience for those who did revenge became a lifelong obsession then in the light of that bright flame streaking across the valley floor kahlan caught sight of the horde all with swords maces flails axes pikes and lances raised in the air as they yelled their battle cries the men grim daunting fierce were all in the grip of a wild lust for the fight as they ran headlong out of the night in the moonlight kahlan could see for the first time since she had joined up with the army the full extent of the enemy forces the reports had told the story but could not fully convey the reality of the sight the numbers were so far removed from her experience as to defy comprehension eyes wide jaw hanging open she gasped in awe kahlan realized with alarm that the enemy was much closer than she had expected throughout the ocean of men torches meant to be used to set fires sparkled like moonlight off the vast sea flooding into the valley at the horizon that moonlight gleaming off uncountable weapons blurred into a flat line over which she almost expected to see ships sailing the undulating leading edge bristling shields and spears threatened to close off her path kahlan used her right heel back against her horses flank to guide him a little to the right so as to clear the wave of soldiers after she had corrected his course she thumped her heels against the animals ribs urging him on and then she realized as arrows zipped past and spears plunged to the ground just in front of her that in the light of the wizards fire the enemy could see her too the ball of wizards fire that had revealed her to the enemy wailed off into the darkness leaving her in shadow and lighting tens of thousands of men at a time as it passed over their heads far in the distance behind the advancing horde the fire finally crashed to the ground igniting a conflagration in the midst of the cavalry horsemen were often held back ready to charge forth when their men encountered the dharan lines the distant mortal screams of man and beast rose into the night an arrow skipped off her leather leg armor more zipped past one stuck in the saddle just below her stomach as she leaned forward over the galloping horses withers apparently in the moonlight they could still spot her and verna racing past why arent they blind kahlan called over her shoulder she could see a cloud billowing out behind them it looked little different than the dust the horse raised as it galloped except kahlan saw that it was coming from the bucket verna rested against her thigh as she tipped it toward the enemy lines a little more a little less controlling the amount that poured out keeping it in a steady stream cara had already been past yet the men showed no ill effect it takes a little while to work verna said in kahlans ear they have to blink a bit fire raced past right behind them fiery droplets splashed down onto the snow splattering when they hit hissing like rain on hot stones round a fire the horse snorted as he raced onward in near panic as she leaned over his withers kahlan stroked his neck reassuringly reminding him that he wasnt alone kahlan let her gaze sweep along the advancing enemy line as she raced before them she saw that the men were doing little blinking their eyes were wide in their fervor for the coming battle the wizards fire that had so spooked the horse from behind exploded through the enemy ranks liquid flames spilled across the mass of soldiers touching off a shrill roar of ghastly cries when burning men crashed into soldiers around them fire splashed onto them too spreading the horror around the fire the advancing line buckled yet other men running headlong through the night trampled those on the ground only to lose their own footing and topple another sphere of wizards fire droned past to crash down spilling its flame like water from a burst dam so massive was the eruption that the surge swept men away carrying them off in a flaming current a huge knot of fire erupted out of the enemy line not far in front of kahlan headed toward the dharan lines immediately a small sphere of blue flame roared in from her right meeting the ponderous globe of yellow flame in midair the collision sent a shower of fire raining down around her as she rode past kahlan gasped and yanked the reins left as a fat gob of the plummeting fire crashed to the ground right before them splattering flame everywhere they missed the fire by inches but she now found herself closing with the enemy soldiers at an alarming rate kahlan could read some of the obscene oaths on their lips she spurred the terrified horse to the right she turned a little but not enough to divert them from angling in toward the enemy lines glowing bits of fire rained down on the men as well as the open ground the horse was running in a panic too frightened to take direction from kahlan the stench of burning leather was adding fuel to the horses fear she glanced down and saw a bit of fire burning on the leather armor protecting her thigh the small but fierce flame fluttered wildly in the wind she dared not try to brush the glowing spot off lest it then stick to her hand she feared to imagine what it would feel like when it finally burned through the leather she would have to endure the pain when it did she had no choice verna didnt realize what was happening she was twisted sideways still releasing the glass dust kahlan could see the plume of it carried away behind them the long trail curved carried by the breeze into the enemy past the front lines back through the ranks of soldiers off into the blackness farther back in the orders ranks the torches lit the cloud as it mingled with the dust churned up from the frozen ground an arrow nicked the horses shoulder and skipped up into the air a surge of men seeing her coming ran with wild abandon in an effort to block her way kahlan yanked on the reins trying to haul the powerful horses head to the right in the grip of terror the horse galloped on she felt helpless as she tried to get it to turn it was doing no good they were headed right toward a wall of men were getting too close verna yelled in her ear kahlan was too busy to answer her arm was shaking with the effort of pulling on the right rein trying to turn the horses head over and to the right but the horse had the bit in his teeth and was stronger than she by far sweat trickled down her neck she stretched her right leg back and dug her heel into the horses right flank to turn him the men before them brought their pikes and swords around to bear fighting was one thing but not having any control and just watching her fate come at her was different kahlan what are you doing with the pressure of her heel in front of his right rear leg she was finally forcing the horse to turn it wasnt enough she wasnt going to be able to divert the runaway horse the enemy looked like a steel porcupine rushing at them three strides away the horse lowered his head good boy she cried maybe he had a chance to clear the pikes kahlan took her weight off the saddle and angled forward flattening her back she bent her arms giving the reins slack with her hands to either side of the horses neck she kept pressure on him with her lower legs but let him have the freedom he needed she didnt know if it would work with the extra weight if only the pikes were shorter kahlan screamed for verna to hold on wizards fire suddenly streamed past in front of them coming in low the men who had rushed ahead in a line to block kahlans way dove to the ground the entire line before them collapsed the fire wailed past just over top of them finally touching down off to kahlans left the cries of a thousand men filled her ears the horse stretched his lowered head getting his hocks underneath his body at the last instant his neck shortened and his head came up as he sprang upward using his powerful hindquarters to launch himself his back rounded as they sailed over the leading edge of men verna cried out her arm like a hook around kahlans middle they came down beyond the soldiers who had dropped flat with her weight on the stirrups kahlan used her legs to absorb the shockverna couldnt with the extra load the horse nearly stumbled as it landed but kept his balance and continued running they were at last clear of the order soldiers whats the matter with you verna yelled dont do that or i wont be able to let it out evenly sorry kahlan called over her shoulder despite the cold wind in her face sweat ran from her scalp the order soldiers seemed to fall away to their rear quarter giddy relief washed over her as she realized they had made it past the bulge in the imperial orders front lines in the distance behind them a storm of fire lit the night zedd and warren were showing them a good oldfashioned firefight as zedd had put it it was a terrifying demonstration if insufficient to stop an enemy as large as the order as the orders gifted raced to the scene and threw up shields it limited the death and devastation the two wizards had bought kahlan and verna the time they had needed kahlan heard cara calling whoa as she galloped up close this time with caras horse heading them off the lathered mount rapidly came to a halt the horse was exhausted as was kahlan as they dismounted beside cara and sister philippa verna tossed the empty bucket to the ground kahlan was glad it was dark so that the others couldnt see her legs trembling she was relieved to see that the spot of fire had expended itself before burning through the four of them watched as the night went mad with flame most exploding against shields of magic yet still doing damage to anyone too close zedd and warren sent forth one tumbling sphere of fiery death after another the cries of men could be heard all along the line the fire was being returned reaping death in the dharan lines but the sisters were throwing up their own shields still the vast enemy army advanced at most the deadly flames only slowed them and disrupted their orderly attack as the gifted on both sides gained control they managed to nullify each others fiery attacks kahlan knew that the forward dharan lines had no hope of holding the onrushing flood of the order they had no hope of even slowing them in the moonlight she could see them beginning to abandon their positions why isnt it working kahlan whispered half to herself she leaned toward verna are you sure it was made properly watching the enemys headlong rush and in the din of battle cries verna didnt seem to hear the question kahlan checked her sword she realized how futile it would be to try to fight she felt richards sword on her back and considered drawing it but decided that it would be better to run she pushed verna urging her to their spent horse cara did the same with sister philippa before she stepped into the stirrup kahlan noticed the order slowing she saw men stumbling some groped with outstretched arms others fell verna pointed look an endless moan of frightened agony began rising up into the night growing in intensity staggering men fell over one another some swung their swords at an invisible enemy hacking instead their blinded fellow soldiers the progress of the men at the front slowed to a crawl soldiers kept coming colliding with the stalled front line cavalry horses panicked bucking off riders spooked horses ran off in every direction oblivious of the men they trampled racing wagons overturned confusion swept the enemys ranks the advance buckled the imperial order ground to a halt zedd and warren rode up and dismounted both sweating despite the frigid night air kahlan gave zedds bony hand a squeeze you two saved our necks at the end there zedd gestured to warren him not me warren shrugged i saw your predicament they all stared in wonder watching the army gone blind you did it verna kahlan said you and your glass saved us at last she and verna threw their arms around each other tears of relief coursing down their cheeks chapter kahlan was one of the last to cross over the pass the valley beyond was well protected by towering rock walls around the southern half it was a long and difficult route around those mountains if the order had any thoughts of attacking them here while the troops of the dharan empire had no intention of letting themselves get trapped in that valley for the time being it was a safe place big old spruces filled the lap of the surrounding mountains so they were somewhat protected from the wind as well tents carpeted the forest floor it was good to see all the campfires and smell the woodsmokea sign that they were safe enough for the men to have fires the aroma of cooking filled the latenight air too it had been a lot of work moving the army and their equipment over the pass and the men were hungry general meiffert looked as pleased as any general would when the army he feared lost was at last safeat least for the time being he guided kahlan and cara through the darkness dotted by thousands of campfires to tents he had set up for them along the way he filled them in on how everything with the army had gone and ran through a list of what few things they had had to leave behind its going to be a cold night general meiffert said when they had reached the tents he had set aside for them between two towering spruce i had a sack of pebbles heated by a fire for you mother confessor you too mistress cara kahlan thanked him before he left to see to his duties cara went off to go get something to eat kahlan told her to go ahead that she just wanted to sleep inside her tent kahlan found spirit standing on a little table the lamp hanging from the ridgepole lighting her proud pose she paused to trace a finger down the flowing robes kahlan her teeth chattering could hardly wait to crawl into bed and pull that sack of heated pebbles under the fur mantle with her she thought about how cold she was and then instead of climbing into her bed went back outside and searched through the dark camp until she found a sister after following the sisters directions going between tents until she reached the area with the thick young trees kahlan found the small leanto shelter set among the boughs for protection from the wind and weather she squatted down peering inside at the bundle of blankets she could just make out in the light coming from nearby campfires holly are you in there a little head poked out mother confessor the girl was shivering what is it do you need me yes as a matter of fact i do come with me please holly climbed out swaddled in a blanket kahlan took her little hand and walked her back to her tent in silence hollys eyes grew big and round as kahlan ushered in inside before the small table the girl paused to stand still as a stump while she stared in wonder at spirit like it kahlan asked trembling with the cold holly reverently ran her frail fingers down spirits arm where ever did you get something so beautiful richard carved it for me holly finally pulled her gaze from the statue and looked up at kahlan i miss richard kahlan could see hollys breath in the motionless air of the tent he was always nice to me a lot of people were mean but richard was always nice kahlan felt an unexpected stab of anguish she hadnt expected the subject to turn to richard what was it you needed mother confessor kahlan turned her thoughts away from her sorrow and smiled i was proud of the work you did to help save us today i promised you that you would be warm tonight you will be the girls teeth were chattering really kahlan laid the sword of truth on the far side of the bed she stripped off some of her heavier clothing doused the lamp and then sat down on the strawfilled pallet light from nearby campfires lent a soft glow to the tents walls come climb into bed with me its going to be very cold tonight i need you to keep me warm holly only had to consider for a second as kahlan lay down on her side she pulled hollys back against her stomach and then drew the sack of heated pebbles up against the girls front holly hugged the sack and moaned with the thrill of warmth the satisfied moan made kahlan smile for a long time she smiled enjoying the simple pleasure of seeing holly warm and safe having the girl there holding her close helped kahlan to forget all the terrible things she had seen that day far up in the mountains a single wolf sang out in a long lonely call the cry echoed through the valley trailing off to be renewed again and again with forlorn persistence with his sword at her back kahlans thoughts turned to richard thinking about him wondering where he was and if he was safe she silently wept herself to sleep the next day snow moved down from the higher mountains to rampage across the southern regions of the midlands the storms raged for two days the second night of the blizzard kahlan shared her tent with holly valery and helen they sat under blankets ate camp stew sang songs told stories of princes and princesses and slept together to keep warm when the snowstorm finally ended in a bleak golden sunrise most of the taller tents had snow drifted to their eaves on their downwind side the smaller ones were completely covered over the men dug themselves out looking like so many woodchucks come up out of their burrows for a peek over the next several weeks the storms continued to roll past dumping more snow in such weather fighting or even moving an army very far was difficult scouts reported that the imperial order had withdrawn a weeks march back to the south it would be a burden to care for blinded men within a days walk all around the place where the special glass had been released the dharan scouts reported that they had seen well over sixty thousand frozen corpses now drifted over with the snowblind men unable to care for themselves in the harsh conditions the imperial order had probably abandoned them to their fate a few dozen of the blind had managed to make it over the pass looking for help begging for mercy kahlan had ordered them executed it was hard telling the exact number blinded by vernas special glass it could be that there were many who did in fact retreat with the imperial order brought along to perform menial tasks it was likely though that the corpses reported by the scouts were the bulk of those blinded kahlan could imagine that jagang might not want them in his camp using food and supplies reminding his men of their stinging retreat she knew though that for jagang retreat was but a momentary setback and not a reappraisal of his objectives the order had men enough to shrug off the loss of the hundred thousand killed since the fighting had started for the time being the weather prevented jagang from striking back kahlan didnt intend to sit and wait for him a month later when the representative from herjborgue arrived she met with him immediately in the small trappers lodge they had found up in the trees to the west side of the valley the lodge sat under the protection of towering ancient pines away from the open areas where the tents were congregated the lodge had become kahlans frequent quarters and often also served as their command center it greatly relieved general meiffert when kahlan would stay in the lodge rather than a tent it made him feel as if the army was doing something about providing better accommodations for the mother confessorthe wife of lord rahl kahlan and cara did appreciate the nights they slept in the lodge but kahlan didnt want anyone to think she wasnt up to the conditions the rest of them had to endure sometimes she would instead have the girls sleep in the lodge along with some of the sisters and sometimes she insisted verna sleep there with holly valery and helen it didnt take a great deal of effort to persuade the prelate kahlan greeted representative theriault from the land of herjborgue inviting him into the cozy lodge he was accompanied by a small guard unit who waited outside herjborgue was a small country their contribution to the war effort was in the area of their only product wool kahlan had need of the man after representative theriault knelt before the mother confessor receiving the traditional greeting he at last stood and pushed his heavy hood back on his shoulders he broke into a broad grin mother confessor so good to see you well she returned a sincere smile and you representative theriault here come over by the fire and warm yourself by the stone fireplace he pulled off his gloves and held his hands before the crackling flames he glanced to the gleaming hilt of the sword sticking up behind her shoulder his eye was caught by spirit standing proudly on the mantel he stared in wonder as did everyone who saw the proud figure we heard about lord rahl being captured he finally said has there been any word kahlan shook her head we know they havent harmed him but thats about all i know my husband hes resourceful i expect he will find a way to get back to help us the man nodded his brow furrowed as he listened earnestly cara standing beside the table reminded of her lord rahl by kahlans words idly rolled her agiel in her fingers kahlan could tell by the look in caras blue eyes and by the way she casually let the weapon dangle once more by the small gold chain around her wrist that the agiel being linked to the living lord rahl still possessed its power as long as it worked they knew richard was alive that was all they knew the man opened his heavy traveling cloak how goes the war everyone anxiously awaits word as near as we can figure weve managed to kill over a hundred thousand of their troops the man gaspedsuch numbers were staggering to someone from a place as small as his homeland of herjborgue then they must be defeated have they run back to the old world rather than meet his gaze kahlan stared at the logs checkering in the wavering glow of the flames im afraid that losing that many men is hardly crippling to the imperial order were taking their numbers down but they have an army of well over ten times that many they remain a threat a weeks march to the south of here kahlan looked up to see him staring at her she could tell by the look in his eyes that he was having difficulty trying to imagine that many people his windreddened face had paled considerably dear spirits he whispered weve heard rumors but to learn they are true with a despondent look he shook his head how is it ever going to be possible to defeat a foe of that size seems that i remember a number of years back you were in aydindril to see the council and you had a bit of trouble after a grand dinner that big man from keltoni forget his namewas boasting and speaking ill of your small land he called you some name do you remember that nightwhat he called you representative theriaults eyes sparkled as he smiled puny puny that was it i guess he felt that because he was twice your size that made him your better i recall men clearing off a table and the two of you arm wrestling ah well i was younger back then and i had a few glasses of wine with dinner besides you won he laughed softly not by strength he was cocky i was clever perhaps and quickthats all you won that was the result those hundred thousand order troops arent any less dead because they outnumbered us the smile left his lips point taken i guess the imperial order ought to quit now while they have men left i recall how those five thousand galean recruits you led went after that force of fifty thousand and eliminated them he leaned an arm on the roughhewn mantel anyway i see your point when you are facing superior strength you must use your wits i need your help kahlan told the man his big brown eyes reflected the firelight as they turned toward her anything mother confessor if it be in my power to do anything kahlan bent and shoved another log onto the fire sparks swirled around before ascending the chimney we need wool cloaks hooded cloaksfor the men he considered only briefly just tell me the numbers and i will see to it im sure it can be arranged ill need at least a hundred thousandour entire force down here at present were expecting more men any time so if you could add half again that number it would go a long way to helping destroy the order as he went through mental calculations kahlan used the poker to set the new log to the back of the fire i know im not asking for something easy he scratched his scalp through his thick gray hair youve no need of hearing how difficult it will be that wont help you win so let me just say that you will have them representative theriaults word was a pledge as sound as gold and as valuable she stood and faced him and i want them made from bleached wool he lifted an eyebrow in curiosity bleached wool we need to be clever as you can understand the imperial order comes from far to the south richard was down there once and told me about how the weather is very different than it is up here in the new world their winters are nothing like we have if i dont miss my bet the order is not familiar with winter nor is it used to surviving much less fighting in such weather winter conditions may be difficult but this puts it to our advantage kahlan made a fist before him i want to harry them mercilessly i want to use the winter weather to make them suffer i want to draw them out make them have to fightin conditions they dont understand as well as we do i want the hooded cloaks to help disguise our men i want to be able to use the conditions to get in close on raids and then disappear right before their eyes they dont have gifted yes but theyre not going to have a sorceress telling every archer where to aim his arrow he stroked his chin yes i see your point he slapped the mantel as if to seal his promise ill have our people begin at once your men will need warm mittens too kahlan smiled appreciatively they will be grateful have your people start sending the cloaks down to us as soon as they have some made dont wait for them all we can start our raids with any number and add to them as you deliver more representative theriault pulled his hood up and fastened his heavy wool cloak winter has just set in the more time you have to whittle them down while you have the advantage of weather the better i had best be on my way at once kahlan clasped arms with the mannot something the mother confessor typically did but something anyone else might do in sincere appreciation of aid as she and cara stood outside the door watching the representative and his guards trudging off through the snow kahlan hoped the supply of white cloaks would start arriving soon and that they would be as effective as she hoped do you really think we can press the war effectively in winter cara asked kahlan turned back to the door we have to before she went back inside kahlan caught sight of a procession coming up through the trees when they were a little closer she saw that it was general meiffert on foot leading she was able to pick out adie verna warren and zedd all walking along beside four riders the midday sun sparkled off the hilt of the lead riders sword kahlan gasped when she saw who it was without bothering to go back inside to get her cloak or fur mantle she raced down through the snow to great him cara was right on kahlans heels harold she called out as she got closer oh harold are we ever glad to see you it was her half brother come from galea kahlan then saw some of the other men riding behind him and gasped again in surprise captain bradley ryan commander of the galean recruits she had fought with was there and his lieutenant flin hobson she thought she recognized sergeant frost in the rear her face hurt from grinning as she ran up to them through the deep snow kahlan wanted to pull her half brother off his horse and hug him in a galean fieldofficer uniform far more muted than their dress uniform he looked grand on his wellbred mount she only now fully realized how worried she had been over his late arrival carrying himself like the prince he was harold tipped his head to her as he bowed in his saddle he offered only a small private smile mother confessor im gratified to find you well captain ryan was grinning even if prince harold wasnt kahlan had fond memories of bradley and flin of their bravery courage and heart the fighting had been horrifying but the company of those fine soldiers fine young men all was a cherished memory they had done the impossible before and had come to help do it again standing beside his horse kahlan reached up for harolds hand come inside weve a good fire going she motioned to the captain the lieutenant and the sergeant you too come inside and get warm kahlan turned to the others who didnt look nearly as happy as kahlan thought they should well all fit come inside prince harold stepped down out of the stirrup mother confessor i kahlan couldnt resist she threw her arms around her half brother he was a big bear of a man much like their father king wyborn harold im so relieved to see you hows cyrilla cyrilla harolds sister and kahlans half sister was a dozen years older than kahlan cyrilla had been ill for ages it seemed when she had been captured by the order she had been thrown into the pit with a gang of murderers and rapists harold had rescued her but the abuse she suffered had left her in an incoherent state oblivious of those around her she regained her senses only infrequently when she came awake she more often than not screamed and cried uncontrollably one of the times when she was lucid she had asked kahlan to promise to be the queen of galea and keep her people safe harold wishing to remain commander of the galean army refused the crown kahlan reluctantly had acceded to his wish harolds eyes shifted to the others briefly mother confessor we need to have a talk chapter at prince harolds instructions captain ryan and his two men went to see to their troops and horses while the rest of them crowded into the small trappers lodge zedd and warren sat on a bench made of a board laid atop two log rounds verna and adie sat against the opposite wall on another bench cara gazed out the small window standing near cara general meiffert watched as the prince ran a finger back and forth along the front edge of the table kahlan folded her hands on the table before her so she began fearing the worst how is cyrilla harold smoothed the front of his coat the queen has recovered queen kahlan rose out of her chair cyrilla has recovered harold thats wonderful news and she has at last taken her crown back even better kahlan was delighted to be relieved of the role of queen to galea as mother confessor it was an awkward duty better served by cyrilla more than that though she was relieved to learn that her half sister had finally recovered while the two of them were never close they shared a mutual respect more than her cheer at cyrillas recovery though kahlan felt a sense of deliverance that harold had at last brought his troops down to join with them she hoped he had been able to raise the hundred thousand they had previously discussed it would be a good beginning for the army kahlan needed to raise harold licked his weathercracked lips by the slump in his shoulders she was sure that the task of collecting his army had been trying and the journey arduous she had never seen his face looking so worn he had a vague empty look that reminded her of her father kahlan smiled exuberantly determined to show her appreciation how many troops did you bring we could certainly use the whole hundred thousand that would just about double what we have down here so far the spirits know we need them no one was saying anything as she looked from one person to the next no one would meet her gaze kahlans sense of relief was sloughing away harold how many troops did you bring he ran his meaty fingers back through his long thick dark hair about a thousand she stared dumbly sinking back into her chair a thousand he nodded still not meeting her eyes captain bradley and his men the ones you led and fought beside before kahlan could feel her face heating we need all your troops harold whats going on he at last met her gaze queen cyrilla refused my plan to take our troops south shortly after you were there and visited her she came out of her illness she was herself againfull of ambition and fire you know what she was like she was always tireless in her advocacy for galea his fingers idly tapped the table but im afraid she has been changed by her infirmity she fears the imperial order so do i kahlan said with quiet bottled rage she could feel richards sword pressed against the back of her shoulder she saw harolds eyes take it in everyone in the midlands fears the order that is why we need those troops he was nodding as she spoke i told her all that i did she said that she is queen of galea and as such she must put our land first galea has joined the dharan empire he opened his hands in a helpless gesture when she was ill she was unaware of that event taking place she said she only gave you the crown for the safekeeping of her people not to surrender their sovereignty his hands dropped to his sides she claims you never had any such authority and refuses to abide by the agreement kahlan glanced at the others in the room sitting mute like a panel of grim judges harold you and i have discussed all this in the past the midlands is under threat she swept her arm out the entire new world is threatened we must turn back that threat not take to defending one land at a time or have each land try to fend for itself if we do that we will all fall one at a time we must stand together i agree with you in principle mother confessor queen cyrilla does not then cyrilla is not recovered harold she is still sick that may be but it is not for me to say elbow on the table kahlan rested her forehead against her fingertips thoughts were screaming around inside her head demanding that this not be happening what about jebra zedd asked from the side of the room kahlan was relieved to hear his voice as if reason were returning to the lunacy of what she was hearing as if the weight of another voice would set things straight we left the seer there to help care for cyrilla and to advise you surely jebra must have advised cyrilla against such actions harold hung his head again im afraid that queen cyrilla ordered jebra thrown into a dungeon moreover the queen gave orders that if jebra speaks one word of her blasphemyas queen cyrilla calls itshe is to have her tongue cut out kahlan had to tell herself to blink it was no longer cyrillas behavior that so stunned her her words came sparse and brittle the naked bones of dead respect harold why would you follow the orders of a madwoman his jaw took a set as if injured by her tone mother confessor she is not only my sister but my queen i am sworn to obey my queen in order to protect the galean people all those men of ours out there who have been fighting with your army are also sworn to protect the people of galea above all else ive already given them our queens orders we must all return to galea at once im sorry but that is the way it must be kahlan pounded her fist on the table and shot to her feet galea stands at the head of the callisidrin valley its a gateway right up the center of the midlands dont you see what a tempting route it might be for the imperial order dont you see how they might want to split the midlands of course i do mother confessor she aimed a stiff arm pointing at the camp beyond the lodge so you just expect all those men out there to put their lives between you and the order you and queen cyrilla callously expect all those men out there to die protecting youwhile you sit back in galeahoping they prevent the order from ever reaching you of course not mother confessor whats the matter with you dont you see that if you fight with us to halt the order you are protecting the people of your homeland harold licked his lip mother confessor all you say is probably true it is also irrelevant i am commander of the galean army my entire life has been devoted to serving the people of galea and my sovereignfirst my mother and father and then my sister from the time i was a boy at my fathers knee i was taught to protect galea above all else kahlan did her best to control her voice harold cyrilla is obviously still sick if you are honestly interested in protecting your people you must see that what youre doing is not the way to accomplish it mother confessor i have been charged by my queen with protecting the people of galea i know my duty duty kahlan wiped a hand across her face harold you cant blindly follow that womans whim the route to life and liberty exists only through reason she may be queen but reason can be your only true sovereign to fail to use reason in this to fail to think is intellectual anarchy he looked at her as if she were some poor child who didnt understand the world of adult responsibility she is my queen the queen is devoted to the people kahlan drummed her fingers on the table what cyrilla is is deluded by ghosts that still haunt her she is going to bring harm to your people you are going to aid her in delivering your people into ruin because you wish something to be true even though it is not you are seeing her as she once was not as she is now he shrugged mother confessor i can understand why you think what you think but it can change nothing i must do as my queen commands elbows on the table kahlan held her face in her hands for a time trembling with anger at the insanity of what she was hearing she finally looked up meeting her half brothers gaze harold galea is part of the dharan empire galea has a queen only at the indulgence of the empire queen though she may be even if she does not recognize the rule of the dharan empire she is still as she always has been subordinate to the mother confessor of the midlands as mother confessor as well as the leader of the dharan empire in lord rahls absence i formally terminate that indulgence cyrilla is now without authority and is removed from office she is no longer the queen of anything much less galea you are ordered to return to ebinissia to put cyrilla under arrest for her own protection to release jebra and to return to this army with the seer and all galean forces except a home guard for the crown city mother confessor im sorry but my queen has ordered kahlan slammed the flat of her hand down on the table enough he fell silent as kahlan rose with her fingertips pressed to the table she leaned closer to him as mother confessor i am commanding you to carry out my orders at once that is final i will hear no more the room seemed gripped by the grave consequence of what was happening each forbidding face watched waiting to see how it was going to go harold spoke in a voice that reminded kahlan of her fathers i realize that it may make no sense to you mother confessor but i must choose my duty to my people above my duty to you cyrilla is my sister king wyborn always told me to run a good army an officer must obey his queen my men down here are ordered by their queen to return at once to protect galea i am a man bound by my honor to protect my people as ordered by my queen you pompous fool how dare you speak to me of your honor you are sacrificing the lives of innocent people to your delusions of honor honor is honesty to what is not blind duty to what you wish to be you have no honor harold kahlan sank into her chair she looked past him to the side staring into the hearth into the flames i have given you my orders do you refuse to obey them i must refuse mother confessor let me say only that it is not out of malice harold she said in a flat tone without looking at him you are committing treason i realize that you may see it that way mother confessor oh i do i do indeed treason to your people treason to the midlands treason to our dharan union against the imperial order and treason against the mother confessor what do you suppose i ought to do about it i would expect that if you feel so strongly you would have me put to death mother confessor she looked up at him if you have enough sense to realize that then what good will it do for you to stick to the orders of a madwoman it will only bring your death and then you will not be able to carry out your queens orders staying to your course can only leave your people without your aid which is what you claim to put above all else why not simply do the right thing and help us to help your people since you refuse you have shown yourself in truth to be without common sense much less honor his eyes turned to her filled with smoldering anger the knuckles of his fists went white i will be heard now mother confessor if i stand by my honor even if it costs me my life it will be honoring my family my sister my queen and my homeland a homeland forged by my father king wyborn and my mother queen bernadine when i was young my father my sovereign king was taken from my mother my family and my homeland of galea by the confessors taken by a confessors power for their selfish desire of a husband for your mother for her selfish desire for a strong man to father her a childyou now you mother confessorthe daughter of that theft of that beloved man from us when i was but a boyyou would take me from my sister hake her too from our land take me from my duty to serve my queen my land and above all my people the last duty my father charged me with before your mother took him from us and destroyed him for no reason but that he was good and she wanted him was that i should always honor my duty to my sister and my land i will carry out my fathers last charge to me even if you think it madness kahlan stared at him in cold shock im sorry you feel that way harold his face had aged and hardened i know that you are not responsible for all that happened before you came to be and i will always love that part of you that is my father but i am still the one who must live with it all now i must be true to myself to my own feelings your feelings she repeated yes mother confessor those are my feelings and i must put my faith in them kahlan swallowed past the painful constriction in her throat her fingers lying limply on the table before her tingled faith and feelings harold you are as mad as your sister she drew herself up straight and folded her hands she shared a last look with her half brother a man she had never known except in name as she pronounced sentence on him beginning at sunrise tomorrow the dharan empire and galea are at war after sunrise tomorrow if you are seen by me or any of our men you will be put to death for the crime of treason i will not allow those brave men out there to die for traitors the imperial order will in all likelihood turn north up the callisidrin valley you will be alone they will butcher every man in your army just as they butchered the people of ebinissia jagang will give your sister to his men as a whore it will be by your doing harold for refusing to use your ability to think and instead following your feelings and faith in what does not exist harold hands clasped behind his back chin held up said nothing as kahlan continued tell cyrilla that she had better hope for the fate i have just described because if the order does not come through galea i will i have promised no mercy to the order galeas treason condemns her to the same fate as the order if the order does not get cyrilla then i swear i will and when i get her i am going to take her back to aydindril and im going to personally throw her back down into that pit from which you rescued her and i am going to leave her down there with every criminal brute i can find for as long as she lives harolds jaw dropped mother confessor you wouldnt kahlans eyes told him otherwise you be sure to tell cyrilla whats in store for her jebra probably tried to tell her and was thrown in a dungeon for it cyrilla is refusing to see the open pit before her and you are walking into it with her worse you are taking your innocent people with you kahlan drew her royal galean sword she grasped either end in a hand gritting her teeth she pulled the flat of the blade against her knee the steel bent then finally snapped with a loud report she tossed the broken blade on the floor at his feet now get out of my sight he turned to leave but before he took a step zedd stood holding out a hand as if to ask him to remain where he was mother confessor zedd said choosing his words carefully i believe you are letting your emotions get in the way harold gestured to kahlan relieved to hear zedds intercession tell her wizard zorander tell her kahlan couldnt believe her ears she remained where she was staring into zedds hazel eyes then would you mind explaining my error of emotion first wizard zedd glanced at harold and then back to kahlan mother confessor queen cyrilla is obviously deranged prince harold is not only doing her a disservice but enabling her to bring only the specter of death to her people if he chose the side of reason he would be protecting his people and honoring his sisters past admirable service when she was of sound mind instead he has betrayed his duty to his people by embracing what he wishes to be true about her instead of facing what is true in this way he is embracing death and in this case embracing death for his people too prince harold has been justly found guilty of treason your emotions for him are interfering with your judgment obviously he is now a danger to our cause to the lives of our people and to the lives of his own people he cannot be allowed to leave harold looked thunderstruck but zedd zedds hazel eyes too were a terrible pronouncement of guilt he waited as if challenging the man to further prove his treason harolds mouth moved but he could offer no words does anyone disagree with me zedd asked he looked at adie she shook her head verna likewise shook her head warren stared at harold for a moment then shook his head harolds expression turned indignant im not going to stand for this the mother confessor has given me until dawn to withdraw you must honor her sentence he took two strides toward the door but then paused clutching his chest twisting slowly as he started to sink his eyes rolling up in his head his legs folded and he crashed to the floor kahlan sat stunned no one moved or said anything general meiffert went down on one knee beside the body checking prince harold for breath or pulse the general looked up at kahlan and shook his head she passed her gaze from zedd to adie to verna to warren none revealed anything in their expression kahlan stood and spoke softly i dont ever want to know which one of you did this im not saying you were wrong i just dont want to know the four gifted people nodded at the door kahlan stood in the bright sunlight a moment feeling the cold air on her face searching until she saw captain ryan leaning against a stout young maple tree he stood at attention as she strode out to him through the snow bradley did prince harold tell you why he was coming here calling him by his given name rather than his rank changed the nature of the question his rigid posture slackened yes mother confessor he said he had to tell you that he had been ordered back by his queen to defend galea and that he was further ordered to bring his men serving with you back to galea with him then what are you doing here why did you and your men come along if he was to take everyone back he lifted his square jaw and looked at her with clear blue eyes because we deserted mother confessor you what prince harold gave me his orders as i just reported them i told him that it was wrong and could only harm our people he said it was not for me to decide such things he said it was not for me to think but to follow orders ive fought with you mother confessor i believe i know you better than prince harold doesi know you are devoted to protecting the lives of the people of the midlands i told him that what cyrilla was doing was wrong he was angry and said it was my duty to follow my orders i told him that in that case i was deserting the galean army and was going to stand with you instead i thought he was going to have me put to death for disobeying him but he would have had to put all thousand of us to death because all the men felt the same way a good many came forward to tell him so the fire seemed to go out of him then and he let us ride down here with him i hope you arent angry with us mother confessor kahlan couldnt force herself to be the mother confessor at that moment she put her arms around him thank you bradley she gripped his shoulders and smiled at him through her watery vision you used your head i couldnt be angry with that you told us once we were a badger trying to swallow an ox whole looks to me youve taken to trying to do the same thing if there ever was a badger who could swallow an ox whole it would be you mother confessor but i guess we wouldnt want you to try it without us to help you do it they turned then and saw general meiffert directing some of his men they were carrying prince harolds limp body out of the lodge holding him by the shoulders and feet his hands dragged through the snow i figured this wasnt going to come to any good end the young captain said ever since cyrilla was hurt prince harold just never seemed himself i always loved the man it hurt me to have to desert him but he just wasnt making sense anymore kahlan put a comforting hand on his shoulder as they watched the body being carried away im sorry bradley like you i always thought highly of him i guess seeing his sister and his queen so long held in the grip of that kind of sickness just brought him to his wits end try to keep your good memories of him i will mother confessor kahlan changed the subject ill need one of your men to take a message to cyrilla i was going to have harold take it but now well need a messenger i will see to it mother confessor she only then realized how cold it was outside and that she didnt have a cloak as the captain went to get his men quartered and to pick out a man to act as a messenger kahlan went back inside the lodge cara was putting more wood on the hearth verna and adie had gone warren was selecting a rolled map from the basket of maps and diagrams in the corner as he was leaving kahlan caught warrens arm she looked into the wizards blue eyes knowing they were much older than they appeared richard had always said that warren was one of the smartest people he had ever met besides that warrens true talent was said to lie in the area of prophecy warren are we all going to die in this mad war his face softened with a shy but impish grin i thought you didnt believe in prophecy kahlan she released his arm i guess i dont never mind cara leaving to find some more firewood followed warren out kahlan warmed herself before the hearth as she stared at spirit standing on the mantel zedd rested a comforting hand on her shoulder what you had to say to harold about using your mind about reason was very wise kahlan you were right her fingers touched the buttery smooth walnut robes of spirit it was what richard said when he was telling me what he had finally come to understand about what he had to do he said the only sovereign he could allow to rule him was reason richard said that those were his very words kahlan nodded as she gazed at spirit he said the first law of reason is that what exists exists what is is and that from this irreducible bedrock principle all knowledge is built he said that was the foundation from which life is embraced he said thinking is a choice and that wishes and whims are not facts nor are they a means to discover them i guess harold proved the point richard said reason is our only way of grasping realitythat its our basic tool of survival we are free to evade the effort of thinkingto reject reasonbut we are not free to avoid the penalty of the abyss we refuse to see she listened to the fire crackling at her feet as she let her gaze wander over the lines of the figure he had carved for her when she heard nothing from zedd she looked over her shoulder he was staring into the flames a tear running down his cheek zedd whats wrong the boy figured it out himself the old wizards voice was the uneasy sum of loneliness and quiet pride he understands ithe interpreted it perfectly he even came to it on his own by applying it came to what the most important rule there is the wizards sixth rule the only sovereign you can allow to rule you is reason reflections of the firelight danced in his hazel eyes the sixth rule is the hub upon which all rules turn it is not only the most important rule but the simplest nonetheless it is the one most often ignored and violated and by far the most despised it must be wielded in spite of the ceaseless howling protests of the wicked misery iniquity and utter destruction lurk in the shadows outside its full light where halftruths snare the faithful disciples the deeply feeling believers the selfless followers faith and feelings are the warm marrow of evil unlike reason faith and feelings provide no boundary to limit any delusion any whim they are a virulent poison giving the numbing illusion of moral sanction to every depravity ever hatched faith and feelings are the darkness to reasons light reason is the very substance of truth itself the glory that is life is wholly embraced through reason through this rule in rejecting it in rejecting reason one embraces death by the next morning about half of the galean force had vanished returning to their homeland and queen as ordered by prince harold before his death the rest like captain ryan and his young soldiers remained loyal to the dharan empire lieutenant leiden the former general and his entire force of keltish troops had also departed by morning he left kahlan a letter in it saying that with galea choosing to break with the dharan empire he had to return to help protect kelton as surely the selfish actions of the galeans meant the order would be more likely to come up the kern river valley and threaten kelton he wrote that he hoped the mother confessor would realize how grave was the danger to kelton and understand that it was not his intention to desert her or the dharan empire but simply to help protect his people kahlan knew of the men leaving general meiffert and warren had come to tell her she had expected it and had been watching she told general meiffert to allow them to leave if they wished war in their camp could come to no good end the morale of the remaining men was boosted by a sense of being on the right side and of doing the right thing that afternoon as she was drafting an urgent letter to general baldwin commander of all keltish forces general meiffert and captain ryan came to see her after listening to their plan she granted captain ryan permission to go with a like number of general meifferts handpicked dharan special forces to conduct raids on the imperial order force warren and six sisters were sent to accompany them with the imperial order having moved so far back to the south kahlan needed information on what they were doing and what shape their force was in more than that though with the foul weather in their favor she wanted to keep pressure on the enemy captain bradley ryan and his band of nearly a thousand were experienced mountain fighters and had grown up in just such harsh conditions kahlan had fought beside the captain and his young galean soldiers and had helped train them in the ways of fighting a vastly superior force if only the enemy force did not number over a million general meifferts special forces which until kahlan had promoted him he had ably commanded were now led by captain zimmer a young square jawed bullnecked dharan with an infectious smile they were everything captain ryans young men were tripled experienced businesslike under stress tireless fearless and coolly efficient at killing what made most soldiers blanch made them grin they preferred fighting just such as this where they were free of massive battlefield tactics and could instead use their special skills they treasured being let off the leash to do what they did best rather than check them kahlan gave them a free hand each of those dharans collected enemy ears they felt a great fidelity to kahlan in part because she didnt try to rein them in and integrate them into the larger army and perhaps more so because when they returned from missions she always asked to see their strings of ears they relished being appreciated kahlan intended to later send them to collect galean ears chapter kahlan glanced over her shoulder at the prelate bent over the map basket in the corner it had been almost a full phase of the moon since warren had left on the mission with captains ryan and zimmer although it was difficult to judge accurately just how long such missions would last they should have been back by now kahlan knew all too well the kind of worry that had to be churning beneath the womans nononsense exterior verna kahlan asked as she rubbed her arms on your way past could you throw some more wood on the fire please cara hopped down off her stool where she was perched watching over kahlans shoulder ill do it verna pulled a map free and on her way back to the table thanked cara here it is zedd i think this better shows the area youre talking about zedd unfurled the new map over the top of the one already laid out on the table before kahlan it was a larger scale giving a more detailed look at the southern regions of the midlands yes zedd drawled as he peered at the new map see here he tapped the drun river see how narrow the lowlands are down south through here thats what i was talking about rough country with cliffs in places hemming the river thats why i dont think they would try to go up the drun valley i suppose youre right verna said besideskahlan waggled a finger over the area to the north on the first mapup this way is mostly only nicobarese they are rather isolated and so a tempting target but they arent a wealthy land the plunder and trade goods would be slim the order has much more opportunity for conquest if they stay over here besides can you see how difficult it would be for them to get their army back over the rangshada mountains if they went up the drun strategically it wouldnt make as much sense for them to go up that way verna idly twiddled with a button on her blue dress as she studied the map yes i see what you mean but your point is well taken kahlan said it wouldnt be a bad idea if you sent a sister or two to watch that area just because it doesnt make as much logistic sense that doesnt mean jagang wouldnt try it come spring hes bound to move on us we wouldnt want to be surprised to find the imperial order storming in the back door to aydindril cara answered the knock at the door it was a head scout named hayes kahlan stood when she saw through the open door and nearby trees that captain ryan was also making his way toward the lodge hayes saluted with a fist to his heart glad to see you back corporal hayes kahlan said thank you mother confessor its good to be back he looked like he could use a meal after captain ryan rushed in through the door cara pushed it shut against the blowing snow hayes stepped to the side out of the way of the captain kahlan was relieved to see the young galean officer how did everything go captain how is everyone he pulled off his scarf and wool hat as he caught his breath verna looked to be holding hers good the captain said we did well the sisters were able to heal some of our wounded some needed to be transported for a ways before the sisters could see to them that slowed us we had a few losses but not as many as we feared warren was a great help where is warren zedd asked as if bidden by his name warren came in through the door escorted by a swirling gust of snow kahlan squinted at the slash of bright light until the door was pushed shut once more she caught the look on vernas face and recalled how lighthearted she always felt to see richard back safely when they had been separated warren casually kissed verna on the cheek with a quick peck kahlan noticed the look they shared even if no one else did she was happy for them but still the reminder was like a jab at the pain of her helpless heartache and worry over richard did you tell them warren asked unbuttoning his cloak no captain ryan said we havent had a chance yet zedds brow drew down tell us what warren heaved a sigh well vernas special glass worked better than we thought it had we captured several men and questioned them at length the ones we saw dead in the valley were only the ones who died at first verna helped warren shed his heavy snowcrusted cloak she put it on the floor by the fire where captain ryan had laid his brown coat to dry it seems warren went on that there were a great manymaybe another sixty seventy thousandwho didnt go blind but who lost the sight in one eye or have impaired vision the order couldnt very well abandon them because they can still see well enough to stay with the rest but more important its hoped that maybe those men will heal and regain full use of their sightand their ability to fight not likely verna said i dont think so either warren said but thats what they are thinking anyway another goodly number maybe twenty five or thirty thousand are sicktheir eyes and noses red and horribly infected verna nodded the glass will do that then some more maybe half that number are having breathing difficulty so kahlan said with those killed and those injured enough to keep them from being effective fighters that makes somewhere near one hundred fifty thousand put out of the way by the glass dust quite an accomplishment verna verna looked as pleased as kahlan it was worth that horse ride scaring the wits out of me it wouldnt have worked had you not thought of doing it that way what kind of success did you have captain cara asked as she came to stand behind kahlan captain zimmer and i had the kind of success we hoped for id guess we took out maybe ten thousand in the time we were down there zedd let out a slow whistle pretty heavy fighting not really not the way the mother confessor taught us to do it and not the way captain zimmer works either mostly we eliminate the enemy as efficiently as possible and try to keep from having to fight at all if you slit a mans throat in his sleep you can accomplish a lot more and youre less likely to get hurt yourself kahlan smiled im glad you were such a good student captain ryan lifted a thumb warren and the sisters were a great help at getting us where we needed to be without being discovered any word about the white cloaks yet we could really use them i can tell you for a fact that they would have enabled us to do more we just got in our first load the day before yesterday kahlan told him more than enough for your men and captain zimmers well have more within a few days captain ryan rubbed his hands warming his fingers captain zimmer will be pleased zedd gestured to the south did you find out why they withdrew so far back over ground theyd taken warren nodded from the men we questioned we found out that they have fever going through their camp nothing we did just your regular fever that happens in such crowded camp conditions in the field but theyve lost tens of thousands of men to the fever they wanted to withdraw to put some distance between us give themselves some breathing room they arent concerned about being able to push us out of their way when they wish that made sense with their numbers it was only natural for them to be confident even cavalier about dealing with any opposition kahlan couldnt understand why warren and captain ryan looked so downhearted she sensed that despite their good news there was something amiss dear spirits kahlan said trying to give them some cheer their numbers are dwindling away like snow beside the hearth this is better than warren held up a hand i asked hayes here to come and give you his report firsthand i think you had better hear him out kahlan motioned the man to come forward he stepped smartly up to her table and snapped to attention lets hear what you have to report corporal hayes his face looked chalky and despite the cold he was sweating mother confessor my scout team was down to the southeast watching the routes in from the wilds and watching too in case the order tried to swing wide around us well i guess the short of it is we spotted a column making its way west to resupply and reinforce the order theyre a big army kahlan said they would have supplies sent from their homeland to augment what they can get as spoils a supply column would have men guarding them i followed them for a week just to get an accurate count how many kahlan asked well over a quarter million mother confessor kahlans flesh tingled as if icy needles were dancing over it how many verna asked at least two hundred and fifty thousand men at arms plus drivers and civilians with the supplies everything they had worked for all the sacrifices all the struggle to whittle down the imperial order had just been nullified worse than nullified their work had been erased and nearly that many more had been added to the force the enemy had started with dear spirits kahlan whispered how many men does the old world have to throw at us when she met warrens gaze she knew that this number even was hardly surprising to him warren gestured to the scout hayes saw only the first group the men we captured told us about the reinforcements we werent sure they were telling us the truthwe thought they might be trying to spook usbut then we met up with corporal hayes on his way back we did some further questioning and scoutingthats why we were delayed in returning another quarter million kahlans words trailed off it all seemed so hopeless warren cleared his throat that is just the first column of fresh troops more are coming kahlan went to the hearth and warmed her hands as she stared into the flames she was standing beneath the statue richard had carved for her to make her feel better kahlan wished that at that moment she could recall the defiant feeling spirit portrayed it felt as if she could only contemplate death the news of the imperial order reinforcements just as the news of departure of the galeans and keltans spread through the camp faster than a storm wind kahlan zedd warren verna adie general meiffert and all the rest of the officers held nothing back from the men those men were risking their lives daily and had a right to the truth if kahlan was passing through the camp and a soldier was brave enough to ask her she told him what she knew she tried to give them confidence too but she didnt lie to them the men having struggled for so long were beyond fear the bleak mood was a palpable pall smothering the spark of life out of them they went about their tasks as if numb accepting their fate which now seemed sealed resigned to the inevitable the new world offered no shelter no safe place nowhere to hide from the boundless menace of the imperial order kahlan showed the soldiers a determined face she had no choice captain ryan and his men having been through such despair before were less troubled by the news they couldnt die they were already dead along with kahlan the young galeans had long ago taken an oath of the dead and could only be returned to life when the order was destroyed none of it mattered much to captain zimmer and his men they knew what needed to be done and they simply kept at it each of them now had multiple strings of ears they began new strings at one hundred it was a matter of honor to them that they kept only the right ear so no two ears could be from the same man representative theriault of herjborgue was as good as his word the white wool cloaks hats and mittens arrived weekly helping hide the men who regularly went on missions while the weather was in their favor to attack the imperial order with the sickness in the orders camp leaving so many of them weak along with so many of the enemy having impaired vision those missions were extraordinarily successful troops wearing the concealing cloaks were also sent to lie in wait and intercept any supply trains hoping to neutralize the reinforcements before they could join with the enemys main force still the attacks were little more than an annoyance to the order kahlan after a meeting with a group just returned found zedd alone in the lodge looking over the latest information that had been added to the maps good fortune she said when he looked up watching as she removed her fur mantle the men who just got in had few casualties and they caught a large group out on patrol they were able to cut them off and take them all out including one of jagangs sisters then why the long face she could only lift her hands in a forsaken gesture of futility try not to be so disheartened zedd told her despair is often wars handmaiden i cant tell you how many years it was back when i was young that everyone fighting for their lives in that war back then thought that it was only a matter of time until we were crushed we went on to win i know zedd i know kahlan rubbed at the chill in her hands she almost hated to say it but she finally did richard wouldnt come to lead the army because he said that the way things stand now we cant win he said whether or not we fight the order the world will fall under its shadow and if we fight it will only result in more deaththat our side will be destroyed the order would still rule the world and any chance for winning in the future would be lost zedd peered at her with one eye then what are you doing here richard said we cant win but dear spirits i cant let myself believe that i would rather die fighting to be free to help keep my people free than to live the death of a slave yet i know im violating richards wishes his advice and his orders i gave him my word i feel as if im treading the quicksand of betrayal and taking everyone with me she searched his face for some sign that richard might have been wrong you said that he had figured out the wizards sixth rule on his ownthat we must use our minds to see the reality of the way things are i had hopes i thought he had to be wrong about the futility of this war but now zedd smiled to himself as if finding fancy in something she saw as only horrifying this is going to be a long war it is far from beyond hope much less decided this is the agony of leadership in such a strugglethe doubts the fears the feelings of hopelessness those are feelingsnot necessarily reality not yet we have much yet to bring to bear richard said what he believed based on the way matters stood at the time he said them who is to say that the people are not now prepared to prove themselves to him prove themselves ready to reject the order perhaps what richard needed in order for him to commit to the battle has already come about but i know how strongly he warned me against joining this battle he meant what he said still i dont have richards strength the strength to turn my back and let it happen kahlan gestured to her inkstand on the table ive sent letters asking that more troops be sent down here he smiled again as if to say that proved it could be done it will take continual effort to grind down the enemys numbers i think we have yet to deal the order a truly serious blow but we will the sisters and i will come up with something you never know in matters of this kind it could be that we will suddenly do something that will send them reeling kahlan smiled and rubbed his shoulder thanks zedd im so thankful to have you with us her gaze wandered to spirit standing proudly above the hearth she stepped over to the mantel as if to an altar that held the sacred carving dear spirits i miss him it was a question without the words hoping he would surprise her with something that he had thought of to help get richard back i know dear one i miss him too hes alivethats the most important thing kahlan could only nod zedd clapped his hands together as if taken with a gleeful thought what we need more than anything is something to get everyones mind off of the task at hand for a while something to give them a reason to cheer together for a while it would do them more good than anything kahlan frowned over her shoulder like what you mean some kind of game or something his face was all screwed up in musing i dont know something happy something to show them that the order cant stop us from living our lives cant stop us from the enjoyment of lifeof what life is really all about he stroked a thumb along the sharp line of his jaw any ideas well i cant really think of just then warren strode in just got a report from over in the drun valley our lucky dayno activity as we expected he stopped dead in his tracks his hand still holding the door lever looking from kahlan to zedd and back again whats the matter whats going on why are you two looking at me like that verna came up behind warren and gave him a shove into the lodge go on go on get in there close the door whats the matter with you its freezing out there verna huffed and shut the door herself when she turned around and saw zedd and kahlan she backed a step vema warren zedd said in a honeyed voice come on in wont you verna scowled what are you two scheming and grinning at well zedd drawled as he winked at kahlan the mother confessor and i were just discussing the big event vernas scowl darkened as she leaned in what big event ive heard nothing about any big event even warren rarely given to scowling was scowling now thats right what big event your wedding zedd said both verna and warrens scowls evaporated as they straightened they were overcome with surprised silly radiant grins really warren asked really verna asked yes really kahlan said chapter it took more than two weeks to prepare for verna and warrens wedding it wasnt that it couldnt have been done more quickly but rather as zedd had explained to kahlan he wantedto drag out the whole affair he wanted to give everyone ample time to ponder it and to dream up lavish doings time to organize to make decorations to cook special foods to get the camp ready for a grand party time to have a stretch where everyone could gossip about it as they eagerly looked forward to the big event the soldiers at first merely pleased soon got caught up in the spirit of the occasion it became a grand diversion they all liked warren he was the sort of man that everyone felt a little sorry for a bit protective ofthe awkward shy type most didnt have the foggiest understanding of many of the things he babbled about they thought that he just wasnt the type who would ever win a woman that he had to them seemingly against all odds gave the men an inner pride that he was one of theirs and he had done it hed won a womans heart it gave them hope that they might one day have a wedding a wife and a family even if they were afraid that they too were often awkward and shy the men even openly expressed happiness for verna she was a woman they respected but had never exactly felt warmly toward their bold wellwishes flummoxed her the entire camp was caught up in the spirit of the event even more than kahlan had hoped after a brief pause in the beginning while it sank in the men so weary not only of fighting against such odds the loss of friends and being in the field away from their homes and loved ones for so long but also the harsh difficult dreary weather took to the diversion with gusto a large central area was clearedtents moved and the area cleaned of snow down to the bare ground at the head of the cleared area they built a platformlaid across anchored supply wagonsatop which the wedding was to take place the platform was needed so that the men would have a better chance to see the ceremony a dance area was set aside and those men with musical instruments and not out on duty spent night and day practicing a choir was formed and went off to a secluded ravine to rehearse wherever kahlan went she could hear pipes and drums or the piercing notes of a shawm or the melodic chords of strings men came to fear playing offkey more than they feared the imperial order with over a hundred sisters available it was suggested that there could be dancing after the ceremony the sisters liked the idea until they started doing the math and realized how many men there were to each woman and how much dancing they would be doing still they were titillated at the prospect of having attention lavished on them at a dance and approved the idea women centuries old were blushing like girls again at all the requests from men in their teens and twenties for the promise of a turn with them at the wedding dance as the wedding approached the men made streets of sorts in a winding course through the camp so that after the ceremony the wedding party could pass in review through the entire camp all the men wanted a chance to be a part in greeting the newly married couple and wishing them well kahlan had the idea that after the wedding warren and verna should have the lodge it was to be her wedding gift to them so for the most part she kept it a secret kahlan had cara direct the public pretense of having a tent set aside and reserved for the newly married couple cara moved vernas things in the tent and freshened it up with herbs and frozen sprigs with wild berries the diversion worked verna believed the tent was to be hers and warrens and wouldnt let him into it until after they were married the day of the wedding dawned with sparkling blue skies and wasnt so cold that people were likely to get frostbite the fresh snow of the day before was quickly cleared out of the central area so that the festivities could take place without the sisters getting snow down their boots as they danced some of the sisters came out to inspect the dance floor sauntering around giving the men a look at who they might get to have a turn withif they were lucky it was all done with much humor and good cheer while verna spent the early afternoon in her tent submitting to having her hair fussed over her face painted and her wedding dress tended to by a gaggle of sisters kahlan was finally able to have the secrecy she needed in order to decorate the lodge inside she secured fragrant feathery balsam boughs to a cord and draped it in swags around the top of every wall she tied red berriesas that was all she could come byinto the boughs to give them some color one of the sisters had given kahlan some plain weave fabric that kahlan had made into a curtain for the window she had worked on it when she retired to the lodge at night stitching designs to give the simple material a lacy look she kept it under her bed so that when they came in to go over battlefield strategy verna and warren wouldnt know what she was doing kahlan was finally able to put the scented candles donated by different sisters as gifts all around the room and at last hang the curtain on a straight limb she stripped of bark the one thing kahlan wouldnt leave to brighten the lodge for the newly wedded couple was spirit that she would take to her new tent as kahlan was making up the bed with fresh bedding cara came in with an armload of something blue kahlan folded the blanket under the foot of the strawfilled mattress as she watched cara shut the door what have you got there you wont believe it cara said with a grin wide blue silk ribbon the sisters have verna tied to a chair while theyre fussing over her and zedd has warren off doing something so i thought you and i could use the ribbon to decorate the place a little drape it around make it look pretty she pointed like up therewe could wind it around the balsam you hung to give it a fancy look kahlan blinked in surprise what a good idea she didnt know what was more astonishing actually seeing cara with blue silk ribbon or hearing her say decorate and pretty in the same breath she smiled to herself happy to have heard such a thing zedd was more of a wizard than he knew kahlan and cara each stood on a log round working their way along the wall as they wove the ribbon through and around the swagged balsam boughs it was so beautiful seeing the first wall completed that kahlan couldnt stop gazing and grinning they started in on the second wall opposite the door using extra ribbon for best effect when verna and warren first entered and saw their new place where did you ever get all this ribbon away kahlan asked around a mouthful of pins benjamin got it for me cara chuckled as she threaded the ribbon around the cord can you believe it he made me promise not to ask him where he got it from kahlan took the pins from her mouth who who what cara mumbled before she stuck her tongue out the corner of her mouth while wiggling a pin into a tight place who did you say got you the ribbon cara lifted another length of blue silk to the ceiling general meiffert i dont have a clue where he you said benjamin cara lowered the ribbon and stared at kahlan no i didnt yes you did you said benjamin i said general meiffert you only thought i never knew that general meifferts first name was benjamin well is benjamin general meifferts first name had cara been wearing her red leather her face would have matched it as it was her dark scowl matched the brown leather she had on you know it is a smile grew on kahlans lips i do now kahlan wore her white mother confessors dress she was a bit surprised to notice that it fit a little loosely but all things considered she supposed it was to be expected because of the cold she also wore the wolf fur mantle richard had made for her but draped it around her shoulders more like a stole she stood with her back straight and chin held high overseeing the ceremony and gazing out at the tens of thousands of quiet faces behind her was a rich verdant wall of woven boughs that enabled distant spectators to more easily pick out the six people up on the platform an ethereal mist of silent breath lifted in the still golden lateafternoon air as he conducted the wedding ceremony zedds back was to her kahlan was fascinated to see his wavy white hair perpetually in disarray now brushed and smoothed down he wore his fine maroon robes with black sleeves and cowled shoulders silver brocade circled the cuffs while gold brocade ran around the neck and down the front a red satin belt set with a gold buckle gathered the outfit at his waist adie stood beside him wearing her simple sorceresss robes with their yellow and red beads at the neckline somehow the contrast looked as grand verna wore a rich violet dress done up with gold stitching at the square neckline the intricate gold needlework ran down the tight sleeves showing under slashed sham sleeves tied at the elbow with gold ribbon the delicate smocking over the midriff extending in a funnel shape down into a gored skirt flaring nearly to the floor vemas wavy brown hair was festooned with blue gold and crimson flowers the sisters had made from little pieces of silk with her serene smile she made a beautiful sorceress bride standing beside the handsome blond groom in his violet wizards robes everyone seemed to lean in a little as the ceremony reached the climax do you vema take this wizard to be your husband for life zedd went on in a clear tone that carried out over the crowd mindful of his gift and duty to it and swear to both love and honor him without pause for as long as you live i do vema said in a silken voice do you warren adie said her voice all the more raspy in contrast to vemas take this sorceress to be your wife for life mindful of her gift and duty to it and swear to both love and honor her without pause for as long as you live i do warren said in a confident tone then it being of your free will i accept you sorceress as being agreeable and give my joyful blessing to this union zedd raised outstretched arms up into the air i ask the good spirits to smile on this womans oath then it being of your free will i accept you wizard as being agreeable and give my joyful blessing to this union adie raised outstretched arms up into the air i ask the good spirits to smile on this mans oath the four of them crossed their arms and joined hands with heads bowed the air in the center of their circle glowed with a living light shining on the union the brilliant flare sent a golden ray skyward as if carrying the oath to the good spirits together zedd and adie said from this time forward you are forever joined as husband and wife both by oath by love and now by gift the magical light dissolved from the bottom up until it was but a solitary star directly above them in an empty lateafternoon sky in the silent winter air tens of thousands of spellbound eyes watched a trembling vema meet warrens kiss to seal a wedding unlike any they were likely to ever see again the marriage of a sorceress and a wizard bound by more than any mere oathbound also by a covenant of magic when vema and warren parted both wearing broad smiles the crowd went wild cheers along with hats rose into the air both beaming vema and warren joined hands after they tumed to the soldiers they waved with their free arms high in the air soldiers cheered applauded and whistled as if it were their own sister or best friend who was just married the voices of the choir then built in an extended note that reverberated through the trees all around it made kahlans skin tingle with the quality of its haunting tone the sound brought a reverent hush to the valley cara leaned close to kahlan and whispered in astonishment that the choir was singing an ancient dharan wedding ceremonial song the origin of which went back thousands of years since the men had gone off to practice alone kahlan hadnt heard it before the wedding it was so powerful it swept her emotions away with the rise and fall of the joined voices vema and warren stood on the edge of the platform likewise gripped by the achingly beautiful song to their union flutes joined in and then drums the soldiers mostly dharan smiled as they listened to the music they knew well it struck kahlan then since she had so long thought of dhara as an enemy land that she had never really thought of dharans as having traditions that could be meaningful or stirring or beloved kahlan glanced over at cara standing beside her smiling distantly as she listened to the music there was an entire land of dhara that was largely a mystery to kahlan she had only seen their soldiers she knew nothing of their women other than the mordsith and they were hardly typicalor their children or their homes or their customs she had come to think of them as joined together at last but she now realized that they were a people she didnt know a people with their own heritage its beautiful kahlan whispered to cara cara nodded blissfully carried away on the strains of music that was an old acquaintance to her and a exotic wonder to kahlan as the choir came to the end of their tribute to the newly wedded couple verna reached back and squeezed kahlans hand it was an apology of sortsan acknowledgment of how difficult this ceremony must be for kahlan refusing to let that hurt tarnish this joyous event kahlan beamed at vernas quick glance she came forward standing behind warren and verna with an arm around each the noise of the crowd trailed off so kahlan could speak these two people belong together perhaps they always have now they forever shall be may the good spirits be with them always with one voice the entire crowd repeated the prayer i want to thank verna and warren from the bottom of my heart kahlan said as she gazed out at the tens of thousands of faces watching for reminding us what life is really about there is no more eloquent demonstration of the simple yet deep meaning of our cause than this wedding today heads as far as she could see bobbed in agreement now kahlan called out who wants to see these two have the first dance the men cheered and hooted as they spread back to open up the central area musicians lined up along the benches at the sides as they waited for verna and warren to make their way down to the dance area kahlan draped an arm over zedds shoulder and kissed his cheek this is the best idea you ever had wizard he took her in with hazel eyes that seemed to see all the way to a persons soul are you all right dear one i know this has to be hard kahlan nodded holding her grin firmly in place im fine it has to be hard on you twice over a smile took him unexpectedly there you go again mother confessor worrying about others kahlan watched a laughing verna and warren arm in arm dancing lightly across the open area ringed by applauding soldiers when theyre done kahlan asked and after youve given your first to adie would you dance with me sir stand in for him im sure he would want that kahlan couldnt bring herself to say his name at that moment or the spell of the joyful celebration would have been broken zedd lifted an eyebrow with playful delight what makes you think i can dance kahlan laughed because there isnt anything you cant do i be able to name a number of things this skinny old man cant do adie said with a smile as she shuffled up behind him when the dance was done and others began joining in as the newly married couple began the second zedd and adie went out in the ring to have a dance and show the young people how it was done kahlan stood at the edge of the circle with cara close at her side general meiffert laughing and shaking mens hands slapping others on the back made his way over mother confessor he was pushed up close by the press of the crowd mother confessor this is a wonderful day isnt it have you ever seen the likes of it kahlan couldnt help but to smile at his delight no general meiffert i dont think i have he glanced briefly at cara he stood awkwardly a moment then turned to watch the dancing despite how well the men had come to know her kahlan was still a confessora woman people feared to be near much less touch no one was likely to ask a confessor to dance or a mordsith general kahlan asked tapping him on the back of his shoulder general could you do me a great personal favor well of course mother confessor he stammered anything what is it i can do kahlan gestured out at the dance area and the soldiers and sisters ringing it would you please dance i know were supposed to be on guard for any mischief but i think it would let the men see the true festive nature of this party were their general to go out there and dance dance yes please but ithat is i dont know how oh do please stop trying to get out of it kahlan turned as if suddenly struck with a thought cara would you go out there with him and dance so his men will see that its all right to join in caras blue eyes shifted between kahlan and the general well i dont see how do it for me please cara kahlan turned back to the general i believe i heard someone mention that your given name is benjamin he scratched his temple thats right mother confessor kahlan turned back to cara cara benjamin here needs apartner for a dance how about you please do it for me cara cleared her throat well all right for you then mother confessor and dont break his ribs or anything we have need of his talents cara scowled back over her shoulder as a smiling benjamin led her away kahlan folded her arms and grinned as she watched the man take cara in his arms it was just about a perfect day just about kahlan was watching benjamin gracefully swirl cara around and other soldiers pulling suddenly shy sisters out of the line at the edge of the dance area when captain ryan stumbled up he straightened before her mother confessor uh well weve been through a lot together and if im not being too forward could i ask you to you know dance kahlan blinked in surprise at the tall young broad galean why yes bradley i would love to dance with you i would love it but only if you promise not to hold me like im made of glass i dont want to look foolish out there he grinned and nodded all right she placed one hand in his and laid the other over his shoulder he put his big hand to the side of her waist under her open fur mantle and twirled her out amid the merrymakers kahlan smiled and laughed as she endured it she thought of spirit and willed herself to remember that kind of strength and she was able to relax and take the party for what it was and not think about what was missing as another man held her in his arms if timidly bradley youre a wonderful dancer pride shined in his eyes she felt him loosen up and let the music flow more smoothly through his movements kahlan caught sight of cara and benjamin not far away doing their best to dance and not look at each other when he whirled her around him his arm securely holding her waist caras long blond braid sailed out behind her then kahlan actually saw cara look up into benjamins blue eyes and smile kahlan was relieved when the song ended and captain ryan was replaced for the next dance by zedd she held him close as she moved to a slower tune with him im proud of you mother confessor you gave a wonderful thing to these men and what is that your heart he tilted his head see them watching you youve given them courage youve given them a reason to believe in what theyre doing kahlan lifted an eyebrow you trickster you you may fool others but not me it is you who has given me heart zedd only smiled you know not since the very first confessor has a man ever again figured out how to love such a woman without her power destroying him im glad it was my grandson who accomplished such an exploit and that it was for his love of you i love you as a granddaughter kahlan and look forward to the day when you are back with my grandson kahlan held zedd close resting her head against his shoulder as they both danced on with their memories as the dancing went on the golden setting sun was finally replaced by torches and warm fires sisters changed partners after each dance and still there were jovial men lined up out of sight waiting a turn and not just with the younger more attractive sisters cooks helpers set out simple fare on food tables sampling some and joking with the soldiers as they went about their task between dances warren and verna tried the variety of food from different tables kahlan danced once more with captain ryan and once more with zedd but then busied herself speaking to officers and soldiers alike so she wouldnt have to dance with anyone should anyone feel awkward about asking her yet work up the nerve she was more able to enjoy the festivities without having to dance as she was greeting a line of young officers and they were telling her how much they appreciated the party someone tapped kahlan on the shoulder she turned to a smiling warren mother confessor i would be honored were you to have a dance with me kahlan noticed verna dancing with zedd this was one dance that would be different warren i would love to dance with the handsome groom he moved smoothly with her not at all haltingly as she had expected he seemed to be blissfully at peace and not nervous about the crush of people or the men constantly clapping him on the back or the joking remarks from some of the sisters mother confessor i just wanted to thank you for making this the best day ive ever had kahlan smiled up into his young face his ageless eyes warren thank you for agreeing to this big party i know its not the sort of thing that fits you oh but it is thats just it people used to call me the mole they did why because i used to stay down in the vaults all the time studying the prophecies it wasnt just that i liked to study the booksi was afraid to come out but you finally did he turned her in time with the sweep of music richard brought me out he did i never knew that in a way youve helped add to what he started warren smiled distantly i just wanted to thank you i know how much i miss him and how much verna misses him i know the men miss their lord rahl kahlan was only able to nod and i know how much you miss your husband thats why i wanted to thank youfor giving us this and the gift of your grace despite your heartache everyone here feels it with you please know that while you miss him you are not alone and are among those who love him too kahlan smiled and managed to get out a thank you as they danced across the open area laughing at the merry tune and the awkward steps of some of the soldiers the music abruptly trailed off it was then that she heard the horns alarm swept through the assembled soldiers as men ran for their weapons until one of the sentries sprinted in waving his arm calling out for everyone to stand down that it was friendly forces puzzled kahlan stretched her neck along with everyone else trying to see they had no forces out she had let them all be present to enjoy the wedding party the crowd parted as horses trotted through the throng kahlans eyebrows went up and her jaw dropped the distinguished general baldwin commander of all keltish forces was at the fore riding a handsome chestnut gelding he brought the horse to a smart halt he ran his first finger along the length of his whiteflecked dark mustache as he took in the crowd gathered in around him his graying black hair grew down over his ears and his pate shone through on top he was a striking figure in his serge cape fastened on one shoulder with two buttons allowing it to show the rich green silk lining his tan surcoat was decorated with a heraldic emblem slashed through with a diagonal black line dividing a yellow and blue shield the mans high boots were rolled down below his knees long black gauntlets their flared cuffs lying over the front were tucked behind a wide belt set with an ornate buckle the press of men made way for kahlan to step through general he lifted a hand in his noble manner a smile spreading wide mother confessor how good to see you kahlan started to speak but horses charged through the crowd falling back for them they stormed into the dance area like a windborne firea dozen mordsith in red leather one of the women leaped from her horse rikka cara called out the womans bold glare swept over the gathered people she finally settled her gaze taking in cara cara moved out of general meifferts arms cara she said as way of greeting she glanced around where is hania cara stepped closer hania shes not here the woman pressed her lips together in bitter disappointment i thought as much when i never received word back i feared we had lost her still i was hoping kahlan stepped forward a little miffed that the woman saw fit to step in front of general baldwin rikka is it ah rikka said a knowing smile stealing onto her face you could be none other than lord rahls wifethe mother confessor i recognize the description the woman saluted casually with a fist to her heart yes i am rikka im glad to have you here and your sisters of the agiel i came from aydindril as soon as berdine received your letter it explained a lot she and i discussed it and decided i should come with some of my sisters to help in our effort i left six sister mordsith with berdine to watch over aydindril and the wizards keep i also brought twenty thousand troops she lifted a thumb pointing with it behind her we met up with the general here a week back we can certainly use your help that was wise of berdinei know how eager she was to come herself but she knows the city and the keep im glad she followed my instructions kahlan settled her most unsettling motherconfessorgaze on rikka now if you dont mind you interrupted general baldwin cara shoved rikka pushing her back out of the way we need to talk rikka before youre up to the task of serving lord rahl and his wife who just happens to be a sister of the agiel rikka lifted and eyebrow in surprise really how could later cara said with a smile before rikka could get herself into any more trouble moving the woman and her sister mordsith back zedd adie and verna eased closer to kahlan general baldwin now off his horse stepped forward at last and went to a knee in a bow my queen mother confessor rise my child kahlan said in formal answer as the camp looked on with the same rapt attention they had devoted to the wedding this had important bearing on them too the general rose to his feet i came as soon as i received your letter mother confessor how many men did you bring he looked surprised by the question why all of them one hundred seventy thousand men when my queen asks for an army i bring her one whispers spread through the men as they passed word back kahlan was stunned she no longer even felt the cold thats wonderful general they are sorely needed we have a real fight on our hands as i explained in my letter the imperial order is getting reinforcements all the time we need to cut those lines i understand with the dharans from aydindril come with us we can just about triple the size of your force down here and we can still bring more in from dhara general meiffert said kahlan felt the hot spark of faith in their chances swelling within her breast by spring for sure we will need them she cocked her head at general baldwin what about lieutenant leiden who oh you must mean sergeant leiden he only has a scout patrol now when a man deserts his queen hes lucky to keep his head but he acted to protect her people so i sent him to guard some remote pass i hope the man dresses warmly kahlan wanted to throw her arms around the dashing general baldwin instead she touched her fingers to his arm in a gesture of her gratitude thank you general we surely need the men well theyre up country a little ways half a day back couldnt fit them all in here with your army thats fine kahlan waggled her fingers calling the mordsith forward im very glad to see you too rikka with mordsith we can better handle the enemy gifted we may even be able to turn the tide cara here has helped eliminate some of the gifted already but im afraid that lord rahl has her under orders to protect me she will continue in that capacity but you will be free to go after their gifted rikka bowed love to she came up and smiled berdine warned me about her she said under her breath to cara you should listen to berdine cara said clapping her on the back come ill help you find some quarters no kahlan said stopping them in their tracks this is a party the general rikka and her sisters are invited in fact i insist well rikka said brightening as long as were protecting lord rahls wife we would be only to happy to stay kahlan took rikkas arm and pulled her close rikka we have a lot of men here and few women this is a dance get out there and dance what are you out of your kahlan shoved her out into the dance area she snapped her fingers at the musicians shall we resume she turned to general baldwin general you have come at a wonderful time a time of celebration please would you dance with me mother confessor i am your queen also generals dance with queens do they not he smiled and offered his arm of course they do my queen long after it was dark the wedding procession made its way through the makeshift streets greeting all the men thousands of soldiers congratulated warren and verna on their marriage offered jesting advice a gentle slap on the back or just a merry wave kahlan recalled a time when the midlands feared these men under darken rahl they were a formidable invader inspiring dread and terror she was amazed at how civil these men could be how human when given a chance it was richard really who had given them that chance she knew that many of them understood that and appreciated it when finally they reached the end of the long winding walk through the sprawling camp they came at last to the tent verna and warren thought was to be theirs those following along bid the couple a good night and wandered back to the party leaving the three of them alone rather than let verna and warren slow kahlan stepped between them took each under an arm and guided them onto the path among the towering trees moonlight through the boughs cast wavering patterns on the snow not knowing what she was up to neither verna nor warren protested as kahlan kept them moving finally kahlan spotted the lodge off through the trees she stopped a little distance away to let them see the candlelight coming from behind the lacelike curtain the juxtaposition against life in an army camp made it looked all the more romantic this is a long and difficult struggle kahlan told them starting a marriage under these conditions is a harsh burden i cant tell you how happy i am that you two chose to go forward with it at a time like this it means a great deal to all of us were all very happy for you more than anything i would like to thank you both for choosing life in all its glory we will one day have to move on as surely the order will move again when spring comes if not before but for now i want this place to be yours i can give you at least this much this little piece of a normal life together verna unexpectedly burst into tears and buried her face in kahlans shoulder kahlan patted the prelates heaving back chuckling at how out of character it was for verna to show such emotion not a good idea verna to let your new husband see you cry just as hes about to take you to his bed that did it and verna laughed too she gripped kahlans shoulders as she searched her eyes i dont know what to say kahlan kissed her cheek love each another be good to each other and treasure being togetherthats what i would like more than anything warren hugged her whispering his thanks in her ear kahlan watched as he led verna the remaining distance to the lodge at the door both turned and waved at the last moment warren swept verna off her feet her lilting laugh drifted among the trees as he carried her through the doorway alone kahlan turned back to the camp chapter the door opened a crack one bloodshot eye peered out into the dingy hall you have a room my wife and i are looking for a room before the man could close the door richard quickly added we were told you had one what of it despite it being selfevident richard answered politely weve no place to stay why bring your problems to me richard could hear angry words going back and forth between a man and woman upstairs behind several of the doors in the hall babies wailed without pause the heavy odor of rancid oil hung in the dank air out the door at the back standing open to the narrow alley young children being chased by older children squealed as they ran through the cold rain richard spoke without expectation into the narrow slit we need a room a dog not far up the alleyway barked with monotonous persistence lots of people need a room i only have one i cant give it to you nicci eased richard aside and put her face close to the crack we have the money for the first week she shoved her hand against the door when he started to shut it its a public room your duty is to help the public get rooms the man shouldered his weight into the door shutting it in her face richard turned away as nicci began knocking forget it he said lets go get a loaf of bread nicci usually followed his lead without admonishment challenge or even comment but this time instead of minding him she rapped persistently on the door layers of peeling paint every color from blue to yellow to red fell from under her knuckles its your duty nicci called to the closed door youve no right to turn us away no answer came were going to report you the door opened a crack again the eye glared out with menace has he a job no but you go away the both of your ill report you for what might i ask look lady i got a room but i got to keep it for people at the top of the list how do you know were not at the top of the list because if you were you would have said so first off and showed me the approval you got with a seal on it people at the head of the list have been waiting a long time for a place youre no better than a thief trying to take the place of a good citizen whos followed the law now go away or i will take down your names for the lodging inspector the door slammed shut again the threat of having their names taken down appeared to take some of the fight out of nicci she huffed a sigh as they walked away the bowed floor creaking and groaning underfoot at least they had been able to get in out of the rain for a brief time we will have to keep looking she told him if you had a job first it would probably help maybe tomorrow you can look for a job while i keep looking for a room out in the cold rain once more they crossed the muddy street to the cobbled walkway on the other side there were yet more places to check though richard didnt hold out any hope of getting a room theyd had doors shut in their faces more times than he could count nicci wanted a room though so they kept looking the weather was unusually cold for this far south in the old world nicci had told him people said the cold spell and rain would soon pass a few days before it had been muggy and warm so richard had no reason to doubt their judgment it was disorienting for him to see woods and fields of lush green vegetation in the dead of winter there were some trees with limbs bare for the season but most were in full leaf as far south as they were in the old world it never got cold enough for water to freeze people only blinked dumbly when he spoke of snow when richard explained snow as flakes of frozen white water that fell from the sky and covered the ground with a cottony blanket some people turned huffy thinking he was making a joke at their expense he knew that back home winter would be raging despite the turmoil around him richard felt an inner tranquillity knowing that kahlan was most likely to be warm and snug in the house he had built in that light nothing in his new life was of enough importance to distress him she had food to eat firewood to keep her warm and cara for company for now she was safe winter was wearing on and in spring she would be able to leave but for now richard was confident that she was safe that and his thoughts and memories of her were his only solace people without rooms huddled in the alleyways using whatever scrap of solid material they could find to prop up over themselves for a roof walls were fashioned from sodden blankets he supposed that he and nicci could continue to do the same but he feared nicci falling ill in the cold and wetfeared that then kahlan too would fall ill nicci checked the paper she carried these places on this register they gave us are all supposed to be available for people newly arrivednot just for people on a list they need workers they should be more diligent in seeing to it that places are available do you see richard do you see how hard it is for ordinary people to get along in life richard hands shoved in his pockets shoulders hunched against the wind and rain asked so how do we get on a list we will have to go to a lodging office and request a room they can put us on a housing list it sounded simple but matters were proving far more complex than they sounded if there arent enough rooms how will being on a list get us a place to stay people die all the time theres work here thats why we camethats why everyone else has come ill work hard and then we can afford to pay more we still have a little money we just need to find a place that wants to rent a room for the right pricewithout all this list foolishness really richard are you that inhumane how would those less fortunate ever get rooms then the order sets the prices to stop profiteers they make sure there is no favoritism that makes it fair for all we just need to get on a list for a room and then everything will be fine watching the glistening cobbles before him as he walked richard wondered how long they would be without a place until their name worked its way to the top of a list it looked to him as if a lot of people would need to die before his and niccis names came up for a roomwith more yet waiting in turn for them to die he stepped first to one side and then the other to avoid bumping into the river of people swirling past making their way in the opposite direction while trying to stay out of the mud of the street he considered again staying outside the citya lot of people did that but there were outlaws and desperate people aplenty who preyed on those who were forced to stay out in the open where there were no city guards were nicci not opposed to the idea richard would have found a place farther out and built a shelter perhaps with some other people so that they could together discourage trouble nicci wasnt interested in the idea nicci wanted to be in the city multitudes came to the city looking for a better life there were lists to get on and lines to wait in to see official people you had a better chance of doing those things if you had a room in the city she said it was getting late in the day the line at the bakery was out the door and partway down the block why are all these people in line richard whispered to nicci it was the same every day when they went to buy bread she shrugged i guess there arent enough bakeries seems like with all the customers more people would want to open bakeries nicci leaned close a scolding scowl darkening her brow the world isnt as simple as you would like it to be richard it used to be that way in the old world mans evil nature was allowed to flourish people set their own prices for goodswith greed being their only interest not the good of their fellow man only the welltodo could afford to buy bread now the order sees to it that everyone gets needed goods for a fair price the order cares about everyone not just those with unfair advantages she always seemed so impassioned when she spoke about the evil nature of people richard wondered why a sister of the dark would care about evil but he didnt bother to ask the line wasnt moving very fast the woman in front of him suspicious of their whispering scowled back over her shoulder richard met her glare with a broad smile good afternoon maam her somber scowl faltered in the light of his beaming grin were new in townhe gestured behindmy wife and i im looking for work we need a room though would you know how a young couple strangers to the city could go about getting a room she half turned holding her canvas bag in both hands letting it pull her arms straight as she leaned her shoulders against the wall her bag held only a yellow wedge of cheese richards smile and his friendly conversational toneartificial though they werewere apparently so out of the ordinary that she seemed unable to maintain her gruff demeanor you have to have a job if you hope to get a room there arent enough rooms in the city what with all the new workers come for the abundance provided by the wisdom of the order if youre ablebodied you need to have work then theyll put your name on the list richard scratched his head and kept smiling as the line slowly shuffled along im eager to work easier to get a room if you cant work the woman confided but i thought you just said you had to have a job if you were to have any hope of getting a room thats true if youre able like you look to be those folks with a greater need because they cant do for themselves are rightly entitled to benevolence and to be put higher on the listlike my husband the poor man hes afflicted terrible like with consumption im so sorry richard said she nodded with the weight of her burden its mankinds wretched lot to suffer nothing can be done about it so theres no use trying only in the next life will we get our reward in this life its the duty of every person with ability to help those unfortunate souls with needs in that way the able earn their reward in the next life richard didnt argue she shook a finger at him those who can work owe it to those who cant to do their best for the good of all i can work richard assured her were from a little place were simple folksfrom farming stock we dont know much about how to go about things like getting work in the city the order has brought the people a great abundance of work a man behind nicci said drawing richards attention the mans oiled canvas coat was buttoned tight at his throat his big brown eyes blinked slowly like a cow as it chewed its cud the way his jaw wobbled sideways as he spoke only added to the impression the order welcomes all workers to our struggle but you must be mindful of the needs of othersas the creator himself wishesand go about getting work in the proper fashion richard his stomach grumbling with hunger listened as the man explained you first need to belong to a citizen workers group they protect the rights of citizens of the order youll have to go before a review assembly for approval to join the workers group and a fitness panel to hear from a spokesman from the workers citizen group who can vouch for you you must do this before you can go for a job why cant i just go to a place and show myself why cant they hire me if i fit their needs just because youre from the country that doesnt mean you shouldnt be mindful of contributing toward the greater good of the order of course not richard said ive always worked for myself through farming to bring food to my fellow man as is our duty i dont know how businesses do things the big brown eyes paused their blinking the man peered suspiciously for a moment then his eyes finally went moony again his jaw resumed its wobbling as he chewed his words its the primary responsibility of business to be sensitive to the needs of the people to contribute to the public welfare to be equitable the review board helps see to this there is much more involved than the narrow goals of businesses i see richard said well id be grateful if you could tell me how to go about it properly he glanced briefly at nicci i want to be a good citizen and do things right by the mans pride in the explanation and the way his big eyes blinked faster as he laid it all out richard expected that the man was somehow involved in the labyrinthine process richard didnt ask how you got a spokesman from the citizen workers group to vouch for you the line inched forward as the man explained the finer details of different sorts of work what each required and how it was all for the benefit of those living within the order and under the grace of the creator as he droned on delivering his information with smug satisfaction nicci watched richard discreetly and without comment as he listened to the procedures she looked as if she was expecting him to suddenly turn from polite to deadly richard knew there could be no point to a battle with this man so he remained polite it turned out that the man named mr gudgeons seemed to know the most about the quarry workers since richard knew little about quarries he passed the time as they stood in line by asking a few questions that pleased mr gudgeons to answerat great length the store ran out of bread and closed before they got any the line of people dissolved into the downpour mumbling to one another as they went about their woeful lot in life richard thanked the woman and mr gudgeons before he and nicci moved on richard paused at a cross street while nicci studied her paper with the list of rooms all around the blocky shapes of buildings rose out of the gloom red paint on the side of one brick building was so faded that it left the figure painted there looking like a blushing ghost the faded whitewash of words beneath the vanishing man were no longer legible passing men gazed at nicci in her wet clinging clothes never seeing her face her hair was plastered to her skull her jaw quivered and her hands trembled yet she didnt complain about the cold as did everyone else they had been told that they couldnt get another list with any new rooms that might have recently become available until the next day so nicci was trying to keep this one whole but in the rain it was a losing battle mangy horses slogged through the mud some of the wagons they pulled squeaking and groaning under the weight of a load only the main thoroughfares like the one they were on were wide enough to allow teams of horses and fullsize wagons to easily pass in both directions some streets were only wide enough for wagons to go in one direction some of those with no room to pull aside were choked off by brokendown wagons richard saw a dead horse in one narrow street the rotting animal attended by a cloud of flies still hitched to its wagon as it awaited someone to come haul it away the blocked streets only added to the congestion of the others some streets were wide enough only for handcarts in many of the narrower passageways only foot traffic could fit the smell of garbage and the stench of streets that also functioned as open sewers had been enough to gag richard for the first week until hed become numb to it the alleyways where he and nicci had slept were the worst the rain only served to flush the filth out of every hole and carry it out into the open but at least as long as he was standing it washed off some of the dirt all the cities richard had seen after theyd entered the old world and traveled south from tanimura were similar to this one all suffering under grinding poverty and inhuman conditions everything seemed caught in a timeless trap a morass of rot as if the cities had once been vibrant with life and people striving to fulfill dreams had once been places of hope and ambition but somewhere the dreams had disintegrated into a gray pall of stagnation and decay no one seemed to much care everyone seemed in a daze biding their time waiting for their lot in life to improve without even having a concept of the shape of that better life or how it might come to be they existed on disembodied faith confident only that the afterlife would be perfect the cities richard had seen were startlingly similar to what richard envisioned the future held for the new world under the yoke of the order this place though was the single largest city richard had ever seen he would never have believed the size of it had he not seen it himself dilapidated buildings entangled by streets teeming with people sprawled over a sweep of low hills across a broad bottomland for miles along the convergence of two rivers squat ramshackle huts built haphazardly of wattle and daub scraps of wood or salvaged mud and straw bricks beset the citys core to a great distance out into the surrounding land like fetid scum surrounding a rotting log in a stagnant pond it was the city of alturrangthe namesake of the land which was now the heart of the old world and the imperial orderthe home city of emperor jagang when they had first entered the old world on their way south toward alturrang richard and nicci had stopped at the northernmost large city in the old world ianimura where the palace of the prophets had once stood tanimura one of the last places in the old world to fall under the rule of the imperial order was a grand place with wide boulevards lined with trees and ornate buildings soaring several stories high faced with columns and arches and windows that let in the light tanimura as large as it was turned out to be but an outpost of the old world far enough away that the rot was only now reaching it for a span of a little over a month richard had found work in tanimura as a masons tender one of a dozen hauling stone and mixing mortar for a squat unattractive building the masons had simple huts the workers and their families lived in so nicci had shelter the master came to trust richard to keep up with his masons when one of the stonecutters fell sick richard was asked to stand in at squaring the blocks of granite for the masons he found holding a chisel and mallet in his hands cutting stoneshaping it to his willa revelation in some ways it was like carving wood but somehow much more from time to time the master stood with fists on his hips watching richard chisel square edges into the hard granite occasionally in a gruff voice he would make minor corrections to richards method after a time as the master saw that richard took to the job and could cut a block square and true he no longer bothered watching before long richards blocks were chosen first by the masons as cornerstones other stonecutters arrived to do more demanding workthe adornments when they had first shown up richard had been eager to see their work they cut into the face of blocks meant to surround the entrance a large flame representing the light of the creator below that they carved a crowd of cowering people richard had seen a number of stone carvings in the various places he had been from the confessors palace in aydindril to the peoples palace in dhara but he had never seen anything like the figures he saw being cut on that building in tanimura they were not graceful or grand or inspiring but just the opposite they were distorted thicklimbed cringing figures recoiling below the light richard was told by one of the artisans that this was the only proper representation of mankindprofane hideous sinful richard kept his mind on cutting square stones when the stonework to the orders headquarters building was finished the job ended the carpenters didnt need any more help the artisans said they could use some assistance carving the anguish of mankind and offered richard the work he declined telling them that he had no ability for carving besides nicci had been eager to move on tanimura had only been a place to earn some money to buy provisions for the long journey ahead of them richard was glad to be away from the depressing sight of the carving going on along the way southeast to alturrang in the cities they passed through richard saw many carvings on buildings and many more freestanding in public squares or in front of entrances they depicted horrors people being whipped by a grinning keeper of the underworld people stabbing out their own eyes suffering people twisted deformed and crippled people like packs of dogs running on all fours attacking women and children people reduced to walking skeletons or covered in sores woeful people throwing themselves into graves in most such scenes the pitiful people were watched over by the light of the allperfect creator represented by the flame the old world was a celebration of misery along the way south they had stopped in a number of cities when richard could find menial work temporary enough not to require waiting on lists he and nicci went for stretches eating cabbage soup that was mostly water sometimes they had rice or lentils or buckwheat mush and on occasion the luxury of salt pork sometimes richard was able to catch fish birds or the odd hare living off the land in the old world though was difficult a lot of other people had the same idea they both had gotten thinner on their long march richard began to understand the carvings of the skeletal people nicci had set their destination but dictated little else leaving most decisions to him complying without complaint week in and week out they walked occasionally paying a few copper pennies to ride in wagons headed their way they crossed rivers straddled by cities large enough to have numbers of stone bridges and went through town after town there were vast fields of wheat millet sunflower and any number of other crops though much of the land lay fallow they saw flocks of sheep and herds of cattle farmers sold the travelers goat cheese and milk ever since the gift had awakened in him richard was able to eat meat only when not doing any fighting he thought it might be part of the requirement to balance his need to sometimes take life since he wasnt doing any fighting he could eat meat without it making him sick unfortunately they could rarely afford meat cheese which he had once loved he could hardly stomach since his gift had come to life in him unfortunately it was often eat cheese or starve but it was the size of the old world and in particular its population that most unsettled him richard had naively thought that the new and the old worlds must be somewhat alike they were not the new world was but a flea on the back of the old from time to time on their journey south vast columns of men at arms moved past them on their way north to the midlands several times it had taken days for all the soldiers to march past whenever he saw the rank upon rank of troops he felt a wave of relief that kahlan was trapped in their mountain home he would hate to think of her fighting in an army facing as many men as he saw going to the war by spring when she could finally get out of the mountain home and all those imperial order troops could truly begin their siege of the new world whatever resistance the dharan empire put up would be crushed richard hoped general reibisch chose not to go up against the order he hated to think of all those brave men being slaughtered under the weight of the coming onslaught at one small city nicci had gone to a stream to wash their clothes while richard worked the day mucking out stalls at a large stable a number of officials had come to town and there were more horses than the stablemaster could handle richard had been at the right place at the right time to get the job not long after the officials arrived and took all the rooms at the inns a large unit of the imperial order troops marched in behind them and set up camp at the city limits fortunately nicci was on the other side of the city doing their washing unfortunately a squad of men passing through the city and doing some drinking decided to accept volunteers richard kept his head down as he carried water to the horses but the sergeant saw him at the wrong place at the wrong time richard was volunteered into the imperial order the new volunteers were quartered in the center of the immense encampment that night after it was dark and most of the men were asleep richard unvolunteered himself it took him until three hours before sunrise to extract himself from his service to the imperial order nicci had gone to the stable and found out what had happened to him richard found her at their camp pacing in the darkness they quickly collected their things and marched south for the rest of the night they went cross country since the moon was out rather than on the roads in case a patrol came looking for him from then on whenever richard saw soldiers he did his best to become invisible in general though it wasnt a serious concern hordes of youths lusting after the promise of plunder were only too eager to join the army they often had to wait weeks or months to be accepted into training so many were the numbers joining richard had seen crowds of them in the cities playing games gambling drinking fightingyoung men dreaming of the glory of killing the evil foes of the great empire of the order they enjoyed the adoration of the populace when they joined the army to go off and fight the frightful wickedness and sin that was said to infect the new world richard was horrified to see the numbers of people living in the old world because it meant that the orders army already in the new world was hardly a drain on the populaceand only the beginning he had thought that perhaps the order might lose their enthusiasm for a war conducted so far from their homeland or that the people of the old world would tire of the hardship necessary to conduct such a war he now knew that thought had been but a feeble daydream it didnt take a wizard or a prophet to know that the armies the new world could raise even given wildly optimistic conditions had no hope whatsoever of prevailing against the millions upon millions of soldiers richard had seen pouring north to say nothing of the ones he hadnt seen who would be taking other routes the midlands was doomed ever since the people of anderith chose the order over freedom he had known in his heart that the new world was going to fall to the order he felt no satisfaction in realizing how right he had been seeing the size of the enemy he realized that freedom was lost and resisting the order was but suicide the course of events seemed irrevocable the world lost to the order the future for him and kahlan seemed no less hopeless by far the strangest place he and nicci had visited in their journey southeast a place she never spoke of afterward had been less than a week south of tanimura richard had still been in a dismal mood thinking about the carvings he had seen when nicci took an old seldomused track off the main road it led back toward the hills to a rather small city beside a quiet river most of the businesses had been abandoned the wind at will carried dust through the broken windows of warehouses many of the homes had fallen to ruin their roofs caved in weeds and vines doing their best to bring down crooked walls only the homes on the outskirts were still occupied mostly by people raising animals and farming the surrounding land on the northern side of the city one small store remained to sell staples to surrounding farmers there was also a leather shop a fortuneteller and a lonely inn in the center of town stood the bones of buildings long since picked clean by scavengers several of the buildings still stood but most had long ago collapsed richard and nicci walked through the center of town watched only by a fitful wind at the southern edge they arrived at the remains of what had once been a large brick building without a word nicci turned off the road and marched deliberately into the forlorn site the wood beams and roof had been consumed by fire a thick mat of weeds and brush were devouring the wood floor the brick walls were all that was left really and they were mostly fallen to rubble with only a portion of the east wall still tall enough to contain a lone window frame the wind ruffled niccis sunlit hair as she looked down the length of the skeletal remains of the building her arms languid at her sides her back not quite as straight as it usually was she stood vulnerable where once a roof would have sheltered her for nearly an hour she was lost among the ghosts richard stood off to the side leaning a hip against the charred remains of part of a workbench one of the only things left inside the brick frame do you know this place he finally asked her she blinked at his question she stared into his eyes for a long time as if he too were a ghost she stepped close to him then her blue eyes finally looking away to let her fingers reminisce as they glided lightly over the remains of the workbench i grew up in this town she answered in a distant voice oh richard gestured around them and this place they made armor here she whispered he couldnt imagine why she would want to see such a place armor the best armor in all the land doubleproofed standard kings and noblemen came here to buy armor richard gazed around at the ruins of the place wondering what more there must be to the story did you know the man who made the armor her blue eyes seeing ghosts again she shook her head no she whispered im so sorry but i never knew him a tear ran down her cheek to drip off her smooth jaw she seemed very much a child at that moment alone in the world and frightened had he not known what he knew about her richard would have put his arms around this forlorn frail child and comforted her chapter nicci was tired cold and impatient she wanted a room her purpose in guiding richard to the center of the empire in alturrang was to bring him facetoface with the righteous cause of the order she knew richard to be a man of profound moral integrity and she wanted to see how he would react when confronted by the undeniable virtue of his enemys intentions she wanted richard to learn how difficult it was for ordinary people to live to get along in the world she was curious as to how he would fare in the same circumstancesshe wanted to throw him into the fire and see how he reacted to the heat as it were she had expected him to be agitated and frustrated by now he remained cool and unruffled she thought he would be furious at learning what he had to do to get a job he was not he had listened to that mr gudgeons fellow explaining the near impossible task that faced anyone wanting work nicci had expected him to punch the pompous official instead richard had cheerfully thanked him it was as if the things he so naively stood for so selfishly defended when she had known him before no longer mattered to him at the palace of the prophets when she had been his teacher every time she thought she knew how he would react he did something she would never have anticipated he did that now too but in a subtly different way what before had been in a manner of speaking unorganized youthful rebellion had turned to the dangerous scrutiny of a predator only the chains around his heart kept him from turning his claws on her when nicci had first captured richard she had briefly seen standing in the window of his house a carving of a proud woman nicci had known as sure as she knew night followed day that richard had carved it it betrayed his unique vision which she recognized the statue was tangible evidence of a hidden side to his gift it was a form of balance to his ability for war yet she detected no magic in it knowing that richard had carved it nicci expected that he would have been interested in the carving job offered him back in tanimura he turned it down he became moody and hardly spoke for several days afterward whenever they went through a new city she saw him taking in the statues and relief carvings since he too carved she expected him to find such creations fascinating he did not she couldnt understand it none were as finely executed as what he had carved to be sure but still they were carvings and she thought he would be at least interested in them she was baffled by his grim mood whenever he saw them one time she had taken the two of them out of their way for no reason but to show him a famous city square and the heroic work of art proudly displayed there it was her thought to bring him a bit of cheer at seeing such a widely heralded work he was not cheered surprised she had asked him why he appeared to so dislike the sculpture called tormented vision its death he had said with distant revulsion as he turned away from the widely worshiped work it was a grand scene of a group of men some gouging out their eyes after having seen the perfect light of the creator other of the men at the base of the statue whod not blinded themselves were being mauled by underworld beasts the keepers minions shrank from the blinded men wailing at what they had seen before taking their own sight no nicci said trying not to laugh and thereby humiliate him for his unenlightened view she sought instead to gently rectify his perception of the famous work by explaining it to him its a portrayal of the unworthy nature of mankind it shows men who have just witnessed his perfect light and in so doing have thus been able to see the hopeless nature of mans depravity that they would cut out their own eyes shows how perfect the creator is that they could no longer bear to look upon themselves these men in the statue are heroes for showing us that we must not arrogantly endeavor to rise above our corrupt essence for that would be sinfully comparing ourselves to the creator it shows that we are but faceless insignificant parts of a greater whole of mankind which he created and thus no single life can hold any importance this work teaches us that only the society as a whole can be worthwhile those at the bottom here who failed to join in with their fellow man and blind themselves are suffering their grim eternal fate at the keepers hands do you see now it honors mankind as the flawed creature he is in order that we may see that each of us must devote ourselves to the betterment of our fellow man because that is our only means of doing good and honoring the creators creationus so you see its not about death at all but about the true nature of life nicci had been taught that the statue was uplifting for the people since it confirmed everything they knew to be true in the whole of her life no one had ever given her a look that made her feel smaller than the look richard gave her nicci swallowed in horror at that look in his eyesit was the complete opposite of that elusive thing she sought from him without saying a word he had made her want nothing so much at that moment as to crawl under a rock and die she couldnt fathom how but he made her feel unworthy to live in some bewildering way that look made her feel as blind as the men in the statue he hadnt said one word but it was days before she could bring herself to look him in the eye again sometimes richard seemed meek when she expected fierceness and intense when she expected indifference she was beginning to wonder if she had been mistaken in thinking there was something special about him once she had even given in to despair of there really being anything in him worth discovering watching him sleep dejected that she had dared hope to uncover some meaning to life beyond what her mother had taught her she had sadly resolved that the next day after visiting the place she had grown up she would end the whole senseless undertaking and return to jagang after they went to her fathers business though she had seen again that quality in his gray eyes and knew beyond doubt that she had not been mistaken this dance had only begun as they marched down the dim hallway of a rooming house she gestured for richard to stand aside nicci wanted this room she wanted to lie down where it was dry and go to sleep she resolutely rapped her knuckles on a door that looked as if it might come apart if she wasnt careful she peered down at the register she had and then stuffed it in her pack as she waited for the door to be answered the lodging house like all the others they had been to was supposed to let rooms to those new to the city the emperor needed workers in her mind she imagined that this would be the place she stared at the stain on the sickly green plaster she imagined seeing the teacolored stain in the shape of a horses rump with its tail flicked up every day as she went about her life she imagined richard walking past the stain every day when he went to a job and every night when he came home just like everyone else had to do richard was watching the stairway beyond the door where nicci again knocked the stairs faced away she couldnt understand why he watched all the things he watched but she didnt discount his instincts by the look on his face he wasnt pleased about the shadowed stairway being a sister of the dark she was hardly frightened by the simple things that frightened other people she knocked again a voice inside told them to go away we need a room nicci declared to the door in a tone that said she meant to have it she knocked harder youre on the register we want the room its a mistake came the muffled voice from inside no room now look here nicci called out heatedly its getting late three youths she hadnt seen sitting on the stairs swaggered around the newel post the three were without shirts showing off their muscles as young men were wont to do all three had knives well well one of the youths said with a cocky grin as his eyes took her in with lewd intent what have we here two little drowned rats i like the fancy tail on the little blond rat a second chortled richard seized her arm and without a word shepherded her out the front door back out into the rain nicci dragged her heels protesting in a whisper the whole way she couldnt believe that lord rahl himself the seeker of truth and the bringer of death would be intimidated by three menboys really as they descended the rickety front stoop richard lifted an eyebrow at her while tipping his head close you have no power remember we dont want this kind of trouble id not like to get knifed over a room this fight isnt worth it knowing when not to fight is just as important as knowing how nicci wanted the room but she finally conceded that richard was probably right the three sneering youths slouched at the door and watched laughing calling richard names so far they werent interested in going out in the rain she had seen young men like them before this latest crop was no different from any of the othersarrogant aggressive and often dangerous at least they made good soldiers for jagangs army richard hurried her along the street he cut through some of the narrow passageways taking several turns at random just to be sure they wouldnt be followed the city of alturrang seemed endless in the overcast and rain visibility was limited the haphazard streets and byways were a confusing maze it had been many years since she had been here last with all the orders efforts the place still had fallen on hard times she feared to think of what it would have been like had the order not been here to help when they emerged on a wider street they found shelter under a small overhanging roof along with a small group of others trying to stay out of the rain nicci hugged herself against the cold richard along with the others huddled under the roof watched the occasional wagon making its way past on the muddy street she didnt know how richard could keep warm in such weather she appreciated his warmth though when the small crowd pressed her up against him richard glanced down at her seeing her shiver but he couldnt bring himself to put an arm around her to help keep her warns she didnt ask nicci sighed the old world didnt stay cold for long in another day or two it would again be warm and muggy when she had been at the crumbled remains of her fathers business just before they left richard had looked as if he almost wanted to put his arms around her and comfort her as much as he hated her as much as he wanted to get away from her he had been moved to sympathy standing in the ruins nicci had let the memories wash through her and had reveled in the exquisite anguish richards eyes were fixed on something she followed his gaze and saw that a wagon not far down the street was moving with an odd wiggle almost as soon as she noticed it the wheel broke with a loud crack with the strain imposed by the wagon slipping and being twisted in the ruts the spokes had snapped under the heavy load the side of the wagon bed dropped with a splash people on the walkway were splattered with mud they cursed the two men in the wagon the fourhorse team struggled to a halt as the uneven load broke the axle causing the good rear wheel to snap its spokes too the whole rear of the wagon collapsed into the mud the two men climbed down to assess the damage the rawboned driver cursed and kicked at the broken wheel lying at a lopsided angle the other man shorter and stoutly built calmly checked the rest of the wagon and its load with a frown of curiosity richard nudged nicci ahead of him as he moved down the street toward the wagon she went reluctantly unhappy to be out from under the roof we have to the husky man said with calm resolve its only a short distance the other cursed again its not my job ishaq and you know it ill not do it then ishaq threw up his hands in a helpless gesture as his headstrong partner went to the front of the wagon and urged the team on managing to drag the wagon to the side of the road and out of the way of the other wagons that were beginning to back up down the street once he had the wagon to the side he started unhitching the team the man at the back of the wagon turned and peered around at the people watching i need some help ishaq called to the sparse crowd doing what a nearby man asked ive got to get this load of iron to the warehouse he stretched his thick neck and pointed just therein the brick building with the faded red paint on the side how much will you pay the bystander asked ishaq was getting frustrated as he glanced over his shoulder and saw his partner leading the horses away im not authorized to pay anything not without approval but im sure that if you came round tomorrow the people watching laughed with knowing disgust and went on their way the man stood in the downpour ankle deep in mud alone he sighed and turned to his wagon pulling back the tarp to reveal iron bar stock richard stepped out into the street nicci wanted to check some more rooms on the list before it got dark she snatched at his sleeve but he only gave her a scolding look she huffed her displeasure but followed anyway as he made his way through the mud to the man struggling to pull a long bar from the wagon bed ishaq is it richard asked the man turned and gave richard a nod thats right if i help you ishaq richard asked will i really get paid tomorrow the truth now ishaq a stocky fellow with a curious red hat with a narrow brim all around finally shook his head in resignation well richard said if i help you get this load into your warehouse then would you allow me and my wife to sleep in there where we could get out of the rain for the night the man scratched his neck im not allowed to let anyone in there what if something happened what if things came up missing id be out of workhe snapped his fingersquick as that just until tomorrow i only want to get her out of the rain before she comes down sick i have no use for iron besides i dont rob people the man scratched his neck again as he gazed back at the wagon over his shoulder he glanced at nicci she was shivering and it was not an act he peered at richard sleeping in the warehouse for one night is not a fair price for lugging all this in there it will take hours if you agree to it and i agree to it richard said over the sound of the rain then its a fair price i asked for no more and im willing to do it for that price the man stared at richard as if he might be crazy he pulled off his red hat and scratched his head of dark hair he swept his wet hair back and replaced the hat you would have to clear out when i come first thing in the morning with a new wagon i could get in trouble ill not let you get in trouble over me if i should get caught ill say i broke in the man thought about it for a moment looking surprised at the last term richard had thrown in an effort to close the deal the man took another look over his shoulder at the load then nodded his consent ishaq hoisted a long bar of steel and put his shoulder under it richard lifted two and extended his arm forward to steady it resting the heavy steel on the bunched muscles of his shoulder come on he said to nicci lets get you inside where you can start to dry out and get warm she tried to lift a steel bar to help but it was beyond her strength there were times when nicci missed her power she could at least feel it through the link to the mother confessor it took more effort but even at this great of a distance she was still able to maintain the link she walked beside richard as they followed the man to the dry room richard had just won for her the next day dawned clear rainwater still dripped from the eaves though the night before as richard helped ishaq lug the load into the warehouse nicci had used a light rope richard had in his pack stringing it between racks so she could hang up their wet things by morning most of their clothes were reasonably dry theyd slept on wooden pallets the only other choice being the dirt everything smelled of iron dust and was covered with a fine black film there was nothing in the warehouse to keep them warm other than a single lantern ishaq had left them over which nicci could at least warm her hands they slept as best they could in their wet clothes by morning those too were reasonably dry much of the night nicci hadnt slept but by the light of that lantern warning her hands had watched richard sleep as she thought about his gray eyes it had been a shock to see those eyes in her fathers business it brought back a flood of memories richard opened the warehouse door just enough to squeeze through and carried their things out into the breaking dawn the sky over the city looked as if it were rusting he left her to watch their things while he went back in to lock the door from inside she could hear him climbing the racks in the warehouse to get up to a window he had to jump to the ground when ishaq finally came up the street with the fresh wagon richard and nicci were sitting on a short wall on the entrance road to the warehouse doors when the wagon rolled past them into the yard outside the building and came to a halt before the double doors nicci saw that the driver who had abandoned ishaq the night before was at the reins the lanky driver set the brake as he eyed them suspiciously whats this he asked richard im sorry to bother you richard said but i just wanted to get here before you opened up so i could inquire if there might be any work available ishaq glanced at nicci seeing that she was dried out he eyed the locked door and realized richard had kept his word and kept him from the possibility of getting in trouble for letting someone sleep in the warehouse we cant hire people the driver said you have to go to the office and put your name on the list richard sighed i see well thank you gentlemen ill give it a try a good day to you both nicci had learned to recognize in richards voice when he was up to something he gazed up the street and then down the street as if he were lost he was up to something now he seemed to be giving ishaq an opportunity to offer more than he had paid for the help ishaq had let richard carry twice as much of the load the night before richard had done so without a word of protest ishaq cleared his throat hold on there he climbed down from the wagon to unlock the door but paused before richard im the load master we need another man you look to have a strong back using the toe of his boot he drew a little map in the mud you go to the officehe lifted his thumb over his shoulderdown this street here to the third turn then right past six more streets he made an x in the mud theres the office you get your name on the list richard smiled and bowed his head ill do that sir nicci knew that richard remembered ishaqs name but he was playing like he didnt for the sake of the driver whom richard didnt trust after the man had abandoned his fellow the night before what richard didnt understand was that the driver had only done what he was supposed to do it was not permitted for one man to take the work that belonged to others that was stealing the load was the responsibility of the load man not the driver you go enlist first in the load workers group ishaq told richard pay your dues they have an office in the same building then you go put your name on the list for the job im in the citizen workers group that goes before the review assembly to consider new applicants you just sit tight and wait outside when we meet later on ill vouch for you the driver leaned out and spat over the far side of the wagon why you want to go and do that ishaq you dont even know this fellow ishaq scowled up at the driver did you see anyone at the hall who was as big as this fellow we need another loader for the warehouse we just lost a man and need a replacement you want me to get stuck with some skinny old man so as ill have to do all the work the driver chuckled suppose not ishaq gestured toward nicci besides look at his young wife she needs some meat on her bones dont you think looks like a nice young couple the driver spat over the side of the wagon again i suppose ishaq casually flicked a hand at richard on his way to unlock the door to the warehouse you be there ill be there ishaq paused and turned back almost forgotwhats your name richard cypher ishaq gave him a nod and turned back to the door im ishaq see you tonight richard cypher dont you let me downyou hear you turn out to be lazy and let me down and ill throw your sorry hide in the river with an iron bar tied around your neck i wont let you down ishaq richard smiled im a good swimmer but not that good as they trudged though the muddy streets on their way to find some food before they went to the offices to get on the list for work richard asked whats wrong nicci shook her head in disgust ordinary people dont have your luck richard ordinary people suffer and struggle while your luck gets you into a job if it was luck richard asked then how come my back hurts from lugging that load of iron bars into the warehouse chapter when richard had finished unloading the last wagon of iron he leaned forward and placed his hands on the pile hanging his head as he panted the muscles in his arms and shoulders throbbed it was always easier having two men to handle the bars one in the wagon and one on the ground but the man who was supposed to help with the load had quit several days back saying he hadnt been treated properly richard didnt really miss him all that much even when the man got up off his backside his assistance was more trouble than it was worth the light coming in the high windows was fading leaving the sky in the west a deep purple sweat ran down his neck making trails through the black iron dust he wished he could jump in a cool mountain lake that thought in and of itself was refreshing he let his mind go there as he caught his breath ishaq came down the aisle with the lantern you work too hard richard i thought i was hired to work ishaq peered at richard for a moment one eye catching the harsh yellow light of the lantern he was holding take my advice you work too hard its only going to get you into trouble richard had been working at the warehouse for three weeks unloading wagons and loading others hed come to know a number of the other men he had a good idea of what ishaq meant but im still worried about trying to swim with an iron bar wrapped around my neck ishaq gave up on his scowl and grunted a laugh i was just spouting for joris sake that day jori was the driver who had refused to help unload the wagon when it broke down richard yawned i know ishaq this isnt no farm like where you came from this is different living under the ways of the order you got to take the needs of others in mind if you hope to get along its just the way the world is richard caught the thread of caution in ishaqs voice and the meaning of the gentle warning youre right ishaq thanks ill try to remember ishaq gestured with his lantern toward the door workers group meeting tonight best be on your way richard groaned i dont know its late and im tired id really rather you dont want your name to start going around you dont want people to start talking that youre not civicminded richard smirked i thought the meetings were voluntary ishaq barked a laugh again richard collected his pack from a shelf in the back corner and then ran to the door so ishaq could lock it outside in the gathering darkness richard could just make out niccis curvaceous form sitting on the wall at the warehouse entrance her curves often put him in mind of nothing so much as a snake they had no room yet so she often came by the warehouse after shed spent much of the day waiting in lines to buy bread and other necessities they would walk together back to their shelter in a quiet alley about a mile away richard had paid a small price to some of the boys there to guard their place and make sure no one else took it the boys were young enough to be thankful for the small price and old enough to be diligent about their job get any bread richard asked as he approached nicci hopped down off the wall no bread todaythey were out but i got us some cabbage ill make us a soup richards stomach was growling hed been hoping for bread so he could eat a piece right then soup would take time wheres your pack and if you bought cabbage where is it she smiled and produced something small she held it out before them as they walked so as to silhouette it against the deep violet of dusk it was a key a room we got a place i checked the lodging office this afternoon our name finally came up they assigned a room to us mr and mrs cypher we can sleep inside tonight good thing too it looks like it will rain tonight i already put my things in our room richard rubbed his sore shoulders he felt a wave of revulsion at the sham she was putting him through putting kahlan through there were times when he felt a hint of something profoundly important about her and what she was doing but most of the time he was merely overwhelmed by the lunacy of it all where is this room he was hoping it wasnt clear over on the other side of the city its one we were at beforenot too far from here the one with the stain on the wall just inside the door nicci they all had stains on the walls the stain that looked like a horses rear end with its tail flicked up youll see it soon richard was starving i have to go to a workers group meeting again tonight oh nicci said workers group meetings are important they help keep a persons mind on whats proper and on everyones duty to his fellow man the meetings were torture nothing worthwhile ever came about at the meetings they sometimes lasted hours there were people though who lived for the meetings so they could stand up in front of others and talk about the glory of the order it was their shining hour their time to be somebody to be important those who didnt show up for the meetings were used as examples of people who werent properly committed to the cause of the order if the absent person didnt mend his ways it was possible he could end up being suspected of subversion the lack of truth to the suspicion was irrelevant stating the charge made some people feel more important in a land where equality was held as the highest ideal subversion seemed to be a dark cloud hovering constantly over the old world it wasnt at all unusual to see the city guard taking people into custody on suspicion of subversion torture produced confessions which proved the veracity of the accuser the people who spoke at length at the meetings had by this logic accurately pointed a finger at a number of insurrectionists as evidenced by their confessions the undercurrent of tension in alturrang left many worried over the constant scourge of insurrectioncoming from the new world it was said officials of the order wasted no time in stamping it out whenever it was discovered other people were so consumed with fear that the finger would turn toward them that the speakers at the workers group meetings were assured of having a large number of zealous supporters in many a public square as a constant reminder of what would happen should you fall into the wrong company the bodies of subversives were left to hang from high poles until the birds picked their bones clean the running joke if an incautious person said anything that sounded at all out of line was you looking to be buried in the sky richard yawned again as they turned down the street toward the meeting hall i dont remember the stain that looks like a horses rear end rocks crunched beneath their boots as they walked down the side of the dark street off ahead of them in the distance he could see ishaqs lantern swinging as the man hurried to the meeting you were paying attention to something else at the time its the room where those three live three what a number of other people some he knew most he didnt hastened along the street on their way to the meeting richard remembered then he stopped you mean the place where those three bullies livethe three with the knives he could just barely see her nod in the dim light thats the place great richard wiped a hand across his face as they started out again did you ask if we could have a different room new people in the city are fortunate to get rooms rooms are assigned as your name comes up if you turn it down you go back to the bottom of the list did you have to give the landlord any money yet she shrugged just what i had richard ground his teeth as he walked thats all we have for the rest of the week i can stretch the soup richard didnt trust her she probably somehow saw to it that they got that particular room he suspected that she wanted to see what he would do about the three young men now that he was forced into the situation she was always doing little things asking odd questions making bold statements just to see what his reaction would be how he would handle matters he couldnt imagine what it was she wanted from him he began to worry about the three he remembered quite clearly how caras agiel had caused kahlan to suffer the same pain as nicci if those three abused nicci kahlan would suffer it too that thought made him go cold and sweaty with worry at the workers group meeting richard and nicci sat on benches at the rear of a smoky room while people up front spoke about the glory of the order and how it helped all people to live a moral life richards mind drifted to the brook behind the house he had built to the sunlit summer afternoons watching kahlan dangle her feet in the water he ached with longing as his minds eye traced the curve of her legs there were speeches about every workers duty to their fellow man many of the discourses were given in a droning monotone having been repeated so often that it was clear that the words were meaningless and that only the act of saying them mattered richard recalled kahlan laughing as he caught the fish hed put in jars for her many of the people the group leaders or citizen spokesmen delivered with passion and fire their praise for the ways of the order a few people stood up and talked about those who werent there giving their names saying what poor attitudes they had toward the welfare of their fellow workers whispers passed among the crowd after the speeches were given some of the workers wives stood up and explained that they had extra need of late because they had just had new children or their husbands were laid up or the relatives they cared for were ill after each spoke there was a show of hands if you agreed to do the right thing and have the group help them then you raised your hand the names of these who didnt raise their hand were noted ishaq had explained to richard that you were allowed not to raise your hand if you didnt agree but if you did it very often you were put on a watch list richard didnt know what a watch list was but it was easy enough to surmise and ishaq had told richard that he didnt want to be on one and to see to it that he raised his hand more often than not richard raised it every time he didnt really care what happened he had no interest in taking part no interest in trying to make things better and no interest in how well or poorly peoples lives went most seemed to want the comfort of the order running their lives relieving them of the burden of thinking on their own just like anderith nicci seemed surprised and occasionally even disappointed to see his hand go up every time but didnt object or question he was hardly even aware of his hand going up he was smiling inwardly as he recalled the wonder in kahlans expression the astonishment in her green eyes when she saw spirit for the first time richard would have carved a mountain for her just to see her tearful joy in seeing something she admired something she cherished something she valued another man spoke complaining about the conditions how unfair they were and how he had been forced to quit rather than subject himself to such abuse by the transport company he was the man who had quit and left richard to handle the loads by himself richard raised his hand along with all the others to grant the man full wages for six months in recompense after the show of hands and some whispering and scratching on paper as all the obligations were figured up the healthy working members were assessed their just share to help those in need those who were able richard had been told had a duty to produce with all their effort in order to help those who couldnt when mens names were called they stood to hear the share to be taken from their wages the next week because he was new richards name was called last he stood staring off across the dimly lit room at the people in motheaten coats sitting behind the long table made of two old doors ishaq sat at one end going along with the others in everything several of the women still had their heads together when they finished they whispered to the chairman and he nodded richard cypher being as you are new you still have some catching up to do on your duty to your workers group your next weeks wages are assessed as due in aid richard stood dumbly for a moment how am i to eat to pay my rent people in the room turned to frown at him the chairman slapped his hand on the table calling for silence you should thank the creator to be blessed with good health so as you can work young man right now there are those who are not as fortunate in life as you those with greater need than you suffering and need comes before selfish personal enrichment richard sighed what did it really matter after all he was lucky in life yes sir i see what you mean im happy to volunteer my share toward those with needs he wished nicci hadnt given away all their money well he said to nicci as they shuffled out into the night i guess we can ask the landlord for the rent money back we can stay on where we were staying before until i can work some more and save up some money they dont give rent money back she said the landlord will understand our need and let our debt build until we can start paying on it next meeting you just have to go up before the review board and explain your hardship if you present it properly they will give you a hardship charity to pay your rent richard was exhausted he felt like he were having some kind of silly dream charity its my wagesfor the work i do thats a selfish way of looking at it richard the job is at the grace of the workers group the company and the order he was too tired to argue besides he didnt expect any justice in anything done in the name of the order he just wanted to go to their new room and get some sleep when they opened the door one of the three youths was pawing through niccis pack holding some of her underthings in one hand he aimed a smirk back over his shoulder at them well well he said as he stood he still wore no shirt looks like the two drowned rats have found a hole to live in his leering gaze slid to nicci he wasnt looking at her face nicci snatched the pack away first then her things from his other hand she stuffed her personal clothes back in the pack while he watched grinning the whole time richard feared she might abandon the link to kahlan in order to use her power but she only glared at the youth the room reeked of mold the low ceiling made richard feel uncomfortably hemmed in the ceiling had once been whitewashed but was now dark with soot from candles and lamps making the room feel cavelike a candle sitting on a rusted bracket by the door provided the only light a wardrobe stood crookedly in the corner in front of dirty walls spotted with flyblows the wardrobe was missing a door two wooden chairs at a table under one small window on the far wall were the only place to sit other than the warped and gouged pine floor the small squares of window glass were opaque under a variety of differentcolored layers of paint through a small triangle in the corner where the glass was broken out richard could see the gray wall of the next building how did you get in here nicci snapped master key he waved it like a kings pass see my fathers the landlord i was just checking your things for subversive writings you can read nicci sniped i would have to see that to believe it the defiant grin never left his face wed not like to find we have subversives living under our roof could endanger everyone else my father has a duty to report any suspicious activity richard stepped aside to let the young man by as he headed for the door but then caught his arm as the youth picked up the candle thats our candle richard said yeah what makes you think so richard tightened his grip on the bare lean muscular arm looking him in the eye he gestured with his other hand our initials are scratched in the bottom there before he thought the young man instinctively turned the candle to have a look the hot wax spilled over his hand he dropped the candle with a yelp oh my i am sorry richard said he stooped and picked up the candle youre all right i hope you didnt get any of that burning wax in your eyes did you hot wax in your eyes hurts something fierce yeah he swiped his straight dark hair back from his eyes how would you know that back where i came from i saw it happen to some poor fellow richard leaned partway out into the hall into the light of another candle on a shelf with his thumbnail he made a show of carving an r and a c in the bottom of the candle see here my initials the youth didnt bother to look uhhuh he swaggered out the door richard went with him and lit the candle from the flame of the one in the hall before walking away the young man turned back with a haughty look how did that fellow manage to be stupid enough to get hot wax in his eyes was he a big dumb ox like you no richard said offhandedly no not at all he was a cocky young man who foolishly put his hands on another mans wife he got the hot wax dripped in his eyes by the husband yeah well why didnt the dumb jackass just shut his eyes richard gave the lad a deadly smile for the first time because his eyelids had been cut off first so he couldnt close them you see where i come from anyone touching a woman against her wishes isnt treated indulgently yeah yeah the young mans eyelids werent the only thing that got cut off the young man swiped his black hair back again you threatening me ox no there would be nothing i could do to you that would harm you more than what youre already doing to harm yourself whats that supposed to mean you are never going to amount to anything you will always be the worthless muck people scrape from their shoes you only get one life and you are wasting yours thats a terrible shame i doubt you will ever know what it is to be truly happy to achieve anything of worth to have genuine pride in yourself you bring it all on yourself and i could do no worse to you i cant help what life deals me yes you can you create your own life yeah how do you figure richard gestured around himself look at the pigsty you live in your father is the landlord why dont you show some pride and fix up the place hes the landlord not the owner the man who owned it was a greedy bastard charging more rent than many could afford the order took the place over for his crimes against the people they tortured the owner to death my father was given the job of landlord we just run the place to help out fools like you who dont have a place weve no money to go around fixing up the building money richard pointed it takes money to pick up that garbage left there in the hall i didnt put it there and these wallsit doesnt take money to wash the walls look at the ceiling in this room it hasnt been washed in a decade at least hey im no scrub woman and the front stoop someone is going to break their neck on it could be you or your father why dont you do something worthwhile for a change and fix it i told you weve no money to fix things it doesnt take money you just need to take it apart clean the joints and put in some new wedges you can cut them from any little scrap of wood lying around the young man wiped his palms on his pants if youre so smart then why dont you fix the stairs good idea i will yeah his sneer returned i dont believe you tomorrow after i get home from work i will fix the stairs if you show up ill teach you how its done i might show up just to see some dupe going to the work of fixing something that isnt even his and for nothing besides it isnt for nothing its because i use the front steps too and for the pleasure in the place where i live i care if my wife falls and breaks her leg but if you want to come and learn how to fix the steps you will wear a shirt out of respect for the women in your building and if i show up and watch you and i dont wear a stupid shirt like some old geezer then i wouldnt have enough respect for you to bother teaching you how to fix the stairs you will learn nothing then what if i dont want to learn something then you will have taught me something about you instead he rolled his dark eyes why should i care about learning to fix some dumb stairs you shouldnt necessarily care about fixing some stairs but if you care about yourself you should care about learningeven learning simple things you come to have pride in yourself only by accomplishing things even from fixing some old stairs yeah i got pride in myself you intimidate people and then mistake that for respect others cant grant you selfrespect even others who care about you you have to earn selfrespect yourself all you know right now is how to stand around and look stupid he folded his arms who you calling richard jabbed a finger against the young mans smooth chest forcing him back a pace you only get one life is that all you want out of it standing around calling names scaring people with your gang is that all you want your one life to mean to you anyone who wants more out of life who wants their life to mean something would care about learning things tomorrow im going to fix those stairs tomorrow well see what sort you are the youth folded his arms again in a defiant stance yeah well maybe id rather spend time with my friends richard shrugged thats why your lot in life isnt fate i dont have any say in much of my life but i make whatever choices i can make in my own rational best interest its my choice to fix those stairs and make the place i live a little better instead of whining and waiting and hoping for someone else to do something for me i have pride that i know how to do that for myself fixing stairs isnt going to make you a man but its going to make you a little more confident in yourself if you want bring your friends and ill teach you all how to use those knives of yours for something more than just waving in peoples faces we might come to laugh at you working ox fine but if you and your pals want to learn anything of worth then youd better start out by showing me you mean to learn by showing respect and showing up with shirts thats the first choice you have if you make it wrong then your choices as you go along are only going to become more limited and my name is richard like i said you might be good for a laugh he made a face richard laugh all you want i know my own worth and dont need to prove it to someone who doesnt know theirs if you want to learn you know what you must do if you ever wave a knife at me again thoughor worse my wifethen you will be making the last of your many mistakes in life he chose to ignore the threat with more bravado what am i ever going to be some dupe like you working your tail off for that greedy ishaq and his transport company whats your name kamil well kamil i work in exchange for wages so i can support myself and my wife i have have something of valuemyself someone values my worth enough to pay me for my time and ability right now choosing to work at loading wagons is one of the few choices i have to make in my life i chose to fix the steps because it improves my life richard narrowed his eyes and what does ishaq have to do with it anyway ishaq hes the one who owns the transport company ishaq is just the load master ishaq used to live here back before the order took over the building my father knew him matter of fact youll be sleeping in his parlor back then it was his transport company he chose the path of enlightenment over greed though when it was offered him he let the citizen workers group help him to learn to be a better citizen of the order learn his place under the creator now he knows hes no better than any of the rest of useven me richard glanced at nicci who was standing in the middle of their room watching the conversation hed forgotten all about her he didnt feel like talking anymore ill see you tomorrow evening whether you come to laugh or to learn its your life kamil and your choice chapter the sun was just coming up dusty shafts of light angled into the warehouse through the high windows when he saw ishaq coming down the aisle to give him the list of iron to be loaded for various wagons richard hopped down off the rack where hed been waiting richard hadnt seen the load master for a week ishaq are you all right where have you been the burly load master hurried up the aisle hello to you too im sorryhello i was worried where have you been he made a face meetings always meetings wait in this office wait in that office no work just meetings for this and for that i had to go see people to try to arrange for loads people need sometimes i think no one really wants any goods to move in this city it would be easier for them if everyone got paid but had to do no workthen they would not have to sign their name on a piece of paper and worry if maybe someday they will be called to account for having done it ishaq is it true that this transport company used to be yours the man paused to catch his breath who tells you these things what about it did the transport company used to be yours ishaq shrugged still is i guess what happened what happened nothing happened except maybe i got smart and figured out it was more work than i needed what did they threaten you with ishaq peered at richard for a time where are you from you dont seem like any farmboy i ever met richard smiled you didnt answer my question ishaq the man gestured irritably what for you want to know about past history past is past a man has to look at the way things are and do the best he can from what life presents him a choice was put to me and i made it things are they way they are wishing dont put food before my children richards inquisitive frown suddenly felt cruel on his face he let it go i understand ishaq i really do im sorry the man shrugged again now i work here just like everyone else much easier i must follow the same rules or i could lose my job just like everyone else everyone is equal now praise be to the order ishaq smiled at richards gibe richard held out his hand lets have the list the load master handed over the paper it only had the names of two places on it with some directions for grade length and amounts whats this richard asked we need a loader to go with a wagon to pick up some iron and see it delivered so im working on the wagons now why i thought you needed me in the warehouse ishaq took off his red hat and scratched his head of dark thinning hair we had some complaints about me what did i do you know ive worked hard too hard ishaq readjusted his hat on his head men in the warehouse say you are petty and spiteful their words not mine they say you make them feel bad by flaunting how young and strong you are they say you are laughing behind their backs many of the men were younger than richard and strong enough ishaq i never i know i know but they feel that you do dont make trouble for yourself now their feelings are what matter not what is richard let out a frustrated sigh but i was told by the workers group that i have the ability to work where as others dont and that i was supposed to contribute my full effort in order to help relieve the strain on those less ablethose who dont have my ability they said that i would lose the job if i didnt do my full effort its a fine line to walk and i stepped over the line they want you dismissed richard sighed so im through here ishaq waggled his hand yes and no you are dismissed from the warehouse for having a bad attitude i convinced the committee to give you another chance and let you be moved to the wagons the wagons arent as much work because you can only load it and then when you get to where its going you unload it cant get in much trouble that way richard nodded thanks ishaq ishaqs gaze sought refuge among the racks of iron and the bins of charcoal and long rows of ore that needed delivery he scratched his temple the pay is less richard brushed the iron and ore dust from his hands and rear of his pants whats the difference they just take it from me anyway and give it out im not really losing any pay other people are losing my pay ishaq chuckled and clapped richard on the shoulder you are the only one around here i can count on richard you are different than the othersi feel i can talk to you and it wont drift to other ears i wouldnt do that to you i know thats why i tell you what i dont tell the others i am expected to be equal and to work like anyone else but i am also expected to provide jobs they took my business but they still expect me to run it for them crazy world you dont know the half of it ishaq so what about this wagonloading job what is it you need done the blacksmith out at the site is dealing me a fit why he has orders for tools but he has no iron lots of people are waiting on things he swept a hand out at the rack of iron most of this is what was ordered last autumn last autumn its nearly spring and its only now come in its all been promised to those who ordered it before so why did it take so long for it to get here ishaq slapped his forehead maybe you are an ignorant farmboy after all where you been under rocks you cant just get things because you want them you got to wait your turn your order must pass before the review board why why why why is that all you know ishaq sighed and said something under his breath about the creator testing his patience he slapped the back of his fingers to the palm of his other hand as he explained it to richard because youve got to think of others thats why you got to take other peoples needs into consideration you have to consider the good of everyone if i get all the runs picking up and delivering the iron then what chance have others who want to do the same if i have all the business thats unfair it would put people out of work whats available has to be divided up the board of supervision must make sure everything is equal to all some people cant handle the orders so fast as i can or they have trouble or they cant get workers or their workers have troubles so i got to wait until they can catch up its your business why cant why why why here take this order i dont need to have that blacksmith come all the way down here again and yell at me hes in trouble with his orders and he needs the iron why is he in trouble i thought everyone had to wait their turn ishaq lifted an eyebrow and lowered his voice his customer is the retreat the retreat whats that the retreat ishaq spread his arms indicating something big thats the name of the place being built for the emperor richard hadnt known the name the emperors new palace was the reason for all the workers coming to alturrang he supposed it was the reason nicci had insisted they come to the city too she had some interest in having him be part of the grand project he assumed it was her grotesque sense of irony the new palace is going to be huge ishaq said waving his arms again a lot of work for a lot of people it will be work for years building the retreat so when the goods are for the order then you had better deliver i take it ishaq smiled and dipped a deep nod now you are starting to understand mr richard why why why the blacksmith is working directly from the orders of the builders of the palace who report to the highest people the builders need tools and things made they dont want to hear excuses from a lowly blacksmith the blacksmith doesnt want to hear excuses from me but i have to go by what the review board sayshe doesnt he goes by what the palace says im in the middle ishaq paused when one of the other loaders came down the aisle with a piece of paper ishaq read the paper the man gave him while the man gave a sidelong look at richard ishaq sighed and gave brief directions to the man after he was gone ishaq turned back to richard i can only transport what the review board allows me to move that paper just nowit was instructions from the board for me to hold a shipment of timbers to the mines because the load was going to go to a company that needs the work you see i cant put other people out of business by being unfair and delivering more than they do or else i have trouble and i get replaced by someone who will not be so unfair to his competitors ah its not like the old days when i was young and foolish richard folded his arms you mean to say that if you do a good job you get in troublejust like i did good job whos to say what is a good job everybodys got to work together for the good of everybody that is a good jobif you help your fellow man richard watched a couple of men off in the distance loading a wagon with charcoal you dont really believe that mouthful of mush do you ishaq ishaq sighed in a long suffering manner richard please load the wagon when you get to the foundry and then go with the wagon out to the retreat and unload it at the blacksmiths shop please dont get sick on me or get a bad back or have infirm children in the middle of the run i dont need to see the blacksmith again or i will have to go swimming with an iron bar around my neck richard grunted a laugh my back is feeling fine good ill get a driver over here to drive the wagon ishaq waggled a cautionary finger and dont ask the driver to help load or unload we dont need that kind of grievance brought up at the next meeting i had to beg jori not to lodge a complaint after i asked him to help me unload the wagon that day in the rain when the wheels brokethe day you helped me get the load to the warehouse remember i remember please dont give jori any trouble dont touch the reinsthats his job be a good fellow then get the iron loaded and unloaded so that blacksmith doesnt come to see me again sure ishaq i wont make any trouble for you you can trust me theres a good fellow ishaq started away but turned back was not so much trouble on a farmam i right no it wasnt i wish i was back there now before he got far ishaq turned back once more you be sure to bow and scrape if you see any of those priests you hear priests what priests how will i know them brown robes and creased capsoh youll know them you cant miss them if you see any you be on your best manners if a priest suspects you of having an improper attitude toward the creator or such he can have you tortured the priests are brother narevs disciples brother narev the high priest of the fellowship of order ishaq waved his arms impatiently i have to get jori to come with the wagon please richard do as i ask that blacksmith will feed me to his forge if i dont have that iron out there today please richard get that load out there please richard gave ishaq a smile in order to put his mind at ease you have my word ishaq the blacksmith will have the iron ishaq heaved a sigh and hurried off to find his driver chapter it was late in the muggy afternoon by the time they made it to the site of the retreat sitting in the wagon beside jori as they cleared the top of the final hill richard was awestruck by the sight it was beyond huge he couldnt imagine how many square miles had been cleared gangs of thousands of men looking like ants spread out below worked in lines with shovels and baskets reshaping the contour of the land jori was disinterested in the construction and only spat over the side offering the occasional i suppose to some of richards questions the foundation was still being laid in deep trenches enabling richard looking down from the road to see on the ground the outline of the future structure it was hard to fathom how enormous the building was going to be seeing the specks moving slowly beside it it was hard to keep in mind that they were men for sheer size the structure would rival anything richard had ever seen there were miles of grounds and gardens going in fountains and other towering structures along entrance roads were beginning to be erected sweeping stretches of mazes were being constructed with hedges hillsides were dotted with trees that had been planted according to a grand plan the retreat faced a lake in what was to be that majestic park the short side of the main building was to run a quarter mile along the river stone pilings marched partway out into the river with a series of connecting arches just starting to be constructed apparently part of the palace was to extend out over the water with docks for the emperors pleasure craft across the river lay more of the city on the palace side of the river too the city spread all around though at a great distance from the retreat richard couldnt imagine how many buildings and people had been displaced for the construction this was to be no distant and remote emperors palace but rather it was set right in the center of alturrang roads were being paved with millions of cobbles giving the multitudes of citizens of the order access to come and see the wand structure there were already crowds of people standing behind rope barricades watching the construction despite the poverty of the old world it would appear that this grand palace was to be a crown jewel of unsurpassed splendor stone of various kinds lay in great piles in the distance richard could see men working at cutting it into the required shapes the heavy afternoon air rang with the faraway knells of hundreds of hammers and chisels there were stockpiles of granite and marble in a variety of colors and massive quantities of limestone blocks special quarry wagons waited in serpentine columns to deliver yet more the long blocks of stone called lifts were slung under heavy beams that bridged the front and rear axles huts and great open shelters had been built for the stone workers so they could work no matter the weather timber was stickered in row upon row of huge stacks covered with purposebuilt roofs the overflow was covered in canvas small mountains of materials for mortar were scattered around the foundation looking like anthills the illusion aided by all the dark specks of men moving about away from the site itself on a road that snaked its way along the side of a hill among a small city of new work buildings overlooking the site lay the blacksmiths shop it was quite large compared with such places richard had seen before of course richard had never seen anything on this scale being built he had seen grand places that already existed to see one just beginning was a revelation the sheer scale of everything was disorienting jori expertly backed his team putting the rear of the wagon right at double doors standing open into blackness there you be jori said it was a long speech for the lanky driver he pulled out a loaf of bread and a waterskin filled with ale and climbed down from the wagon to find a place farther down the hill where he could sit and watch the building while richard worked at unloading the iron the blacksmiths shop was dark and stifling hot even in the outer cluttered stockroom like all blacksmiths shops the walls in the workroom were covered in soot windows were kept to a minimum mostly located overhead and covered with shutters so as to keep it dark in order to more easily judge the nature of the glowing metal despite being recently built for the work at the palace the blacksmiths shop already looked a hundred years old nearly every spot held some tool or other in a dizzying array and variety there were rows of tools piles of them the rafters were hung with tongs and fire pots and crucibles and squares and dividers and contraptions like huge insects which looked to be used for clamping pieces together low benches seemingly cobbled together in haste were hung all round with longhandled dies of every sort some benches held smaller grindstones slots around some tables held hundreds of files and rasps some of the low tables were covered in a jumble of hammers in such variety as richard had never imagined their handles all sticking out making the tabletops look like huge pincushions the floor was choked with clutter boxes overflowing with parts bars rivets wedges lengths of iron stock clippings pry bars pole hooks dented pots wooden jigs tin snips lengths of chain pulleys and a variety of special anvil attachments everything was covered with soot or dust or metal filings broad short barrels full of liquids sat around the anvils where men hammered on glowing iron held in tongs flattening stretching cutting squaring clipping glowing metal hissed and smoked in protest as it was quenched in the liquid other men used the horns of their anvils to bend metal that looked like bits of sunset held captive in tongs they held up those fascinating bits and matched them to patterns hammered on the metal some more and checked it again richard could hardly think in all the noise in the darkness a man worked a big bellows putting all his weight on the downstroke the blast of air made the fire roar charcoal overflowed from baskets sitting wherever there had been room to put them cubbyholes held pipe and odd scraps of metal metal hoops leaned against benches and planks some of the hoops were for barrels bigger ones were for wagon wheels tongs and hammers lay here and there on the floor where men had dropped them in the haste of battle with the hot iron the whole place was as agreeable a clutter as he had ever seen a man in a leather apron stood not far away at a door to another workroom he held out a chalkboard covered with a maze of lines as he studied a large contraption of metal bars on the floor in the room beyond richard waited not wanting to interrupt the mans concentration the sharply defined muscles of his sooty arms glistened with sweat the man tapped the chalk against his lip as he puzzled then swiped a line clean on the board and drew it again moving its connecting points richard frowned at the drawing it looked familiar somehow even though it was no recognizable object would you be the master blacksmith richard asked when the man paused and looked over his shoulder the mans brow seemed enduringly fixed in an intimidating scowl his hair was cropped close to his skulla good practice around so much fire and whitehot metaladding to his menacing demeanor he was of average height and sinewy but it was his countenance that made him look big enough for any trouble that might come along by the way the other men moved and glanced at this man they feared him taken by inexplicable compulsion richard pointed at the line the man had just drawn thats wrong what you just did is wrong you have the top end right but the bottom should go here not where you put it he didnt so much as blink do you even know what this is well not exactly but i then how can you presume to tell me where to put this support the man looked like he wanted to stuff richard in the forge and melt him down offhand i dont know exactly something just tells me that you had better be the man with the iron i am richard said glad to change the subject and wishing he had kept his mouth shut in the first place he had only been trying to help where would where have you been all day i was told it would be here first thing this morning what did you do sleep till noon ah no sir we went right to the foundry first thing ishaq sent me right there at dawn but the man at the foundry was having problems because im not interested you said you had the iron its already late enough get it unloaded richard looked around every spot seemed occupied where would you like it the master blacksmith glared around at the crammed room as if he expected some of the piles to get up and move for him they didnt if youd have been here when you were supposed to be here you could have put it out there just inside the door in the outer supply room now they brought that big rock sled that needs welding so you will have to put the iron in the back next time get out of bed earlier richard was trying to be polite but he was losing his patience with being castigated because the blacksmith was having a troubled day ishaq made it quite clear that you were to get iron today and he sent me to see to it i have your iron i dont see anyone else able to deliver on such short notice the hand with the chalkboard lowered the full attention of the mans glower focused on richard for the first time men who had heard richards words scurried off to attend to important work farther away how much iron did you bring fifty bars eight feet the man let out an angry breath i ordered a hundred i dont know why they sent an idiot with a wagon when do you want to hear the way it is or do you want to yell at someone if you just want to spout off to no point and no useful end then go right ahead as im not much injured by ranting but when you finally want to hear the truth of the way things are just let me know and ill give it the blacksmith peered silently for a moment a bull bewildered by a bumblebee whats your name richard cypher so whats the truth of the way things are richard cypher the foundry wanted to fill the order they have bar stock stacked to the rafters they cant get it delivered they wanted to let me have the whole order but a transport inspector stationed there wouldnt let us have the whole hundred bars because the other transport companies are supposed to get their equal loads but their wagons are broken down so ishaqs wagons arent allowed to take more than their fair share and fifty was their allotment thats right richard said at least until the other companies can move some more goods the blacksmith nodded the foundry is dying to sell me all the iron i can use but i cant get it here im not allowed to transport itto put transport workers like you out of work were it up to me richard said id go back for another load today but they told me they couldnt give me any more until next week at the earliest id suggest you get every transport company you can find to deliver you a wagonload that way youll have a better chance to get what you need the blacksmith smiled for the first time it was amusement at the foolishness of richards idea dont you suppose i already thought of that ive got orders in with them all ishaq is the only one with equipment at the moment the rest are all having wagon problems horse problems or worker problems at least i have fifty bars for you that will only keep me going the rest of the day and for the morning the blacksmith turned this way ill show you where you can stack it he led richard through the congested workshop among the confusion of work and material they went through a door and down a short connecting hall the noise fell away behind they entered a quiet building in back attached but set off on its own the blacksmith unhooked a line attached at a cleat and let down a trapdoor covering a window in the roof light cascaded down into the center of the large room where stood a huge block of marble richard stood staring at the stunning stone heart of a mountain it seemed completely out of place in a blacksmiths workshop there were tall doors at the far end where the monolith had been brought in on skids the rest of the room had space left open all around the towering stone chisels of every sort and varioussize mallets stuck up from slots along the pitch black walls you can put the bars here on the side be careful when you bring them in richard blinked he had almost forgotten the man was there with him still he stared at the lustrous quality of the stone before him ill be careful he said without looking at the blacksmith i wont bang it into the stone as the man started to leave richard asked i told you my name whats yours cascella is there more to it yes mister see that you use it all richard smiled as he followed the man out yes sir mr cascella ah mind if i ask what this is the blacksmith slowed to a stop and turned back he gazed at the marble standing in the light as if it were a woman he loved this is none of your business thats what it is richard nodded i only asked because its a beautiful piece of stone ive never seen marble before it was a statue or made into something mr cascella watched richard watching the stone theres marble all over this site thousands of tons of it this is just one small piece now get my shorted order of iron unloaded by the time richard was done he was soaked in sweat and filthy not only from the iron bars but from the soot of the blacksmiths shop he asked if he could use some of the water in a rain barrel that the men were using to wash in as they were getting ready to leave for the day they told him to go ahead when he finished richard found mr cascella back at the chalkboard alone in the suddenly silent shop making corrections to the drawing and writing numbers down the side mr cascella im finished i kept the bars well off to the side away from the marble thank you he mumbled mind if i ask what you will have to pay for that fifty bars of iron the glare was back whats it to you from what i heard at the foundry the man there had been hoping to fill the whole order so he could get three point five gold marks so since you got half your order i believe you will be paying one point seven five gold marks for the fifty bars of iron am i correct the glare darkened like i said whats it to you richard put his hands in his back pockets well i was wondering if you would be willing to buy another fifty bars for one point five gold marks so youre a thief too no mr cascella im not a thief then how are you going to sell me iron for a quarter mark less than the foundry is selling it for you smelting a little iron ore in your room at night mr richard cypher do you want to hear what i have to say or not his mouth twisted in annoyance balk the foundry man was furious because he wasnt allowed to transport your whole order he has more iron than he can sell because he isnt allowed to transport it and the transport companies are all jammed up so they arent showing up he said he would be willing to sell it to me for less why he needs the money he showed me his cold blast furnaces he owes wages and needs charcoal and ore and quicksilver among other things but hasnt enough money to buy it all the only thing he has plenty of is smelted metal his business is strangling because he cant move his product i asked what price he would be willing to sell me iron for if he didnt have to transport itif i picked it up myself he told me that if i came after dark he would sell me fifty bars for one point two five gold marks if youre willing to buy it from me for one point five ill have you another fifty bars by morning when you said you need it the man gaped as if richard was a bar of iron that had just come to life before his eyes and started talking you know im willing to pay one and threequarters why would you offer to sell it to me for one and a half because richard explained i want to sell it for less than youd have to pay through a transport company so that youll buy it from me instead and because i need you to loan me the one and a quarter gold marks first so i can buy the bars in the first place and bring them to you the foundry will only sell them to me if i pay when i come to take them whats to keep you from disappearing with my one and a quarter gold marks my word the man barked a laugh your word i dont know you i told you my name is richard cypher ishaq is scared to death of you and he trusted me to get you the iron so you wont come wring his neck mr cascella smiled again id not wring ishaqs neck i like the fellow hes stuck in a tight spot but dont you tell him i said that id like to keep him on his toes richard shrugged if you dont want me to i wont tell him you know how to smile i know though that youre in a tighter spot than ishaq you have to deliver goods for the order but youre at the mercy of their methods he smiled again so richard cypher what time will you be here with your wagon i dont have a wagon but if you agree ill have your fifty iron bars right thererichard pointed at a spot out the double doors beside where jori had parked the wagonin a pile by dawn mr cascella frowned if you dont have a wagon how you going to get the bars here walk thats right are you out of your mind i dont have a wagon and i want to earn the money its not all that far i figure i can carry five at a time that only makes ten trips i can do that by dawn im used to walking tell me the rest of itwhy you want to do this the truth now my wife isnt getting enough to eat the workers group assesses most of my wages since im able to produce and gives it to those who dont work because i can work ive become a slave to those who cant or who dont wish to their methods encourage people to find an excuse to let others take care of them i intensely dislike being a slave i figure i can entice you to go along with the deal by offering you a better price we each gain a benefit value for value if i were to go along what do you plan to do with all that moneygo live off it for a while drink it away i need the money to buy a wagon and a team of horses the frown knotted tighter what do you need with a wagon i need the wagon to deliver you all the iron youre going to buy from me because i can get it for you cheaper and because i can deliver it when you need it you looking to get buried in the sky richard smiled no i just happen to think that the emperor wants his palace built from what ive heard they have a lot of slave labor down therepeople theyve captured but they dont have enough slave labor to do it all for them they need people like you and the foundries if the officials of the order want to have the work progressand not have to explain to emperor jagang why it isnt they will be inclined to look the other way in that narrow crack of need there is opportunity i expect ill have to bribe a few officials to get them to be busy elsewhere when i come to pick up loads but ive already figured that cost into it ill be acting on behalf of myself not an established transport company so they will be more inclined to see this as a way of accomplishing what they need without suspending their morass of restrictions you will be getting iron for less than you pay now and i can deliver you cant even get what you need at the higher price you will make more too we both benefit the blacksmith stared for a moment as he tried to find a flaw in richards plan youre either the stupidest crook i ever saw or the i dont even know what but i have brother narev breathing down my neck and that isnt pleasant not pleasant at all i probably shouldnt tell you this but you know how ishaq sweats over me i sweat ten times that much when brother narev comes to ask why the tools arent ready the brothers dont want to hear my troubles they just want what they want i understand mr cascella he let out a sigh all right richard cypher one and a half gold marks for fifty bars delivered by dawn tomorrowbut ill only give you the one and a quarter now you get the other quarter mark in the morning when my iron is here agreed who is this brother narev anyway brother narev hes the high priest did i hear someone mention my name the voice was deep enough to nearly rattle the tools off the walls richard and the blacksmith turned to see a man approaching from around the corner of the shop here and there his heavy robes betrayed his large bony frame his face seemed to pull the gathering darkness into the deep creases of his face dark eyes gleamed out from under a hooded brow overspread with a tangle of graying hairs wiry hair above his ears curled up from under the edges of a dark creased cap the cap sat halfway down his forehead he looked like a shadow come to life to stalk the world mr cascella bowed richard followed his lead we were just discussing the problem of getting enough iron brother narev where are all my new chisels blacksmith i have yet to i have stone sitting down there with no chisels to cut it i have stonecutters who need more tools you are holding up my palace the blacksmith lifted a hand toward richard this is richard cypher brother narev he was just telling me how he thought he might be able get me the iron i need and the high priest held up his hand for silence you can get the blacksmith what he needs brother narev snapped at richard it can be done then do it richard bowed his head by your command brother narev the shadowed figure turned to the shop show me blacksmith the blacksmith seemed to know what the high priest wanted and followed behind him gesturing for richard to come along richard understood he couldnt get the money to buy the iron until the blacksmith first took care of the important man who had just vanished into the shadows of the shop when the blacksmith snapped his fingers and pointed at a lamp on his way by richard snatched it up he lit a long splinter in the glowing coals of the forge and then lit the lamp he held it up behind the two men as they stood just inside the doorway to the room with the complex contraption of metal bars sitting on the floor beyond mr cascella held the chalkboard up in the light brother narev looked at the drawing on the chalkboard then to the maze of iron lines on the floor comparing them richard felt an icy tingle at the base of his scalp when he suddenly realized what the thing on the floor was brother narev pointed to the drawing to the line richard had said was wrong this line is wrong brother narev growled the blacksmith wagged his finger over the chalk drawing but i have to stabilize this mass over here i told you to add braces i didnt invite you to ruin the main scheme you can leave the top of the support where you have it but the bottom should be attached here brother narev pointed to where richard had said it should go mr cascella scratched his head of short hair as he stole a glance over his shoulder just long enough to scowl at richard that would work the blacksmith conceded it wont be as easy but it will work im not concerned with how easy it is brother narev said with menace i dont want anything attached to this area here no sir it must be seamless so none of the joining work shows through when it is covered in gold get me those tools made first yes brother narev the high priest turned an uncomfortable scrutiny on richard theres something about you do i know you no brother narev ive never before met you i would remember meeting a great man such as yourself i mean i would remember such a thing he glared askance at richard yes i suppose you would you get the blacksmith his iron i said i would the brother grunted irritably so you did as the tall shadow of a man stared into richards eyes richard absently reached to lift his sword a little to make sure it was clear in its scabbard the sword wasnt there brother narev opened his mouth to say something but his attention was caught by two young men entering the shop they wore robes like the high priest but without caps they had simple hoods pulled up over their heads instead brother narev one called what is it neal the book you sent for has arrived you asked that we come for you at once brother narev nodded to the young disciple then directed a sour look at mr cascella and richard get it done he said to both both richard and the blacksmith bowed their heads as the high priest swept out of the shop it felt as if a thundercloud had just departed over the horizon come on mr cascella said ill get you the gold richard followed him into a little room where the master blacksmith pulled out a strongbox attached with massive chain to a huge pin in the floor under the plank serving as his desk he unlocked the strongbox and handed richard a gold mark victor richard looked up from the gold mark and frowned what victor you asked what more there was to my name he set silver to make up the quarter mark on top of the gold mark resting in richards palm victor chapter after leaving ishaqs place and before going to get the iron for victor richard rushed back to his room it wasnt dinner he wanted but to let nicci know that he had to go back to work she had in the past made it clear that they were husband and wife and that she would take a dim view of him vanishing he was to remain in alturrang and work just like any other normal man kamil and one of his friends were waiting for him both were wearing shirts richard stood at the foot of the stairs looking up at the two im sorry kamil but i have to go back to work then youre a bigger dupe than i thoughttaking work at night too you should just stop trying its no use trying in life you just have to take what life gives you i knew you would have an excuse not to do what you said you would do you almost had me thinking that you might be different than i was going to say that i have to go back to work so we have to do this right away kamil twisted his mouth as was his habit to express his displeasure with those older and stupider than he this is nabbi he wants to watch your foolish labor too richard nodded not showing any irritation at kamils arrogant attitude glad to meet you nabbi the third young man glared from the shadows back by the stairs in the hall he was the biggest he wasnt wearing a shirt to pry the steps apart richard used his knife and a rusty metal bar kamil found for him it wasnt difficultthey were ready to fall apart on their own as the two youths watched richard cleaned the grooves in the stringers since they were chewed up from being loose he deepened their bottoms showing the two what he was doing and explaining how he would bevel the ends of the treads to lock into the deepened channel richard watched kamil and nabbi as they whittled wedges to match the one he made as a pattern for them they were only too delighted to show him their knife work richard was delighted that it helped get the job done sooner once they had them back together kamil and nabbi both ran up and down the repaired steps apparently surprised that they really were now sturdy underfoot and pleased that they were partly responsible for the repair you both did a good job richard told them because they had they didnt make any smart remarks they actually smiled richards dinner was watery millet eaten by the light of a burning wick floating in linseed oil the smell from the simple light went poorly with dinner which was more water than millet nicci said shed already eaten and didnt want any more she encouraged him to finish it he didnt give nicci the details of his second job she was insistent only that he work the work itself was irrelevant to her she tended to her household chores and expected him to earn them a living she seemed satisfied that he was learning how ordinary people had to work themselves sick just to make enough to get along in life the promise of money to buy them more food seemed to spark a longing in her eyes that her lips did not express he noticed that the black material covering her once full bosom was now slack and half empty her elbows and hands had become bony as he took another spoonful of millet nicci casually mentioned that the landlord kamils father had come by richard looked up from his soup what did he say he said that since you have a job the area citizens building committee had assessed us extra rent in order to help pay the rent of those in the local buildings who cant work you see richard how life under the ways of the order cultivates caring in people so that we all work together for the benefit of all nearly all of what was not taken by the workers group was taken by the area building committee or some other committee and all for the same purpose for the betterment of the people of the order richard and nicci had next to nothing left for food richards clothes were getting looser all the time but not as loose as niccis dresses were getting she seemed smug about the fact that their rent was past due foodstuffs at least were relatively inexpensivewhen they were available people said that it was only by the grace of the creator and the wisdom of the order that they could afford any food at all richard had heard talk at ishaqs place that more plentiful and varied food could be had for a price richard didnt have the price on his wagon ride with jori to the foundry and the blacksmith richard had spotted distant houses that looked to be quite grand welldressed people walked those streets occasionally he saw them in carriages they were people who neither dirtied their hands or soiled their morals with business they were men of principle they were officials of the order who saw to it that those with the ability sacrificed for the cause of the order selfsacrifice is the moral duty of all people she said in challenge to his clenched teeth richard could not hold his tongue selfsacrifice is the obscene and senseless suicide of slaves nicci gaped at him it was as if he had just said that a mothers milk was poison to her newborn richard i do believe that thats the cruelest thing ive ever heard you say its cruel to say that i would not happily sacrifice myself for that thug gadi or for some other thug i dont know its cruel not to willingly sacrifice whats mine to any greedy wretch who lusts to possess plundered goods the unearned even at the cost of their victims blood selfsacrifice for a value held dear for a life held dear for freedom and the freedom of those you respectselfsacrifice such as mine for kahlans lifeis the only rationally valid sacrifice to be selfless means you are a slave who must surrender your most priceless possessionyour lifeto any smirking thief who demands it the suicide of selfsacrifice is but a requirement imposed by masters on slaves since there is a knife to my throat it is not to my good that i am stripped of what i earn by my own hand and mind it is only to the good of the one with the knife and those who by weight of numbers but not reason dictate what is the good of all those cheering him on so they might lap up any drop of blood their masters miss life is precious thats why sacrifice for freedom is rational it is for life itself and your ability to live it that you act since life without freedom is the slow sure death of selfsacrifice to the good of mankindwho is always someone else mankind is just a collection of individuals why should everyones life be more important more precious more valuable than yours mindless mandatory selfsacrifice is insane she stared not at him but at the flame dancing on the pool of linseed oil you dont really mean that richard youre just tired and angry that you have to work at night too just to get by you should realize that all those others you help are there to help society including you should you be the one in desperate need richard didnt bother to argue with her and said only i feel sorry for you nicci you dont even know the value of your own life sacrifice could mean nothing to you thats not true richard she whispered i sacrifice for you i saved what millet we had for you that you might have strength the strength to stand upright when i throw my life away why did you sacrifice your dinner nicci because it was the right thing to doit was for the good of others he nodded as he peered at her in the dim light you would endanger your life to starvation for othersfor any others he pointed a thumb back over his shoulder how about that thug gadi would you starve to death so he might eat it might mean something nicci if it was a sacrifice for someone you value but it isnt its a sacrifice to some mindless gray ideal of the order when she didnt answer richard pushed the rest of his dinner before her i dont want your meaningless sacrifice she stared at the bowl of millet for an eternity richard felt sorry for her for what she couldnt understand as she stared at the bowl he thought about what would happen to kahlan if nicci were to fall sick from not getting enough to eat eat nicci he said softly she finally picked up her spoon and did as he said when she had finished she looked up with those blue eyes that seemed so eager for the sight of something he could not make her see she slid the empty bowl to the center of the table thank you richard for the meal why thank me i am a selfless slave expected to sacrifice for any worthless person who presents their need to me he strode to the door with his hand on the loose knob he turned back i have to go or i will lose my work her big blue eyes were brimming with tears as she nodded richard made the first trip from the foundry through the dark streets to victors shop carrying five bars from windows along the way a few people blinked out at the man lugging a load past they blinked without comprehension at the meaning of what he was doing he was working for nothing but his own benefit bent under the weight richard kept telling himself that carrying five bars each time would make it only ten trips and the less trips the better he carried five the second trip and the third by the fourth time he returned to the foundry he decided that he would have to make an extra trip in order to give himself a break and only carry four bars for a few of the trips he lost track of how many times he went back and forth throughout the empty night the next to last time he struggled to lift but two bars that left three he forced himself to carry all three the last time trading the extra effort for the lesser distance he got the last three bars to victors place before dawn his shoulders were bruised and painful he had to walk all the way to his job at ishaqs place so he couldnt wait for victor to arrive to complete his payment of the last quarter gold mark the day of work was a break from the night of exhausting lugging of iron bars jori didnt talk unless spoken to so richard lay in the wagon bed with a load of charcoal and snatched a few minutes of sleep here and there as the wagon bounced along he only felt relieved that he had done as he had promised as he returned home after an interminable day richard looked up and saw kamil and nabbi standing at the head of the stairs they both had on shirts weve been waiting for you to come home and finish the job kamil said richard swayed on his feet what job the stairs we did that last night you did only the stairs in the front you said you intended to fix the stairs the front is only part of the stairs the back stairs are twice as long and in worse shape than the front were you dont want your wife and the other women of the building to fall and break their necks when they go out back to the cooking hearth or the privy do you this was their idea of a little test richard knew he would lose an opportunity if he put them off he was so tired he couldnt think straight nicci stuck her head out the front door i thought i heard your voice come in to dinner i have soup waiting on you got any tea nicci cast a sidelong glance at the two in shirts i can make tea come on and ill get it while you have your soup please bring it out to the back richard said i promised to fix the stairs now there are still a couple hours of light i can eat while were working kamil and nabbi asked more questions than the evening before the third youth gadi passed by occasionally as richard and the other two worked gadi without his shirt made a point of looking nicci up and down when she brought richard his soup and tea when richard had finally finished he went to the room that had once been ishaqs parlor and was now his and niccis home he took off his shirt and splashed water on his face from the washbasin his head was throbbing wash your hair nicci said youre filthy i dont want lice in here rather than argue that he had no lice richard dipped his face in the water and scrubbed his head with the cake of coarse soap it was easier than talking her out of it so he could go to sleep nicci hated lice he was thankful he supposed that she was at least a clean wife in their fraudulent arrangement she kept the room bedding and his clothes clean despite the difficulty of hauling water from the well down the street she never objected to any work necessary to simulate the lives of normal people she seemed to want something so badly that she often lost herself in the role to the extent that while he never forgot she was a sister of the dark and his captor she occasionally did he dunked his head again swishing his hair rinsing out the soap as a stream of water ran off his chin and back into the basin he asked who is brother narev nicci sitting on her pallet sewing paused and looked up her sewing suddenly looked out of place as if her parody of domestic life lost its aura for her why do you ask i met him yesterday out at the blacksmiths out at the site of the project richard nodded i had to deliver iron out there she bent back to her needlework richard watched in the light of the linseedoil lamp sitting beside her as she took a few more stitches in the patch to the knees of a pair of his pants she finally paused and let her arms one sheathed in his pant leg sink to her lap brother narev is the high priest of the fellowship of orderan ancient sect devoted to doing the creators will in this world he is the heart and soul of the ordertheir moral guideso to speak he and his disciples lead the righteous people of the order in the ways of the everlasting light of the creator he is an advisor to emperor jagang richard was taken aback he hadnt expected her to be so versed on the subject his caution along with the hair at the back of his neck lifted what sort of advisor she took another stitch pulling the long thread through brother narev was jagangs pedagoguehis teacher advisor and mentor brother narev put the fire in jagangs belly hes a wizard isnt he it was more statement than question she looked up from her sewing he could see in her blue eyes that she was weighing whether or not to tell him or perhaps how much she wanted to tell him his steady gaze told her that he was expecting the whole truth in the language of the street you could describe him as such what does that mean common people those who understand little about magic would describe him as a wizard strictly speaking though he is not a wizard then what is he strictly speaking actually he is a sorcerer richard could only stare at her he had always assumed that a wizard and a sorcerer were the same thing when he thought about it he realized that people who knew about magic spoke exclusively of a male with the gift as a wizard he had never heard any of those people mention a sorcerer you mean hes like you like a sorceress only male the question stymied her for a moment i suppose you could think of it that way but thats not really right if you want to compare it then you would have to say he has more in common with a wizard since both are male the concept of sorceress introduces irrelevant issues richard swiped water from his face please nicci ive been up all last night working and im dead on my feet dont go all abstract and complex on me just tell me what it means she set her sewing aside and gestured to his pallet for him to sit near her in the light richard pulled his shirt back on he yawned as he crossed his legs under himself on his pallet brother narev is a sorcerer she began im sorry but the distinction is just not something simply explained its a very complex matter i will try to make it as clear as i can but you must understand that i cant boil it down too much or it will lose any real flavor of the truth sorcerers are much the same as wizards but differentin much the way that water and oil are both liquids you might say both pour and can dissolve things but they dont mix and they dissolve different things neither do the magic of a wizard and a sorcerer mix nor do they work on the same things anything he did against a wizards gift or anything a wizard did against his would not work while both are the gift they are different aspectsthey dont mix the magic of each nullifies the other making it just sort of fizzle you mean like additive and subtractive are opposites no while on the surface that would seem a good way to understand it its entirely the wrong way to think of it she lifted her hands as if to begin again but then let them drop back into her lap its very hard to explain the difference to one such as you who has little understanding of how his own gift works you have no basis in which to ground anything i could tell you there are no words which are both accurate and which you would understand this is beyond your understanding well do you mean that much like a wolf and a cougar are both predators they are not the same sort of creature thats a little closer to it how common are these sorcerers about as common as dream walkers she said as she gave him a meaningful look or war wizards even though he couldnt understand it and she couldnt explain it richard for some reason found that bit of news troubling what is it though that he does differently nicci let out a sigh im no expert and im not entirely sure but i believe he does the same basic sort of things a wizard would do but just does them with a sorcerers unique quality of magicliquor and ale both get you drunk but they are different kinds of drink made from different things one of those is stronger not so with wizards and sorcerers do you see why words and these kinds of comparisons are so inadequate the strength of a wizard and sorcerers gift is dependent on the individual it is not influenced by the fundamental nature of his magic richard scratched his stubble as he considered her words in view of the fact that both could do magic he couldnt come up with any distinction that seemed of any practical importance is there anything that he can do that a wizard cant he waited she didnt look like she was thinking about his question but more like she was considering whether she wanted to answer it at all nicci you told me when you first captured me that you would tell me the truth about things you said you had no reason to deceive me she watched his eyes but finally looked away as she pulled her blond hair back from her face the gesture unexpectedly painfully reminded him of kahlan perhaps i believe he may have learned how to replicate the spell that surrounded the palace of the prophets it took wizards thousands of years ago with both sides of the gift to create that particular spell i believe that one of the ways sorcerers are different is that their power is not divisible into its constituent elements as it is in wizards so while his magic works differently he may have learned enough of how the wizardswho at that time possessed both sides of the gift as do youwere able to create the spell around the palace of the prophets to be able to replicate it in his own fashion you mean the spell that slowed aging you think he can cast such a web yes jagang intimated as much to me i knew brother narev when i was young he was a grown man then a visionary preaching the doctrine of the order he spoke pensively about wishing to live long enough to see his vision of the order come to fruition when i was taken to live at the palace in tanimura i believe that may have given him the idea as he not long after went there too the sisters knew nothing of him they thought him no more than a humble worker since his gift is different than that of a wizard they didnt detect his ability i now believe that he went there for the express purpose of studying the spell around the palace of the prophets so that he could recreate such a spell for his own benefit why didnt he storm the palacetake it overand then he could have the spell for his purpose its possible that in the beginning he thought he might one day take over the palace for his causein fact emperor jagang had that exact planbut its also possible that he was from the beginning studying the spell because he wanted not simply to recreate it but to enhance it richard rubbed his brow trying to comfort his aching head you mean that now maybe he thinks he can create the spell over the retreatthe emperors new palacelike that one at the palace of the prophets but better so that aging will be slowed even more so that he and his chosen will live even longer yes dont forget age is relative to one who lives to a thousand years living less than one century would seem all too brief to a person who lives many thousands of years though a lifetime that lasts but a mere one millennium would seem fleeting i suspect that brother narev has learned to slow aging to such an extent that it would make him the next best thing to immortal jagang had planned on capturing the palace of the prophets it might have been that once they secured the palace brother narev intended to augment its spell to suit his purposes but i spoiled that plan nicci nodded as are all of us who were once at the palace brother narev now grows older just like everyone else once away from the spell it feels like a headlong rush toward the grave what youth brother narev has left he is no doubt eager to preserve remaining relatively young forever has much to be said for it remaining old forever would be less attractive because you destroyed the palace of the prophets where he could have had ample time to bring his plan to bear he has been forced to act sooner rather than later richard flopped back on his mat he laid the back of a wrist over his forehead he has the blacksmith making a spellform in iron the blacksmith has no idea what it is hes creating the spellform is to be covered with gold eventually for purity its likely that is merely part of the process it could even be that the goldcovered spellform is nothing more than a pattern from which the true spellform will be cast in pure gold richard squinted in thought if it is a pattern for casting that would make it more likely that narev intends to cast a number of these spellformsthat they will work together nicci looked up and frowned yes that is a possibility will making such a thing harm the blacksmith no it is propitious conjuring disregarding for the moment the purpose for which it is desired such a spell is meant to be beneficial it is to slow aging in order to lengthen life what about brother narevs disciples young wizards from the palace of the prophets alarmed richard sat up i was at the palace of the prophets they will recognize me no they were young wizards in training there but they left to follow brother narev before you arrived if they see you they will not know you if theyre wizards wont they recognize that i have magic a smile of contempt colored her features they are not that talented they are but bugs to what you are richard found no comfort in the compliment wont brother narev or his disciples recognize you her face turned serious oh they would know me it sounds as if brother narev must be strong in his gift wont he be able to recognize that i have the gift he was looking at me strangely he asked if he knew me he sensed something why did you think him a wizard richard picked at the straw stuffing coming out of the pad over his pallet as he considered the question there was nothing that gave it away for a fact but i strongly suspected it from a lot of little things the way he carried himself the way he looked at people the way he spokeeverything about him only after i surmised that narev was a wizard did i realize that the thing the blacksmith was making for him looked like some sort of spellform he would suspect you of being gifted in much the same way can you tell the difference yes ive learned to recognize an ageless look in their eyes i can in some way see the aura of the gift around those in whom it is powerfulyou for instance at times the air crackles around you she stared in fascination ive never heard of such a thing it must have something do to with you having both sides you have both sides dont you see it no but i acquired the subtractive side in a different manner she had given her soul to the keeper of the underworld but you see nothing of the sort in brother narev do you when richard shook his head she went on with her explanation that is because as i explained you have different aspects of the gift other than with your faculty of reason you have no wizardly ability to recognize the gift in him he has no sorcerous ability to recognize the gift in you your magic wont work on one another only your faculty of reason betrayed his gift to you richard realized that without saying it she was telling him that if he didnt want narev to learn that he had the gift then he had better be careful around the man there were times when he thought he had her game figured out there were times like now when it seemed his entire perception of her purpose shifted at times it almost seemed to him as if she threw her beliefs in his face not because she believed them but because she was desperately hoping for a reason not to hoping he would find her in some lost dark world and show her the way out richard sighed inwardly he had given her his arguments as to why her beliefs were wrong but rather than sway her it only angered her at best or worse further entrenched her in her convictions as tired as he was he lay in his bed his eyes but narrow slits watching nicci lit by the light of a single wick bent in concentration over her sewingone of the most powerful women ever to walk the world and she appeared perfectly content to sew a patch in the knee of his pants she accidentally stuck herself with the needle as she shook her hand and winced with the pain richard had the sudden cold recollection of the link between her and kahlan his beloved would feel that prick chapter richard took the snowwhite slice when victor held it out whats this try it victor said as he waved an insistent hand eat tell me what you think its from my homeland here a red onion goes well with it the white slice was smooth dense and rich with salt and herbs richard let out a rapturous moan he rolled his eyes victor this is the best thing ive ever had what is it lardo they sat on the threshold of the double doors out of the room with the marble monolith watching dawn break over the site where the walls of the retreat had begun to rise only a few people stirred below before long laborers would arrive in great numbers to begin again their work on the retreat it went on every day without pause rain or shine now that spring was wearing on the weather was pleasant nearly every day with afternoon rains every few days but nothing dreary or oppressivejust enough to wash you clean and make you feel refreshed if not for the everpresent ache of missing kahlan his worry over the war far to the north his loathing of being held prisoner the slave labor at the site the abuse of people the people who disappeared or those who confessed under torture and the grindingly repressive nature of life in alturrang he might have found the spring quite enjoyable day by day too his worry grew that kahlan would soon be able to leave their mountain home he dreaded her getting caught up in such a war as would be soon be roaring into full flame after he had eaten some of the mild onion richard went back to the delightful lardo he moaned again victor ive never tasted anything like this whats lardo victor held out another thin slice richard gladly accepted after a long night of work the dense delicacy was really hitting the spot victor gestured with his knife to the tin beside him holding the pure white block lardo is paunch fat from the boar and this tin of it is from your homeland no noi make it myself i come from far to the south of here far awaynear the sea that is where we make lardo when i come here i make it here i put the paunch fat in tubs i carved myself out of marble as white as the lardo victor gestured with his hands as he spoke working the air as vigorously as he worked iron the fat is put in the tubs with coarse salt and rosemary and other spices from time to time i turn it in the brine it must rest a year in the stone to cure to became lardo a year victor nodded emphatically this we are eating i made last spring my father taught me to make lardo lardo is something only men make my father was a quarry worker lardo gives quarry workers the stamina they need to work long hours sawing blocks of our marble or swinging a pickaxe for blacksmiths too lardo gives you power to lift a hammer all day so there are quarries where you lived he waved his thick hand at the towering block behind them this this is cavatura marblefrom my homeland he pointed out at several of the stock areas below that there and there is marble from cavatura too thats where youre from cavatura victor grinned like a wolf as he nodded the place where all that beautiful marble came from our city gets its name from the marble quarries my family are all carvers or quarry workers me i end up a blacksmith making tools for them blacksmiths are sculptors he grunted a laugh and you where are you from me far away they had no marble there only granite richard changed the subject lest he have to start inventing lies besides it was getting light so victor when do you need more of that special steel tomorrow are you up to it the steel victor needed was from farther away at a foundry out near the charcoal makers they needed a lot of charcoal to cook with the iron to make highgrade steel ore came in by barge from not far away it would take most of the night for richard to get there and back sure i will be sick today and get some sleep he had become sick quite a lot over the last several months it fit right in with the way most of the others worked work some be sick tell the workers group that you were ailing some people limped in with a story it wasnt necessary the workers group never questioned the only thing he rarely missed were the meetings where those with bad attitudes were named people at the meetings were often named but you were more likely to bring attention if you missed the meetings those named were often subsequently arrested and given an opportunity to confess more than once a person named at a meeting as having an unsatisfactory attitude killed themselves one of brother narevs disciples neal came around last evening with some new orders victors voice had taken on a tense edge what you just brought will last me the day but i need that steel by tomorrow you will have it are you sure have i ever let you down victor victors hard face melted into a helpless smile he passed richard another slice of lardo no richard you never have not once i had given up hope of ever meeting another man who kept his word well id best be off and take care of my horses theyve had a hard night and ill need them rested for tonight how much steel do you need two hundred half square and half round richard performed a pained moan youre going to make me strong or kill me victor victor smiled his approval you want the gold no you can pay me when i deliver richard no longer needed the money in advance he had a heavy wagon now and a strong team of horses he paid ishaq to care for them along with the transport companys teams in the company stables ishaq helped richard with any number of the special arrangements that hed had to make ishaq knew which officials lived in the nice homes they couldnt afford those homes with just their pay as officials of the order you be careful of neal richard said whys that for some reason he believes im in need of lecturing he truly believes that the order is mankinds savior he puts the good of the fellowship of order above the good of mankind victor sighed as he stood and tied on his leather apron my thoughts about him too as they passed into the building the sun was just lighting the marble standing there richard lingered and put a hand to the cold stone as he always did whenever he passed it it almost felt alive to him alive with potential victor i asked you once what this was mind telling me now the blacksmith paused beside richard and gazed up at the pure stone before him he reached out and touched it lightly letting his fingertips glide over the surface testing caressing this is my statue what statue the one i want to carve someday many in my family are carvers as far back as i can remember i always wanted to carve too i wanted to be a great sculptor i wanted to create great works instead i had to work for the master blacksmith at the quarry my family needed to eat i was the oldest living son my father and the blacksmith were friends my father asked the blacksmith to take me on he didnt want another son lost to the stone its a hard and dangerous life cutting stone from a mountain did you carve other things i mean like wood or something victor still staring at his stone shook his head i only wanted to carve stone i bought this block with my savings i own it few men can say they own a part of a mountain a part as pure and beautiful as this richard could understand the sentiments so victor what will you carve out of it he squinted as if trying to peer beyond the surface i dont know they say that the stone will speak to you and tell you what it should be do you believe that victor laughed his deep laugh nonot really but the thing is this is a beautiful piece of stone there is none finer for statues than cavatura marble and few blocks of cavatura marble with as fine a grain as this piece i couldnt bear to see it carved up into something ugly like what they carve nowadays it used to be long ago that only beauty was carved from beauty such as this no more he whispered in distant bitterness now man must be carved with a twisted natureas an object of shame richard had delivered tools down to the site for victor down to where the carving was taking place and had had the opportunity to get a closer look at the work being done the outside of the stone walls was to be covered with expansive scenes on a scale that was staggering the walls that would enclose the palace went on for miles the carvings being produced for the retreat were the same as those richard had seen everywhere in the old world but would have no equal in sheer overpowering quantity the entire palace was to be an epic portrayal of the orders view of the nature of life and of redemption in the afterlife of the underworld the figures being carved were stilted with limbs that could not possibly function those carved in relief were forever bound to the stone from which they only haltingly emerged the poses reflected a view of man as ineffective shallow unsubstantial the elements of the hated anatomy of man his muscle bone and flesh were melted together into lifeless limbs their proportions distorted to strip the figures of their humanity expressions were either impassive if the statue was supposed to portray virtue or filled with terror agony torment if intended to illustrate the fate of evildoers proper men and women bent under the weight of labor were always made to look out at the world through the vacant stupor of resignation most often it was difficult to tell male from female their worldly bodies an everlasting source of shame were hidden by bulky garments like those the priests of the order wore further reflecting the orders teachings only the sinful were shown naked so that all could see their detestable cankerous bodies the carvings represented man as helpless doomed by the inadequacy of his intellect to suffer every blow of existence most of the sculptors richard suspected feared to be questioned or even tortured and so repeated the view that man was to be carved accepting his vile nature thus earning his reward only through death the carvings were meant to assure the masses that this was the only proper goal for which man could hope richard knew that a few of the carvers vehemently believed such teachings he was always careful of what he said around them ah richard i wish you could see beautiful statues instead of todays scourge i have seen statues of great beauty richard softly assured the man have you im so glad people should see those things not this thishe waved a hand toward the rising walls of the retreatthis evil in the guise of goodness so you will one day carve such beauty i dont know richard he finally admitted the order takes everything they say that the individual is of no importance except inasmuch as he can contribute to the good of others they take what art can be the lifeblood of the soul and turn it to poison turn it to death victor smiled wistfully this way as it is i can enjoy the beautiful statue inside the stone i understand victori really do the way you describe it i can see it too we will both enjoy my statue the way it is then victor took his hand from the stone and pointed to the base besides you see there there is an imperfection in the stone it runs all the way through that is why i could afford this piece of marblebecause it has this flaw were most anyone to carve this it would endanger the stone if not done just right and with the flaw taken in mind the entire piece could easily shatter i have never been able to think of how to carve this stone to take advantage of its beauty but to also avoid the flaw perhaps someday it will come to you how to carve the stone to create a thing of nobility nobility ali but wouldnt that be somethingthe most sublime form of beauty he shook his head but i will not do it not unless the revolt comes revolt victors careful gaze swept the hillside through the open door the revolt it will come the order cannot standevil cannot stand not forever anyway in my homeland when i was young there used to be beauty and there used to be freedom they were shamed into giving up their lives their freedom bit by bit to the cause of fairness to all men people didnt know what they had and let freedom slip away for nothing but the hollow promise of a better world a world without effort without struggle to achieve without productive work it was always someone else who would do these things who would provide who would make their lives easy we used to be a land of abundance now what food is grown rots while it awaits committees to decide who should have it who should move it and what it should cost meanwhile people starve insurgents those disloyal to the order are blamed for all the starvation and strife that slowly destroys us and so ever more people are arrested and put to death we are a land of death the order continually proclaims its feelings for mankind but their ways can but cultivate death on my way here i have seen corpses by the thousands go uncounted and unburied the new world is blamed for every ill every failure and young men eager to smite their oppressors march off to war many people though have come to see the truth they and the children of these peopleme and others like mehunger for freedom to live our own lives rather than be slaves to the order and their reign of death there is unrest in my homeland as there is here a revolt is coming unrest here ive seen no unrest victor smiled a sly smile those with revolt in their hearts do not show their true feelings the order always fearful of insurrection tortures confessions from those they wrongly arrest every day more are put to death those who want things to change know better than to make themselves targets before the time has come someday richard revolt will come richard shook his head i dont know victor revolt takes resolve i dont think such real resolve exists you have seen people who are unhappy with the way things are ishaq those at the foundries my men and me all those you deal with other than the officials you bribe hunger for change victor lifted an eyebrow at richard not one of them complains to any board or committee about what you do you may want nothing to do with it as i believe is your right but there are those who listen to the whispers of the freedom to the north richard tensed freedom to the north victor nodded solemnly they speak of a savior richard rahl he leads them in the fight for freedom they say that this richard rahl will bring us our revolt had it not all been so overwhelmingly tragic richard would have burst out laughing how do you know this rahl character is worth following victor fixed richard with a look that richard remembered from the first time he met the blacksmith you can judge a man by his enemies richard rahl is hated by the emperor and by brother narev and by his disciples as no other man is hated he is the one he bears the torch of revolution richard could muster only a desolate smile he is but a man my friend dont worship a man worship his cause but not him victors glare so full of his emotion his burning hunger for freedom turned back to his wolfish grin ah but that is what richard rahl would say that is why he is the one richard thought it would be best to change the subject he saw that it was getting light well i have to get going im sure youll figure out what to do with the stone victor it will come to you when the time is right the blacksmith feigned a scowl but it was a poor spoof of the very real one that had just departed that is always what i thought too richard scratched his head have you ever carved anything victor no nothing are you sure you are able to carve that you have the ability victor tapped his temple as if to dissuade a skeptic in here i have ability in here i have beauty that is all that matters to me if i never touch steel to this stone then i will always have the beauty of what it could be and that the order can never take away from me chapter nicci wiped the sweat off her brow as she went down the line checking to see if her clothes were dry summer was only around the corner and it was already hot her back hurt from her earlier work at the washtub and various other chores the other women were chatting in the warm sunshine they occasionally giggled over some quirk that one of them after a round of amiable urging would divulge about her husband everyone in the building it seemed had begun coming alive along with the new spring growth nicci knew that spring had nothing to do with it that knowledge drew frustration up from her darkest recesses she couldnt figure out how richard did it no matter how hard she tried she just couldnt unravel the knot he seemed to tie around everything she was beginning to believe that if she took him down into the deepest cave she could find the sunlight would make its way into the darkest recesses to shine on him she would think it was some kind of magical luck except she knew beyond doubt that he had not used any magic whatsoever the backyard such an overgrown tangled place so filthy with piles of scrap and garbage was now a garden the men who lived in the building after they came home from work had rid the yard of the refuse even several of the ones who didnt work had come out of their rooms to help cart away an item or two after it was cleared out the women of the building had turned the soil and planted a garden they were going to have vegetables vegetables there was talk of getting a few chickens the single latrine off in the back corner so overused and so foul was now two privies in good repair now there was rarely a wait to use a privy and there were no more urgent pleas or frayed tempers kamil and nabbi had helped richard build thempartly out of scraps of lumber salvaged from the refuse piles in the yard before they were hauled away and some they collected from other rubbish heaps nicci had hardly believed her eyes when she had seen kamil and nabbiin shirtsdigging the holes for the new privies everyone thanked them profusely the two toughs beamed with pride the outdoor cooking hearth had been repaired so the women could set more pots in it and cook at the same time requiring less wood to be hauled richard and some of the other men of the building built stands for the washtubs so the wives wouldnt have to bend so far or chafe their knees raw the men made a simple roof of canvas salvaged from the refuse so that the women could cook and wash without getting wet when it rained the people in the buildings to either side at first surly and suspicious of the activity began asking curt questions richard kamil and nabbi went over and explained what they had done and how they could put their place in shape too and even helped them get started nicci had yelled at richard for spending his time at other peoples places he said that she was the one who had told him that it was his duty to help others nicci had no answerat least none that made any sense so as she could say it aloud and not sound a fool when richard showed people how to improve their homes he didnt lecture or teach but rather somehownicci couldnt understand howmanaged to infect them with his enthusiasm he hadnt told them what to do but rather hed made them pant to figure out for themselves how they could make things better for themselves everybody took a liking to richard it made her growl under her breath nicci collected her washing in the woven basket richard had shown the women of the building how to make from thin strips of wood nicci had to admit that the basket was easy enough to make and a better way to lug clothes she climbed the sturdy stairsstairs that shed once thought would be the end of her the hallway inside was spotless the floors had been washed somewhere richard had come up with ingredients for paint and the men had a grand time of mixing it up and painting over the stains on the walls one of the men in the building knew about roofs so he fixed the roof so it wouldnt leak and stain the walls again as nicci walked down the hall she saw gadi without his shirt sitting up the stairway in the shadows he was using his big knife to whittle at a piece of wood and in so doing make clear his dangerous nature later the women living in the building would tsk and clean it up gadi not happy about people nagging at him of late leered down at her she now had something for him to leer at now that she had gained her weight back richards second job at night enabled him to be able to afford more food he brought home things she had missed for monthschicken oil spices bacon cheese and eggs she could never find such things in the city stores nicci had thought they sold the same food everywhere in the city shops but richards travels while delivering things he said took him to places where they sold a wider variety of food kamil and nabbi sitting on the front steps saw her through the open door they stood and bowed politely as she came down the hall good evening mrs cypher kamil said could we help you carry that nabbi asked she found it all the more irritating because she knew for a fact that they were sincere they liked her because she was richards wife thank you no im there now they held the door for her and closed it behind her when she had passed into her room she thought of them as richards soldiers he seemed to have a private army of people who broke into grins when they saw him coming most people seemed only too pleased to do whatever they thought richard might like done kamil and nabbi would have washed diapers if he asked it for the chance to ride with him at night in the wagon as he picked up and delivered things around alturrang he only rarely took them with him saying that he could get in trouble with the workers group the youths didnt want richard to get in trouble and lose his job so they patiently waited for the rare times when he tilted his head for them to come along their room had been transformed the ceiling had been cleaned and whitewashed the flyblown walls had been scrubbed and painted a salmon colora color she had picked thinking that richard would not possibly be able to come up with the rare ingredients needed for the color the walls were now mockingly salmon one day a man had shown up with an armload of tools kamil said that richard had sent him over to fix their room the man spoke a language nicci didnt understand he waved his arms a lot and chattered and laughed goodnaturedly as if she must understand at least a little of what he told her he pointed around at walls and asked questions she hadnt the foggiest notion of what he was there to do she suspected he had come to fix the wobbly table she rapped the top with the flat of her hand and then showed him how it wobbled he nodded and grinned and chattered she finally left him to his work while she went to the city store to wait in line to buy bread she was there the entire morning in the afternoon she waited in line for millet when nicci finally returned home the man was gone the old window broken and not only long painted over but also painted shut had new glass and it was raised and they had a new window in the other wall both windows were open a cool crossbreeze let fresh air into the stuffy room nicci stood in the center of the room stunned to be looking through the window to the building next door she gaped out the window in the wall where there had been no window before she was able to see the street mrs sharim from next door had smiled and waved as shed walked past nicci set down the wash basket and opened the window at the side to get some air into the stifling room she pushed the curtains back with windows you could see though she had decided that curtains were in order richard somehow got her fabric when she was finished he told her she had done a wonderful job nicci found herself grinning just as everyone else grinned when richard told them they had done well she had brought richard to the worst place in the old world to the worst building she could find and he somehow ended up making everything better just as she had insisted was his duty but she had never meant it to be like this she didnt know what shed meant she only knew that she lived for the times richard was with her even though she knew he hated her and wanted nothing more than to be away from her and back with his kahlan nicci could not help feeling her heart rise into her throat when he came home through the link to kahlan she thought that at times she could feel the womans longing for him every inch of her ached with understanding of kahlans longing the room grew darker as she waited life didnt start until richard came home as the daylight faded the lamplight took its place they had a real lamp now not just a wick through a wooden button floating in linseed oil the door opened richard put one foot inside he was speaking to kamil as the young man was going off to his familys place upstairs it was getting late finally still smiling richard came in and shut the door the smile faded as it always did he held out a burlap sack i came across some onions carrots and some pork i thought you might like to make a stew nicci lifted a hand weekly toward the millet she had spent the afternoon in line to buy it had bugs in it it was moldy i bought millet i thought i would make you a soup richard shrugged if you prefer your millet soup saw us through some pretty lean times nicci felt that flash of pride that he had acknowledged what she had done as valuable she shut the windows it was dark out with her back to the windows as she watched him she closed the curtains tight richard stood in the center of the room watching her a puzzled frown creasing his brow between his eyes nicci closed the distance to him she was aware of the exposed flesh of her bosom rising and falling above the top of her black dress gadi had just been staring at her bosom she wanted richard to stare at her like that richard watched only her eyes her fingers tightened around his muscled arms make love to me she whispered his brow drew down what richard i want you to make love to me now he appraised her eyes for an eternity her heart thundered in her ears every fiber of her being screamed out for him to take her she teetered on the edge waiting her life suspended in the exquisite anguish of expectation his voice came not at all harsh if anything it was tender but it was also resolute no nicci felt as if a thousand needles of ice were dancing up her arms his refusal stunned her no man had ever refused her it hurt to her core worse than anything jagang or any other man had ever done she had thought blood rushed to her face melting the ice in a flash of heat nicci flung open the door come out into the hall and wait she commanded in a shaky voice he was standing in the center of their room looking into her eyes the lamp on the table cast harsh shadows across his face his shoulders looked so broad tapering down to his waist a waist she ached to encircle with her arms she wanted to scream instead she spoke softly but with authority he could not mistake you will come out into the hall and wait or nicci made a snipping gesture with two fingers by the look in his eyes he knew that she was not bluffing kahlans life now hung by a thread and if he didnt do as she ordered she would not hesitate to cut that thread with his gray eyes on her the whole time richard stepped out into the hall she put a finger to the center of his chest and pushed until his back was against the wall beside their door you are to wait right there on that spot until i tell you that you may move from it she gritted her teeth or kahlan will die do you understand nicci youre better than this think about what youre or kahlan will die do you understand he let out a breath yes nicci marched to the stairwell gadi stood halfway up the stairs his dark eyes watching he arrogantly descended toward her until he was at the bottom with her he had a fine form she supposed displayed as it was without a shirt he was close enough to feel the heat of him nicci looked him in the eye he was the same height as she i want you to have sex with me what my husband does not adequately take care of my needs i wish you to a smirk spread on his face as his gaze slid to richard he looked back at her bosom at what was within his power to possess gadi was young and bold and stupid enough to believe himself irresistible to her to believe his puerile primping had swept away her inhibitions to the point of helpless lust for what he had to offer one arm pulled her to him with his other hand he swept her hair out of the way his thin lips kissed her neck when his teeth raked her flesh she moaned to encourage him to be rough the last thing in the world she wanted was tenderness there could be no retribution in tenderness tenderness would not cleave richards soul with anguish tenderness would not hurt him gadis hands squeezed her bottom pulling her hard against his groin he moved against her in a lewd fashion she panted in his ear to encourage his confidence in his dominion over her body tell me why im sick of his gentle nature his kind touch his caring ways thats not what a real woman needs i want him to know what a real man can doi want what he cant give me she nearly cried out in pain when he twisted her nipple yeah yes i want what a real man like you can do for a woman his rough hands squeezed her breast she performed another moan he smiled my pleasure his smirk sickened her no mine she whispered in breathy submission he cast one more hateful glare at richard then bent to slip a hand up the front of her dress to see if she really meant it if she would really let him have his way with her his hand slid up the inside of her bare thigh commanding surrender she obediently parted her legs for him nicci held on to his shoulders as he groped her his upper lip curled in a haughty grin his fingers worked without mercy her eyes watered she trembled and bit the inside of her cheek to hold back her cry mistaking agony for lust he was inflamed by her whimpers jagang and his friend kadar kardeef to name but a few took her without her consent none of it had ever approached the sense of violation she felt at that moment as she stood there in the hall letting that smirking little thug do to her as he would she forced her hand down between them and seized him gadi are you afraid of richard are are you man enough to take me while he is outside the room listening to us knowing you are his better with me afraid of him his voice came in a husky growl just tell me when right now i need it from you now gadi i thought so nicci smiled inwardly at his solemn look of lust say please first you little whore please she ached only to crush his worthless skull please gadi with his arm around her waist gadi gave richard a taunting sneer as he swaggered past niccis fingers on gadis back urged him to go on into their room and wait he smiled over his shoulder and did as she wanted nicci paused to glare into richards eyes we are linked what happens to me happens to her i hope you are not foolish enough to think i wouldnt make you sorry for the rest of your days if you dont stay right there i swear to you she will die this night if you dont stay there nicci please dont do this youre only hurting yourself his voice was so tender so compassionate she almost threw her arms around him to beg him to stop her but the flame of his refusal still burned shamefully in her heart nicci turned back from the doorway and gave richard a vicious grin i hope your kahlan enjoys this as much as im going to enjoy it after tonight she will never believe in you again kahlan gasped her eyes opened she could only make out obscure shapes in the swirling darkness she gasped again a feeling she couldnt define couldnt interpret couldnt put a nature to welled up in her it was something totally foreign yet at the same time bewitchingly familiar something inappropriate yet longed for it filled her with a kind of passionate terror that undulated seductively to indecent pleasure pushing before it a sense of shapeless dread she felt the weight of a shadow over her feelings and sensations she could not grasp or control inundated her even as she fought them nothing seemed real she gasped again at the crude sensation it confused her it hurt and at the same time she felt a kind of wild hunger awakening it was as if richard were there in bed with her it felt so good again she was panting her mouth was dry as dust in richards intimate embrace she had always felt a kind of expectant delight that their shameless lust could never be completely satedthat there was always a spark of something left to explore to reach toward to define she had always exalted in the idea of that endless quest for the unattainable she drew a sharp breath she felt herself in that headlong rush now but this was something she had never imagined her fists clutched at the sheets her mouth opened in a silent scream against the ripping thrust of pain this was not human it made no sense she gasped again in panic as the most awful feelings burgeoned through her she moaned at the horror of it at the hint of pleasure in it and at the confusion of nearly enjoying the sensation the realization came to her she knew what this meant tears stung her eyes she rolled onto her side torn between the joy of feeling richard and the pain of knowing that nicci was feeling him in this way too she was slammed onto her back she gasped again her eyes going wide her whole body rigid she cried out at the pain she twisted and struggled covering her breasts with her arms her eyes watered at agony she couldnt explain or completely identify she missed richard so much she wanted him so badly it hurt she gave in to him even in this she surrendered herself to him a low wail escaped her throat her muscles knotted as tight as oak roots she was racked with wave after wave of startling pain mixed with an unsatisfied longing that had turned to revulsion she couldnt get her breath she burst into tears as it ceased her body finally able to move again but too exhausted to do so she had hated every violent appalling brutal second of it and grieved that it had ended because she had at least felt him she felt joy that she had so unexpectedly sensed him and blind rage at what it meant she clutched the sheets in her fists as she wept inconsolably mother confessor a dark form slipped into the tent mother confessor it was caras whisper cara set a candle on the table the light seemed blindingly bright as cara looked down mother confessor are you all right kahlan pulled a ragged breath she was lying on her back in her bed tangled in her blanket it was twisted around between her legs maybe it was just a dream she wished it was she knew it wasnt kahlan ran her fingers back into her hair as she sat up cara it came out as a choking sob cara knelt on the ground beside her and gripped kahlans shoulders what is it kahlan struggled to get her breath whats wrong what can i do are you hurt are you sick oh cara hes been with nicci cara held her at arms length her face a picture of concern what are you talking about whos been her words cut off when she realized what kahlan meant kahlan struggled against caras grip how could he she no doubt made him cara insisted he must have done it to save your life she would have had to threaten him kahlan was shaking her head no no he was enjoying it too much he was like an animal he never took me like that he never acted oh cara hes fallen for her he couldnt resist her any longer hes cara shook her until kahlan thought her teeth would come loose wake up open your eyes mother confessor wake up youre half asleep youre still half dreaming kahlan blinked as she looked around she was panting still getting her breath she had stopped crying cara was right it had happened there was no doubt in kahlans mind but it had happened when she was sleeping and in her sleep it had taken her unaware she hadnt reacted rationally youre right kahlan said in a voice hoarse from crying her nose was stuffed up so that she could only breath through her mouth now cara said in a calm voice tell me what happened when she felt her face go red kahlan wished for the darkness how could she tell anyone what had happened she wished cara hadnt heard her well through the linkkahlan swallowedi could sense that that well that richard made love to nicci cara looked skeptical did it feel like when well i mean are you sure could you tell it was him kahlan felt her face go a darker shade of red not exactly i guess i dont know she covered her breasts i could feel his his teeth on me he was biting cara scratched her head averting her gaze unsure how to frame her question kahlan answered it for her richard never hurt me like that oh well then it wasnt richard what do you mean it wasnt richard it had to be richard did it would richard want to make love to nicci carashe could make him threaten him do you think nicci is an honorable person kahlan frowned nicci are you out of your mind there you go then why must it be richard nicci may have simply found some man she had to havesome handsome farmboy it could be nothing more than that really you think so you said it didnt seem like richard i mean you were half asleep and in shock you said he never kahlan looked away no i suppose not she looked back at the mordsith in the dim light im sorry cara thank you for being here with me id not have liked it if it had been zedd or someone else thank you cara smiled i think wed best keep this between the two of us kahlan nodded gratefully if zedd ever started in asking all his detailed questions about this well id die of embarrassment kahlan realized then that cara was wrapped in a blanket that was open in the front enough to reveal that she was naked underneath there was a dark mark on the upper half of her breast there were a few more but faint kahlan had seen cara naked and didnt recall there being any such mark on her in fact except for her scars her body was exasperatingly perfect frowning kahlan gestured cara whats that there cara glanced down and then threw the blanket closed its i mean well its just a bruise a love bruisefrom a mans mouth is benjamin over there in your tent with you cara got to her bare feet mother confessor you are still half asleep and having dreams go back to sleep kahlan smiled as she watched cara leave the smile faded as she lay back in her bed in the quiet loneliness her doubts crept back she cupped her breasts her nipples throbbed and ached as she moved on the bed a little she winced as she only then began to realize how much she hurt and where she couldnt believe that even in her sleep a part of it had been she felt her face reddening again she felt an overwhelming sense of shame at what she had done no she had done nothing she was only sensing something through her link to nicci it wasnt real she hadnt really experienced itnicci had but kahlan suffered the same injuries as she had at various times kahlan still felt that connection to nicci through the link and an aching sort of caring about the woman what had happened left kahlan feeling saddened she felt that nicci had so desperately wanted something kahlan slipped her hand down between her legs she flinched in pain as she touched herself she brought her fingers up to the candlelight they glistened with blood there was a lot of blood despite the burning pain of being torn inside the confused embarrassment and the shadow of shame she most of all felt a sense of relief she knew without doubt cara was right it had not been richard chapter ann peered among the stand of birch trees crowded in the deep shadows of cliffs for which the place was named the dense wood was thick with the trees their peeling white bark covered with dark blotches making it disorienting and difficult to make sense of anything to become disoriented here and wander into the wrong place uninvited was the last mistake you would ever make it had been in her youth that shed last come here to the healers of redcliff shed promised herself she would never return shed promised the healers as much too in the nearly thousand years since she hoped they had forgotten few people knew of the place and even fewer ever came hero with good reason the term healers was an odd and highly misleading designation for such a dangerous lot yet it wasnt entirely without merit the healers of redcliff werent concerned with human ailments but with the wellbeing of things that mattered to them and very odd things indeed mattered to them to tell the truth of it after all this time she would be surprised to find them still in existence as much as she hoped their talents could help and as desperately as she needed help she hoped to find that the healers no longer stalked the redcliff wood visitooor hissed a teasing voice from the dim shadows in the crags of the cliff off behind the trees ann stood still cold sweat dotted her brow among the confusion of lines and spots made by the trees she could not make out what it was she saw move she didnt really need to see them she had heard the voice there were no others like theirs she swallowed and tried to sound composed yes i am a visitor im glad to find you well only us few left the voice said echoing among the rock walls the chiiiimes took most that was what ann had feared what she had hoped im sorry she lied tried the voice said moving through the trees could not heal the chiiiimes away she wondered if they could still heal at all and how long they would last comes sheeee for a healings teased a voice from the depths of the jagged clefts to the other side come to let you look she said letting them know she had terms too it would not be all their way costssss you know ann nodded yes i know she had tried everything else nothing had worked she had no other choice at least none she could think of she was no longer sure if it mattered to her what happened if it mattered if she ever came out of the redcliff wood she was no longer sure if she had ever done any real good in her entire life well she asked into the shadowy silence something flashed back behind the trees back in the shade under low rock ledges as if inviting her further along the path deeper into the twisting cleft in the mountains rubbing her knuckles which still ached from the burns long healed she followed the path and the rustle of brush shortly she came to a small gap its the trees back through that gap she could see the craggy opening of a cave eyes watched from that dark maw comes sheeee in the voice hissed in resignation ann let out a sigh as she stepped off the trail and into a place she had never forgotten despite how much she had tried kahlans hair whipped around lashing at her face she gathered it in a fist over the front of her armored shoulder as she made her way through the hectic camp thunderstorms collided violently with the mountains at the east side of the valley throwing off lightning thunder and intermittent sheets of rain sporadic gusts bent the trees and their leaves shimmered as if trembling in fright before the onslaught usually the camp was relatively quiet so as not to give any unwanted information to the enemy now the noise of camp breaking up was jarring by contrast the noise alone was enough to make her pulse race if only that were all as kahlan hurried through what to the untrained eye would look like mass confusion cara in her red leather shoved men out of the way to break a clear path for the mother confessor kahlan knew better than to try to get the mordsith not to do it at least it caused no harm most of the men when they saw kahlan in her leather armor with a dharan sword at her hip and the hilt of the sword of truth sticking up over her shoulder moved out of her way without cams help horses nearby reared as they were being harnessed to a wagon men shouted and cursed as they struggled to get the team under control the horses bellowed in protest other men ran through camp leaping over fires and gear as they rushed to deliver messages men sprang out of the way as wagons sped along splashing mud and water a long column of lancers five men wide was already marching off into the threatening gloom their supporting archers were scrambling to fall in with them the path to the lodge was set with stones so people heading for it would not have to walk in the mud though one still had to run the gauntlet of mosquitoes rain swept in just as kahlan and cara made the door zedd was there with adie general meiffert and several of his officers verna and warren they were all loosely gathered around the table pulled to the center of the room half a dozen maps lay atop one another on the table the mood in the room was tense how long ago kahlan asked without any greetings just now general meiffert said theyre taking their time striking camp theyre not organizing for an attack theyre simply forming up to move out kahlan rubbed her fingertips against her brow any word on the direction the general shifted his posture betraying his frustration the scouts say that by all indications theyre going north but nothing more specific than that yet they arent coming after us they could always change course or send an army over here but right now it appears they arent interested in coming in here after us jagang doesnt need to come after us warren said kahlan thought he looked a little pale small wonder she imagined they were all a little pale jagang has to know we are going to come at him hes not going to bother coming in here after us kahlan couldnt dispute his logic if he goes north he has to know were not going to sit here and wave goodbye the emperor had changed his tacticsagain kahlan had never seen a commander like him most military men had their preferred methods if they had once won a battle in a certain way they would suffer a dozen losses with the same tactics thinking it had to work because it once had some were limited by their intellect those were easy enough to read they usually waged an artless campaign content to throw men into a meat grinder hoping to clog it with sheer numbers some leaders were clever inventing tactics as they went those often thought too much of themselves and ended up on the point of a simple pike others slavishly went about using textbook tactics thinking of war as a kind of game and that each side should oblige the other by following rules jagang was different he learned to read his enemy he held to no favored method after kahlan had hit him with quick limited attacks driven into the center of his camp he learned the tactic and instead of relying on his overpowering numbers sent the same kind of attack back at the dharan army to good effect some men could be driven to making foolish mistakes by shaming them jagang didnt make the same mistake twice he reined in his pride and changed his tactics again not obliging kahlan with foolhardy counterattacks the dharans had still managed to carve him up they had taken out imperial order troops in unprecedented numbers their own losses while painful were remarkably low considering what they had accomplished winter though had killed far more of the enemy than anything kahlan and her men could conceive the imperial order being from far to the south was unfamiliar with and ill prepared for winter in the new world well over half a million men had frozen to death several hundred thousand more had succumbed to fevers and sickness from the harsh life in the field the winter alone had cost jagang nearly threequarters of a million men it was almost beyond comprehension kahlan now commanded roughly three hundred thousand troops in the southern reaches of the midlands under ordinary circumstances that would be a force capable of crushing any enemy the men streaming up from the old world had replaced the enemy losses several times over jagangs army was now well over two and a half million men it grew by the day jagang had been content to sit tight for the winter fighting in such conditions was for the most part impossible he had wisely waited out the weather when spring had come he still sat apparently he was smart enough to know that warfare in spring mud was a deadly undertaking in the muddy season you could lose your supply wagons if they got strung out streams became impassable floods losing wagons was a slow death by starvation cavalry were next to useless in the mud losses to falls in a cavalry charge cost valuable mounts to say nothing of the men soldiers could make an attack of course but without supporting services it was likely to be a bloodbath for no real gain jagang had sat out the spring mud his minions had used the time to spread the word about jagang the just kahlan was infuriated when she got reports weeks after the fact about envoys of peace who had shown up in various cities throughout the midlands giving speeches about bringing the world together for the good of all mankind they promised piece and prosperity if they were welcomed into cities now with summer finally upon them jagang was beginning his campaign anew he planned his troops to now visit those cities his envoys had been to the door burst open it was not the wind but rikka the mordsith looked like she hadnt slept in days cara went to her side to be ready to offer assistance if requested but didnt directly lend a hand for support a mordsith did not look favorably upon help in front of others rikka stepped up to the table opposite kahlan and tossed two agiel down atop the map kahlan closed her eyes for a moment then looked up into rikkas fierce blue eyes what happened i dont know mother confessor i found their heads impaled on pikes their agiel were tied to the pikes kahlan held her anger in check are you satisfied now rikka galina and solvig died as mordsith would want to die galina and solvig died for nothing rikka after the first four we knew it wouldnt work with the dream walker in their minds the gifted are not vulnerable to mordsith in the way that would otherwise be the case it could have been something else if we can catch their gifted where the mordsith can get at them then we might be able to take them out its worth the risk their gifted can cut down thousands of soldiers with a sweep of their hand i understand the wish rikka wishing however does not make it possible we have six dead mordsith to show us the reality of what is we will not throw away the lives of any more because we refuse to recognize the truth of it i still think those of us here have important things to decide i dont have time for this kahlan put her fists on the table and leaned toward the woman i am the mother confessor and the wife to lord rahl you will do as i say or you will leave do you understand rikkas blue eyes shifted to cara cara stood as expressive as a stone rikka looked back at kahlan and let out a long sigh i wish to remain with our forces and do my duty fine now go get yourself something to eat while you still have a chance we need you to be strong for a mordsith rikkas little nod was about as close to a salute as it came after she was gone kahlan swatted at the plague of mosquitoes and returned her attention to the map so she said removing the two agiel from the map who has any suggestions id say we have to keep at their edges zedd offered obviously we cant be throwing ourselves in front of them we can do nothing but to continue to fight them as we have been doing i agree verna said general meiffert rubbed his chin as he stared down at the map spread out before them on the table what we have to worry about is his size well of course we have to worry about the size of the order kahlan said they have enough men to split up and still be too huge to handle thats what im talking aboutwhat were going to do when he splits if i were him thats what id do he knows how it would complicate our lives there was an urgent knock warren over by the window not bothering to look at the map with the rest of them opened the door captain zimmer stepped in giving a quick salute of his fist to his heart panting as he entered he brought with him a swirling rush of warm air that smelled like a horse ignoring the rest of them warren returned to his brooding at the window hes splitting his force captain zimmer announced as if their fear had given birth to the reality most in the room sighed unhappily with the news any direction yet kahlan asked captain zimmer nodded from the looks of it hes sending maybe a third possibly a little more up the callisidrin valley toward galea the main force is heading to the northeast probably to enter and go north up the kern valley they all knew the eventual goal zedd made a fist theres no joy in being right but thats just what kahlan and i talked about that was our guess general meiffert was still rubbing his chin as he studied the map its an obvious move but with the size of his force the obvious is not a liability no one wanted to broach the issue so kahlan settled the matter galea is on its own were not sending any troops to help them captain zimmer finally waggled a finger at the map we need to put our forces in front of their main force to slow them down if we stay on their heels instead we will only be cleaning up the mess they make id have to agree the general shifted his weight to his other foot we have no choice but to try to slow them well have to keep giving ground but at least we can slow them otherwise they are going to move up through the center of the midlands with the speed and power of a spring flood zedd was watching the young wizard off by himself at the window warren what do you think warren looked up at the sound of his name as if he hadnt been paying attention something about him didnt look well he took a breath and straightened his face brightening making kahlan think she had been mistaken hands clasped behind his back warren strode to the table he peered at the map from over vernas shoulder forget galeaits a lost cause we cannot help them they will suffer the sentence imposed upon them by the mother confessornot because she spoke the words but because her words were simple truth any troops we sent to help would be forfeit zedd cast a sidelong glance at his fellow wizard what else warren finally moved closer to the table wedging himself between verna and the general with authority he firmly planted his finger on the map far to the northalmost threequarters of the way to aydindril from where they were camped you have to go there general meiffert frowned up there why because warren said you cant stop jagangs armyhis main force you can only hope to slow them as they move north up into the kern valley this is where you must make a stand if you hope to delay them next winter once they move through you they will be upon aydindril move through us general meiffert asked in an surly manner warren looked up at him well do you suppose you are going to be able to stop them it wouldnt surprise me if by then they have three and a half to four million men the general let out an illtempered breath then why do you think we should be at that spotright in their way you cant stop them but if you harry them sufficiently as they move north you can keep them from reaching aydindril this year at this spot they will be running out of time before the weather closes in with a bit of stiff resistance you can grind them to a halt for the winter buying aydindril one more season of freedom warren looked up into kahlans eyes the following summer a year from now aydindril will fall prepare them for it in whatever way you are able but make no mistake the city will fall to the order kahlans blood ran cold to hear him say the words aloud staggered her she wanted to slap him to contemplate the imperial order taking their attack into the heart of the midlands was horrifying to accept as foreordained the imperial order seizing the heart of the new world was unthinkable kahlans mental image of jagang and his bloodthirsty thugs strolling the halls of the confessors palace sickened her warren leaned around the general to look at zedd the wizards keep must be protectedyou know that better than i it would be the end of all hope if their gifted were to gain the keep and the dangerous things of magic stored there i think the time has come to keep that above all else in our thinking holding the keep is vital zedd smoothed back his unruly white hair i could hold the keep by myself if i had to warren looked away from zedds hazel eyes you may have to he said in a quiet voice when we get to this placehe tapped the map againthen you can do no more with the army zedd and you must go to safeguard the wizards keep and the things of magic kept there kahlan could feel the blood heating her face youre talking about this as if its all settledas if it has been decided by fate and there is nothing we can do about it we cant win if we hold such a defeatist attitude warren smiled his shy manner suddenly surfacing im sorry mother confessor i didnt mean to give you that impression i am only offering my analysis of the facts of the situation we arent going to be able to stop themtheres no use deluding ourselves about that they grow larger by the day we must also take into account that there are going to be lands such as anderith and galea which fear the order and will join them rather than suffer the brutal fate of those who refuse to surrender i lived in the old world as it fell bit by bit to the imperial order ive studied jagangs methods i know the mans patience he methodically conquered the entire old world when such a feat seemed inconceivable he spent years building roads just to be able to accomplish his plans he never wavers from his goal there are times when you can anger or humiliate him into a rash action but he quickly comes to his senses he quickly comes to his senses because he has a cause that is paramount to him you must understand something important about jagang its the most important thing i can tell you about the man he believes with all his heart that what he is doing is right he revels in the glory of conquest and victory to be sure but his deepest pleasure is being the one who has brought what he sees as righteousness to those he views as heathens he believes that mankind can only advance ethically if they are all brought under the moral authority of the order thats just nonsense kahlan said you may think so but he truly believes he is serving the cause of the greater good for mankind he believes piously in this it is a sacred moral truth to him and his ilk he believes that murder rape and enslavement are just general meiffert asked he would have to be out of his mind he was raised at the feet of priests of the fellowship of order warren lifted a finger to make sure they all noted his point he believes that all those things and more are justified he believes that only the next world matters because then we will be in the eternal light of the creator the order believes that you earn that reward in the next world by sacrificing for your fellow man in this world all those who refuse to see thisthat would be usmust either be brought to follow the orders ways or die so general meiffert said its his sacred duty to crush us its not plunder he seeks primarily but his bizarre version of the salvation of mankind exactly all right kahlan said with a sigh so what do you think this holy man of justice will do he basically has two choices i believe if he is to conquer the new world and bring all of mankind under the authority of the order he must take two important places or he has not really succeeded aydindril because it is the seat of power in the midlands and the peoples palace in dhara because it reigns over the dharan people if those two fall everything else will crumble he could have gone for either emperor jagang has now made his choice of which falls first the imperial order is going for aydindril in order to split the midlands why else would they go north what better way to defeat an enemy than to cleave them in two after they have aydindril they will turn their swords to an isolated dhara what better way to demoralize an enemy than to first go for their heart i am not saying that it is preordained but merely telling you the way the order goes about its grisly work this is the same thing richard has already figured out given that we cant realistically expect to stop them i think it only wise to face the reality of what is dont you kahlans gaze sank to the map i believe that in the darkest hours we must believe in ourselves i do not intend to surrender the dharan empire to the imperial order we need to wage the best war we can until we can turn it around the mother confessor is right zedd insisted with quiet authority the last great war i fought in my youth seemed just as hopeless for a time we prevailed and drove the invaders back to the place from where they had come none of the dharan officers said anything it was dhara that was that invader but things are different now that was a war pressed by an evil leader zedd met the gaze of general meiffert captain zimmer and the other dharan officers every side in a war has good people just as they all have the bad richard as the new lord rahl has given those good people a chance to flourish we must prevail in this as difficult as it may now be to believe there are good people in the old world too who would not wish to be under the boot heel of the order or to press a war for the orders reasons nonetheless we must stop them so kahlan said gesturing at the map before warren how do you think jagang will press the war warren tapped the map again to the south of aydindril knowing jagang and the way he conquers his opponents i think he will stick to his grand plan he has a goal and will doggedly continue to move toward it there is nothing we have shown him that he has not seen from other opponents for his whole life with that experience im sure he finds this war unexceptional i dont mean to discount our effortsall war has its surprises and weve given him some nasty ones i would say though that it is going largely as he expected it will take them the summer to advance to this place ive shown you given his usual pace and the fact that you will be harrying them jagang in general has always moved slowly but with unstoppable force he will simply pour in enough men to crush the opposition he feels that if he takes time to get to his enemy it only gives them more time to tremble in fear of him when he finally arrives his enemies are often ready to crumble from the agony of the wait if you put your force there where i showed you you will be able to protect aydindril next winter as jagang will be content to bide his time he has learned what a hardship the winters are in the new world he will not needlessly press a winter campaign but in the summer when they move again like they do now then aydindril will fallwhether or not you stand against the weight of their main force when they move on aydindril we must hold the wizards keep that is all we can do the room was silent the fire was cold now warren and verna had already packed their things and were ready to go as was most of the rest of the army warren and verna were losing their home kahlan glanced to the side letting her gaze linger on the curtains she had long ago made for them their wedding seemed but a dim memory her own wedding seemed but a distant dream every time she woke richard seemed almost a ghost to her mindnumbing relentless neverending war seemed the only reality there were occasional fleeting moments when she thought that she might have only dreamed him that he couldnt possibly have really existed that their longago happy summer home in the mountains never happened those moments of doubt terrified her more than jagangs army warren kahlan asked in a soft voice what then what do you think will happen the following summer after they have taken aydindril warren shrugged i dont know maybe jagang will be content to digest aydindril for a while to establish firm control over the midlands he believes it his duty to his creator to bring all of mankind under the order sooner or later he will move on dhara kahlan finally directed her attention to captain zimmer captain get your men ready while were getting all our supplies and such on the way you might as well go and remind jagang that we have kept our blades sharp the captain grinned and clapped his fist to his heart kahlan swept her gaze across everyone in the room i intend to make the order shed blood for every inch they take if that is all i can do then i will do it until i breathe my last breath chapter the deadstill air was sweltering and reeked of stagnant sewage richard wiped sweat from his brow at least as long as his sturdy wagon was rolling through the streets he could enjoy a little breeze distracted out of his concern over knowing kahlan and cara had to have long since left the safety of their mountain home he noticed an unusual amount of activity for the middle of the night shadowy figures hurried down the dark streets to dart into dim buildings slashes of light briefly fell to the street until doors could be pulled shut the moon was out and in the darker alleys he thought he saw people watching him waiting until he passed before they went on their way over the rumble of his wagons wheels he couldnt hear anything they might be saying as he turned onto the road that would take him out to the charcoal maker he had to pull his team up short as men with long pole weapons stepped out and blocked his way a guard seized the horses bits other of the city guard swept out of the side street to point lances up at him what are you doing out here one of the voices asked from the side of the wagon richard calmly yanked up on the lever to set the brake i have a special pass to move goods at night its for the emperors palace the words emperors palace were usually enough to have him on his way the guard waggled his fingers if you have a special pass then lets see it this night the guards wanted more richard pulled a folded piece of paper from a protective leather sleeve inside his shirt and held it down to the guard metal squeaked as the guard slid open a tiny door on his shielded lantern letting a narrow slit of light fall across the paper several heads bent in to read the words and inspect the official seals they were all genuine they should bethey had cost richard a small fortune here you go the guard handed the paper back to richard have you seen anything unusual as you have gone through the city unusual what do you mean the guard grunted if you had seen anything you wouldnt have to ask he waved his hand on your way richard made no effort to leave should i be worried he made a show of looking around are there highwaymen about am i in danger is it safe for a citizen to be out ill take the wagon back if its dangerous the man chuckled derisively youve got nothing to be afraid of its just some foolish people making trouble because theyve nothing better to do thats all it is are you sure you have work to do for the palace get to it yes sir richard clicked his tongue and flicked the reins the heavy wagon lurched ahead he didnt know what was going on but suspected the guards were out to catch some more insurgents for questioning they probably wanted to get back to their post so anyone they got their hands on was likely to end up being an insurgent a man from ishaqs place had been arrested several days before he had been drunk on homemade liquor and left a meeting early he never made it home a few days later ishaq had received word that the man had confessed to crimes against the order the mans wife and daughter were arrested the wife was released after receiving a specified number of lashes for confessing to speaking ill of the order and having hateful thoughts about her neighbors the daughter had not yet been released no one even knew where she was being held eventually he reached the edge of the city where it gave way to open fields richard took a deep breath of the agreeable aroma of freshly turned earth lights from occasional farms glimmered like lonely stars in the moonlight richard could finally see the rough skyline of forest as he rolled into the charcoal makers place the charcoal maker a nervous man named faval scurried up to the side of the wagon richard cypher there you are i was worried about you coming why the man let out a highpitched titter faval frequently giggled at things that werent funny richard understood that it was just his way he was a jumpy fellow and his laugh was not meant as disrespect but was rather something he couldnt help a lot of people though avoided faval because of his strange laugh fearing he might be crazya punishment they believed imposed on sinners by the creator others got angry at him because they thought he was laughing at them that only made faval more nervous which made him laugh all the more faval was missing his front teeth and his nose was crooked from being broken a number of times richard knew the man couldnt really help it and so never gave him trouble about it faval had taken a liking to him i dont know i just thought you might not come favals big eyes blinked in the moonlight richards face wrinkled in a puzzlement faval i said i was coming why would you think i might not favals fingers worried at his earlobe no reason richard climbed down the city guards stopped me no favals titter rippled out through the darkness what did they want did they ask you anything they wanted to know if id seen anything unusual but you didnt he giggled they let you go you saw nothing well richard drawled i did see that fellow with the two heads crickets chirped in the silence faval blinked in astonishment in the moonlight richard could see his mouth hanging open you saw a man with two heads this time it was richard who laughed no faval i didnt it was just a joke it was but it wasnt funny richard sighed i suppose not have you got the load of charcoal ready ive got a long night ahead of me victor needs a load of steel and priska needs charcoal or he said he would have to close down he said you didnt send your last order faval giggled i couldnt i wanted to richard cypher i need the money i owe the loggers for the trees i made into this charcoal they told me they were going to quit bringing me wood if i didnt pay them faval lived at the edge of a forest so his source of wood was handy but he wasnt allowed to cut the wood all resources belonged to the order trees were cut when the loggers who had permits needed work not when someone needed wood most of the wood lay on the ground and rotted anyone caught picking up wood was liable to be arrested for stealing from the order faval held his hands up as if to implore richards understanding i tried to get the charcoal transported to priska but the committee denied me permission to transport it they said i dont need the money dont need the money can you imagine he laughed painfully they told me that i was a rich man because i had a business and that i had to wait while they saw to the needs of the common people first i am only trying to live i know faval i told priska that it wasnt your fault he understandshe has troubles like that of his own hes just desperate because he needs the charcoal you know priska he gets hot at those who have nothing to do with the problem i told him i would bring a load of charcoal tonight and another two tomorrow night can i count on you for two more loads tomorrow richard held out the silver coins for the load of charcoal faval clapped his hands together prayerfully oh thank you richard cypher you are a savior those loggers are a nasty lot yes yes and two tomorrow i have them cooling now you are as good as a son to me richard cypher he motioned off into the darkness as he tittered they are there cooking you will have them richard could see the dozens and dozens of mounds like little haystacks that were the earthen ovens small pieces of split wood were tightly stacked around in a circle with tinder stuffed in the center building them up into a rounded pile which was then covered over with fern leaves and broom and then plastered over with firm earth fire was put in at the bottom then that opening was closed over moisture and smoke escaped from small vents in the top for six to eight days when the smoke ceased the vents were sealed to kill the fire after it cooled the earthen ovens could be opened and the charcoal removed it was a laborintensive occupation but rather simple work let me help you load your wagon faval said richard caught the mans shirt at his shoulder as he started away faval whats going on faval put a finger to his lower lip as he laughed it almost sounded like it was painful for him to laugh he hesitated but finally whispered his answer the revolt it has started richard had suspected as much what do you know about it faval nothing i know nothing faval its me richard im not going to turn you in faval laughed this time it sounded more like relief of course not of course not forgive me richard cypher i get so nervous i wasnt thinking so what about this revolt faval turned up his hands in a helpless gesture the order they strangle people we cant live if not for you richard cypher i would be well i dont want to think about it but others they are not so fortunate they starve the order takes the food they grow people have loved ones who have been arrested they confess to things they did not do did you know that richard cypher that they confess to things they did not do i never believed it myself i thought that if they confessed then they were guilty why confess if you are innocent he giggled why i thought they were terrible people wanting to hurt the order i thought it served them right and i was glad they were arrested and punished so what changed your mind my brother favals chuckles suddenly were sobs he helped me make charcoal we made it together we supported our families making charcoal we worked from sunup until sundown we slept in the same house there that one there one room we were together all the time last year at a meeting where we all had to stand up and tell how the order made our lives better as we were leaving they arrested him someone gave his name as maybe an insurgent i was not worried my brother was not guilty of anything he makes charcoal richard waited in the darkness sweat trickling down his neck as faval stared off into the dark visions for a week i went every day to the barracks to tell them that he would not do anything against the order we loved the order the order wishes all people to be fed and cared for the guards said my brother finally confessed high crimes they called it plotting to overthrow the order they said he confessed it to them the next day i was going to go to see more people the officials at the barracksi was so angryto tell them that they were cruel animals my wife she cried and begged me not to go back to the barracks yet again for fear they would arrest me too for her sake and the children i did not go it would do no good anyway they had my brothers confession no one who confesses is innocent everyone knows that they put my brother to death his wife and children live with us still we can hardly faval giggled as he bit down on his knuckle richard put a hand on the mans shoulder i understand faval there was nothing you could have done faval wiped at his eyes now i am guilty of thinking hateful thoughts that is a crime you know i am guilty of it i think about life without the order i dream of having a cart of my own just a cartand my sons and nephew could deliver the charcoal we make wouldnt that be wonderful richard cypher i could buy his voice trailed off he looked up in confusion but the order says such thoughts are a crime because i am putting my wants before the needs of others why are their needs more important than mine why i went to ask for a permit to buy a cart they say i cannot have one because it would put the cart drivers out of work they said i was greedy for wanting to put people out of work they called me selfish for having such thoughts thats wrong richard said in quiet assurance your thoughts are not a crime nor are they evil its your life favalyou should be able to live it as you see fit you should be able to buy your cart and work hard and make the best of your life for you and your family faval chortled you sound like a revolutionary richard cypher richard sighed thinking about how useless the whole thing was no faval faval appraised him in the moonlight for a time it has already started richard cypher the revolt it has begun i have charcoal to deliver richard went around the back of the wagon and hoisted a basket up onto the wagon bed faval helped with the next basket you should join them richard cypher you are a smart man they could use your help why richard wondered if he dared get his hopes up what do they have planned what are they going to do with this revolt faval giggled why they are marching in the streets tomorrow they are going to demand changes what changes well i think they want to be able to work they are going to demand they be allowed to do what they want he giggled maybe i can get a cart do you think richard cypher do you think that when they have this revolt i can get a cart and deliver my charcoal i could make more charcoal then but what do they plan to do how are they going to change anything if the order says nowhich they will do why i think they will be very angry if the order tells them no they may not go back to their jobs some say they will break into the stores and take the bread richards hopes faded back into the shadows the man clutched at richards sleeve what should i do richard cypher should i join the revolt tell me faval you should not ask anyone else what you should do about something like this how can you endanger your life the lives of your family on what a man with a wagon says but you are a smart man richard cypher i am not so smart as you richard tapped his finger against the mans forehead faval in here in your head you are smart enough to know what you must do you have already told me why the order can never help people have better lives by telling them how they must live you figured that out all on your own you faval the charcoal maker are smarter than the order faval beamed you think so richard cypher no one ever told me before that i was smart youre smart enough to decide for yourself how much it means to you and what you want to do about it i fear for my wife and my brothers wife and all our children i dont want the order but im afraid for them if i am arrested how would they live richard heaved another basket into the wagon faval listen to me revolt is the kind of thing you must be sure of its dangerous business if you are going to join a revolt you have to be sure enough of what you want to do to be ready to lay down your life for your freedom really you think so richard cypher the spark of hope was gone faval you stay here and make charcoal priska needs charcoal the order will arrest those people and then that will be the end of it youre a good man i dont want to see you arrested faval grinned all right richard cypher if you say so i will stay here and make charcoal good ill be back tomorrow night but faval if there is still trouble i may not make it tomorrow night if there is still marching going on and the streets and roads are blocked i may not be able to make it out here i understand you will be back as soon as you can i trust you richard cypher you never let me down richard smiled look if they are having a revolt tomorrow and i cant make it out here right away heres the money for the next load he handed the man another silver mark i dont want those loggers to stop getting wood for you the foundries need charcoal faval giggled in genuine delight he kissed the silver mark and slipped it down his boot the charcoal will be ready now let me help you load your wagon faval was only one of the charcoal makers with whom richard dealt he had a whole string of them he kept going so the foundries could have charcoal they were all humble people just trying to get along in life they did the best they could under the yoke of the order richard made a little profit selling the charcoal to the foundries but he made more selling iron and steel he bought from them charcoal was just a small sideline to help fill his nights as long as he was out with his wagon what he made from the charcoal covered the bribes mostly he made a good bit more hauling the odd load of ore clay lead quicksilver antimony salt molding powders and a variety of other things the foundries needed but couldnt get permits for or get transported when they needed them there was as much of that business as richard could want it paid for the care of his team with some profit left over the iron and steel was pure profit by the time he made it to the foundry with the load of charcoal priska the hulking foundry master was pacing his powerful hands grabbed the side of the wagon he peered in about time i had to wait for an hour after i came from favals while the city guards inspected the load priska waved his beefy arms those bastards its all rightcalm down they didnt take any i have it all the man sighed i tell you richard its a wonder ive kept my furnaces going richard ventured a dangerous question youre not involved with the trouble in the city are you in the light coming from his office windowreally no more than a hutpriska appraised richard for a time richard change is coming change for the better what change a revolt has begun richard felt the spark of hope grow anew but stronger this timenot so much for himself his chains held him too tenaciously but for the people who yearned to be free faval was a kind man a hardworking man but he was not the clever man the resourceful man that priska was priska was a man who knew more than it would seem possible for him to know priska had given richard the names of all the officials who could be bribed for papers and advised him how much to offer a revolt richard asked a revolt for what for usfor the people who want to be able to live our lives as we wish the new beginning is starting tonight in fact it has already begun he turned to his building and pulled open the doors when you get to victors you must wait for him richard he must speak with you about what priska waved dismissively come give me my charcoal and then load your steel victor will bite my head off if i keep you richard pulled the first basket out of the wagon and carried it to the side where priska added another what have these people who starting the revolt done what are their plans priska leaned close as richard dragged another basket to the rear of the wagon they have captured a number of officials of the order high officials have they killed them yet killed them are you crazy they arent going to harm them they will be held until they agree to loosen the rules satisfy the demands of the people richard gaped at the man loosen the rules what are they demanding things must change people want to be allowed more stay in their businesses their lives their work he lifted a basket of charcoal less meetings they are demanding to have their needs taken more into consideration this time the spark of richards hopes didnt dim rather it plunged into icy waters he didnt much pay attention to priska as they unloaded the wagon and then loaded the steel he didnt really want to listen to the plans for the revolt he couldnt help getting the gist of it anyway the revolutionaries had it all figured out they wanted public trials for those people the order arrested they wanted to be allowed to see prisoners they wanted to have the order give them a list of what had happened to a number of people who had been arrested but never heard from there were other details and demands but richards mind wandered to other things as richard was climbing up into his wagon to leave priska seized his arm in a iron grip the time has come richard for men who care to join the revolt the two of them shared a long look victor is waiting priska released richards arm and grinned so he is ill see you later richard perhaps the next trip you make here will be after the order meets the demands and you will be able to come in the day without papers that would be grand priska by the time he arrived at victors richard had a headache he felt sick over what hed heard and what he feared yet to hear victor was there waiting for him it was a little early yet for the man to be there usually he didnt arrive until closer to dawn the blacksmith threw open the doors to his outer stockroom he set a lantern on a shelf so richard could see to back his wagon close victor was wearing a wolfish grin as richard climbed down come richard unload your wagon then we will have some lardo and talk richard went methodically about his task not really wanting to talk he had a good idea what victor wanted to talk about victor as was his way left richard to unload he was the man buying the steel and enjoyed the service of having it delivered where he wanted it it was a service he could rarely get from a transport company despite the higher price richard didnt mind being left alone summer this far south in the old world was miserable the humidity was oppressive with the nights rarely better than the days as he worked he thought about the sparkling bright days spent with kahlan beside the brook at their mountain home it seemed a lifetime ago his hopes of ever seeing her again were difficult to keep alive but his worry for her now that summer was here never ceased sometimes it hurt so much to think about her to miss her to worry that he had to put her from his mind at other times thoughts of her were all that kept him going by the time he had finished the sky was tuning lighter he found victor in the far room the doors open wide so that dawns light lit victors marble monolith the blacksmith was gazing at the beauty in his stone at the statue still inside that only he saw it was a long moment before he noticed richard standing not far away richard come have lardo with me they sat on the threshold looking out over the site of the retreat watching the miles of stone walls tun pink in the hazy dawn even from the distance richard could see along the top of one wall the vile figures representing the evil of mankind victor handed richard a pure white slice of lardo richard the revolt i told you about has started but you probably already know that no it hasnt richard said victor stared dumbfounded but it has a lot of trouble has started it is not the revolt you and i spoke of it will be you will see many men will be marching today victor gestured expansively richard we want you to lead us richard had been expecting the question no i know i know you think the men dont know you and they wont follow you but you are wrong richard many do know you more than you think i have told many of them about you priska and others have spoken of you you can do it richard richard stared out at the walls at the carvings of cowering men no victor was taken aback this time but why not because a lot of men are going to die victor chuckled no richard no you misunderstand this will not be that kind of revolt this will be a revolt of men of goodwill this is a revolt for the betterment of mankind that is what the order always preaches we are the people they say they are for the people and now when we put the demands of the people to them they will have to listen and give in richard shook his head sadly to himself you want me to lead you yes then i want you to do something for me victor of course richard name it you stay far away from anything to do with this uprising those are my orders to you as your leader you stay here and work today you stay out of it victor looked as if he thought richard might be making a joke after a moment he saw that richard was not joking but why dont you want things to get better do you wish to live like this all your life dont you want things to improve are you willing to kill those men of the order that have been captured kill them richard why do you want to talk about killing this is about life about things being better victor listen to me these men you go up against are not going to play by your rules but they will want you stay here and work or you will die along with a lot of other men the order will crush this uprising within a day or two and then they will go after everyone they even suspect had a hand in it a lot of people are going to die but if you wereto lead us you could present our demands that is why we want you to lead usto prevent that kind of trouble you know how to convince people you know how to get things donejust look at how you help all the people in alturrang faval priska me and all the others we need you richard we need you to give people a reason to follow the revolt if they dont know what they stand for and what they want then no one can give them a reason they will onlysucceed when they burn for freedom and are not only willing to kill for it but to die for it richard stood and brushed the dirt from his pants stay out of it victor or you will die with them victor followed him to his wagon in the distance men were arriving to work on the emperors palace the blacksmith picked at the wood on the wagons side apparently wanting to say more richard i know how you feel i really do i too think these men are not burning with the kind of hunger for freedom that i have but they are not from cavatura as i am so perhaps they do not know what true freedom is but for now this is all we can do wont you give it a try richard richard rahl of the dharan empire to the north understands our passion for freedom and would try richard climbed up into his wagon seat he wondered where people heard such things and marveled at how the spark of such ideas could travel so far after he took up the reins and whip richard shared a long look with the sober blacksmith a man intoxicated with the whiff of freedom in the air victor would you try to hammer cold steel into a tool of course not the steel must be whitehot before it can become something so must men victor these men are cold steel spare your hammer im sure this richard rahl would tell you the same thing chapter the uprising lasted a day richard stayed home he asked nicci to stay home too he told her that hed heard rumors of possible trouble and said he didnt want her to get hurt the purge of the insurrectionists by the order on the other hand lasted a week men who had participated in the marching had been slaughtered in the streets or captured by the city guard those who were captured were questioned until they eventually confessed the names of others people questioned by the order always confessed the ripples of arrest confession and further arrest spread through the city and went on for days hundreds of men were buried in the sky eventually the fires of unrest were snuffed out the ash of regret covered every tongue as people wanted to forget the whole thing the marches were rarely even mentioned as if it had never happened richard finally went back to work at the transport company rather than risk having his wagon out at night jori had nothing to say as they rolled through the city past the poles holding up rotting corpses buried in the sky jori and richard made trips out to the mines to pick up ore for the foundries they made one trip to a sandstone quarry a little ways to the east of the city that took the whole day there and back the next day they delivered the stone to the west side of retreat where it was needed for a buttress there were a number of poles maybe fifty or sixty on the other side of the walls over near the carving area apparently some of the workers had been purged too on the way out they went up the road past the blacksmiths shop richard jumped down off the wagon and told jori that he would go up the hill and join him after the wagon made its way around the twists in the road he said he had to report to the blacksmith about their next delivery inside the dark workshop victor was hammering a long piece of steel bending the redhot metal over the horn of an anvil he looked up and when he saw it was richard thrust the hot metal in the liquid beside this anvil where it bubbled and hissed richard im glad to see you richard noticed several of victors men were missing sick victor grimly shook his head richard acknowledged the news with a single nod im glad to see you well victor i just wanted to stop and make sure you were all right richard im fine he hung his head thanks to your advice i could be buried in the sky now he gestured toward the retreat did you see many of the carvers all hanging from the poles down there richard had seen the bodies but hadnt realized it was many of the stone carvers he knew how some had felt about the things they carvedhow they hated to create scenes of death priska victor gave a desolate shake of his head too choked up to say it faval saw him yesterday victor took a purging breath he said you told him to stay home and make charcoal i think he is going to rename one of his children after you if priska what about your special steel victor gestured with the bar he held in tongs his head man is going to carry on can you make a run for iron i havent had a supply since before the trouble brother narev is in a foul mood he wants some iron supports for the piers he suggested that a blacksmith loyal to the order and the creator would get them made richard nodded i think its calmed down enough when i could really use it now but i can make do until the day after tomorrow i have some of these fussy chisels to make for the detail work and im short men so it can wait that long day after tomorrow then it should be safe enough by then the sun had set as richard was walking up the street to his room with nicci but the twilight let him see his way well enough he was thinking about victor when half a dozen men stepped out from behind a building richard cypher they werent dressed like regular city guards but that didnt mean a whole lot lately there were a number of special men not in uniform who it was said hunted down troublemakers thats right what is it you wish he saw the men each had swords under their light capes they each had a hand on a long knife at their belts as sworn officers of the imperial order it is our duty to place you under arrest for suspicion of insurrection when nicci woke richard still wasnt home she growled unhappily she rolled onto her back and saw that light was coming in through the curtains by the angle of the sunlight it looked like it must be shortly past dawn she yawned and stretched in her bed letting her arms drop back as she stared at the ceiling the clean whitewashed ceiling she felt her anger building it was upsetting when he wasnt there at night but it made her feel a fraud if she berated him for working so hard her intent had been to make him see how hard ordinary people had to work to get along in life to make him see how the order was the only hope of improving the lives of the common people she had warned him not to become involved in the recent uprising she was pleased he didnt try to argue with her about it if anything he seemed opposed to them it surprised her that he had even stayed home from work while the marches took place he warned kamil and nabbi in the strongest terms to keep away from the insurrection now that the rebellion had been crushed and the authorities had arrested many of the troublemakers it was safe again so richard had finally been able to return to work the rebellion had been a shock the order needed to do more to make people understand their duty to help make the lives of those less fortunate more tolerable then there wouldnt be any trouble in the streets to that end many of the officials had been purged for not doing enough to further the cause of the order at least there was that much good out of it nicci splashed water on her face from the basin richard had brought home one day the flowers around the edges matched the salmoncolored walls and the rug he had been able to purchase from savings he was certainly industrious managing to save from his meager wage she pulled off her sweaty nightshirt and bathed herself as best she could with a wet washcloth it felt refreshing she hated to look sweaty and dirty in front of richard she saw that the bowl of stew shed made for his dinner the night before was still sitting on the table he hadnt told her that he had to work at night but sometimes he didnt have time to come home for dinner first when he worked at night he usually came home shortly after dawn so she expected to see him at any moment he would likely be hungry maybe she would make him eggs richard liked eggs she realized she was smiling she had been angry when she first woke and now thinking about what richard liked she was smiling she combed her fingers through her hair already eagerly looking forward to seeing him walk in to asking if he would like her to make him eggs he would say yes and she would have the pleasure of doing something she knew he wanted she loathed doing things she knew he didnt like it had been several months since that awful night with gadi that had been a mistake she knew that afterward at first she had enjoyed it not because she wanted to have sex with that repulsive thug but because she had been so humiliated by richard refusing to make love to her that she wanted to get back at him she had in the beginning of it reveled in what gadi did to her reveled in how he hurt her because it was hurting kahlan too nicci enjoyed it only in the sense that it was punishment for what he had done to her nothing hurt richard like hurting kahlan gadi hated richard having nicci he thought got back at richard and made gadi a king again as much as he wanted her he wanted to get back at richard more richard had taken gadis kingdom and made it his own nicci was only too happy to let the little bully be king again every sincere cry she knew richard heard and would know that kahlan felt the same pain but as gadi went at her with wild abandon doing his best to degrade richard by what he did to her richards wordsnicci please dont do this youre only hurting yourself began to haunt her as gadi took her she tried to make believe it was richard tried to have richard if even by proxy but she couldnt make herself believe it not even for the pleasure of such a fantasy richard she knew would never humiliate and hurt a woman in that way she couldnt even pretend for a second that it was richard more though nicci began to comprehend that richards words were not a plea to spare kahlan pain but to spare nicci the pain as much as he must hated her richard had expressed concern for her as much as he must hated her he didnt want to see her hurt nothing else richard could have said would have cut deeper into her heart that kindness was the cruelest thing he could have done to her the pain afterward was her punishment nicci was so ashamed of what she had done that she pretended to richard that she hadnt suffered in the incident she wanted to spare him the distress of knowing what kahlan was suffering along with her the next morning she told richard that she had made a mistake she didnt expect his forgiveness she wanted him to know she knew she had been wrong and that she was sorry richard said nothing he only watched her with those gray eyes of his as he listened before leaving for work she bled for three days gadi had bragged to his friends about having her to her further humiliation he revealed all the details to gadis surprise kamil and nabbi had been furious at him they were intent on dripping hot wax in his eyes and doing some other thingswhat nicci wasnt sure but could imagine the threat was so deadly serious that gadi had gone off and joined the imperial order army that very same day he had joined just in time to leave with a new troop on their way north to the war gadi had sneered to kamil and nabbi that day telling them that he was going off to be a hero nicci heard footsteps coming down the hall she smiled and pulled three eggs out of the cupboard instead of richard opening the door as she was expecting someone knocked nicci stepped to the middle of the room who is it nicci its me kamil the urgency in his voice made the fine hairs on her arms stand on end im decent come in the young man burst in panting his face was white as were his knuckles around the doorknob tears stained his cheeks theyve arrested richard last night they have him nicci was only dimly aware of the eggs hitting the floor chapter with kamil at her side nicci ascended the dozen stone steps up into the city guard barracks it was a huge fortress its high walls stretching off down the entire block nicci hadnt asked kamil to go with her she doubted that anything short of death would have stopped him she couldnt really decipher precisely how richard managed to inspire such reactions in people as they had left nicci was in a state of frantic shock but she had noticed that the entire building of people seemed tense and alert faces peered from windows as she and kamil had rushed out the building and down the road people had come out of other buildings to watch her go they all wore grim expressions what was it that made people care so much about this one man what was it that made her care the inside of the filthy barracks was crowded with people hollowcheeked unshaven old men stood as if in a daze staring off at nothing plumpcheeked women with scarves covering their heads wept as wailing children clung to their skirts other women stood around without expression as if they were expecting to buy bread or millet one small child with only a shirt and nothing from the waist down stood forlorn his tiny fists at his mouth as he bawled the room felt like a death watch city guards mostly large young men with indifferent expressions pushed through the throng as they passed on into dark halls guarded by their fellows a short roughly constructed wooden wall held back all the people confining the pandemonium to half the room beyond the short wall more of the guards casually talked among themselves others brought reports to men at a simple table joked or picked up orders on their way through nicci cut right through the crowd forcing her way to the short wall where cowering women pressed close hoping to be called hoping for word hoping for the miracle of intercession by the creator himself pressing up against the rough boards they received splinters instead nicci seized the sleeve of a passing guard he halted in midstride his glare rose from her hand to her eyes she reminded herself that she was without her power and released his sleeve may i ask please who is in charge he looked her up and down a woman he appeared to judge was about to be without a husband and available his face slid into an affected smile he gestured there at the table peoples protector muksin the older man sat ensconced behind his sovereign stacks of papers beneath a chin that sank down toward his chest his spreading body looked as if it were melting in the summer heat his loose white shirt bore big dark rings of sweat adding its bit of stink to the stench of the sultry room guards leaned down to speak into his ear while his dull gaze roamed never settling others behind the table to either side of him were busily engaged in work at stacks of their own papers or speaking among themselves or dealing with the other stream of officials and guards that was ebbing and flowing through the room protector muksin the shiny top of his head concealed about as well as an aged turtle napping beneath a few blades of grass watched the room his dark eyes never stopped moving gliding past the guards the officials the milling crowd when they glided over niccis face they registered no more interest than in any of the other people all were citizens of the order equal pieces each unimportant in and of itself could i see him nicci asked its important the guards smile turned to mockery im sure it is he waved a finger at the clump of people to the side end of the line wait your turn nicci and kamil had no choice but to wait nicci knew enough about such petty officials to know better than to make a scene they lived for the times when someone made a scene she leaned her shoulder against the plastered wall dark with oily stains of countless other shoulders kamil took up station behind her the line wasnt moving because the officials werent seeing anyone nicci didnt know if they only saw citizens at certain times there was no choice but to keep their place in the line the morning dragged on without the line in front of her changing it grew more crowded in back kamil she said in a low voice after several hours you dont need to wait with me you can go home his eyes were red and swollen i wish to wait he sounded surprisingly distrustful i care about richard he added in a tone that sounded like an accusation i care about him too why do you think im here i only came to get you because i was so afraid for richard and i didnt know what else to do everyone else was off to work or to buy bread kamil turned and leaned his back against the wall i dont believe that you care for him but i didnt know what else to do nicci swiped a sweaty strand of hair off her forehead you dont like me do you still he didnt look at her no might i ask why kamils gaze snuck a glance around to see if anyone was listening they were all concerned with their own problems you are richards wife yet you betrayed him you took gadi to your room you are a whore nicci blinked in surprise at his words kamil glanced around again before he went on we dont know why a man like richard would be with you every woman without a husband in the house and the other houses nearby told me she would be his wife and never lie with another man as long as she lived they all say they dont understand why you would do that to richard everyone was sad for him but he would not listen to us tell him nicci turned away suddenly she couldnt bear the shame of looking at a young man who had just called her a vile name and had been right you dont understand the situation she whispered from the corner of her eye she saw kamil shrug you are right i dont understand i dont understand how anyone could do such a hurtful thing to a husband like richard who works hard and takes such good care of you to do such a thing you must be a bad person who does not care about your husband she felt tears join the sweat on her face i care about richard more than you could ever know he didnt answer she turned to look at him he was bouncing his shoulders gently against the wall he was too ashamed of her or angry at her to look her in the eye kamil do you remember when we first came to live in the room in your building he nodded still not looking at her do you remember how cruel you and nabbi treated richard all the mean things you said to him all the hurtful names you called him how you threatened him with your knives i made a mistake he said and sounded as if he meant it kamil i made a mistake too she didnt bother trying to hide her tearshalf the women in the room were weeping i cant explain it to you but richard and i were having an argument i was angry with him i wanted to hurt him i was wrong it was a foolish thing for me to do i made a terrible mistake she sniffled and dabbed her nose on a small handkerchief kamil watched her from the corner of his eye i admit its not the same kind of mistake that you and nabbi made when you were acting tough when you first met richard but it was a mistake i was acting tough too you dont desire gadi gadi turns my stomach i only used him because i was angry with richard and you are sorry niccis chin trembled of course im sorry you are not going to get angry and do it again with some other man no i told richard i made a mistake i was sorry and i would never do such a thing to him again i meant what i said kamil thought it over as he watched a woman shake a child by the arm the child wouldnt stop crying because it wanted to be picked up she said something under her breath and the child leaned against her leg and pouted but didnt cry anymore if richard can forgive you then i should not be angry at you he is your husband it is for the two of you to settle not for me he touched her arm you made a foolish mistake it is over dont cry for that anymore there are more important things now nicci smiled through her tears and nodded he smiled a little bit nabbi and i told gadi we were going to cut off we told him we would cut him for what he had done to richard gadi showed us his knife so we would let him pass gadi loves his knife he has cut men with it before cut them bad he told us to let him pass to go to join the army that he was going to use his knife to slice the guts out of the enemy to be a war hero and to have many women better than richards wife im sure i will not be the only woman to be sorry they ever met gadi in the late afternoon peoples protector muksin began seeing people niccis back ached but it was nothing to compare to her fear for richard the people were taken one at a time by a pair of guards to stand before protector muksin the line moved fairly rapidly because the protector tolerated no long conversations at most he would riffle through some of his papers before telling the supplicant something what with all the wailing and weeping in the room nicci couldnt hear any of it when it was her turn one of the guards shoved kamil back only one citizen may speak with the protector nicci tilted her head to signal kamil to stand back and not make a scene the guards each grabbed an arm and fairly carried her to the spot in front of the protector nicci was indignant at being treated so roughlylike some common citizen she had always enjoyed a kind of authority sometimes spoken sometimes unspoken and had never really given it much thought she wanted to have richard see what it was like to live as the common working people richard seemed to flourish the two guards stood close at her shoulders in case she caused any trouble they must have seen it enough she felt her face flushing at her treatment protector muksin my husband was name his darkeyed gaze was skipping over the people remaining in line no doubt measuring how far off dinner was richard he looked up sharply full name his name is richard cypher he was taken in last evening nicci didnt want to say the word arrested fearing to lend weight to a serious charge he shuffled through papers not at all seeming to be interested in looking at her nicci found it slightly confounding when the man didnt look at her in that calculating way men had of measuring her dimensions in their mind imagining what they couldnt see as if she didnt know what they were doing the two guards though were looking down the front of her dress ah protector muksin waved a paper you are lucky he has been released then he looked up as if she were daft we have him his name is on this paper there are many places people are taken the protectors of the people cant be expected to know where they all are thank you nicci said without knowing what she was thanking him for why is he being held what are the charges the man frowned how would we know the charges he has not yet confessed nicci felt dizzy a number of the other women fainted when they spoke to the protector the guards hands on her arms tightened the protectors hand started to lift to signal them to remove her before he could nicci spoke in as calm a voice as she could muster please protector muksin my husband is no troublemaker he never does anything but work he never speaks ill of anyone he is a good man he always does as he is told for one fraction of a second as she watched sweat roll down the mans cheeks he seemed to be considering something has he a skill he is a good laborer for the order he loads wagons she knew the answer was a mistake before she had completed it the hand lifted flicked dismissing her like a gnat with a mighty jerk the guards lifted her from her feet and whisked her from the important mans presence but my husband is a good man please protector muksin richard did not cause any of the trouble he was home her words were sincere and much the same as those spoken by the women before her she was furious that she could not convince him that she was differentthat richard was different the others she knew now had all tried to do the same kamil ran behind as the guards carried her down a short dark hall to a side door out of the stone fortress evening light stole in when they opened the door they shoved her nicci stumbled down the steps kamil was shoved out right behind her he fell facedown in the dirt nicci knelt to help him up from her knees she looked up to the doorway what about my husband she pressed you can come back another day one guard said when he confesses the protector can tell you the charges nicci knew he would never confess he would die first that was not a problem as far as these men were concerned can i see him nicci folded her hands prayerfully as she knelt beside kamil please can i at least see him one of the guards whispered to the other have you any money he asked her no she said in a mournful cry they started to go back in wait kamil cried out when they paused he ran up the steps he lifted his pant leg and pulled off a boot upending it a coin fell into his palm without reservation he handed the silver coin to the guard the man made a sour face when he looked at the coin this isnt enough for a visit kamil seized the big mans wrist as he started to turn i have another at home please let me go get it i can run i can be back in an hour the man shook his head not tonight visits for those who can pay the fee are the day after tomorrow at sunset but only one visitor is allowed kamil waved his hand at nicci his wife she will visit him the guard swept an appraising look over nicci smirking as if to consider what more she might have to give to see her husband just be sure to bring the fee the door slammed shut kamil raced down the steps and seized her arm his big eyes brimming with tears what are we going to do thats two more days they will have him two more days he was starting to choke on his panic he hadnt said it but she knew what he meant that was two more days to torture a confession out of him then they would bury richard in the sky nicci took a firm grip on the boys arm and walked him away kamil listen to me richard is strong he will be all right hes been through a lot before hes strong you know hes strong kamil was nodding as he bit his lower lip and wept reduced to a child by his fear for his friend nicci stared at the ceiling the entire night the next day she went to stand in line for bread she realized as she stood with the other women that she must have the same hollow look as they she was in a daze she didnt know what to do everything seemed to be disintegrating that night she slept only a few hours she was in a state of restless anxiety counting the minutes until the sun would come up when it did she sat at the table clutching the loaf of bread she would take to richard waiting the eternity it took for the day to drag by the neighbor lady mrs sharim brought nicci a bowl of cabbage soup she stood over nicci smiling sympathetically while she waited to make sure nicci ate the soup nicci thanked mrs sharim and said the soup was delicious she had no idea what the soup tasted like in the early afternoon nicci decided to go wait at the stronghold until she was allowed in she didnt want to be late kamil was sitting on the steps waiting for her a small crowd of people milled about kamil shot to his feet i have the silver mark nicci wanted to tell him that he didnt have to pay it that she would but she didnt have a silver mark she had only a few silver pennies thank you kamil i will find the money to pay you back i dont want it back it is for richard it is what i choose to do for richard it is worth it to me nicci nodded she knew she would rot before anyone came up with a penny for her yet she had devoted her entire life to helping others her mother told her once that it was wrong to expect thanks that she owed help to those people because she was able to give it as nicci walked down the steps people came up and offered their best wishes they asked her to tell richard to be strong and not to give in they asked her to tell them if there was anything they could do or if she needed money theyd had richard for days nicci didnt even know if he was still alive the silent walk to the prison stronghold was terror she feared to find he had been put to death or to see him and know he would die a lingering suffering agony from his questioning nicci knew very well how the order questioned people at the side door a halfdozen other women along with a few older men stood in the sweltering sun all the women had sacks of food none of the people spoke they were all bent under the weight of the same dread nicci stared at the door as the sun slowly sank in the gathering dusk kamil hung his waterskin on niccis shoulder richard will probably want something to drink with his bread and chicken thank you she whispered the ironbound door squeaked open everyone looked up at the guard standing in the door signaling for everyone to approach he glanced down at a piece of paper as the first woman raced up the stairs he stopped her and asked her name when she told him he checked it against his list then let her pass the second woman he turned away she cried out saying she had paid for the visit he told her that her husband had confessed to crimes of treason and was allowed no visitors she wailed as she fell to the ground everyone else watched in horror fearing the same fate another woman gave her name and was sent in another went in then the next was told that her husband had died nicci in a daze started up the stairs kamil grabbed her arm he put a coin in her hand thank you karnil he nodded tell richard i said just tell him to come home richard cypher she answered the guard her heart hammering he looked at the paper briefly then waved her in that man will take you to him relief flooded through her he was still alive inside the dark hall another soldier waited he tilted his head in command follow me he moved into the darkness a lamp swinging from each hand she stayed close behind as he descended two long flights of narrow stairs into the damp dark underground in a small room with a hissing torch peoples protector muksin sat on a bench sweating as he talked to two menminor officials judging by their deferential treatment of the rotund protector the protector stood after briefly inspecting the paper the guard handed him you have the fee yes protector muksin nicci handed over the coin he glanced at it before pocketing the silver fines for civil violations are steep he said cryptically as his dark eyes halted to measure her reaction nicci licked her lips her hopes suddenly buoyant she had passed the first test by paying the fee the greedy bastard was now demanding money for richards life nicci spoke cautiously fearing to make a mistake if i knew the fine protector i believe i could raise the money the protector peered at her with an intensity that made sweat break out across her brow a man needs to prove his repentance a fine that cuts to the bone is a sure way to show remorse for a civil infraction less and we will know the penance insincere day after tomorrow at this time those who have confessed to such infractions and have someone who can pay the price of the fine are brought before me for disposition he had named the price everything he had told her what richard had to do she wanted to tear out the mans fat throat thank you for your kind understanding of my husbands civil indiscretion if i could see him i will see that he hurts to the bone in remorse he smiled a thin sweaty smile see that you do young lady men left too long down here with their guilt end up confessing to the most terrible things nicci swallowed i understand protector muksin the torture would not stop until the man had the price the guard seized her arm abruptly and yanked her off down a pitchblack corridor holding his two lanterns in his other hand they went down another flight of stairs down to the very bottom of the stronghold the narrow passageway burrowed its crooked way through the stone of the foundation past rooms purposebuilt to hold criminals being not far from the river water seeped into the place leaving it forever slimy wet and reeking of rot she saw things skitter away into the blackness the sound of their feet splashing through ankledeep water echoed back from the distance decomposing carcasses of huge rats bobbed on the waves caused by their passing footsteps the place reminded nicci of her childhood nightmares of the underworld a fate her mother had promised awaited all those who failed in their duty to their fellow man the short doors to the sides each had a small opening about the size of a handso that the guards could look in she supposed there was no light at all but what the guards brought so there was nothing for those inside to look out at in several of those doors fingers gripped the edge of the opening as the lamplight passed nicci saw wide eyes peering out from the black holes from many of the openings came weeping of anguish or agony the guard stopped here it is her heart beating wildly nicci waited instead of opening the door the guard turned to her and grabbed her breasts she stood motionless fearing to move he fondled her as if he were testing melons in the market she was too afraid to say anything lest he not let her see richard he pressed closer to her and pushed his meaty hand down inside the top of her dress fingering her nipples nicci knew that men like this were necessary if the order was to bring their teachings to all you had to accept that the nature of mankind was perverted there had to be sacrifices brutes were necessary to enforce morality on the masses she stifled a yelp as he pinched her tender flesh the guard chuckled pleased with his grope and turned to the door after some difficulty with the rusty lock he finally got the key to turn he grasped the door through the opening and gave a mighty tug the door slowly grated open just enough to get by the guard hung a lantern just inside on the wall after ive seen to some other matters ill be back and your visit will be over he chortled again dont waste any time getting your skirts up for himif hes in any condition for it he shoved her in the room here you go cypher i got her nice and randy for you the door shut with a clang that echoed up and down the crooked passageway nicci heard the key turn and the guards sloshing footsteps as he departed the square room was so tiny she could have stretched her arms and touched the walls to each side at the same time the ceiling brushed the top of her head she was overwhelmed by the terrifying closeness of it she wanted out she feared the body crumpled at her feet was dead richard she heard a little groan his arms were behind his back locked in some kind of wooden binders she feared he might drown tears stung her eyes she sank to her knees the slimy water that had sloshed into her boots now soaked up through her dress richard she pulled at his shoulder to turn him over he cried out and shrank away from her hand when she saw him she covered her mouth with both hands to stifle her scream she felt the tears flooding down her face as she gasped to get her breath oh richard nicci stood and tore off a strip of her shift from under her dress kneeling once more she used the cloth to gently wipe the blood from his face richard can you hear me its nicci he nodded nicci one eye was swollen shut his hair was matted with mud and slime from the water he lay in his clothes were torn open in the harsh light from the small lamp she could see puffy red wounds crisscrossing his flesh he saw her staring at his wounds im afraid youll never be able to patch this shirt she offered a feeble smile at his grim humor her fingers trembled as she wiped his face she didnt know why she would react this way she had seen worse than this richard pulled his head back away from her ministrations am i hurting you yes sorry i have some water he nodded eagerly nicci poured water into his mouth from the waterskin he drank greedily while he caught his breath she said kamil came up with the money for the fee to get me in to see you richard only smiled kamil wants you out of here i want me out of here he didnt sound like himself his voice was hoarse and almost gone richard the protector who the official in charge of this this prison he told me that there is a way to get you out he said you must plead guilty to a civil infraction and pay a fine richard was nodding i figured as much he asked if i had money i told him i did you do youve saved money he nodded i have money niccis fingers desperately gathered his collar into her fist richard i cant pay the fine to get you out for two more days can you hold on please can you hold on until then he smiled in the dim lamplight im not going anywhere nicci remembered then and pulled the bread out of the sack i brought food bread and some roasted chicken chicken bread wont sustain me long they dont feed me she tore at the chicken with her fingers she held a piece up to his mouth for him she couldnt stand to see richard helpless it angered her it made her sick eat richard she urged when his head sank forward he shook his head as if to banish sleep here have some more she watched him chew can you sleep in this water they dont let you sleep they she pushed a long chunk of chicken in his mouth she knew too many of the details of the orders methods she didnt want to know which technique they had chosen for him ill get you out richard dont give up ill get you out he shrugged as if to say it didnt matter why covetous of your prisoner jealous to see others abuse me in your place fear they might destroy me before you can richard thats not i am just a man only the greater good matters that im innocent is immaterial because no one mans life has value if i must suffer and die this way to help drive others to the ways of your creator and your order who are you to deny them that virtuous end what do your wishes matter how can you put your life or mine above the good of others how many times had she lectured him with that same moral doctrine how contemptuous how venomous how treacherous it sounded from his lips she hated herself at that moment he somehow put the lie to everything the order stood for to everything she had devoted her life to he somehow made doing good seem evil that was why he was so dangerous that he even existed threatened everything for which they stood she was so close so close to knowing what she needed to understand the very fact that there were tears running down her face told her that there really was something that made the whole ordeal worthwhilemade it essential the indefinable spark she had seen in his eyes from the first instant was real if she could just reach that little bit more then she could finally do what was best it would be better for him what kind of life could he ever have how much suffering could he endure she hated that she was condemned to serving the creator in such a way look around nicci you wanted to show me the better way of the order look around isnt it glorious she hated to see one of his beautiful eyes swollen shut richard i need the money you saved if im to get you out of here ill need it all the official told me it had to be all of what you had a hoarse whisper was all he had left its in our room our room where tell me where he shook his head you could never get it out you have to know the trick to open it go to ishaq ishaq at the transport company why it was his parlor once theres a hidden compartment in the floor tell him why you need the money he will open it for you she held more chicken up to his mouth all right ill go to ishaq she hesitated while she watched him chew im sorry that you have to give up what youve managed to save i know how hard you work its not right for them to take it he shrugged again just money id rather live nicci smiled and wiped the tears from her cheeks that was the best thing she could have hoped to hear the door opened pull your skirt down woman times up as he dragged her out by her arm she stuffed the last of the chicken in richards mouth civil infraction she called to him dont forget he had to confess to a civil infraction that could be paid with a fine then they would release him any other crime was death i wont forget she reached back toward him as she was pulled from the tiny cell ill be back for you richard i swear chapter nicci paced as ishaq bent over the trapdoor in the corner of the room he had been at it a long time he had pushed the wardrobe aside to get at the secret place in the floor occasionally he muttered under his breath cursing himself for having made it so difficult to get into at last ishaq scrambled to his feet nicci hoped that the meager money richard could have managed to save would be enough to satisfy protector muksin in her head she was going through a list of people who had offered money to help richard ishaq scurried close here it is he hurriedly placed the leather purse in her hand the weight shocked her the purse filled her palm it didnt make sense she realized richard must have put some metal items in with his savingsthat would account for the weight she pulled open the top and dumped the contents in her palm nicci gasped there were close to two dozen gold marks there wasnt any silver it was all gold dear creator she whispered her eyes wide where would richard get all this money it was more money than most wealthy men saw in their lifetime she looked up into ishaqs eyes where would richard get all this money he swept his red hat off his head he waved impatiently at all the gold lying in her palm richard earned it she felt her frown darkening earned it how no one man could earn this much moneynot honestly anyway she felt her anger building richard stole this gold didnt he dont be silly ishaq gestured irritably richard earned it he bought and sold goods she gritted her teeth how did he get this money the man flung up his hands im telling you he earned it himselfall by himself he bought things and sold them to people who needed them things what kind of things contraband no things like iron and steel nonsense how would he move it carry it on his back at first but then he bought a wagon to a wagon yes and horses he bought charcoal and ore and sold them to the foundries mostly he bought metal from the foundry and sold it to the blacksmith the black smith uses a great deal of metal he bought it from richard that was how he earned the money nicci seized the mans collar at his throat take me to this blacksmith nicci was furious all this time she had thought richard an honest hardworking man and now she had discovered that he was imprisoned properly he was guilty of swindling honest working people out of their money he was profiteering at that moment she was not sorry at all for what they were doing to him in the prison he deserved it all and more he was a criminal cheating honest hardworking people out of gold she burned with humiliation knowing she had been deceived by him nicci had seen the site of the palace before but at a distance as she went about her business in the city she had never been this close it was going to be everything jagang said it would be it filled her with awe all the inspiring words of brother narev from her youth were like a sacred choir singing from the depths of her memories as she looked upon the sweep of scenes being erected the walls were already up over the openings for the windows on the first floor in some sections beams were being laid spanning the interior walls to support the next story but it was the outside which took her breath the stone walls were banded with carvings on a scale she had never imagined just as brother narev would have directed the carvings were inspirational and convincing nicci saw people gazing upon the scenes weeping at the events recounted in stone weeping at the depiction of the miserable creature that was man and the unattainable glory that was the perfection of the creator with such moving visions there could be no doubt that the order was mankinds only hope of salvation just as jagang had said this would be a palace to stir the people with overpowering emotion why are those poles there she asked ishaq as they marched along the wide cobbled path where people stood and watched the construction while others knelt and prayed at various horrific scenes depicted on the walls carvers ishaq removed his red hat as he looked at the sight it was said they took part in the revolt niccis gaze passed among the rotting corpses hanging at the tops of the poles why would the carvers take part in the revolt they have work more than that they were working on the scenes of the glory of the order they of all people should have known how their only hope of reward in the next world required suffering in this i did not say they took part i said that it was said that they took part nicci didnt correct the man all men were corrupt there wasnt a man who could not be put to death without it being justified that included richard many of the stones under protective roofs where men had worked now sat idle ramps were constructed along with scaffolding for the masons to work on the palace walls as they placed their stone other men slave labor worked at hauling huge blocks up the ramps to them carried baskets of mortar or dirt and rock or worked in trenches building the underground cells where the order would purge the world of the worst sinners and where criminals would confess their crimes it was a terrible business but you couldnt have a garden unless you got your hands dirty first the blacksmiths shop up on the side of a hill overlooking the colossal undertaking was the largest she had ever seen with a project of this scale it was understandable she stood outside while ishaq hurried in to fetch the blacksmith for her the sounds of hammers ringing on steel the smells of the forge the smoke the oils the acid the brine all brought back a flood of memories of her fathers shop for a brief moment niccis heart beat fastershe was a girl again she almost expected to see her father come out and smile at her with that wondrous energy of his showing in his blue eyes instead a brawny man stepped out of the shadows into the daylight he wore no smile but a menacing glare at first she thought he was bald then she saw that his full head of hair was simply cropped close to his scalp some of her fathers men who worked with hot iron did the same his scowl would have set any other woman back three paces he wiped his hands on a rag as he walked through the milky sunlight toward her appraising her eyes more carefully than most menother than richard his thick leather apron was speckled with hundreds of tiny burn marks mrs cypher ishaq backed away contenting himself to be a shadow thats right im richards wife funny richard never really spoke of you i guess i just assumed he had a wife but he never said richard has been taken into custody the scowl changed in an instant to wideeyed concern richards been arrested for what apparently for the most base of crimes cheating people cheating people richard theyre out of their minds im afraid not he is guilty i have the evidence what evidence ishaq swooped in close unable to contain himself any longer richards money the money he made made niccis shout drove ishaq back a step you mean the money he stole the blacksmiths scowl had returned stole who do you think he stole this money from who are his accusers where are his victims well you are one me yes im afraid you were one of his victims im here to return your money i cant use stolen money to rescue a criminal from his just punishment richard will have to pay the price for his crime the order will see that he does the blacksmith tossed his towel aside and planted his fists on his hips richard never stole one silver penny from anyoneleast of all me he earned his money he cheated you he sold me iron and steel i need iron and steel to make things for the retreat brother narev comes in here and growls at me to get things made but he doesnt deliver me the iron from which i must make them richard does until richard came along i nearly got buried in the sky myself because ishaq here couldnt get me enough iron and steel i couldnt the committee only gives me permission to bring what i bring i would be buried in the sky myself if i bring more than i have permission to bring everybody at the transport company watches me they report me to the workers group if i spit wrong so nicci said folding her arms richard has you over your own brine barrel he brings you iron at night and you have no choice but to pay him his price and he knows it he makes all this gold by gouging you thats how he got richby overcharging you thats the worst kind of thievery the blacksmith frowned at her as if she were daft richard sells me iron and steel for a lot less than i can buy it through the regular transport companieslike from ishaq i charge what the committee on fair pricing tells me i have no say thats just crazy nicci said to the blacksmith ignoring ishaq no its smart you see the foundries produce more than they can sell because they cant get it moved their furnaces have to be heated whether they make one ton or ten they need to make enough iron to make the heat worth it to pay their workers and to keep their furnaces going if they dont buy enough ore the mines close and then the foundry cant get any ore at all they cant exist if they cant get raw materials but the order wont let ishaq and those like him move as much as the foundries need moved the order takes weeks to decide on the simplest request they consider every imaginable person who they fancy might conceivably be hurt if ishaq were to move the load the foundries were desperate they offered to sell their extra to richard at less money so they are cheated in richards scheme too no because richard takes it they sell more so it costs them less to make they make more money than they would have otherwise richard sells it to me for less than i have to pay from the regular transport companies because he buys it for less nicci threw her hands up in disgust and to top it off he is putting working men out of jobs hes the worst sort of criminalmaking his profit off the backs of the poor the needy and the workers what ishaq protested i cant get enough people to work and i cant get enough permits to haul the goods people need richard puts no one out of workhe helps create more business for everybody the foundries he hauls for have each hired more men since they are able to sell through richard thats right the blacksmith said but you just dont see it nicci insisted as she raked back her hair hes pulled the wool over your eyes hes cheating youmilking you dry youre getting poor because richard dont you get it mrs cypher richard has made half a dozen foundries money they are working now only because of richard he moves their goods when they need them moved not when they can finally get some asinine permit with seals all over it richard has by himself enabled a whole string of charcoal makers to earn a living supplying those foundries along with a number of miners and any number of other people and me richard has made me more money than i ever thought id make richard has made us all rich by doing something that is desperately needed and doing it better than others can do it he has kept us all working not the order and their committees boards and groups richard ive been able to keep men on because of richard he never says it cant be done he figures a way to do it in the process he has earned the trust of every man he deals with his word is as good as that gold why even brother narev told richard to do what needed doing to get me the iron i needed richard told him he would the palace wouldnt be this far along if not for richard keeping everyone going with what he gets for us when we need it the order owes richard a debt of gratitude not torture and punishment he has helped the order by doing what they need done those piers standing out there would not be built yet if richard hadnt found me the iron to make the bracing ties those carvings on the palace walls down there would not be done if he hadnt gotten me the steel i needed to make the tools to carve them the goods down there are only moved in by wheels turning on iron bands i make to repair them because richard got me the steel richard has done more to raise that palace up out of the ground than any other single man besides that hes made friends doing it nicci couldnt make it work in her head it had to be true she remembered that richard had met brother narev how could someone make so much money help the order and have the people he deals with still trust him but he has made all this profit the blacksmith shook his head as if she were a snake among them profit is a dirty word only to the leeches of the world they want it seen as evil so they can more easily snatch what they did not earn the frown returned as the blacksmith leaned toward her his voice became as hot as the iron he worked what i want to know mrs cypher is why richard is in some stinking prison being tortured to give a confession while his wife is standing here acting a fool over him earning money and making us all happy and rich in the process nicci felt a lump rising in her throat i cant pay the fine until tomorrow night until i met you i never thought richard ever made a mistake the man pulled his leather apron off over his head and heaved it at the wall of his shop with that kind of money we can bargain him out sooner i hope its soon enough ishaq are you with me of course they know me im trusted i go too give me the money the blacksmith commanded nicci dropped it into his upturned palm without even thinking about it richard wasnt really a thief it was a wonder she didnt know how but these people were all happy with him he made them all rich it didnt make any sense to her please if you can help id be indebted to you im not doing it for you mrs cypher im helping a friend i value who is worth helping nicci my name is nicci im mr cascella he growled as he started away mr cascella tossed four gold coins on the table in front of peoples protector muksin he had told nicci and ishaq that he wanted to hold something in reserve so they could pump the bellows if they needed more heat the blacksmith towered over the man behind the table several officers put their noses to their work the guards around the room all watched richard cypher you have him were here to pay the fine protector muksin blinked at the coins like a fat carp that was too full to eat a worm we dont assess fines until tomorrow night come back then and if this man cypher has not confessed to involvement in anything more serious you can pay then i work out at the new palace mr cascella said brother narev keeps me busy im here now so couldnt we just take care of this matter while were all here it would make brother narev happy if his head blacksmith didnt have to come all the way over here again tomorrow when im here now protector muksins dark eyes turned from side to side traversing the crowded room of wailing people his chair chattered as he scooted it closer to the table he folded his stubby fingers atop a pile of tattered papers i would not wish to inconvenience brother narev the blacksmith smiled i thought not however brother narev would not want me to overlook my duty to the people of course not ishaq put it he swiped his red hat off his head when the dark eyes turned his way such was not implied of course we are trusting in you to do your duty who are you the protector asked nicci i am the wife of richard cypher protector muksin i was here before i paid a fee to see him you explained the fine to me he nodded i see so many look mr cascella said we have a lot of money for the fine if we could pay it now and get richard cypher out today that is some of it is money other people might not be willing to contribute tomorrow the blacksmith slid four more gold marks across the table the protectors dark eyes looked unimpressed the money all belongs to the people there is great need nicci suspected that the great need was in his pocket and that he was holding out for more as if to answer the charge protector muksin slid the eight gold coinsa fortune by any standard of measureback across the table the money would not be paid here we have no use for it we are humble servants of the order the amount of the fine would be noted in the ledger but you would have to deliver it to a citizen committee for distribution to those in need nicci was surprised that she had been wrong about the man he was indeed an honest official this changed the nature of the whole business her hopes brightened perhaps it wouldnt be so difficult to get richard released after all behind her on the other side of the short wall women were wailing children were crying and people were praying nicci could hardly breathe in the stinking sweltering room she hoped that the official would be moved to hurry the case so he could get to attending the matter of the small crowd of guards who waited off in the side halls for papers and orders but you make a mistake the protector added if you think money can buy this mans release the order is not concerned with the life of one man for no mans life is of any real importance im inclined to tell you to keep your moneyuntil we can look into why anyone would have such a large sum i think this man must be disruptive to civil order if he stirs up this much support no one man is any better than another that he can bring so much money to bribe him out of his just punishment proves my suspicion that he has something to confess his chair creaked as he leaned back to peer up at them it appears you three would think otherwisethink that he is better than any other man no the blacksmith said in an offhanded manner its just that he is our friend the order is your friend those in need are your concern you have no business caring for one man over another such unseemly behaviour is blasphemy the three of them before the desk stood mute behind them the weeping the wailing the panicked praying for those in the darkness far below went on without pause everything they said only seemed to turn the man more against them if he had a skill then it might be different there is great need for contributions to the order by those with ability there are many who hold back when they should be doing their best to contribute it is the duty of those with ability to it all came clear to nicci in one blinding instant but he does have a skill she blurted out what skill the protector asked not pleased at being interrupted nicci stepped closer he is the greatest greatness is a delusion of the wicked all men are the same all men are evil by nature all men must struggle to overcome their baser nature by devoting their lives selflessly to the cause of helping their fellow man only selfless acts will enable a man to gain his reward in the afterlife mr cascellas fists tightened he started to lean in if he argued now it would render the matter irredeemable nicci gave him a stealthy kick with the side of her foot hoping to convince him to be quiet and let her do the talking before it was too late nicci bowed her head as she retreated a step forcing the blacksmith aside without making it look obvious you are wise protector muksin we could all learn valuable lessons from you please forgive the inept words of a poor wife i am a simple woman humbled and discomposed in the presence of such a wise representative of the fellowship of order startled the protector said nothing nicci had traded in such words for over a hundred years and knew their value she had given the man but a petty official a standing in the core of the orderin the fellowship itselfthat he could never attain this sort of man would aspire to wear the mantle of social merit to a man like this to be thought to hold such intellectual status was as good as earning it perception was reality to such men the perception was what counted not the actual accomplishment what is this mans skill nicci bowed her head again richard cypher is an undistinguished stone carver protector muksin the men to either side of her stared in disbelief a stone carver the protector asked lingering in thought over the words a faceless artisan his only hope in life that he could one day work in stone to show mans wickedness so that he might help others see the need to sacrifice to their fellow man and the order and in this way hope to earn his reward in the afterlife the blacksmith quickly recovered and added to her words as you may know many of the carvers at the retreat were traitorsthank the creator they were discoveredand so there is much carving to be done for the glory of the order brother narev can confirm this for you protector muksin the protectors dark eyes shifted among the three how much money do you have twentytwo gold marks nicci said he scowled his condemnation as he pulled a ledger book close and dipped his pen in a chipped ink bottle the protector bent forward and wrote the fine in his book he next wrote an order on a piece of paper and handed it up to the blacksmith take this to the workers hall at the dockshe gestured with his pen off behind themdown that street i will release the prisoner after you bring me a workers group seal to prove that the fine was paid to the men who deserve it mostthose in need richard cypher must be stripped of his illgotten gains richard deserved it most nicci thought bitterly he had earned it not those other men nicci thought about all the nights hed worked without sleep without food she remembered him wincing as he lay down to sleep his back aching from his labor richard had earned that moneyshe knew that now those men who would get it had done nothing for it but to desire it thus proclaiming their right to it yes protector muksin nicci said as she bowed thank you for your wise justice mr cascella let out a quiet sigh nicci leaned confidentially toward the protector we will carry out your equitable instructions immediately she smiled deferentially since you have treated us so fairly in this matter might i ask one further consideration it was a lot of gold that would be credited to his effort on behalf of the order she knew he would likely be in a generous mood at that moment its more a matter of curiosity really he wheezed an annoyed sigh what is it you want nicci leaned closer close enough to smell the mans stale sweat the name of the person who reported my husband the one who rightly brought richard cypher to justice nicci knew that he was thinking that men were more likely to be welcomed into the fellowship when they helped collect great sums for those in need the matter of the name would only be a gnat bothering his pleasant thoughts he pulled some papers close and scanned through them flipping them aside as he searched here it is protector muksin said at last richard cyphers name was reported by a young soldier volunteering in the imperial order army his name is gadi the report is months old it took some time to see justice done but the order always sees justice done in the end that is why they call our great emperor jagang the just nicci straightened thank you protector muksin her calm face concealed her inner fury that the little thug was out of her reach gadi deserved to suffer the protector wrote out his sentence for a civil crime as he spoke take the order of fine i gave you to the workers group at the docks and return here when you have seals to prove that his fine of twentytwo gold marks was paid in full richard cypher is further ordered to report to the carvers committee for work assignment he handed her the paper with the orders richard cypher is now a stone carver for the order the sun was setting by the time they returned with all the papers and seals the blacksmith was impressed with the way she had handled the official when the offer of gold failed to work ishaq thanked her a hundred times it only mattered to her that richard would be freed she was relieved to know that she had been wrong that richard wasnt a cheat and a thief after all it had been such an ugly feeling thinking ill of richard it had for a time tainted her whole world she had never been so happy to be wrong better yet they had done it she was to have him back at the side door to the stronghold mr cascella ishaq and nicci waited the shadows grew darker finally the door opened two guards held richard between them as they came out onto the landing when they saw richard his condition mr cascella cursed under his breath ishaq whispered a prayer the guards released richard with a shove he stumbled forward the blacksmith and ishaq raced to the steps to help him richard caught himself and straightened a dark form upright in the last of the light defiant of the long shadows around him he held a hand out commanding the two men to stay where they were both stopped with a foot on the bottom step ready to run up to him should he need them nicci couldnt imagine what pain it had to cost richard to walk so steadily proudly smoothly down the stairs without help as if he were a free man he did not yet know what she had done to him nicci knew there could be no worse plight for richard the torture down in the depths of the stronghold was not as bad as what she had just condemned him to nicci was sure that this was the one thing at last that would force out the answer she sought if there really was an answer to be found chapter brother narev paused behind richards shoulder a shadow come to visit he often lurked nearby making sure the carvings were progressing as directed this was the first time the great man himself had stopped to watch richard work dont i know you the voice was like stone grating on stone richard let his arm holding the hammer drop to his side as he looked up he wiped the dusty sweat from his brow with the back of his left hand still holding the clawed stone chisel yes brother narev i was a laborer hauling iron at the time i was bringing a load to the blacksmith one day when i was honored to meet you brother narev frowned suspiciously richard allowed no crack in his facade of innocent calm a laborer and now a carver i have ability which i am joyful to contribute to my fellow man i am grateful for the opportunity the order has given me to earn my reward in the next life by sacrificing in this joyful neal the shadow of the shadow stepped forward you are joyful to carve are you yes brother neal richard was joyful that kahlan was alive he didnt think about the rest of it he was a prisoner and what he had to do to keep kahlan alive he would do that was all there was to it what was was brother neal smirked his superiority at richards obeisance the man had come often to lecture the carvers and richard had come to know him all too well the carvers work being the influential face the palace would show to the people was critically important to the fellowship of order richard was frequently the object of neals harangues neal a wizard not a sorcerer like brother narev always seemed to feelthe need to prove his moral authority around richard richard gave him no rough edge to grip yet neal still persisted in clawing for one brother narev believed his own words with grim conviction mankind was evil only through selfless sacrifice to your fellow man had you any hope to redeem yourself in the afterlife there was no joy in his faith simply a ruthless duty to it neal on the other hand bubbled over with his feelings he believed in the orders doctrine with an impassioned incandescent arrogant pride gleefully convinced the world needed ironfisted direction which only enlightened intellectuals such as himself could providewith grudging deference to brother narev of course richard had more than once overheard neal proclaim with conviction that if he had to order the tongues cut out of a million innocent men it would be better than to allow one man to blaspheme against the selfevident righteous nature of the orders ways brother neal a freshfaced young manno doubt deceptively young considering that nicci said he had once lived at the palace of the prophetsfrequently accompanied brother narev basking in his mentors approval neal was brother narevs chief lieutenant his face might have been fresh but his ideas were not tyranny was ancient even if neal deluded himself in believing it the bright new salvation of mankind when applied by him and his fellows his ideas were a paramour he embraced with a lovers boundless blind passiona truth discovered with a lovers lust nothing stirred him to anger quicker than the whiff of argument or contradiction no matter how reasoned in the heat of his passion neal was perfectly willing to destroy any dissension torture any opposition kill any number who failed to bow before the pedestal upon which stood his irrefutably noble ideals no misery no failure no amount of wailing and anguish and death could dim his glowing conviction that the ways of the order were the only correct course for mankind the other disciples all like neal wearing hooded brown robes were an incongruous collection of the cruel the pompously idealistic the bitterly greedy the resentful the spiteful the timid and most of all the dangerously deluded all shared an underlying caustic inner loathing for mankind which manifested itself in a conviction that anything pleasurable for the people could only be evil and accordingly only sacrifice could be good all with the exception of neal were blind followers and completely under the spell of brother narev they believed brother narev far closer to the creator than to man they hung on his every word believing each to be divinely inspired were he to tell them they must kill themselves for the cause richard was sure they would break their necks rushing for the nearest knife neal was alone in that he believed in the divinity of his own words in addition to brother narevs every leader had to have a successor richard was pretty sure neal had already decided who would best serve as the next incarnation of the order a peculiar choice of words joyful brother narev circled a knobby finger toward the cowering deformed frightened figures richard was working on this makes you joyful richard gestured to the light he had carved so as to shine down on the wretched men this brother narev is what makes me joyfulbeing able to show men cowering before the perfection of the creators light it makes me joyful to show mankinds wickedness for all to see for in this way they will know their duty to the order above all else brother narev made a suspicious sound deep in his throat the sunlight hooded his dark eyes more than usual and seemed to deepen the creases around his mouth as he regarded richard with a look sharing mistrust and loathing laced with apprehension only the apprehension was any different than the look he gave everyone richard fed him a vacant stare the brothers mouth finally twisted with the dismissal of his private thoughts i approve i forgot your name but then names are not important men are not important individually each man is but a meaningless cog in the great wheel of mankind how that wheel turns is all that matters not the cogs richard cypher one brow flocked in tangled white and black hair lifted yes richard cypher well i approve of your carving richard cypher you seem to understand better than most how man is properly depicted richard bowed it is not my hand but the creator guiding it to help the order show the way the suspicious look was back but richards expression made brother narev finally believe the words brother narev his hands clasped behind his back glided away to see to other matters neal like a child sticking close to his mothers skirts scurried to stay close to brother narevs robes he cast a scowl back over his shoulder richard almost expected to see neal stick out his tongue as best as richard could figure there were about fifty of the brownrobed disciples he saw them often enough to come to know their nature victor had mentioned to richard that one of the foundries had cast in pure gold from the master that the blacksmith had made somewhere near the same numbers of the spellforms victor thought them only decorations richard had seen several of the gold spellforms being installed onto the tops of huge ornate stone pillars set out around the grounds of the retreat the pillars in polished marble were designed and placed to look like grand decorations for a grand place richard suspected they were more richard went back to chiseling a thick unbending limb at least now his own limbs worked again it had been a while but he was healed this though seemed no less a torture people gathered every day to view the low relief carvings already up on the walls some people knelt on the cobblestone walks before the scenes praying till their knees bled some brought rags to put beneath their knees as they prayed many simply stared with forsaken looks at the nature of mankind depicted in stone richard could see in the faces of many who came that they had come with some kind of vague undefinable hope hungering for some essential answer to a question they could not formulate the emptiness in their eyes as they left was heartbreaking they were people being drained of life no less than those bled to death in the dungeons of the order some of those people gathered to watch the carvers work in the two months richard had worked at carving for the retreat the crowds grew larger to watch him than any of the other men the people sometimes wept at what they saw emerge from beneath richards chisels in the two months richard had worked at carving for the retreat he had come to understand the nuance of carving in stone what he carved was dispiriting but the act of carving itself helped to make up for it richard reveled in the technical aspects of applying steel to stone guided by intent as much as he hated the things he had to carve he came to love working stone with a chisel the marble seemed almost alive under his touch he would often carve some tiny part with reverence for the subjecta finger gracefully lifted a eye with knowing vision a chest holding a heart of reason after he accomplished such grace he would deface it to suit the order more often than not that was when people wept richard invented impossibly stiff stilted contorted people bent under the weight of guilt and shame if this was the way to preserve kahlans life then he would make everyone who saw the carvings weep their hearts out in a way they were doing the weeping for him suffering over the carvings for him being destroyed by what they saw for him in this way he was able to endure the torture when the shadows lengthened to dusk and the day was finished the carvers started putting away their tools into simple wooden boxes before going home for the night they all would return not long after first light the master builder provided them with orders for areas and shapes to be covered with carving so they could shape the stones to the correct size brother narevs disciples came by to provide the details of the stories to be told in stone the stone richard carved was for the grand entrance to the retreat marble steps swept around in a half circle leading up to the huge round plaza a colonnade of pillars in a half circle mirroring the steps surrounded the back half of the plaza richards job was carving the sweep of scenes that were placed above those columns it was to be an entrance which set the tone for the entire palace in the center of the plaza brother neal had told richard that brother narevs vision was that there would be the statue dominating the entrance to the palace and it was to be a work which would strike down any observer with an overpowering sense of their own guilt and shame at mankinds evil nature the statue in its horror was a call to selfless sacrifice and was to be built into the form of a sundial showing people cowering under the light of their creator neal had described it with such delight that the image it created in richards mind sickened him richard was the last to leave the site as he often did he headed up the hill along the winding road to the workshops victor was in his shop banking his coals for the night with autumn upon them the days werent insufferably hot so the forge wasnt the miserable place it had been in high summer winter this far south in the old world was never harsh but the forge in winter would be a good place to banish the chill that would come on cold rainy days richard so good to see you the blacksmith knew why richard was there go on back maybe i will come sit with you when im finished here richard gave his friend a smile and said id like that richard opened the double doors at the rear letting the last of the light fill the room where stood the marble he came often to see the monolith sometimes after a day of carving ugliness he had to come and look at the stone and imagine the beauty inside that balance sometimes seemed as if it was all that sustained him richards fingers dusty from his work carving stone reached out to feel the white cavatura marble it was slightly different from the stone he carved down at the site he had the experience now to discern the subtle difference the grain was finer in victors stone harder it would better take and hold detail under richards fingers the stone was as cool as moonlight and just as chaste when he looked up victor was standing nearby smiling wistfully watching richard and the stone after carving such ugliness it is good to look upon the beauty of my statue richard chuckled in answer victor strode across the room gesturing come sit with me and have some lardo in the failing light they sat on the threshold eating thin slices of the heavy delicacy savoring the cool air coming up the hill you know you dont need to come here to look at my beautiful statue victor said you have a beautiful wife to look at richard didnt say anything i never recalled you mentioning your wife i never knew about her until she came to me that day for some reason i always believed you had a good woman victor frowned off at the shell of the retreat why didnt you ever mention her richard shrugged i hope you dont think me a terrible person richard but she just doesnt fit my idea of the woman i thought would be with you i dont think youre a terrible person victor everybody should have the right to think for themselves do you mind if i ask you about her richard sighed victor im tired id really rather not talk about my wife besides theres nothingto say shes my wife what is is victor grunted as he chewed a big bite of red onion after he swallowed he waved the half of onion he had left its not good for a man to carve such things in the day and then at night have to go home towhat am i saying what has gotten into me forgive me richard nicci is a beautiful woman yes i suppose so and she cares for you richard didnt say anything ishaq and i tried to get you out of that place by bargaining for you with your gold it wasnt enough the man was a pompous official nicci knew how to wiggleworm him she used her words to turn the key on your prison door without nicci you would be buried in the sky so she told them that i could carveto save my life thats right it is she who got you the job of carver victor waited for more and finally sighed in resignation when it wasnt forthcoming how are those chisels i sent down good they work well i could use a clawed chisel with finer teeth though victor handed richard another small slice of lardo you will have it what about the steel victor waved his onion not to worry ishaq is doing well in your place not as good as you but he is doing well he gets me what i need everyone likes ishaq and is happy he decided to fill in the need the order is so desperate for progress to continue that they turn a blind eye to his work faval the charcoal maker asked about you he likes ishaq but misses you richard smiled at the memory of the nervous fellow im glad ishaq is buying his charcoal there were a lot of good people in the old world richard had always envisioned them as the enemy and now he was friends with a number of them it had happened to him so often and in the same way people were basically the same everywhere once you got to know them there were those who loved liberty who cried out to live their own lives to strive to rise above to achieve and those bent on the mindless equality of stagnation brought about through the enforcement of an artificial arbitrary gray uniformitythose who wanted to transcend through their own effort and those who wanted others to think for them and were willing to pay the ultimate price for it kamil and nabbi both stood and grinned when richard climbed the steps nabbi and i worked on our carving richard will you come and see richard smiled and put an arm around kamils shoulders sure lets see what youve done today richard followed them down the clean hallway and out to the back where kamil and nabbi had carved faces in an old log the carvings were terrible well kamil it looks pretty good yours too nabbi the carvings of the faces wore smiles and to richard that alone was priceless despite how poorly done they had more life to them than what richard saw executed day in and day out in precious marble by master carvers really richard nabbi asked you think kamil and i could be carvers someday maybe you need more practiceyou still have much to learnbut all carvers have to practice to become adept here look at this right here for example what do you think of this whats wrong with it kamil folded his arms as he frowned in concentration at the face hed carved i dont know nabbi ill at ease nabbi shrugged it doesnt look like a real face but i cant tell why look at my face at my eyes whats different well i think your eyes are a different shape kamil said and they are closer togethernot out at the side of the head nabbi added very good richard smoothed some of the dirt where the carrots had been pulled up and then molded the moist dirt into a mound he used his finger and thumb to shape a simple face see here by putting the eyes closer like this it looks more like a real person both young men nodded as they studied what he had done i see kamil said ill start a new one and do it better richard clapped him on the back good man maybe one day we can be carvers too nabbi said maybe was all richard said nicci had dinner on the table waiting for him a bowl of soup sat next to the glowing lamp the rest of the room was left to the evening gloom nicci too sat at the table waiting how was the carving today she asked as richard went to the basin to wash the dirt from his hands he splashed the soapy water on his face rinsing off the stone dust carving is carving nicci rubbed her thumb on the base of the lamp are you able to stand it richard wiped his hands what choice have i i can either stand it or i can end it all what choice is that are you asking me if i am ready to commit suicide yet she looked up that isnt what i meant he tossed the towel down beside the basin besides how can i not be grateful for a job you got for me niccis blue eyes turned back to the table victor told you it wasnt all that hard to figure out victor said only that you were beautiful and you saved my life i had no choice richard they would only release you if you had a skill i had to tell them more than most days he felt the essence of the engagement with her the dance she felt secure behind her shield of had to tell them yet it allowed her to watch him to see how he would react all the effort of the day moving heavy stone blocks lifting the hammer countless times had sapped his strength his hands tingled with the effect of all those ringing blows now he had begun yet again the battle with nicci he sat down on his pallet as exhaustion took him fatigue was part of any battle as much as he ever felt it when he held the blade he felt it now that lifeordeath dance this was no less a battle than any richard had ever fought nicci stood in opposition to freedom to life this was a dance with death the dance with death was really the definition of life itself since all people eventually must die i want to know something nicci she gazed expectantly at him what is it can you tell if kahlan is alive of course i can feel the link to her at all times and is she still alive then nicci smiled in that assuring manner of hers richard kahlan is fine dont let that weigh on your mind richard stared at nicci for a time finally he withdrew his gaze and lay down in his prison bed he rolled away from niccis gaze from the dance richard i made you soup come eat im not hungry he shut her from his mind and tried to remember kahlans green eyes as weariness engulfed him chapter richard could feel neals breath on the back of his neck the young disciple watched over richards shoulder as he taptaptapped the back of the chisel carving the gaping mouth of a sinner crying out in agony as his body was being torn apart by the keeper of the underworld quite good neal murmured overcome with delight in what he was seeing richard rested the wrist of his chisel hand against the stone to help push himself upright thank you brother neal neals brown eyes the same color as his drab robes stared with arrogant challenge richard did nothing to meet that challenge you know richard i dont like you no man is worth liking brother neal you always have an answer dont you richard the young wizard smiled then as he reached under his hood and scratched his closely cropped brown hair do you know why you have this job because the order gave me a chance to help no no neal interrupted as he suddenly grew impatient i mean do you know why the position was open do you know why we needed carvers enabling you to gain this great opportunity at employment richard knew very well why they had needed carvers no brother neal i was a laborer at the time many of them were put to death then they must have been traitors to our cause im happy the order caught them neals sly smile returned as he shrugged maybe i could tell that they had a bad attitude they thought too much of themselves of what they selfishly considered their talent a very oldfashioned notion dont you think richard i wouldnt know brother neal i only know i am able to carve and i am grateful for the opportunity to do my duty to help my fellow man by contributing my efforts neal backed away giving richard an appraising look as if to measure whether or not the words had been mocking richard hadnt given neal the opening he wanted so neal simply spilled out his point i thought some among them might be deriding the order with their work i thought they might be using their carving to mock and ridicule our noble cause really brother neal i never suspected that is why you are nobody and never will be anybody you are a nothing just like all those carvers i realize i am nobody important brother neal it would be wrong to think i was of any value other than in what i can contribute i aspire only to work hard in service to the creator so i might earn my reward in the next life the smile was gone replaced by a fiery scowl i ordered them put to death after i had confessions tortured out of each one of them richards fist tightened on the chisel through a calm expression he contemplated driving his chisel through neals skull he knew he could do it before the man could react but what would it gain nothing i am grateful brother neal that you uncovered the traitors in our midst neal squinted in suspicion for a moment he finally dismissed it with a twist of his mouth before suddenly swirling amid a flourish of his robes come with me the brother commanded in a grave tone as he marched away richard followed him across the field churned to mud by all the workers going back and forth by all the supplies being dragged carried or rolled to the construction site they strode past what seemed the endless face of the palace the stone walls were getting ever higher with row upon row of window openings their trim was beginning to take form many of the beams for the second floor had been placed in sockets in the walls a maze of inner walls was going up too defining the interior rooms and hallways there would be miles of corridors in the palace dozens of stairwells stood in various stages of construction it wouldnt be long before oak floors were laid over some of the rooms below enclosing them the roof had to be completed over those sections first though lest rain ruin the flooring some of the outer rooms were to have roofs lower than the main section which was to rise up to a towering height richard expected to see those lower rooms capped with slate and lead roofs before the winter rains he stayed close behind brother neal as they marched toward the main opening into the palace there the walls were higher and more complete with many of the ornate decorations in place neal charged two at a time up the semicircle of marble steps leading up to the entry plaza the white marble pillars stood in an impressive sweep and over the top of them many of the stone carvings had been installed with all the tortured people frozen in stone it was an intimidating sight as it was meant to be the floor of the plaza was grayveined white cavatura marble the sun on the marble made the plaza half encircled by the soaring columns glow with glorious light the decrepit people in the stone ringing the plaza seemed to be screaming in pain at that lightwhich was just the effect brother narev had wanted neal made a sweeping gesture with an arm here will be the great statuethe statue to crown the entry to the emperors retreat he turned a complete revolution while holding the arm aloft this will be the place where people enter the great palace this is where people will come while on their way to see the officials of the order this is where they will come closer to the creator richard said nothing neal watched him for a moment then stood in the center and threw his arms up toward the sunlight herewill be the statue to the glory of the creator using his light in a sundial the light will reveal the loathsome creatures of the statuesmankind this will be a monument to mans evil nature doomed to the misery of his existence in this world wicked of character cowering in humiliation as his light reveals mans hateful body and soul for what it isperverted beyond hope richard thought that if madness had a champion it was the order and people who thought like them neals arms swept back down a conductor concluding a triumphant performance you richard cypher are to carve this statue richard was acutely aware of the hammer in his straining fist yes brother neal neal waggled a finger held close to his nose as he grinned with fiendish delight i dont think you understand richard he thrust up a commanding hand wait wait right there he strode off his brown robes swirling behind like muddy waters in a flood neal collected something from behind the marble pillars and returned holding it in one hand it was a small statue he set it down where the radiating lines of the marble floor converged at a point in the middle of the plaza it was a plaster statue of what brother neal had just revealed to richard if anything it was even more gruesome than neal had described it richard ached to smash it with his hammer right on the spot it would almost be worth dying to destroy such a vile thing almost this is it neal said brother narev had a master carver do up the model of the sundial to his instructions brother narevs vision is truly remarkable its perfect dont you think it is just as horrifying as you said it was brother neal and you are to carve it just scale this model up into a great statue in white marble feeling numb richard nodded yes brother neal the finger waggled again with great delight no no you dont yet really understand richard he was grinning like a washwoman standing at a fence with basket full of dirty gossip you see i did some checking on you brother narev and i never trusted you richard cypher no we never did now we know all about you i found out your secret richards flesh went cold his muscles tightened as hard as stone he prepared to throw himself into battle there appeared to be no choice but to fight now neal was about to die you see i talked to peoples protector muksin richard was taken aback who neal displayed a triumphant grin the man who sentenced you to work as a carver he knew your name he showed me the disposition of the case you confessed to a civil infraction he showed me the finetwentytwo gold marks quite a sum neal waggled the finger again that was a miscarriage of justice richard and you know it no man can get a fortune like that through a mere civil infraction such a gain can only be illgotten richard relaxed a bit his fingers ached from how hard he had been gripping the hammer no neal said you had to have done something much more serious to have collected a fortune of twentytwo gold marks you are obviously guilty of a very serious crime neal spread his hands like the creator before one of his children i am going to show you mercy richard does brother narev approve of your showing mercy oh yes you see the statue is to be your penance to the orderyour way to atone for your evil deed you will create this statue when you are not doing your other carving for the palace you will receive no pay for it you are commanded not to steal any marble from that which the order has purchased for the emperors retreat but to procure the marble with your own money if you have to work for a decade to earn such a sum all the better you mean i am to carve here in the day at my job and i am to carve this statue for you on my own time at night your own time what a corrupt concept when am i to sleep sleep is not the concern of the order justice is richard took a calming breath he pointed with his hammer at the thing on the ground and this is what i am to carve thats right the stone will be purchased by you and your labor will be contributed by you to the benefit of your fellow man it will be your gift to the people of the order in penance for your evil deeds men like you with the ability must happily contribute their all to help the order brother neal swept his arm out there is to be a dedication of the palace this winter the people need to see tangible evidence that the order can bring such a great project as this magnificent palace to reality they desperately need the lessons this palace will teach them brother narev is eager to dedicate the palace he wishes to hold a great ceremony this winter which will be attended by many dignitaries of the order the war is progressing the people need to see that their palace is too they need to see results for their sacrifices you richard cypher are to carve the great statue for the entrance to the emperors retreat i am honored brother neal neal smirked you should be what if im not up to the task neals smirk widened into a grin then you will go back into custody and protector muksins questioners will have you until you confess after you finally confess you will be hung on a pole the birds will feast on your flesh brother neal pointed down at the grotesque model pick it up this is what you shall devote your life to nicci looked up when she heard richards voice he was talking to kamil and nabbi she heard him say that he was tired and couldnt look at their carving that he would look tomorrow nicci knew they would be disappointed that was unlike richard she spooned buckwheat mush and peas from a dented pot into a bowl she placed the bowl and a wooden spoon on the table there was no bread she wished she could make something better for him but after their voluntary contributions were taken out they had no money if not for the garden the women of the building had taken to planting in the back of the house they would be in desperate straits nicci had learned how to grow things so she could have food for him his shoulders were stooped his eyes distant he was carrying something in one hand i have your dinner come and eat richard set the thing on the table beside the oil lamp it was a small intricately carved statue of figures cowering in terror they were partially surrounded by a section of a ring a tall lightning bolt a common symbol of retribution by the creator came down in the center piercing a number of obviously evil men and women pinning them to the ground it was a staggering representation of the evil nature of mankind and the creators anger at their wanton ways whats this she asked richard slumped down into a chair his face sank into his hands his fingers stabbed back into his hair after a time he looked up what you wanted he said quietly what i wanted my punishment punishment richard nodded brother narev found out about the fine of twentytwo gold marks he said i must have done something criminal to get that much money and he sentenced me to make a statue for the grand entrance to the emperors palace nicci glanced down at the small thing on the table what is it a sundial this is the ring with the times etched on it the lightning bolt casts a shadow of the creators light on the ring to tell the time of day i still dont understand why is it a sentence you are a carver that is your job richard shook his head i am to buy the stone out of my own money and i am to carve this at night on my own time as my gift to the order and why do you see this as what i wanted richard ran a finger down the lightning bolt his eyes studying the statue you brought me here to the old world because you wanted me to learn the errors of my ways i have i should have confessed to a crime and let them end it without thinking nicci reached across the table and put her hand over his no richard thats not what i wanted he pulled his hand away nicci pushed his bowl closer to him eat richard you need your strength without complaint he did as she told him a prisoner doing as ordered she hated to see him like this the spark was gone from his eyes just as it had left her fathers eyes when he looked at the statue sitting in the center of their table his eyes were dead it was as if the life the energy the hope was gone from him when he was finished with his meal he went without a word to his bed and lay down facing away from her nicci sat at the table listening to the sputter of the lamps flame watching richards even breathing as he went to sleep it seemed his spirit was crushed she had believed for so long that she would learn something valuable when he was pushed to such extremes it appeared she had been wrong that he had finally given up she could learn nothing from him now there was little left for her to do little reason to continue the whole thing for a moment she felt the crushing weight of her disappointment then even that was gone empty and unfeeling nicci collected the bowl and spoon and carried them to the wash bucket she worked quietly to let him sleep as she resigned herself to returning to jagang it wasnt richards fault he could teach her nothing there was nothing more to life to learn this was all there was her mother had been right nicci took out the butcher knife and set it quietly on the table richard had suffered enough it would be for the best chapter nicci sat at the table the knife under her fingers forever she watched his back his chest slowly expanded with his breath of life and sank again there was time enough to slip the knife into his back between his ribs to pierce his heart there was time enough yet before dawn death was so final she wanted to watch him for a while nicci never tired of watching richard after she did it she wouldnt be able to watch him anymore he would be gone forever with the damage the chimes had done to the worlds and their interconnection she didnt even know if a persons soul could still go to the spirit world she didnt even know if the underworld still existed and if richards spirit would go there or if he would simply be gone foreverif he and that which was his soul would simply cease to exist in her numb state she had lost track of time when she glanced out the window that richard had had installed with the money he had earned she noticed that the sky had taken on a the color of a weekold bruise linked as she was to kahlan nicci couldnt accomplish the deed with her magic as much as she abhorred the idea of it and knowing how gruesome it would be she had to use the sharp blade nicci curled her fingers around the wooden handle of the stout knife she wanted it to be quick she couldnt bear to think of him suffering he had suffered enough in life she didnt want him to suffer in death too he would struggle briefly but then it would be over richard abruptly rolled onto his back and then sat up nicci froze still sitting in her chair he rubbed the sleep from his eyes could she kill him when he was awake could she look into those eyes of his as she plunged the knife into his chest she would have to it was for the best richard yawned and stretched he sprang to his feet nicci what are you doing havent you gone to bed i i guess i fell asleep in the chair oh well ithere it is i need that he snatched the knife out of her hand mind if i borrow this i need to use it im afraid ill have to sharpen it for you later i wont have time before i have to leave can you make me something to eat im in a hurry i have to go see victor before i start to work nicci was dumbfounded he was suddenly revived in the lamplight and the faint dawn coming in the windows he had that look in his eyes he looked resolute determined yes all right she said thanks he called over his shoulder while hurrying out the door where are you but he was gone she decided he must be going out back to get some vegetables but why would he need the big knife for that she was confused but she was revived too richard seemed himself again nicci pulled from the pantry some eggs she had been saving along with an iron skillet and hurried out back to the cooking hearth the coals were still glowing from the cook fires of the evening before providing a little light she carefully fed in some small twigs and kindling then stacked a bed of fingerthick branches on top she simply set the iron skillet atop the wood as it caught rather than set up the rackeggs were quick as she waited for the skillet to get hot she heard an odd scraping noise in the flickering light of the fire she didnt see richard in the garden she couldnt imagine where he had gone or what he was up to she broke the eggs into the hot skillet and tossed the shells in the compost bucket at the side of the hearth with a wooden spoon she scrambled the eggs around as they cooked as nicci stood using her skirt to hold the hot handle of the skillet she was surprised to see richard coming out from behind the broad cooking hearth richard what are you doing there are some loose bricks back here i was just seeing to it before i went to work i cleaned out the joints ill bring some mortar home and fix it later he pulled a handful of thickbladed grass and used it as a potholder to take the skillet from her with his other hand he flipped the knife into the air caught it by the point and held the handle out to her nicci took the heavy knife now scratched and dulled from scraping the bricks clean he ate standing using the wooden spoon are you all right she asked fine he said around a hot mouthful of eggs why nicci gestured toward the house well last night you seemed so defeated he frowned at her so ive no right to feel sorry for myself now and again well yes i suppose but now now ive thought it over and its to be my gift to the people is it i shall give the people a gift they need what are you talking about richard waved the wooden spoon brothers narev and neal said this will be my gift to the people and so it shall be he shoveled more eggs into his mouth so you are going to carve the statue they want he was already running up the stairs before she had finished the question i have to get the model of the statue and be off to work nicci raced after him up the stairs he was still eating the eggs as he went he stood in their room peering down at the small statue on the table as he finished the eggs she couldnt make sense of ithe was smiling he set the skillet on the table and scooped up the model ill probably be home late i have to get started on my penance for the order if i can i may have to work all night in astonishment she watched him hurry off to work she could hardly believe that he had once again somehow evaded death nicci couldnt recall ever being so grateful about anything she couldnt understand it richard reached the blacksmiths shop shortly after victor had opened up for the days work his men had not yet arrived victor wasnt surprised to see him richard sometimes came early and the two of them would sit and watch the sun come up over the site richard im glad to see you and i you victor i need to talk to you he let out a gruff grunt the statue thats right richard said a little taken aback the statue you know with richard following behind victor made his way through the dark shop weaving among the clutter of benches work and tools oh yes i heard along the way he stooped to pick up a hammer here a bar of iron there and set them on a table or shoved them in a bin as if one could tidy a mountain by arranging a few pebbles and picking up a fallen limb what did you hear brother narev paid me a visit last evening he said there is to be a dedication of the retreat to show our respect to the creator for all he provides for us he glanced back over his shoulder as he strode past his huge block of cavatura marble he told me you are to carve a statue for the entrance plazaa big statue he said it is to be done for the dedication from what i hear from people from ishaq and others the order credits the uprising to the drain of building such a monumental project as the retreat in addition to waging the war they have armies of men working for the constructionnot just here but from quarries far and wide to mines for the gold and silver to forests where they cut the wood even slaves must be fed the purge of officials leaders and skilled workers after the uprising was expensive with a dedication i think brother narev wants to show people the progress to inspire them to involve outlying lands in the celebration believing this will head off further troubles in the blackness of the room only the skylight in the high ceiling above let light cascade down over the stone the marble took the light deep into its fine crystalline structure and gave it back as a loving gift victor opened the double doors that looked out over the retreat brother narev told me that your statue is also to be a sundial with the creators light shining down on mankinds torment he told me i am to oversee the making of the gnomon and dial plane for its shadow to fall upon he said something about a lightning bolt victor turned around his eyes following as richard set the model of the statue on a narrow tool shelf that ran the length of the room dear spirits victor whispered that is grotesque they want me to carve this they want it to be a statue with the power to dominate the grand entrance victor nodded brother narev said as much he told me how big would be the metal for the dial plane he wants bronze can you cast the bronze no with the backs of his fingers victor tapped richards arm here is the good part few people can cast such a piece brother narev ordered priska released to do the casting richard blinked in astonishment priska is alive victor nodded high people must have not wanted him buried in the sky in case they needed his skills they had him locked away in a dungeon the order knows they need people with ability they released him to get this done if he wants to remain alive and out of the dungeon he is to cast the bronze at his own expense as a gift to the people they say it is his penance i am to give him the specifications and see to its assembly and placement on the statue victor i want to buy your stone the blacksmiths brow slid into an unfriendly frown no narev and neal found out about my civil fine they think i got off too lightly they ordered that i carve their statuemuch like priska is to provide the castingas my penance i must buy the stone myself and i must carve it after my work at the site is finished for the day they want it for this winters dedication of the retreat victors eyes turned toward the model on the shelf as if it was some monster come to visit ruin on him richard you know what this stone means to me i wont victor listen to me no he held his palm up toward richard dont ask this of me i dont want this stone to become ugly like all the order touches i wont allow it neither will it victor gestured angrily at the model that is what you are to carve how can you even think of that ugliness visiting my pure marble i cant richard set the plaster model on the floor he picked up a large hammer its handle leaning against the wall and with a mighty blow shattered the abomination into a thousand pieces he stood as the white dust slowly billowed over the threshold out the door and down the hill toward the retreat like some ghost of evil returning to the underworld victor sell me your stone let me liberate the beauty inside victor squinted his distrust the stone has a flaw it cant be carved ive thought about it i have a way i know i can do it victor put his hand to his stone almost as if he were comforting a loved one in distress victor you know me have i ever done anything to betray you to harm you his voice came softly no richard you have not victor i need this stone it is the best piece of marblethe way it can take in light and send it back it has grain that can hold detail i need the best for this statue i swear victor if you trust me with it i will be true to your vision i wont betray your love of this stone i swear the blacksmith gently ran his beefy callused hand up the side of the white marble that towered to nearly twice his height what if you were to refuse to carve them their statue neal said that then they will take me back to the prison until they get a confession out of me or until i die from the questioning i will be buried in the sky in return for nothing and if you do as you want insteadvictor gestured to the fragments of the modeland dont carve them what they want maybe i would like to see beauty again before i die bah what would you carve what would you see before you die what could be worth your life mans nobilitythe most sublime form of beauty the mans hand paused on the stone his eyes searching richards but he said nothing victor i need you to help me im not asking you to give me anything im willing to pay your price name it victor returned his loving gaze to his stone ten gold marks he said with bold confidence knowing richard had no money richard reached into his pocket and then counted out ten gold marks he held the fortune out to victor the blacksmith frowned where did you get such money i worked and i saved it i earned it helping the order build their palace remember but they took all your money nicci told them how much you had and they took it all richard cocked his head you didnt think id be foolish enough to put all my money in one place did you i have gold stashed all over if this isnt enough i will pay you whatever you ask richard knew that the stone was valuable although not worth ten gold marks but it was to victor so richard would not argue the price he would pay whatever the man asked i cant take your money richard he waved a hand in resignation i dont know how to carve it was but a dream as long as i never carved it i could dream of the beauty in the stone this is from my homeland where once there was freedom his fingers blindly found the wall of marble this is noble stone i would like to see nobility in this cavatura marble you may have the stone my friend no victor i dont want to take your dream i want to in a way fulfill it i cannot accept it as a gift i want to buy it but why because i will have to give it to the order i dont want you giving this to the order i will have to do that more than that though they will no doubt want it destroyed it must be mine when they do that i want it to be paid for victor held out his hand ten marks then richard counted out the ten gold marks and then closed the mans big fingers around them thank you victor richard whispered victor grinned where do you wish me to deliver it richard held out another gold mark may i rent this room i would like to carve it here from here when im done it can be sledged down to the entrance plaza victor shrugged done richard handed over a twelfth gold mark and i want you to make me the tools with which i will carve this stonethe finest tools you have ever made the kind of tools used to carve beauty in your homeland this marble demands the best make the tools out of the best steel points toothed chisels and chisels for fine worki can make them for you there are hammers aplenty about you may use i also need rasps in a variety of shapes and files too straight curveda wide selectionthe finest smoothing files i need you to get me pumice stones the fine white closegrained pumice ground to the same shapes to match the rasps and files and a good supply of powdered pumice too victors eyes had gone wide the blacksmith had come from a place where they had once done such carving he knew full well what it was richard meant to do you intend to do flesh in stone i do you know how richard knew from statues he had seen in dhara and in aydindril and from what some of the other carvers told him and from his own tests in his work for the orders palace that if carved properly then smoothed and polished to a high luster quality marble could take in the light and give it back in a way that seemed to liberate the stone from its hardness softening it so that it assumed the look of flesh if done properly the marble could seem to almost come alive ive seen it done before victor ive carved before ive learned how to do it ive thought about it for months ever since i started carving for them this purpose has kept my mind alive ive used my work for the order to practice what ive seen what ive learned and what ive thought of on my own even before when they questioned me i thought about this stone about the statue i know is in it to keep my mind from what they did to me you mean it helped you to endure their torture richard nodded i can do it victor he lifted a fist in firm conviction flesh in stone i only need the proper tools victor rattled the gold in his fist done i can make the proper tools for what you want to do this is what i know i dont know how to carve but this will be my partwhat i can do to bring the beauty out richard clasped forearms with victor to seal their agreement i have one thing i would ask youas a favor victor laughed his deep belly laugh i must feed you lardo so you may have the strength to carve this noble stone richard smiled i wouldnt ever turn down lardo what is it then victor asked what is the favor richards fingers tenderly touched the stone his stone no one is to see it until it is done that includes you i would like to have a canvas tarp so i can cover it i would ask that you not look at it until it is done why because i need it to be mine alone while i carve it i need solitude with it as i shape it when im finished then the world can have it but when i work on it it is to be my vision and mine alone i wish no one to see it before it is finished but most of all i dont want you to see it because if anything goes wrong i dont want you involved in this i dont want you to know what i do if you dont see it you cant be buried in the sky for not telling them victor shrugged if that is your wish then it shall be so i will tell the men that the back room is rented and it is offlimits i will put a lock on the inner door i will put a chain on the outer double doors here and give you the key thank you you dont know what that means to me when do you need the chisels i need the heavy point to rough it out first can you have it done by tonight i need to get started there isnt much time victor dismissed richards concern with a flourish of his hand the heavy point is easy i can make that in short order it will be done when you come from your work down thereyour work with the ugliness long before you need the other chisels they will be ready for you to carve beauty thank you victor what is this thank you talk this is business you have paid me in advance value for value between honest men i cant tell you how good it is to have a customer other than the order victor scratched his head and turned more serious richard they will want to see your work wont they they will want to see how you are doing on their statue i dont think so they trust my work they gave me the model they want scaled up they have already approved it theyve told me my life depends on this neal delighted in telling me how he ordered those other carvers tortured and put to death he wanted to frighten me i doubt they will give it a second thought but what if a brother does come wanting to see it then i will have to bend an iron bar around his neck and let him pickle in the brine barrel chapter richard touched the length of the point chisel to his forehead as he had so often touched the sword of truth there in much the same way this was no less a battle this was life and death blade be true this day he whispered the chisel had eight sides so as to provide grip in a sweaty hand victor had given it a proper heavy blunt point he had also put his initialsv cin small letters on one of the facets proclaiming the pride of its maker such a heavy chisel would shatter stone and remove a great excess material in short order it was a weapon that would do a lot of damage fracturing the structure of the marble down the width of three fingers a point used carelessly on unnoticed flaws could shatter the entire piece finer points would cause shallower fractures but remove less material even with the finest point punches richard knew that he could only approach to within the last half finger of the final layer the network of spidery cracks left by a point were fractures in the crystalline structure of the marble itself so damaged the stone lost its translucence and its ability to take a high polish to do flesh in stone the final layers had to be approached with care and be left undamaged by any tool after the heavy point removed much of the waste then finerpoint chisels would allow richard to get closer refining the shape once he was within as close as a half finger of the final layer he would turn to the clawed chisels simply chisels with notches in their edge to shear away the stone without fracturing the underlying structure of the marble the coarse claws took off the most stone leaving rough gouges he would use chisels with a series of finer and finer teeth to refine the work finally he would use smoothbladed chisels some only half as wide as his little finger down at the site where he carved scenes for the frieze that was as far as the carvers went it left an ugly surface ungainly and coarse rendering flesh as wooden leaving no definition or refinement to muscle and bone it robbed the people in the carvings of their humanity on this statue richard would really only begin where the carvings for the order ended he would use rasps to define bone muscle even veins in the arms fine files would remove the marks left by the rasps and refine the most subtle contours the pumice stones would remove the filing marks leaving the surface ready to polish with pumice paste held in leather cloth and finally straw if he did it right he would have his vision in stone flesh in stone nobility holding the heavy point chisel to his palm with his thumb richard put his hand to the stone feeling its cool surface he knew what was insideinside not only the stone but inside himself there were no doubts only the heartpounding passion of expectation as he so often did richard thought of kahlan it had been nearly a year since he had looked into her green eyes touched her cheek held her in his arms she would have long ago left the safety of their home for dangers he could vividly imagine for a moment he was overwhelmed with the weight of despair choked by the sadness of how much he missed her humbled at how much he loved her now he knew he must dismiss her from his mind so that he could devote himself entirely to the task he had to do as he so often did richard said his silent goodnight to kahlan then he set the point at ninety degrees to the face of the stone and took a powerful swing with the steel club stone chips exploded away his breaths came deeper and faster it was begun with great violence richard attacked the stone by the light of lamps victor left for him after the work day was done richard lost himself in the work raining down blow upon blow sharp stone chips rattled off the wooden walls and stung when they hit his arms or chest with a clear vision of what he wanted to do he broke away the waste stone his ears rang with the sound of steel on steel and steel on stone it was music jagged chips and chunks fell away they were the fallen enemy the air boiled with the white dust of battle richard knew precisely what we wanted to accomplish he knew what needed to be done and how to do it he was filled with a clarity of purpose a course to follow now that it had begun he was lost in the work dust billowed up around him until his dark clothes were white as if the stone were absorbing him as he was transforming with it until they were one sharp shards nicked him as they shot away his bare arms white as the marble itself were soon streaked here and there with blood from the battle from time to time he opened the doors to shovel out the ankledeep scree the white scrap avalanched down the hill tinkling with a sound like a thousand tiny bells the white dust covering him was cut through with dark rivulets of sweat and red scratches the cool air felt refreshing against his sweatsoaked skin but then he once again shut out the night shut out the world to be alone for the first time in nearly a year richard felt free in this he was in complete control no one watched him no one told him what he must do this work was his singular purpose in which he strove for perfection there were no chains no limitations no desires of others to which he must bow in this struggle to accomplish his best he was utterly free what he intended would stand in unyielding opposition to everything the order represented he intended to show them life richard knew that when the brothers saw the statue they would sentence him to death stone chips burst forth with each blow taking him closer to his goal he had to stand on a work stool to reach the top of the marble moving it around the monolith to work all sides narrowing it down to what would be richard swung the steel club with the fury of battle his chisel hand stung with the ringing blows as violent as the attack was though it was controlled a trimming hammer called a pitcher could be used for such rough work it removed waste with greater speed than a heavy point to shape the block but it was used with a full swing and richard feared because of the flaw to unleash that much power against the stone in the beginning the block had strength in its sheer mass but even so he considered such a trimming hammer too dangerous for this particular stone richard would have victor make him a set of drill bits for a bow drill with a bows cord run around the shaft of the drill it could be twisted and driven through the marble richard had thought long and hard about the problem of the flaw he had resolved to cut out most of it first to stop any further cracks from running through more of the stone he would drill holes through the crack to relieve the stress with another series of closely spaced holes he would weaken the stone in a waste area around the flaw and simply remove most of it there would be two figures a man and a woman when finished the space between them would be where richard had removed the worst of the flaw with the weakest stone removed the sound stone that remained would be strong enough to take the stress of the work since the defect started at the base he couldnt eliminate it all but he could reduce the problem it presented to a manageable level that was the secret to this piece of stone eliminating its weakness then working in its strength richard considered it a fortunate flaw first of all because it had reduced the value of the stone enabling victor to purchase it in the first place to richards mind though the flaw had been valuable because it had caused him to think about the stone and how to carve it that thought had brought him to his design without the flaw he might not have come to the same design as he worked he was filled with the energy of the fight driven onward by the heat of the attack stone stood between him and what he wanted to carve and he craved to eliminate that excess so he could get to the essence of the figures a huge corner of waste broke loose slipping away slowly at first then crashing down chips and shards rained down as he worked burying the fallen foe several more times he had to open the doors and shovel out the scrap it was invigorating to see what was once an irregular shaped block becoming a rough shape the figures were still completely encased their arms far from being free their legs not separate yet but they were beginning to emerge he would have to be careful drilling holes in the open areas to prevent breaking off the arms richard was surprised to see light streaming through the window overhead he had worked the entire night without realizing it he stood back and appraised the statue that was now more or less roughly a cone shape now there were only lumps where the arms would extend out from the bodies he wanted the arms to be free the bodies to convey grace and movement life what he carved for the order was never free always tightly bound to the stone forever stiff unable to move like cadavers half of what had been there the night before was now gone richard ached to stay and work on but he knew he couldnt from the corner he excavated the canvas tarp victor had left for him and flung it over the statue when he threw open the door the white dust billowed out victor was sitting among the rubble of his stone monolith the blacksmith blinked richard you have been here the whole night i guess i have he gestured as a grin split his face you look like a good spirit how goes the battle with the stone richard could think of nothing to say he could only beam with the joy of it victor laughed his belly laugh your face says it all you must be tired and hungry come sit and resthave some lardo nicci heard kamil and nabbi shout a greeting as richard came down the street and then their footsteps as they ran down the front stairs she glanced out the front window and in the failing light of dusk saw them meet up with richard as he came down the street she too was happy to see him coming home this early nicci had seen precious little of richard in the weeks since he took on the duty of carving the statue for brother narev she couldnt imagine how richard could endure carving a statue she knew had to be agony for himnot so much because of its size but because of its nature if anything though richard seemed invigorated often after working all day carving the moral lessons for the facade of the palace he would then work late into the night on the grand statue for the entrance plaza as tired as he had to be when he came home he would sometimes pace there were nights when he would only sleep for a couple of hours rise and go to work on the statue for hours before his workday at the site began several times he had worked the entire night richard seemed driven nicci didnt know how he could do it he sometimes came home to eat and to take a nap for an hour and then he would go back she would urge him to stay and sleep but he would say that the penance had to be paid or they would put him back in prison nicci feared that possibility so she didnt insist that he stay home to sleep losing sleep was preferable to him losing his life he had always been muscular and strong but his muscles had become even more lean and defined since he came to the old world all that labor of loading iron and now moving rock and swinging a hammer had built him up even more when he went out back to the washtubs and removed his shirt to rinse off the stone dust the sight of him made her knees weak nicci heard footsteps passing down the hallway and the excited voices of kamil and nabbi asking questions she couldnt understand richards words but she easily recognized the timbre of his voice calmly giving the two the answers to their questions as tired as he was as much as he was away at his work he still took time to talk to kamil and nabbi and to the people of the building he was no doubt now on his way out back to give pointers to the two young men on their carving during the day they worked around the building cleaning and caring for the place they turned over the dirt in the garden mixing in compost when it was ready the women appreciated having the heavy spade work done for them the two washed painted and repaired hoping richard would approve and then show them how to do new things kamil and nabbi always offered to help nicci with anything she might needshe was after all richards wife richard came in the door as nicci stood at the table cutting up carrots and onions into a pot he slumped down into the chair across the table he looked spent from his day of workafter having been up hours earlier working on the statue i came home to get something to eat i have to go back and work on the statue this is for tomorrows stew i have some millet cooked is there anything more in it she shook her head i only had enough money for the millet today he nodded without complaint despite how exhausted he looked there was some remarkable quality in his eyes some inner passion that made her pulse race faster whatever it was that she had seen in him from the first moment seemed to have only gotten stronger since that night she had almost put the knife through his heart tomorrow well have this stew she said his gray eyes were staring off into his private visions from the garden she retrieved the cook pot after setting a wooden bowl on the table before him and spooned millet into his bowl until it was full there was little left but he needed it more than she she had spent the morning waiting in line for the millet and then had spent the afternoon picking all the worms out of it some of the women just cooked it until you couldnt tell nicci didnt like to feed that to richard standing close tothe table cutting up carrots she could finally stand it no more richard i want to come to the site with you and see this statue that youre carving for the order he was silent for a moment as he chewed and then swallowed when he finally did speak it was with a quiet quality that matched that inexplicable look in his eyes i want you to see the statue niccii want everyone to see it but not until im finished why he stirred his spoon around in his bowl please nicci will you grant me this let me finish it then you will see it her heart pounded against her ribs this was important to him you arent carving what they told you to carve are you richards face turned up until his gaze met hers no im not im carving what i need to carve what people need to see nicci swallowed she knew this was what she had been waiting for he had been ready to give up then he wanted to live and now he was willing to die for this nicci nodded having to look away from those gray eyes of his ill wait until its ready now she knew why he seemed so driven lately that quality hinted at in her fathers eyes and blazing in richards she felt was somehow tied to this the very idea was intoxicating in more ways than one this was a matter of life and death are you sure about this richard i am she nodded again all right i will honor your request the next day nicci got an early start to buy bread she wanted richard to have bread with the stew she was cooking kamil offered to go for her but she wanted to get out of the house she asked him to keep an eye on richards stew as it simmered on the banked coals it was an overcast day and coola hint of the rapidly approaching winter the streets were crowded with people out looking for work with carts hauling everything from manure to bolts of coarse dark cloth and with wagons mostly carrying building materials for the palace she had to step carefully to avoid the dung in the road and squeeze between all the people moving as slowly as the sludge of the open sewers as she made her way through the city there were crowds of needy people in the street many come to alturrang for work no doubt although there were few people at the workers group hall the lines at the bakeries were long at least the order saw to it that people got bread even if it was gray tough bread you had to go early though before they ran out with more people all the time the shops ran out earlier every week someday it was rumored they were going to be able to provide more than one kind of bread she hoped that this day at least they might have some butter too sometimes they sold butter the bread and the butter were inexpensive so she knew she could afford to buy a little for richardif they had any they almost never had any butter nicci had spent a hundred and eighty years trying to help people and people seemed no better off now than they ever were those in the new world were prosperous enough though someday when the order ruled the world and those with the means were made to contribute their fair share to their fellow man then everything would finally fall into place and all of mankind could at last live with the dignity they deserved the order would see to it the bread shop stood at an intersection of two roads so the line turned around the corner onto another street nicci was around that corner leaning a shoulder against the wall watching the passing throngs when a face in the crowd caught her attention her eyes went wide as she straightened she could hardly believe what she was seeing what was she doing in alturrang nicci didnt really want to find outnot now when it seemed she was getting close to finding her answers matters seemed to be at a critical state with richard she felt sure that it would soon come to resolution nicci flipped her dark shawl up over her head of blond hair and tied it snug under her chin she sank back behind a wide woman and hugged the wall as she peeked out between the people in line nicci watched sister alessandra her nose held high as her calculating gaze swept the faces of all the people on the street she looked like a mountain lion on the prowl nicci knew who alessandra was hunting ordinarily nicci would have been only too happy to cross paths with the woman but not now nicci sank back against the rough clapboards staying low behind the people ahead of her until sister alessandra had vanished into the vast sea of people crowding the street chapter as kahlan rode out of her home city of aydindril for the last time she pulled her wolffur mantle up over her shoulders for protection against the bitter wind she recalled that the last time the weather had been about to close in for the winter was the last time she had seen richard with the world in such constant turmoil and the battle burning hot her thoughts by necessity always seemed to be on urgent matters the unexpected memory of richard was a welcome if bittersweet respite from the worries of war she took a last look before cresting the hill to see the splendor of the confessors palace on the distant rise it made her ache with the sense of home whenever she saw the soaring white marble columns and rows of tall windows other people were stricken with awe or fear at the sight of the palace but kahlans heart was always warmed by it she had grown up there and it was a place of many happy memories for her it wont be forever kahlan kahlan glanced over at verna no it wont she wished she could believe that besides verna said offering a smile we will be denying the imperial order the people and that is what they are really after the rest is just stone and wood what matters stone and wood if the people are safe kahlan despite her desolate tears was overcome with a smile youre right verna that really is all that matters thank you for reminding me dont worry mother confessor cara said berdine and the rest of the mordsith along with the troops will watch over the people and see them safely to dhara kahlans smile widened i wish i could see jagangs face when he finally gets here next spring to be greeted by ghosts the season of war was drawing to an end if the summer with richard in their mountain home had been a wonderful dream then the summer of endless warfare had been a nightmare the fighting had been desperate intense and bloody there were times when kahlan thought she and the army could not go on that they were finished each of those times they had managed to pull through there were occasions when she almost welcomed death just to have the nightmare end just to stop seeing people in agony and pain to stop seeing all the precious lives in ruins against the seemingly indomitable millions of the imperial order the forces of the dharan empire had managed to slow the enemy enough to keep them from taking aydindril this year with thousands of lives lost in the fighting they had bought the hundreds of thousands of people of aydindril and other cities that lay along the path of the order the time they needed to escape as autumn had turned bitter the immense force of the imperial order had reached a broad valley at a convergence of the kern river and a large tributary where the lay of the land provided space to accommodate their entire force with winter closing in jagang knew better than to be caught unprepared they had dug in while they had the opportunity the dharan forces had set up their defensive lines to the north bulwarking the way to aydindril just as warren had forecast aydindril was more than jagangs army could take in this season of war jagang once again had proven his prudent patience he had chosen to preserve the viability of his army so he would be able to press on successfully when conditions allowed in the short run it gave kahlan and her forces breathing room but in the long run it would spell their doom kahlan felt sweet relief that warrens prediction of aydindril falling the following year at least would not be at the cost of a slaughter of the citys citizens she didnt know what hardships the people would have to endure escaping to dhara but it was better than the certain slavery and widespread death of remaining behind in aydindril some people she knew would refuse to leave in cities along the orders march up the midlands some people put their faith in jagang the just some people believed that the good spirits or the creator would watch over them no matter what kahlan knew they couldnt save everyone from themselves those who wished to live and were willing to see reason stood a chance those who saw only what they wished to see would at the least fall under the pall of the orders domination kahlan reached back and touched the hilt of the sword of truth sticking up behind her shoulder it was comforting sometimes to touch it the confessors palace was no longer her home home was wherever richard and she were together the fighting was often so intense the fear so palpable that there were timesdays at a stretchwhen she never thought of him sometimes she had to devote all her physical and mental effort to just staying alive one more day some men feeling the war was hopeless had deserted kahlan could understand the way they felt all they ever did it seemed was to fight for their lives against overwhelming odds as they backed their way up through the midlands galea had fallen that there was no word from any city in galea probably said it all they had lost kelton too many of the keltans in winstead penverro and other cities had fled first most of keltons army were still with them though some had rushed home in desperation kahlan tried not to think too long on everything that had gone wrong lest she give up they had saved a good many peoplegotten them out of the way of the order at least for the time being it was the best they could do along the long retreat north tens of thousands of their joint forces had lost their lives in the fierce battles the order had lost many times that number in the high summer heat the order had lost a quarter million men to fever alone it made little difference they continued to grow and to roll onward kahlan recalled the things richard had told her that they could not win that the new world was going to fall to the order and if they resisted it would only cause greater bloodshed she was reluctantly coming to understand that hopeless outlook she feared she was only getting people killed to no good end yet giving up still was out of the question for her kahlan looked over her shoulder past the long column of men escorting her past the trees and up the mountain to the great dark mass of the wizards keep looming up on the mountain overlooking aydindril zedd would have to go there they could not stop the imperial order from having aydindril but they dared not let them have the keep it was dusk ten days later when kahlan and her company rode back into the dharan camp it was obvious from the first instant that something was wrong men were running through camp swords drawn others were rushing pole weapons to the barricades men were donning leather and chain mail as they ran to their posts it was a tense scene but one kahlan had seen repeated so often that it seemed almost routine i wonder what this is all about verna said with a scowl ill not like it if jagang spoils my dinner kahlan not wearing her leather armor suddenly felt naked it was uncomfortable to wear on long rides so going through friendly territory she had tied it to her saddle cara moved close as they dismounted they handed the reins to soldiers as men closed in protectively kahlan couldnt remember what color cloth would be used to mark the command tents she had lost track of the exact number of days she had been gone it had been somewhat over a month she took the arm of an officer among the men who had swept in around her where are the commanders he pointed with his sword down that way mother confessor do you know whats going on no mother confessor the alarm sounded as a sister rushed past i heard her say it was genuine do you know where my sisters or warren are verna asked the officer ive seen sisters running around everywhere prelate ive not seen wizard warren darkness was settling in leaving only the fires to guide them through camp most of the fires though had been doused at the alarm so the camp was becoming a black maze horses with dharan riders flashed past headed out on patrol foot soldiers raced out of camp to scout no one seemed to know what the threat was but that wasnt unusual besides being frequent and varied attacks were usually confusing in addition to being frightening it was over an hour before kahlan cara verna and their heavy ring of guards made it through the sprawling camp that was the size of a city to the officers tents none of the officers were there this is a foolish way to go about it kahlan muttered she found her tent with spirit standing on the little table and tossed her saddlebags inside along with her armor lets just wait here so people can find us i agree verna said kahlan gestured to include a number of the group of men who had set up a defensive guard around her spread out and find the officers tell them that the mother confessor and the prelate are at the command tents well wait here for reports tell any sisters you see verna added and if you see warren or zedd tell them too that weve returned the men raced off into the night to carry out their instructions i dont like this cara muttered i dont either kahlan said as she stepped into her tent cara stood guard along with a small army of men as kahlan took off her fur mantle and slipped on her leather armor it had saved her from taking wounds often enough that she was not shy about wearing it all it would take was one man to slip up close and thrust a sword into her and that might well be the end if she got lucky and they ran it through a leg or even her belly she had a chance of being healed by a sister but if it was in some other placeheart head some major artery so that the loss of blood was too fastthen even the gifted wouldnt be able to heal her the leather was extremely tough and while not impervious to blades spears or arrows it afforded a good degree of protection while allowing enough freedom of movement to enable her to fight a blow with a blade had to be landed just right or it would glance harmlessly off the leather many of the men wore chain mail which afforded better protection but it was too heavy for kahlan to be practical for her to wear in combat speed and maneuverability were life kahlan knew better than to risk her life needlessly she was more valuable to their cause in her capacity as a leader than as a combatant still while she rarely went directly into combat the fighting had often enough come to her a sergeant finally arrived to give her a report assassins was all he said that one chilling word was enough it was what she had figured and explained the state of the camp how many casualties kahlan asked i only know for sure that one attacked captain zimmer he was eating at a campfire with his men the captain managed to miss a killing blow but took a nasty wound in the leg hes lost a lot of blood the surgeons are seeing to him right now what about the assassin verna asked the sergeant looked surprised at the question commander zimmer killed the assassin he screwed up his face with the distaste of the rest of what he had to say the assassin was dressed in a dharan uniform he walked through the camp without notice until he found a targetcaptain zimmerand attacked verna let out a worried breath a sister might be able help the captain kahlan dismissed him with a nod the sergeant saluted with a fist to his heart before rushing off to his duties it was then that kahlan spotted zedd approaching the front of his robes was wet and darkundoubtedly with blood tears ran down his face gooseflesh tingled up kahlans arms and legs verna gasped when zedd suddenly saw her and for an instant faltered before rushing toward them verna clutched kahlans arm zedd seized vernas hand hurry was all he said it was all he needed to say they all understood verna let out a mournful cry as she was pulled along after the old wizard kahlan and cara ran behind as zedd led them on a winding charge through the confusion of shouting men galloping horses squads in formation dashing in every direction and unit officers taking roll call the roll call was needed because the assassins were in dharan uniforms so they could sneak up close to their quarry it was necessary to account for every man in order to single out those who didnt belong it was tedious and difficult but essential they rushed into the swirl of turmoil around the tents where wounded men were being treated men shouted orders as others brought in men crying out in pain or men with their limp arms dragging the ground each tent could hold up to ten or twelve men vernas composure was frayed with panic zedd stopped her holding her by her arms his voice was choked with his emotion a man stabbed holly warren was nearby and tried to protect the girl verna i swear to you on my dead wifes soul i did everything i could do dear spirits forgive me but i must be the one to tell you he is beyond my power to help him he asked for you and kahlan kahlan stood in a stupor her heart in her throat zedds hand on her back urged her to move quickly she followed verna ducking into the tent half a dozen dead men lay at the far end of the tent covered with blankets here and there a bloody hand stuck out from under a cover one man was missing a boot kahlan stared unable to make her mind work unable to understand how the soldier had lost a boot it seemed so sillydying and losing a boot tragedy and comedy together under a shroud warren lay on his back on a pallet on the ground sister philippa was on the far side of him her tall frame bent over the youthful wizard holding his hand sister phoebe was on the near side holding his other hand both women turned tearstained faces up to see verna above them warren sister philippa said its verna shes here and kahlan too the two sisters quickly moved out of the way for verna and kahlan to take their places they covered their mouths to hold in their cries as they fled the tent warren was as white as the stacks of clean bandages lying nearby his eyes were open wide as he stared up as if he could no longer see his curly blond hair was matted in sweat his robes were soaked in blood warren verna moaned oh warren verna kahlan he asked in a breathy whisper yes my love verna kissed his hand a dozen times kahlan squeezed his other limp hand im here too warren i had to hold on till you both came back to tell you both tell us what warren verna asked through her tears kahlan he whispered she leaned in im here warren dont try to talk just listen to me kahlan pressed his hand to her cheek im listening warren richard is right his vision i had to tell you kahlan didnt know what to say a smile came to his ashen face verna what is it my love i love you always have verna could hardly get her words past her choking tears warren dont die dont die please dont die give me a kiss warren whispered while i still live and dont mourn what ends but what a good life weve had kiss me my love verna bent over him and met his lips with hers giving him a gentle loving kiss as her tears dripped onto his face unable to bear the scene kahlan staggered out of the tent finding zedds protective arms waiting she hid her weeping against his shoulder what are we doing she cried whats it all for what good is any of it were losing everything zedd had no answer for her tears at the futility of it all the minutes dragged on kahlan forced herself to be strong to be the mother confessor she couldnt let the men see her giving up silent men stood nearby not wanting to look in the direction of the tent where warren lay dying when general meiffert materialized out of the darkness the relief on caras face was evident he rushed up close to cara but didnt touch her im glad to see you safely returned he said to kahlan how is warren kahlan couldnt speak zedd shook his head i didnt think he would live this long i think he held on so he could see his wife the general nodded sorrowfully we caught the man who did it kahlan came to full attention bring him to me she growled without hesitation the general hurried off to retrieve the assassin when kahlan gestured cara went with him what did he say to you zedd asked in a quiet voice so that others wouldnt hear he wanted to tell you something kahlan took a purging breath he said richard is right zedd looked away in forlorn misery warren was his friend kahlan never knew zedd to take a liking to anyone the way he had taken to warren they shared things she knew she could never understand despite his young appearance warren was over a hundred and fifty years old close to the same age as verna to zedd who was always looked up to as the wise old wizard it must have been a particular comfort to share wizardly matters with one who understood such things instead of constantly needing explanation and direction he said the same to me zedd whispered tearfully why didnt warren use his gift kahlan asked zedd wiped a finger across his cheek he was walking past just as the man seized and stabbed holly perhaps the assassin couldnt find his target or maybe he became lost and confused or he could have just panicked and decided to stab someone and holly was handy at that moment kahlan wiped her hands back across her cheeks maybe he had been told to look for a wizard in such robes and when he saw warren he stabbed holly to cause a commotion so he could get at warren that could be warren doesnt really know it all happened in an instant warren was right there and just reacted i asked but he didnt know why he didnt use his power perhaps in that terrible flash of the knife he feared to kill holly in the process since the man had her and was stabbing her his instinct to save her just caused him to snatch for the knife it was a fatal mistake maybe warren simply hesitated before using his power zedd shrugged painfully a splitsecond hesitation has been the end of a lot of wizards if i hadnt hesitated kahlan said as she stared off into bitter memories nicci wouldnt have had me she wouldnt have richard now dont try to fix the past dear oneit cant be done what about the future zedds gaze sought hers meaning remember at the end of last winter when we left campwhen the order began moving when zedd nodded she went on warren pointed at this place on the map he said we had to be here to stop the order are you suggesting he knew he would die here you tell me im a wizard not a prophet but warren is when he said nothing kahlan asked in a whisper what about holly i dont know i was just arriving to talk to warren it had just happened soldiers were jumping the man warren yelled orders for them not to kill him i guess he was thinking the assassin might have valuable information i saw holly bleeding from her wounds in shock i immediately had warren brought in here and started to work on him sisters rushed in and took holly to another tent zedds heartsick gaze sank to the cold ground i did everything i know to do it wasnt enough kahlan enclosed his shoulders protectively in her arm it was out of your hands from the first zedd it was disorienting to see her source of strength in a state of such painful weakness it was irrational to expect him to be unemotional and strong in such circumstances but it was still disconcerting in that moment kahlan was overcome with a sense of all the loss zedd had suffered in his life it was all there in his wet hazel eyes men made way for the returning general meiffert and cara behind them two burly soldiers had a wiry young manlittle more than a boy really he was muscular but no match for the men who had him his hair tumbled down across a forehead above dark contemptuous eyes he wore a proud sneer so the lad said trying to sound tough i guess that in my service to the order i knifed someone important that makes me a hero of the order make him kneel before the mother confessor general meiffert said with quiet command the two soldiers kicked the back of the young mans knees to take him down he snickered as he knelt before her so youre the big important whore ive heard so much about too bad you werent aroundid have loved to have cut you i guess i showed some people im pretty good with a knife so in my absence kahlan said you cut a child instead just for practice id have cut a lot more people if these big dumb oxen wouldnt have lucked into jumping me but i still did my duty to the order and the creator it was the bravado of someone who knew he was about to pay the ultimate price for his actions he was trying to convince himself that he had fulfilled a valuable service he wanted to die a hero and then go straight to the creator for his reward in the afterlife verna emerged from the tent there was no hurry in her movements her face was ashen and drawn kahlan took hold of her arm ready to help if verna should need it verna stopped when she saw the young man on his knees this is him she asked kahlan put her other hand tenderly to vernas back silently offering support this is him kahlan confirmed thats right the lad sneered up at verna im the one who knifed the enemy wizard im a hero the order will bring relief and justice to the people and i helped do it your kind is always trying to keep us down keep you down verna repeated in a dead tone those who are born with all the luck and advantagesthey never want to share i waited but no one ever gave me a chance in life until the order did im a hero of downtrodden people everywhere ive struck a blow against the oppressors of mankind ive helped bring justice to those who are never given a chance i killed an evil man im a hero the silence of everyone nearby was all the more grim with the backdrop of activity going on as men searched the camp for other assassins officers called out names getting quick replies troops searching for invaders trotted through the night their chain mail and weapons jingling like thousands of tiny bells the man on his knees grinned at verna the creator will give me my reward in the next life im not afraid to die ive earned eternity in his everlasting light verna passed her gaze among the eyes of all those gathered i dont care what you do to him she said but i want to hear his screams the entire night i want this camp to hear his screams the entire night i want the orders scouts to hear his screams that will be my tribute to warren the young man licked his lips realizing things werent going as he had expected that isnt fair the young assassin shouted in protest panic began to tremble through his body he had been prepared for a martyrs death a quick end this was something unforeseen he died quick i should have the same consideration this isnt fair fair what isnt fair verna said with terrible calmness is that your mother ever opened her legs for your father we shall now belatedly correct her mistake what isnt fair is that a good and kind man died at the hands of a sniveling little coward so lacking in sense that he is incapable of recognizing the lies he now spews out at us you wish to trade your life for the one you have taken you wish to die in a cause you foolishly believe to be noble you shall have your wish young man but before you die you shall fully understand what it is you have surrendered how precious is your life and how utterly wasted you shall come to regret your mothers act of creation as much as do we verna swept a look of finality over the group watching this is my wish please see to its execution cara took a step forward let me do it then her grim face held no hint of relish i would be best at carrying out your wish as you intend it verna the lad laughed hysterically a woman you all think youre going to have some big blond bitch try to teach me a lesson youre all as crazy as ive heard verna nodded i will be indebted to you cara she started to leave but paused dont let him die before morning when i will come to witness it i wish to look into his eyes and see if this young man has come to understand the nature of reality and its lack of fairness before he forfeits his fife for nothing of worth and for his part in a great evil i promise you cara said softly to verna that even though this night will seem forever to you in your grief it will be infinitely longer for him verna simply touched caras shoulder in appreciation on her way past after verna had walked off into the darkness cara turned to kahlan i would ask to use a tent no one should have to see what i do to him his screams will be knowledge enough as you wish mother confessor the young man struggled frantically but the soldiers had him in a firm grip if youre so good as you claim then show me mercy drool ran from the corner of the boys mouth and hung swinging in rhythm with his panting but i have kahlan said i am allowing you to suffer the sentence verna has named and not the one i would impose cara snapped her fingers and pointed at the young man as she marched off the soldiers dragged the shrieking boy after her the others we captured the general asked kahlan kahlan started for her tent cut their throats chapter kahlan sat up when she realized that she didnt hear the distant screams any longer it was still hours till dawn maybe his heart had stopped unexpectedly no cara was mordsith and was well trained in what mordsith did as she had lain fully dressed in her bed listening to the bloodcurdling screams aching for verna missing warren sweat had occasionally beaded her brow whenever she thought about how richard had once been the one under a mordsiths agiel to banish the uninvited ghastly images invading her thoughts she looked up at spirit the lamp hanging from the ridgepole cast a warm light on the carving stressing the graceful lines of her flowing robes her fisted hands her head thrown back no matter how many times kahlan looked at the statue she never tired of it every time it was a thrill richard had chosen this view of life over the terrible bitterness he could have fallen into clinging to such bitterness would only have robbed him of his ability to experience happiness kahlan heard a commotion outside just as she sprang to her feet cara poked her head in through the flap kahlan had left open the mordsiths blue eyes were in a lethal rage she stepped into the tent pulling the lad behind by a fistful of his hair he shook as he blinked frantically blinded by the blood in his eyes gritting her teeth cara shoved him he fell to the dirt at kahlans feet whats this about kahlan asked the look in caras eyes revealed a woman at the edge of a feral fury at the edge of control at the fardistant reaches of what it was to even be human she was treading the soil of another world madness cara dropped to her knees and seized the young man by the hair she yanked him back up and held him against her redleatherclad body as she pressed her agiel to his throat he choked and coughed blood frothed from his mouth tell her cara growled he held his hands out to the sides in surrender i know him i know him kahlan frowned down at the terrified young man you know who richard cypher i know richard cypherand his wife nicci kahlan felt as if the world crashed down around her the weight of that world sank her to her knees before caras charge what is your name gadi im gadi cara pressed her agiel into his back causing him to let loose a wild scream she slammed his face to the ground kahlan held a hand out cara wait we need to talk to him i know im just making sure he wants to talk to us kahlan had never seen cara quite like this unleashed this way this was more than doing as verna asked this was personal to cara warren had been someone she liked but worse for gadi richard was caras life the mordsith pulled him upright again red bubbles grew around his broken nose when the light caught cara just right kahlan could see blood glistening on the red leather now i want you to tell the mother confessor everything he was nodding as he wept and before cara had even completed the command i lived therewhere they came to live i lived where richard and his wife nicci kahlan corrected yes nicci he didnt understand what she meant they came to live in a room in our house my friends and i didnt like him then kamil and nabbi started talking to him they started liking richard i was angry he fell to such blubbering that he couldnt finish kahlan seized his jaw slick with blood and shook his face talk or ill have cara start in again i dont know what to say what you want he sobbed everything you know about him and nicci everything kahlan yelled inches from his face tell her the rest of it cara said in his ear as she pulled him to his feet kahlan followed him up fearing to miss a precious word richard started to get people to fix up the place he works for ishaq at the transport company when he came home at night he would fix things he showed kamil and nabbi how to fix things i hated him you hated him because he made things better he made kamil and nabbi and others think they could do things for themselves when they cantpeople cant do for themselves thats a cruel deception people have to be helped by those with the ability its their duty richard should have made things better because he couldhe shouldnt have made kamil and nabbi and the others think they could change their lives for themselves no one can do that the people need help not such heartless and unfeeling expectations i found out richard was working at night he was hauling extra loads for greedy people he was making money he shouldnt be allowed to make then one night i was sitting on the steps and i heard nicci get mad at richard she came out to me on the steps and asked me to have sex with her women always want me she was a whoreno better than the restdespite all her airs she told me that richard wasnt man enough to take care of her and she wanted me to have her because he wouldnt i gave it to her good just the way she wanted it i gave it to the whore good i hurt her good just like she deserved with all her strength kahlan rammed her knee into his groin gadi doubled over unable to draw his breath his eyes rolled up in his head and he went down hard cara smiled i thought you might like to hear that part kahlan wiped the tears from her cheeks it wasnt richard i knew it wasnt richard it was this pig kahlan kicked him in the ribs as he started coming around he let out a cry she wagged her fingers impatiently cara seized him by the hair and yanked him to his feet finish your story kahlan said with icy rage he coughed and gagged and drooled cara had to steady him on his feet she held his arms behind his back so he couldnt comfort his groin the pain was clearly evident in his contorted face talk or ill do it again please i was telling you when you stopped me get on with it he nodded frantically when i was done with the whorwhen i left nicci kamil and nabbi were crazy kahlan lifted his chin what do you mean they were crazy they were crazy angry because i was with richards wife they like richard so they were crazy angry with me they were going to do things to me hurt me so i decided to go into the army to fight for the order against the heathens and kahlan waited she glanced up at cara the mordsith did something behind gadis back that made him gasp in a cry and then i turned in richards name you did what i turned in his name before i left i told the city guards at protector muksins office that richard was doing criminal things that he was stealing work from working peoplethat he was making more than his fair share kahlan frowned what does that mean what happens when you turn in a name gadi was trembling in terror he clearly didnt want to answer cara pressed her agiel against his side blood oozed down his sweatsoaked shirt he tried but couldnt draw a breath his ashen face began to turn purple tell her cara said in cold command gadi gasped in a breath when she released the pressure they will arrest him they will make him confess confess kahlan asked fearing the answer gadi nodded reluctantly they will torture a confession out of him most likely they might even hang his body from a pole and let the birds pick his bones if he confesses to something bad kahlan swayed on her feet she thought she might throw up the world had disintegrated into madness she kicked over the map basket and pawed through the maps until she found the one she wanted she pulled a pen and an ink bottle out of their box set the statue of spirit on the ground and spread the small map across the table come here kahlan ordered snapping her fingers and pointing to the ground before the table she put the pen in his trembling fingers after he had shuffled close kahlan pointed at the map we are here show me where you traveled with the order he pointed this river i came up from the old world with reinforcement troops after some training we joined the emperors force and we advanced up this river basin over the summer kahlan pointed to the old world now i want you to mark the place where you lived alturrang thats it there she watched him dip the pen and circle the dot and the name alturrang far to the souththe heart of the old world now she said mark the roads you came up in the old worldincluding any cities or towns you went through cara and kahlan both watched gadi mark roads and circle a number of cities and towns warren and the sisters were from the old world they knew a great deal about the lay of the land enabling them to provide detailed maps when hed finished gadi looked up kahlan turned over the map draw the city of alturrang i want to see the major roadsanything you know of it gadi immediately set to drawing the map for her when he was finished he looked up again now show me where this room is where richard lives gadi marked the map to indicate the place but i dont know if he will be there lots of people turn in the names of people suspected of wrongdoing against their fellow man if they take the name and they arrest him the brothers may order penance or they could even question him and then order him put to death brothers kahlan asked gadi nodded brother narev and his disciples they are the head of the fellowship of order brother narev is our spiritual guide he and the brothers are the heart of the order what do they look like kahlan asked her mind already racing ahead the brothers wear dark brown robes with hoods they are simple men who have given up the luxuries of life to serve the wishes of the creator and the needs of mankind brother narev is closer to the creator than any man alive he is mankinds savior gadi was clearly awed by the man kahlan listened while gadi told her everything he knew about the fellowship of order about the brothers and about brother narev gadi shook in the silence after he had finished kahlan wasnt watching him but staring off what did richard look like she asked in a distant voice was he well did he look all right yes hes big and strong foolish people like him kahlan spun around landing the heel of her hand against gadis face hard enough to knock him from his feet get him out of here she told cara but you must show me mercy now i told you what you want to know he broke down in tears you must show me mercy you have a job to finish kahlan said to cara kahlan pulled the tent flap back and peeked in sister dulcinia was snoring softly holly looked up tears filled the girls eyes as she stretched out her arms pleadingly kahlan knelt beside the girl and bent over to hug her holly started crying sister dulcinia woke with a snort mother confessor kahlan put a hand on the sisters arm its late why dont you go get some sleep sister sister dulcinia smiled her agreement and then grunted with the effort of struggling to her feet in the low tent in the distance on the far side of the camp kahlan could hear gadis bloodcurdling screams kahlan smoothed the downy hair from hollys brow and kissed her there how are you sweetheart are you all right oh mother confessor it was awful wizard warren got hurt i saw it kahlan hugged her as she started weeping again i know i know is it all right is he healed like they healed me kahlan cupped the little cheek and wiped a tear away with her thumb im sorry holly but warren died her brow bunched up with her misery he shouldnt have tried to save me its my fault hes dead no kahlan soothed thats not the way it is warren gave his life to save us all he did what he did out of his love of life he didnt want to let evil be free among those he loved do you really think so of course i do remember him for how he loved life and how he wanted to see those he loved free to live their own lives he danced with me at his wedding i thought he was the most handsome groom ever he was indeed a handsome groom kahlan said with a smile at the memory he was one of the best men ive ever known and he gave his life to help keep us free we honor his sacrifice by living the best lives we can live kahlan started to rise but holly hugged her all the tighter so kahlan lay down beside her she stroked hollys brow and kissed her cheek will you stay with me mother confessor please for a while sweetheart holly fell asleep cuddled up to kahlan kahlan wept frustrated bitter tears over the sleeping girl a girl who should have the right to live her life others though lusted to steal that right at the point of a blade after she had finally decided what she must do kahlan slipped silently out of the tent to go pack her things it was just turning light when kahlan emerged from her tent carrying her bedroll saddlebags dharan sword the sword of truth leather armor and pack with the rest of her things spirit was safely rolled up in her bedroll a light snow was just beginning to fall announcing to the muted camp that winter had arrived in the northern midlands everything seemed as if it was ending it wasnt just warrens death that convinced her but rather the futility it symbolized she could no longer delude herself the truth was the truth richard was right the order would have it all sooner or later they would have her and kill her along with those who fought with her it was only a matter of time until they enslaved all of the new world they already had much of the midlands some lands had fallen willingly there was no way to resist a force of their overwhelming size the terror of their threats or the seduction of their promises warren had attested it as part of his dying words richard was right she had thought she could make a difference she had thought she could drive back the advancing hordesby the sheer weight of her will if need be it was arrogance on her part the forces of freedom were lost many of the people in those fallen lands had put their faith in the order at the cost of their liberty what was left to her running retreat terror death she had nothing to lose anymore really nearly everything was already lost or soon would be while she at least still had her life she was going to use it she was going to go to the heart of the order what are you doing kahlan spun around to see cara frowning at her cara i im leaving cara gave a single nod good i too think it is time i wont be long getting my things together you get the horses and ill meet no im going alone you will stay here cara stroked her long blond braid laying over the front of her shoulder why are you going theres nothing left here for me to donothing i can do im going to go drive my sword into the heart of the order brother narev and his disciples its the only thing i can do to strike back at them cara smiled and you think i want to stay here you will stay here where you should be with benjamin im sorry mother confessor cara said tenderly but i cant follow such orders i am mordsith my life is sworn to protecting lord rahl i promised lord rahl i would protect you not stay and kiss benjamin cara i want you to stay here its my life if this is the end all there is to be then i will do with the rest of my life as i wish its my life to live not yours to live for me im going and that is final kahlan saw in caras eyes that it was kahlan didnt think she had ever heard cara express such a sentiment about her own wishes it was indeed her life besides cara knew where kahlan was going if kahlan left without cara cara would simply follow getting mordsith to obey orders was often more difficult than herding ants youre right cara it is your life but when we get down into the old world youre going to have to wear something to disguise who you are red leather in the old world will be the end of us i will do what i must to protect you and lord rahl kahlan smiled at last i believe you would cara cara wasnt smiling kahlans smile faded im sorry i tried to leave without you cara i shouldnt have done it that way youre a sister of the agiel i should have talked it over with you thats the proper way to treat someone you respect cara smiled at last now you are making sense we might not ever come back from this cara shrugged and you think we will live the high life if we stay i think only certain death awaits us if we stay kahlan nodded thats what i think too thats why i must go im not quarreling kahlan gazed out at the falling snow the last time winter had come she and cara had just managed to escape in time kahlan steeled herself and asked cara do you really believe richard is still alive of course lord rahl is alive cara held up her agiel rolling it in her fingers remember and then she did the agiel would only work if the lord rahl to whom she was sworn was alive kahlan handed cara some of her load gadi he died as verna wished it she showed him no pity good pity for the guilty is treason to the innocent it was not long after dawn when kahlan made it to zedds tent cara had gone to get horses and supplies when kahlan called zedd asked her to enter he rose from the bench beside adie the old sorceress kahlan what is it ive come to bid you goodbye zedds eyes showed no surprise why dont you stay and get some rest leave tomorrow there are no tomorrows left winter is upon us again if i am going to do as i must i dont have a day to waste zedd gently gripped her shoulders kahlan warren wanted to see you he felt he had to tell you that richard was right it meant a great deal to him that you know that richard told us that you must not attack the heart of the order before the people prove themselves to him or all will be lost such a thing is even less likely to happen today than the day he said it and maybe warren meant that richard was rightthat we are going to lose the new world to the order so what is there to stay for maybe it was warrens way of trying to tell me to go to richard before im dead or hes dead and then its too late to even try and nicci ill find out when i get there but you cant hope to zedd what else is there for me to watch the midlands fall to aspire at most to live out my life running to live as a recluse hiding every day from the clutches of the order even if warren hadnt said it ive come to realizeno matter how much i wish it was otherwisethat richard is right the order will only be pinned down for the winter while we help the people escape aydindril in the spring the enemy will flood into my city then they will turn to dhara there will be nowhere to run though they escape for the moment the order will subjugate those people there is no future for me richard was right the least i can do is spend the last of my life living for myself and for richard there is nothing else left for me zedd tears brimmed in his eyes i will miss you so youve brought back good memories of my own daughter and given me so many good times kahlan threw her arms around him oh zedd i love you she couldnt hold back her own tears then she was all he had left and he was losing her too nothat wasnt true kahlan pulled back zedd the time has come for you to leave too you must go to the keep and protect it he nodded with great reluctance great sadness i know kahlan knelt before the sorceress and took up her hand adie will you go with him and keep him company a beautiful smile came to the womans weathered face well i she looked up zedd zedd scowled bags now youve ruined the surprise of the invite kahlan smacked his leg stop cursing in front of ladiesand stop being so sour id like to know youre not going to be lonely up there a smile stole across his face of course adie is going to the keep with me adie scowled in turn how do you know that old man you never asked my approval why i have a mind please stop it kahlan said both of you this is too important to be fussing over i can fuss if i want to zedd protested that be right adie shook a thin finger we are old enough to fuss if we wish kahlan smiled through her tears of course you can its just that after warren it reminds me of how much i hate to see people waste their lives on things that dont matter zedd truly did scowl now youve a thing or two to learn dear one if you dont know how important fussing is that be right adie said fussing keeps you sharp when you get old you need to stay sharp adie is entirely right zedd said why i think kahlan silenced him with a hug that adie joined are you sure about this dear one zedd asked after they parted i am im going to take my sword into the belly of the order zedd nodded as he hooked his bony fingers around the back of her neck he pulled her head close and kissed her brow if youre to go then ride hard and strike harder my thought exactly cara said as she stepped into the tent kahlan thought caras blue eyes looked a little more liquid than usual are you all right cara cara frowned whats that supposed to mean nothing kahlan said general meiffert got us the six fastest horses he could find cara smiled her pleasure at the prospect well have fresh mounts with us and be able to cover a lot of ground fast i have all our supplies loaded up if we leave now we should be able to escape winters grip we have the map so we can stay away from the routes the orders troops use and the heaviest population centers there are good roads and open country down there riding hard i think that we can make it in a few weeks a month at most zedds face contorted with concern but the order controls much of the southern midlands its dangerous country now i have a better way cara flashed a sly smile well go where i know the countryd hara we will go east from here and cross over the mountains then go south down through dharathrough mostly wideopen country were we can make good timedown through the azrith plains to eventually join the kern river far to the south after the river valley clears the mountains we will cut southeast into the heart of the old world zedd nodded his approval of the plan kahlan curled her fingers lovingly around the old wizards thin arm when will you go to the keep adie and i will leave in the morning i think it best not to dally here any longer today well settle matters of the army with the officers and the sisters i think that as soon as the people are out of aydindril and when the snow quickly deepens to insure the order wont be going anywhere until spring then our men should begin slipping out of this place to make their way over the mountains to the safety of dhara it will be slow going in winter but without having to fight as they travel it wont be as difficult as it otherwise would be that would be best kahlan agreed it will get our men out of harms way for now they wont have me to be the magic against magic for them but they will have verna and her sisters they know enough by now to carry on protecting the army from magic at least for a while the words hung in the air unspoken i want to go see verna before i leave kahlan said i think it will be good for her to have other people to worry about then i want to see general meiffert and then wed best start riding we have a long way to go and i want to be south before the snow hobbles us kahlan embraced zedd fiercely one last time when you see him zedd whispered in her ear tell the boy i love him dearly and i miss him something awful kahlan nodded against his shoulder and told him a bold lie youll see us both again zedd i promise you kahlan stepped out into the early light of winters first breath everything was dusted with snow making it look as if the world were carvedfrom white marble chapter in one long fluid motion with his fingertips adeptly guiding the far end of the file richard glided the steel tool down the fold of cloth held forever crisp in white marble concentrating on applying steady pressure to cut a precise fine layer he was lost in the work the file held hundreds of ridges row upon row of tiny blades of hardened steel which did the work of cutting away and shaping the noble stone these were blades he wielded with the same commitment with which he wielded any blade he blindly reached back and set the file down on the wooden bench careful to put it on the wood and not to let it clang against other steel lest he dull it prematurely he exchanged the file for another with even finer teeth and took out the roughness left by the correction accomplished with the one before with fingers as dustywhite as those of a baker laboring with flour richard examined the surface of the mans arm testing it for flaws until polished the minor flaws and facets were often easier to see with the fingers than the eye where he found them he used a smaller file in one hand while his other hand followed behind riding the swell of muscle feeling the subtle difference in what the tool had done to the stone he was removing only paperthin layers of material now it had taken him several months to arrive at this final layer it was exhilarating to be so close to the flesh the days had passed one upon another in an endless procession of work carving death in the day down at the site and life in the night carving for the order was balanced by carving for himselfslavery and freedom in opposition whenever one of the brothers inquired about the statue richard was careful to hide his satisfaction with what he was creating he did it by recalling the model he had been commanded to carve he always bowed his head respectfully and reported his progress on his penance assuring them that his work was on schedule and would be done on time to install in the palace plaza for the dedication stressing the word penance helped to direct their thoughts to that issue and away from the statue itself the brothers were invariably much more satisfied with his weariness from his toil at his work of contrition that they were interested in yet another dreary stone carving there were carvings everywhere this was but one more manifestation of the irredeemable inadequacy of mankind just as no one man in their cosmos was important no one work mattered it was the sheer number of carvings which was to be the orders overpowering argument for mans impotence the carvings were merely background props for the stage upon which the brothers moralized on sacrifice and salvation richard always humbly reported his nights with little food and little sleep as he worked on his penance after his carving work during the day selfless sacrifice being the proper cure for wickedness the brothers went away pleased richard switched to a smaller file one bent in a decreasing radius curve and worked the muscle where it narrowed into sinew showing the tension in the arm which revealed the underlying structure during the day he observed other men as they worked in order to study the complex shapes of muscle as it moved with life at night he referred to his own arms held up to the lamplight so that he might accurately depict veins and tendons standing proud on the surface he referred to a small mirror at times the surface of the skin he carved was a rich landscape stretched over bone and muscle creased in corners drawn smooth as it swept over curves for the womans body his memory of kahlan was vivid enough to require little other reference he wanted this work to show the capacity for movement for intent for accomplishment the posture of the figures displayed awareness the expression of the faces especially the eyes would show that most sublime human characteristic thought if the statues he had seen in the old world were a celebration of misery and death this was a celebration of life he wanted this to show the raw power of volition the man and woman he carved were his refuge against his despair over his captivity they embodied freedom of spirit they embodied reason rising up to triumph to his great annoyance richard noticed that light was coming in the window above the statue taking over from the lamps that had burned all night all night he had done it again it was not the quality of the light which he actually very much favored which vexed him but that it signified the end of his time with his statue he now had to go carve ugliness down at the site fortunately that work required no thought or careful effort as he drawfiled the curve of the mans shoulder muscle there was a knock at the door richard it was victor richard sighed he had to stop richard pulled the red cloth tied around his neck down away from his nose and mouth where it kept him from breathing all the marble dust it was a little trick victor had told him about used by the marble carvers from his homeland of cavatura be right there richard stepped down off the ledge made by the base where he had carved out the legs at midcalf he stretched his back realizing how much it hurt from hunching over and from lack of sleep he retrieved the canvas tarp and shook the dust from it just before he flung the cover over the statue he got the full view of the figures the floor shelves and tools were covered in a fine layer of marble dust but against the black walls the marble stood out in the glory of light from above richard threw the tarp over the incomplete figures and then opened the door you look a ghost victor announced with a lopsided grin richard brushed himself off i forgot the time did you see in the shop last night the shop no what victors grin returned wider this time priska had the bronze dial delivered yesterday ishaq brought it come see around the other side of the blacksmiths shop in the stock room the bronze sat in a number of pieces it was too big for priska to cast as one piece so he had made several that victor would join and mount the pedestal for the partial ring that would be the dial plane was massive knowing it was for a statue richard was carving priska had done a job to be proud of its beautiful richard said isnt it though ive seen him do fine work before but this time priska has outdone himself victor squatted and ran his fingers over the strange symbols filled in with black priska said that at one time long ago his home city of alturrang had freedom but like so many others lost it as a tribute to that time he cast it with symbols in his native tongue brother neal saw it and was pleased because he thought it a tribute to the emperor who is also from alturrang richard sighed priska has a tongue as smooth as his castings would you have some lardo with me victor asked as he stood the sun was already well up richard stretched his neck and peered down at the site id best not i need to get to work richard squatted down and lifted one end of the pedestal first though let me show you where this goes victor grabbed the other end and together they lugged the bronze casting around the shop when richard opened the double doors victor saw the statue for the first time even if it was covered in a tarp that revealed only the round bulges that were the two heads even so victors eyes feasted it was apparent in those eyes how his vivid imagination was filling in some of it with his fondest hopes your statue is going well victor nudged richard with an elbow beauty richard was overcome with a blissful smile ali victor you will see for yourself soon enough the dedication is only a couple weeks off i will be ready it will be something to bring a song to our hearts before they kill me anyway victor dismissed such talk with a flourish of his hand i am hoping that when they see such beauty again and at their palace they will approve richard held out no such illusion he remembered then and reached into a pocket to pull out a piece of paper he handed it to the blacksmith i didnt want priska to cast words on the back of the dial because i didnt want the wrong people to see them i would ask you to engrave these words on the back surfaceabout the same height as the symbols on the front victor took the paper and unfolded it his grin melted away he looked up at richard with an open look of surprise this is treason richard shrugged they can only kill me once they can torture you a long time before they kill you they have very unpleasant ways to kill people too richard have you ever seen a man buried in the sky while he was still alive bleeding from a thousand cuts his arms bound so that the vultures could feast on his living flesh the order binds my arms now victor as i work down there as i see the death around me i am bleeding from a thousand cuts the vultures of the order are already feasting on my flesh with grim resolve richard held victors gaze will you do it victor glanced down at the paper again he took a deep breath and then let it slowly out as he studied the paper in his hand treason though these words be i like them i will do it richard clapped him on the side of the shoulder and gave him a confident smile good man now look here where the pedestal is to be attached richard lifted the tarp enough to uncover the base ive carved you a flat face tilted at the proper angle i didnt know where the holes in the casting would be so i left it for you to drill the holes and fill them with lead for the pins once you attach the pedestal then i can calculate the angle of the hole ill need to drill for the gnomon victor nodded the gnomon pole will be ready soon i will make you a drill bit the proper size for it good and a round rasp to do final fitting in the hole you will have it victor said as they both stood he waved his hand toward the covered statue you trust me not to peek while you are off carving your ugly work richard chuckled victor i know you want more than anything to see the nobility of this statue when it is finally finished you would not spoil that experience for yourself for anything victor let out his rolling belly laugh i guess you are right come after your work and we will have lardo and talk of beauty in stone and the way the world once was richard hardly heard victor he was staring at what he knew so well even though it was covered from his eyes it was not hidden from his soul he was ready to begin the process of polishing to make flesh in stone her head bent her scarf protecting her from the chill winter wind nicci hurried down the narrow alleyway a man coming the other way bumped against her shoulder not because he was rushing but because he simply didnt seem to care where he was going nicci threw a fiery scowl at his empty eyes her fierce look fell away down a bottomless well of indifference she clutched her sack of sunflower seeds closer to her stomach as she moved on through the muddy alleyway she stayed close to the rough wooden walls of the buildings so she wouldnt be jostled by the people going the other way people bundled against the current cold snap moved through the alleyway toward the street beyond looking for rooms for food for clothes for jobs she could see men beyond the alley sitting on the ground leaning against buildings on the far side of the street watching without seeing as wagons rumbled down the roads taking supplies out to the site of the emperors palace nicci wanted to get to the bread shop she had been told they might have butter today she wanted to get butter for richards bread he would be home for dinnerhe had promised she wanted to make him a good meal he needed to eat he had lost some weight though it only added distracting definition to his muscular build he was like a statue in the fleshlike the statues she used to see long ago she remembered how when she was little her mothers servants made cakes out of sunflower meal she had been able to buy enough to make him some sunflower cakes and maybe she would have butter to put on them nicci was growing increasingly anxious the dedication was to take place in a few days richard said his statue would be ready he seemed too calm about it as if he had come to some inner peace he seemed almost like a man who had accepted his imminent execution whenever richard spoke to her despite the conversation his mind seemed elsewhere and his eyes held that quality which she so valued in the wasteland that was life the misery that was existence this was the only hope left to her all around her people looked forward only to death only in her fathers eyes when she was younger and more so now in richards did she see any evidence that there was something to make it all worthwhile some reason for existence nicci was slowed to a halt by the clinkclinkclink of pebbles rattling in a cup the sound was the unmistakable rattle of her chains she had been a servant to need her whole life and as much as she tried there it was the cup of some poor beggar still rattling for her help she could not deny it tears filled her eyes she had so wanted to serve richard butter with his bread but she had only one silver penny and this beggar had nothing she at least had some bread and some sunflower seeds how could she want butter for richards bread and cakes when this man had nothing she was evil she knew for wanting to keep her silver penny the penny richard had earned with his own sweat and effort she was evil for wanting to buy butter for richard with it who was richard to have butter he was strong he was able why should he have more while others had none nicci could almost see her mother slowly shaking her head in bitter disappointment that the penny was still in niccis fist and not helping the man in need how was it that she could never seem to live up to her mothers example of morality how was it she could never overcome her evil nature nicci turned slowly and dropped her silver penny in the beggars cup people gave the beggar a wide berth without seeing him they avoided coming near him they were deaf to the rattle of his cup how could people not yet have learned the orders teachings how could they not help those in need it was always left to her she looked at him then and recoiled at the sight of the hideous man swathed in filthy rags she pulled back more when she saw lice hopping through his thatch of greasy hair he peered out at her through a slit in the rags draped around his face but it was what she saw through that slit that caught her breath in her throat the scars were gruesome to be sure as if he had been melted by the keepers own fires yet it was the eyes that gripped her as the man slowly rose to his feet the mans grimy fingers like a claw curled around her arm nicci he hissed in startled triumph drawing her close caught in the grip of his powerful fingers and his burning glare she was unable to move she was so close she could see his lice hopping at her kadar kardeef so you recognize me even like this she said nothing else but her eyes must have said that she thought he was dead for he answered her unspoken question remember that little girl the one you seemed to care so much about she urged the towns people to save me she refused to allow me to die there on the fire where you had put me she hated you so much she was determined to save me she selflessly devoted herself to caring for me to helping her fellow man as you had ordered the towns people to do oh i wanted to die i never knew a person could have that much pain and still live as much as i wanted to die i lived because i want you to die even more you did this to me i want the keeper to sink his fangs into your soul nicci looked deliberately at his grotesque scars and so for this you have come seeking your revenge no not for that for making me beg where my men could hear it for allowing other people to hear me beg for my life it was for that reason they saved meand their hatred of you it is for that that i seek revengefor not allowing me to die for condemning me to this life of a freak where passing women toss pennies in my cup nicci gave him a smooth smile why kadar if you want to die i can certainly oblige you he released her arm as if it had burned his fingers his imagination gave her powers she didnt have he spat at her kill me then you filthy witch strike me dead nicci flicked her wrist and brought her dacra to hand the dacra was a knifelike weapon carried by sisters once the sharpened rod was stuck into a victim no matter where releasing her power into the dacra killed them instantly kadar kardeef didnt know she had no power but even without her power behind it the dacra was still a dangerous weapon that could be driven into a heart or through a skull he wisely backed away he wanted to die yet he feared it why didnt you go to jagang he would not have let you become a beggar jagang was your friend he would have taken care of you you would not have to beg kadar kardeef laughed youd have liked that wouldnt you to see me living off the scraps of jagangs table you would love to sit at his side the slave queen and have him see me fallen to this to watch as you two tossed me your crumbs fallen to what to see you wounded youve both been wounded before he snatched her wrist again i died a hero to jagang i would not want him to know i begged like any of the weak fools we have crushed beneath our boots nicci pressed her dacra against his belly backing him off kill me then nicci he opened his arms finish it like you should have you never left a job incomplete before strike me dead like i should have been long ago nicci smiled again death is no punishment every day you live is a thousand deaths but you know that dont you kadar was i that repulsive to you nicci was i that cruel to you how could she tell him that he was and how much she hated him having her as chattel for his amusement it was for the good of all that the order used men like kadar kardeef how could she put herself her own interests above the good of mankind nicci turned and rushed off down the alleyway thank you for the penny he called mockingly after her you should have granted my request you should have nicci nicci wanted only to gohome and scrub the lice out of her hair she could feel them burrowing into her scalp chapter richard pulled away the fistful of straw he brushed the fragments of grasses from his leather apron his arms ached from the labor of rubbing the straw lightly loaded with fine abrasive clays against the stone yet when he saw the luster of the stone the character of the high polish the way the marble glowed taking light deep into the stone and returning it he felt only exhilaration the figures emerged from a sparkling stone base of rough marble the grooved lines of the toothed chisels used in opposing directions to shear off thin layers of stone were still evident on the lower calves where the legs emerged he wanted the statue to bear testimony to the hand of man and the figures origin in stone they rose up to nearly twice his height the statue was in part a representation of his love for kahlanhe could not keep kahlan out of the work because kahlan was his idea of a womanyet the woman in the statue was not kahlan it was a man of virtue with a woman of virtue joined in purpose they complemented each other the two universal parts of what it was to be human the curved section of the sundial had been placed by victor and his men several days before when richard had been working down at his job at the site of the emperors palace they had left the tarp over the statue as they worked after the ring had been set richard had placed the pole that served as the gnomon and finished the hand holding it the base of the pole was fixed with a gold ball victor had yet to see the statue he was beside himself with eager anticipation as richard stared at the figures only the light from the window above entered the darkened room he had been given the day from work down at the site in order to prepare the statue to be moved to the plaza that evening in the rooms beyond the shop door the hammers of the blacksmiths rang ceaselessly as victors men worked on orders for the palace richard stood in the near darkness listening to the sounds of the blacksmith shop as he stared up at the power of what he had created it was exactly as he had intended the figures of the man and woman seemed as if they might draw a breath at any moment and step out of the stone base they had bone and muscle sinew and flesh flesh in stone there was only one thing missingone thing left to do richard picked up his mallet and a sharp chisel when he looked up at the finished statues there were moments when he could almost believe as kahlan insisted that he used magic to carve yet he knew better this was a conscious act of human intellect and nothing more standing there chisel and mallet in hand gazing at the statue that was his vision in stone was a moment when richard could savor the supreme achievement of having his creation exist exactly as he had originally conceived it for this singular moment in time it was complete and it was his alone it was for this moment pure in its existence untainted by what others thought for this moment it was his accomplishment and he knew its value in his own heart and mind richard went to one knee before the figures he laid the cold steel of the chisel to his forehead and closed his eyes as he concentrated on what he had left to do blade be true this day he pulled the red cloth tied at his throat up over his nose so not to have to breathe the stone dust then set the chisel to the marks in the fiat place he had already prepared just above the heart of the flaw richard brought the mallet down and began to carve the title of the statue in the base for all to see nicci standing behind the corner of a building around a curve in the road watched farther down the hill as richard left the shop where he had carved his statue he was probably going to see about getting the team to move the stone he closed the door but he didnt put the chain on it no doubt he didnt intend to be gone for long men were working all over the hillside at a variety of shops tradesmen from leather workers to goldsmiths contributed to a constant din of saws grinding and hammering the ceaseless uproar of the labor was nerveracking while many of the men coming and going gave nicci a good looksee her glare warned them off once she saw richard disappear beyond the blacksmiths shop she started down the road she had told him she would wait until he was done before she came to see it she had kept her word still she felt uneasy she didnt know why but she felt almost as if she would be invading a sacred site richard hadnt invited her to see his statue he had asked her to wait until it was done since it was done she would wait no longer nicci didnt want to see it up on the plaza of the palace along with everyone else she wanted to be alone with it she didnt care about the order and their interest in the statue she didnt want to be standing with everyone else with people who would not recognize it as something of significance this was personal to her and she wanted to see it in private she reached the door without anyone accosting her or even paying her any mind she looked around in the bright hazy midafternoon light but saw only men attending to their work she opened the door and slipped inside the room was dark its walls black but the statue inside was well lit by light coming down from a window in the high roof nicci didnt look directly at the statue but kept her eyes to the floor as she hurried around the huge stone so she could see it for the first time from the front once in place her pulse pounding she turned niccis gaze rose up the legs the robes the arms the bodies of the two people up to their faces she felt as if a giant fist squeezed her heart to a stop this was what was in richards eyes brought into existence in glowing white marble to see it fully realized was like being struck by lightning in that instant her entire life everything that had ever happened to her everything she had ever seen heard or done seemed to come together in one flash of emotional violence nicci cried out in pain at the beauty of it and more so at the beauty of what it represented her eyes fell on the name carved in the stone base life nicci collapsed to the floor in tears in abject shame in horror in revulsion in sudden blinding comprehension in pure joy chapter after richard had returned with the fine white linen he had bought to cover the statue until the ceremony the following day he helped ishaq and a number of the men he knew from down at the site begin the slow process of sledging the heavy stone down to the plaza fortunately it hadnt rained in a while and the ground was firm ishaq knowing such business well had brought along greased wooden runners which were placed before the hefty wooden rails supporting the wooden platform under the statue so that the teams of horses could more easily pull the heavy load across the ground after the statue was dragged onto the second set of greased runners the men brought the ones left behind to the front leapfrogging the statue as it was moved along the hillside was white with the scree of waste stone so the statue weighed considerably less than it once had victor had originally hired special stonehauling wagons to move the block they couldnt use them now because the finished piece couldnt be turned on its side or handled in such a rough manner ishaq waved his red hat in his fist yelling orders warnings and prayers as they had moved along richard knew that his statue could be in no better hands the men who helped seemed to pick up ishaqs nervous tension they sensed this was something important and though the work was difficult they seemed more pleased to be a part of it than they were about their everyday labor at the site it took until late afternoon to move the statue the distance from the shop to the foot of the steps leading up to the plaza men shoveled dirt at the bottom of the stairs and packed it tight in order to ease the transition in grade a team of ten horses was taken around the other side of the columns long lengths of rope were passed through the vacant doorways and windows and then secured around the stone base in order to draw the sledge up the steps the extra runners were laid on the leading edge of the dirt ramp later to be moved up onto the steps as the statue progressed upward near to two hundred men swooped in at ishaqs frantic screaming to help pull on the ropes along with the horses inch by inch the statue ascended the steps richard could hardly stand to watch if anything went wrong all his work would tumble back and shatter the flaw would destroy it all he smiled to himself realizing how silly it was to worry that the evidence of his crime against the order might be ruined when the stone had finally arrived safely up on the plaza sand was packed underneath the platform to support its weight with the sand holding the wooden platform secure the heavy runners were removed with the runners off the platform was slid off its hill of sand from there it was a relatively simple task to coax the statue off the wooden base and onto the plaza itself at last marble sat on marble gangs of men with ropes around the stone base tugged the freed statue into its final resting place at the center point of the plaza ishaq stood beside richard when it was over mopping his brow with his red hat the entire statue and sundial was shrouded in its white linen cover with line securing it so ishaq couldnt see what it was still he sensed something of importance stood before him when was all ishaq asked richard knew what he meant i guess im not sure brother narev is to dedicate the palace to the creator tomorrow before all the officials who have traveled to see how the money theyve looted from the people is being spent i guess that tomorrow the officials along with everyone who comes to the ceremony are to see the statue along with the rest of the palace its just another display of the orders view of mans placei dont think they intend any unveiling or anything like that from what richard had learned the ceremony was a matter of great concern to the brothers the drain of the expense of the palace on top of the expense of the war required justification to the people who were paying that price not only with their sweat but with their blood the fellowship of order ruled through the imperial order with the necessary collaboration of brutes to whom they gave moral sanction while the brutes had easily crushed the bodies of those who had revolted the brothers wanted to crush the ideas such revolt represented before they could spread because it was such ideas that were the greatest threat to them to that end it was also important to inspire the officials the minions of the orders tyranny richard imagined that with scenes of mans depravity carved into thousands of feet of stone wall the flock of farflung officials of the order were going to be given guided tours by the brothers of all mankinds failings and thus coerced into their duty of turning over money they had already confiscated at the point of a bladea blade they wielded under the moral sanction of the brothers through the fellowship of order such petty officials were allowed a slice for their service to the order but the brothers no doubt wanted to forcefully dissuade them from any grander notions under the direction of the brothers the collective of the order like any autocratic ruler ultimately ruled only by the acquiesce of the people who were controlled either by moral intimidation or by physical threat or by both tyranny required constant tending lest the illusion of righteous authority evaporate in the light of its grim toll and the brutes be overpowered by the people who greatly outnumbered them that was why richard had known he couldnt lead he could not bludgeon people into understanding that bludgeoning was wrong because their lives were of great value whereas the order could have them bludgeoned into obedience by first making people believe that their lives were of no value free people were not ruled freedom had first to be valued before its existence could be demanded from what im told it is to be a big event ishaq said people from all over are coming to the dedication of the emperors palace the city is full of people from far and near richard looked around at the site as the workers trudged back to their regular jobs im surprised none of the officials have come to have a look at the palace in advance ishaq waved his hat dismissively they are all at the gathering of the fellowship of order in the center of alturrang big doings food drink speeches by the brothers you know how the order likes meetings very boring i imagine from what i know of such events the officials will be kept busy hearing of the needs of the order and their duty to get people to sacrifice to that need the brothers will keep them all under tight rein that meant the brothers would all be busytoo busy to come out to the site for the trivial task of checking a statue one of their slaves had carved in the scheme of things richards statue was insignificant it was only the starting point of the stately tour of the miles of walls displaying extensive scenes depicting the grand cause of the order as dictated by the brothers under narevs leadership if the officials and the brothers were too busy to come today the people of the city were not most would probably attend the events of the next day but they wanted to get a sense of the place for themselves first without the boring speeches that would drag out the ceremony richard watched many of those people go from one scene on the walls to another their faces stricken with the desolate emotion of what they were seeing guards kept people at a respectful distance and out of the labyrinth of rooms and hallways inside now enclosed by upper floors and in some places roofs now that the statue was set in place those guards moved in to clear the plaza entrance richard had only gotten a few hours of sleep in the last week now that the statue was in place exhaustion overwhelmed him with all the work on top of so little sleep and little to eat he was almost ready to drop where he stood victor appeared out of the long shadows some workers were leaving but others would still be at it for several more hours richard hadnt even realized that it had taken the better part of the day to move the statue with the heat of the work over his sweatsoaked shirt felt like ice against his flesh here victor said handing richard a slice of lardo eat in celebration that you are done richard thanked his friend before devouring the lardo his head was pounding he had done all he could do to show people what they needed to see with the work done though richard felt suddenly lost he realized only then how much he hated having finished to be without the noble work it had been his reason to go on ishaq im dead on my feet do you think you could give me a ride in your wagon partway to my house ishaq clapped richard on the back come you can ride in the back im sure jori would not mind at least he can save you part of your walk i must stay here and see to the teams and wagons richard thanked the smiling victor in the morning my friends in the full light we will remove the cover and see beauty one last time after that well who knows tomorrow then victor said with his sly laugh i dont think i will sleep tonight he called after richard the months of effort seemed to all come down upon him at once he climbed into the back of ishaqs wagon and bid the man a good night as ishaq left richard curled up under a tarp to shut out the light and was asleep before jori returned he was dead to the world as the wagon rolled away nicci watched as richard departed with ishaq she wanted to do this on her own she wanted it to be her part she wanted to contribute something of value only then could she face him she knew precisely how the order would react to the statue they would view it as a threat they would not allow other people to see it the order would destroy it it would be gone no one would ever know about it twining her fingers together she wondered how to proceedwhat should be first then it came to her she had gone to him before he had helped richard he was richards friend nicci rushed across the sprawling site of the palace and up the hill she was winded by the time she reached the blacksmiths shop the grim blacksmith was putting away tools he had already banked the fire in his forge the smells the sights even the layer of iron dust and soot gave nicci a joyful flash of her fathers shop she understood now the look that had been in her fathers eyes she doubted he had fully understood it himself but she did now the blacksmith looked up without smiling as she rushed into his shop mr cascella i need you his frown grew whats that matter why are you crying is it richard have they no nothing like that she grabbed his meaty hand and tugged at him it was like tugging on a boulder please come with me its important he gestured with his other hand around at his shop but i have to clean up for the night she yanked again on his hand she felt tears stinging her eyes please this is important he wiped his free hand down his face lead the way then nicci felt a little foolish pulling the burly blacksmith along by the hand as she raced down the hill he asked where they were going but she didnt answer she wanted to get down there before the light was gone when they reached the plaza guards were patrolling up at the top of the steps keeping everyone off the plaza nicci saw ishaq nearby loading long planks in a wagon she called to him and seeing the blacksmith with her he ran over nicci what is it you look a frightful i have to show you both the statue now victors scowl grew it will be unveiled tomorrow when richard no you must see it now they both fell silent ishaq leaned close as he gestured covertly we cant go up there its guarded i can nicci angrily wiped the tears from her cheeks her voice regained the quality of grave authority she had wielded so often that dark intonation that had passed judgment on countless lives and sent people to their death wait here both men pulled back at the menace in her eyes nicci straightened her back she lifted her chin she was a sister of the dark she ascended the steps in a measured pace as if the palace were hers it was she was the slave queen these men were hers to command she was deaths mistress the guards approached her warily sensing that the woman in black was a threat before they could speak she spoke first what are you doing here she hissed what are we doing here one asked were guarding the emperors palace thats what were doing how dare you talk back to me do you know who i am well i dont think i deaths mistress perhaps you have heard of me all dozen men straightened she saw their eyes take in the black dress again then her long blond hair her blue eyes by their reaction to what they saw it was obvious to nicci that her reputation preceded her before they could say another word she spoke again and what do you suppose emperor jagangs consort is doing here do you suppose i came without my master of course not you idiots the emperor several mumbled together in shock thats right the emperor is arriving for the dedication tomorrow i have come to make my own examination first and what do i find idiots here you stand with your thumbs in your ears while you should be standing to greet his excellency as he arrives into the city mere hours from now the guards eyes widened but no one told us where is he coming in we havent been informed arid do you suppose a man as important as jagang wishes his whereabouts to be known for any assassin in the neighborhood to find him and if there are assassins about here you fools stand all the men bowed urgently where the sergeant asked where is his excellency arriving hes arriving from the north the man licked his lips but but which road from the north there are any number of routes nicci planted her fists on her hips do you suppose his excellency is going to announce his route beforehand and to the likes of you if only one road was guarded then any assassin would know where to expect the emperor now wouldnt they all the roads are to be guarded and here you stand instead the men bobbed and bowed nervously wanting to leave to do their duty but not knowing where to go nicci gritted her teeth and leaned toward the sergeant get your men out to one of the north roads now that is you duty all the roads are to be guarded pick one the men bowed repeatedly as they sidestepped away after scurrying only a few feet they broke into a dead run she watched them collect other guards as they went as they vanished out of the plaza nicci turned to the two startled men they climbed the stairs now unhindered by guards some of the people treading the cobblestone paths come to look at the carvings on the walls had heard yelling and turned to watch what she was doing women on their knees praying up at the carvings in stone of the light shining down on depraved people looked over their shoulders as victor and ishaq reached the top of the plaza nicci untied the line grabbed the linen in her fists and ripped the shroud off the statue both men stopped in their tracks in a half circle around the plaza the walls were covered with the story of mans inadequacy all around them man was shown small depraved deformed impotent terrified cruel mindless wicked greedy corrupt and sinful he was depicted forever torn between otherworldly forces controlling every aspect of his miserable existence an existence incomprehensible in its caldron of churning evil with death his only escape into salvation those who had found virtue in this world under the protection of the creators light looked lifeless their faces without emotion without awareness their bodies as unbending as cadavers they stared out at the world through a vacant mindless stupor while all around them danced rats through their legs wriggled snakes and over their heads flew vultures in the vortex of this torrent of tortured life this cataclysm of corruption this depravity and debauchery rose up richards statue in bold glowing opposition it was a devastating indictment of all around it the mass and weight of the ugliness surrounding richards statue seemed to shrink back into insignificance the evil of the wall carvings seemed now to be crying out at their own dishonesty in the face of incorruptible beauty and truth the two figures in the center posed in a state of harmonious balance the mans body displayed a proud masculinity though the woman was clothed there was no doubt as to her femininity they both reflected a love of the human form as sensuous noble and pure the evil all around seemed as if it was recoiling in terror of that noble purity more than that though richards statue existed without conflict the figures showed awareness rationality and purpose this was a manifestation of human power ability intent this was life lived for its own sake this was mankind standing proudly of his own free will this was exactly what the single word at the bottom named it life that it existed was proof of the validity of the concept this was life as it should be livedproud reasoned and a slave to no other man this was the rightful exaltation of the individual the nobility of the human spirit everything on the walls all around offered death as its answer this offered life victor and ishaq were on their knees weeping the blacksmith lifted his arms up toward the statue before him laughing as tears ran down his face he did it he has done as he said he would flesh in stone nobility beauty people who had come to see the other carvings now began gathering to see what stood in the center of the plaza they stared with wide eyes many seeing for the first time the concept of man as virtuous in his own right the statement was so powerful that it alone invalidated everything up on the walls that it had been carved by man underscored its veracity many of them saw it with the same understanding nicci had the carvers wandered away from their work to come see what stood in the plaza the masons came down from the scaffolding the tenders set down their mortar buckets the carpenters climbed down from their work at setting beams the tilers laid aside their chisels the drivers picketed their horses men digging and planting the surrounding grounds set down their shovels they came from all directions toward the statue in the plaza people flowed up the steps in ever expanding ranks they flooded around the statue gazing in awe many fell to their knees weeping not in misery as they had before but with joy many like the blacksmith laughed as tears of delight ran down their happy faces a few covered their eyes in fear as people took it in they began to run off to get others soon men were coming down from the shops on the hill to see what stood in the plaza men and women who had come to watch the construction now ran off home to get loved ones to bring them to see what stood at the emperors palace it was something the like of which most of these people had never in their lives seen it was vision to the blind it was water to the thirsty it was life to the dying chapter kahlan pulled her map out and took a quick look it was hard to tell for sure she glanced up and down the road and noted that the other buildings were not quite as well kept what do you think cara asked in a low voice kahlan slipped the map back inside her mantle she snugged the fur up over her shoulders a little making sure it covered the hilt of richards sword she wore strapped behind her shoulder her own sword was hidden under her cloak at least the sun had just gone down i dont know we dont have much light left i guess theres only one way to be sure cara eyed the people who looked their way for the most part everyone in the city seemed remarkably incurious with their horses stabled outside of the city there would not be any swift escape if they needed to get away the general indifference of people though somewhat eased kahlans concern they had decided to simply be as aloof and casual as possible she had thought they looked pretty simple in their traveling clothes but in a place as drab as alturrang the two of them had a hard time being inconspicuous in retrospect she wished they would have had the time to find something shabby to wear kahlan felt they were about as inconspicuous as a pair of painted whores at a country farm fair she climbed the stairs to the place as if she knew where she was going and belonged there inside the hallway was clean it had the smell of freshly scrubbed wood floors with cara close at her heels kahlan moved down to the first door on the right she could see the stairway farther down the hall if this was the correct building this would be the proper door looking both ways kahlan gently rapped on the door no answer came she knocked again a little louder she tried the knob but it was locked after checking the hall again she pulled a knife from her belt and worked it under the molding springing it out until the door popped open she grabbed caras sleeve and pulled the woman in with her inside they both struck a pose prepared to fight there was no one in the room in the light coming in from two windows kahlan saw first that there were two sleeping pallets what she saw next was richards pack kneeling on the floor in the far corner she flipped back the flap and saw his things insidehis war wizards clothes were in the bottom near tears she clutched the pack to her chest it had been over a year since she had seen him for almost half the time she had known him he had been gone from her it seemed she could not endure another moment kahlan heard a sudden noise cara seized the wrist of a young man as he charged in brandishing a knife in one fluid motion she had his arm twisted behind his back kahlan thrust her hand into the air cara no cara made a sour face as she lowered her agiel from the young mans throat his eyes were wide with both fear and indignation thieves youre thieves thats not yours put it back kahlan rushed to the youth motioning for him to keep his voice down is your name kamil or nabbi the young man blinked in surprise he licked his lips as he glanced over his shoulder at the woman towering above him im kamil who are you how do you know my name im a friend gadi told me then youre no friend before he could scream for help cara clamped a hand over his mouth kahlan shushed him gadi murdered a friend of ours after we captured him gadi told me your name when she saw that he was taken aback by the news kahlan signaled for cara to lower her hand gadi killed someone thats right cara said he stole a quick glance over his shoulder what did you do to him to gadi we put him to death kahlan said not revealing the full extent of the deed the young man smiled then you really are friends gadi is a bad person he hurt my friend i hope he suffered it took him a long time to die cara said the young man swallowed when he saw her grin from over his shoulder kahlan gestured and cara released him so who are you two he asked my name is kahlan and this is cara so what are you doing here thats a little complicated but were looking for richard his suspicion returned yeah kahlan smiled he was indeed richards friend she put her hand to the side of his shoulder as she held his gaze im his wife his real wife kamil blinked dumbly but but kahlans voice hardened nicci isnt his wife his eyes brimmed with tears as a grin overcame him i knew it i knew he didnt love her i could never understand how richard could have married her kamil suddenly threw his arms around kahlan hugging her with fierce happiness for richard kahlan laughed softly as she smoothed the young mans hair cara seized his collar and pulled him back but at least did it gently and you kamil asked cara i am mord cara is richards good friend kamil unexpectedly hugged cara then kahlan feared the mordsith might crush his skull but she endured it politely even if she was ill at ease kahlan thought cara might even have started to smile kamil turned back to kahlan but what is richard doing with nicci then kahlan took a deep breath its a long story tell me kahlan appraised his dark eyes for a moment she liked what she saw there still she thought it best to keep it simple nicci is a sorceress she used magic to force richard to go with her magic what magic he pressed without pause kahlan took another breath she could have used her magic to hurt me kill me if richard didnt agree to go with her kamil gazed skyward as he thought it over he finally nodded that makes sense thats the kind of man richard ishe would do anything to save the woman he loved i knew he didnt love nicci and how did you know that kamil gestured at the two pallets he didnt sleep with her i bet he slept with you when you were together kahlan could feel her face flushing at his boldness how do you know that i dont know he scratched his head you just look like you belong with him when you say his name i can see how you care for him kahlan couldnt help but smile through her weariness they had been riding at a breakneck pace for weeks they had lost a few horses along the way and had to acquire others they had gone with little sleep for the last week she had trouble even thinking straight so do you know where richard is now kahlan asked at work im sure he usually comes home about nowunless he has to work at night too kahlan briefly scanned the room what about nicci i dont know she may have gone to buy bread or something its a little funnyshes usually home long before now she almost always has dinner ready for richard kahlans gaze drifted through the darkening room from table to basin to cupboard she would hate to leave only to have him show up a minute after she left kamil thought it was odd that nicci wasnt home that they were both gone was troubling where does he work kahlan asked at the site site what site kamil gestured into the distance out at the emperors new palace theyre building tomorrows the big dedication the new palace is done oh no its years and years from being done its only started really but they are going to dedicate it to the creator now a lot of people have come to alturrang for the ceremony richard is a laborer helping build the palace kamil nodded hes a carver at least he is now he used to work at ishaqs transport company but then he got arrested kahlan seized him by the shirt he was arrested they tortured him kamils eyes turned away from her frantic expression i gave nicci my money so she could get in to see him she and ishaq and victor the blacksmith got him out he was hurt bad when he got better the officials made him take a job carving kamils words spun through her head the ones that floated above all the rest were that richard had recovered he carves statues now kamil nodded again he carves people in stone to decorate the walls of the palace he helps me with my own carvings i can show you out back wonder of wonders richard carving but all the carvings they had seen in the old world were grotesque richard would not like to carve such ugliness obviously he had no choice maybe later kahlan rubbed her fingers across her brow as she considered what to do can you take me there now to the site where richard works yes if youd like but dont you want to wait to see if he comes home first he may be home soon you said he works at night sometimes for the last few months he worked at night a lot hes carving some special statue for them kamils face brightened he told me to go tomorrow to see it with the dedication tomorrow it may be hes still finishing it ive never seen where he works but victor the blacksmith may know we should go see this blacksmith then kamil scratched his head again as his expression turned to disappointment but the blacksmith will be gone for the night is there anyone else out there now there may be a lot of people there crowds go out there to see the placeive gone out there myself and tonight there may be more than usual because of tomorrows ceremony that might be just what they needed they wouldnt look so out of place searching the area for richard if there were crowds out there it would give them an excuse to look around well give him an hour kahlan said if he doesnt return by then then its most likely because hes working if he doesnt come back well have to go out there and look for him what if nicci shows up cara asked kamil waved his hand to dismiss their concern ill go out on the front steps and watch for nicci you two can wait in here where no one will see you ill come warn you if i see nicci coming up the street i can always take you out the back way if i see her returning home kahlan laid a hand over his shoulder and gave it a squeeze that sounds good to me kamil well wait in here kamil hurried out to his guard post kahlan glanced around the tidy room why dont you get some sleep cara said ill stand guard you stood guard last kahlan was exhausted she glanced down at the sleeping pallet closest to richards things then nodded she lay down on his bed the room was getting dark just being where he slept was a comfort being so close but so far she couldnt fall asleep niccis heart sank when she saw that richard wasnt in their room kamil was nowhere to be found she had felt so good out at the site watching all the people come to see richards statue throngs of people had come to see it and had been uplifted some had been angered by it she of all people understood that still nicci could hardly believe the hateful reaction of some people to such beauty some people hated life she understood that too there were those who refused to seewho didnt want to see other people though had a reaction much like hers it had all come clear for her for the first time in her life life made sense richard had tried to tell her but she hadnt listened she had heard the truth before too but othersher mother brother narev the orderhad shouted it down and shamed her out of listening her mother had trained her well and from the first day she had seen brother narev nicci had been a soldier in the orders army when she saw the statue she saw at last the truth she had always refused to see suddenly and clearly standing before her this was the valid vision of life for which she had hungered yet which she had evaded her entire life she understood now why life had seemed so empty so pointless she herself had rendered it so in refusing to think nicci had been a slave to everyone of need she had given her masters their only real weapon against her she had surrendered to their twisted lies by putting the crippling chains of guilt around her own neck for them giving herself freely into slavery to the whims and wishes of others instead of living her life as she should havefor herself she had never asked why it was right for her to be a slave to anothers desires but not evil for them to enslave her she was not contributing to the betterment of mankind but was merely a servant to countless puling little tyrants evil was not one large entity but a ceaseless torrent of small wrongs left unchallenged until they festered into monsters she had lived her whole life on shifting quicksand where reason and the intellect were not to be trusted where only faith was valid and blind faith was sacred she herself had enforced mindless conformity to that empty evil she had helped bring everyone together so they might have one collective neck around which the worst among men in the name of good could put their leash richard had answered their tower of empty lies in one righteously beautiful statement for all to see and had punctuated it with the simple words on the back of the bronze sundial her life was hers to live by right she belonged to no one freedom exists first and foremost in the mind of the rational thinking individualthat was what richards statue had shown her that he had carved it proved it a captive of her and the order his ideals had risen above both nicci realized only now that she had always known her father held this same valueshe had seen it in his eyeseven though he could never rationalize it his values were expressed through the integrity of his work that was why from a young age she had wanted to be an armorer like him it was his vision of life she had always loved and admired but suppressed because of mother and her ilk it was that same look in richards eyes that same value for life held dear that had drawn nicci to him nicci knew now that she had worn black ever since her mothers death in an endless shapeless longing to bury not just her mothers hold over her but more important her mothers evil ideals she was so sorry richard wasnt home she wanted to tell him that he had given her the answer she had sought she could never ask his forgiveness though what she had done to him was beyond forgiveness she saw that now the only thing she could do now was to reverse the wrong she had done as soon as she found him they would leave they would go back to the new world they would find kahlan then nicci would set things right she had to be close to kahlan at least within sight in order to undo the spell then kahlan would be free then richard would be free as much as nicci loved richard she understood now that he should be with kahlan the woman he loved her desire for him gave her no right to do as she had done she had no right to anothers life as they had no right to hers nicci lay down in her bed and wept at the thought of the outrage she had done to them both she was overcome with shame she had been so blind for so long she could not believe how she had thrown her entire life away fighting for evil just because it claimed to be good she truly had been a sister of the dark she at least could work to correct the harm she had caused kahlan could hardly believe the size of the crowd by the light of the moon brightening the thin layer of hazy clouds and by torches here and there throughout the valley it looked like the open area as far as she could see was packed with people the numbers had to be in the hundreds of thousands thunderstruck kamil threw up his arms its the middle of the night ive never seen so many people out here what are they all doing here how would we know cara sniped she was in a foul mood unhappy that they hadnt found richard yet the city had been crowded with people too with the city guards prowling the streets uneasy about all the latenight activity it had been necessary to restrain their eagerness in favor of caution it had taken them hours to get out to the site by way of back streets dark roads and kamils guided tour of alleyways the lad pointed its up there they followed him up a road lined with workshops most closed up and dark a few had men inside still working at benches by the light of lamps or candles kahlan reached under her cloak and curled her fingers around the hilt of her sword when she saw a man running in their direction he saw them and skidded to a halt have you seen it seen what kahlan asked he pointed excitedly down at the palace in the plaza he started running again he called behind as he went i have to go get my wife and sons they have to see it kahlan and cara shared a look in the near darkness kamil ran over to a shop and tugged on a door but it was shut up tight victor isnt here his voice couldnt conceal his disappointment its too late do you know whats down in the plaza kahlan asked him he thought a moment the plaza i know the place but wait thats where richard told me to go the plaza he said to go to the plaza tomorrow lets go down there now and have a look kahlan said kamil waved a hand pointing this is the shortest way down the hill behind the blacksmith shop so jammed was the place with people that it took them over an hour just to make it down the hill and across the expanse of grounds around the palace even though it was the middle of the night more people kept arriving all the time once they reached the palace kahlan discovered that they couldnt get to the plaza there was a huge mob of people stretching back forever along the front wall waiting to go up to the plaza when kahlan cara and kamil tried to go around and get up there to see what was going on it nearly started a riot people had been waiting a long time to reach the plaza and they didnt like having others try to push ahead kahlan saw several men try to get ahead by going around the waiting crowd they were set upon by the mob cara pulled her hand out from under her cloak and casually showed kahlan her agiel kahlan shook her head long odds with jagangs army are one thing but the three of us against a few hundred thousand does not sound good to me really cara asked i thought it roughly even kahlan only smiled even cara knew better than to go against a mob kamil frowned in puzzlement at caras humor when they found the back of the line they melted in it wasnt long before the line behind them grew so large that they could no longer see the back end winding out into the grounds the people all around seemed filled with a strange kind of nervous expectancy a round woman in front bundled up in little more than rags turned a plump grin on them she held out what looked like a loaf of bread would you like some she asked thank you no kahlan said but thats very kind of you to offer ive never made such an offer before the woman giggled seems the right thing to do now doesnt it kahlan had no idea what the woman was talking about but said yes it does throughout the night the line inched along kahlans back ached painfully she even saw cara grimace as she stretched i still think we just ought to draw weapons and get up there cara finally complained kahlan leaned in close what difference does it make where have we to go before morning when morning comes we can go up to the blacksmiths place or to the carving areas over there and hopefully find richard but we can do nothing tonight maybe he will be at his room now you want to run into nicci again you know what shes capable of the next time we may not be so lucky to escape we havent come all this way to battle heri just want to see richard even if richard goes back thereand we dont know that he willwe do know hes got to return here in the morning i suppose cara grouched the sky was taking on a faint reddish glow by the time they made it to the foot of the marble steps they could hear moaning and wailing up ahead kahlan couldnt see the cause but people up on the plaza were weeping freely oddly enough some people could be heard to laugh joyfully a few others cursed as if they had been robbed of their life savings at the point of a knife as they slowly made their way up the steps kahlan and cara tried to stay low behind the people surrounding them so as not to draw attention to themselves the plaza above was lit by dozens of torches their flickering light giving an indication of the vastness of the crowds the smell of the burning pitch mixed sourly with the stale sweat of the packed multitude through a momentary gap between people in front of her kahlan snatched a quick glance ahead she blinked at what she saw but it was gone almost as fast as she saw it screened by the throng the people ahead wept some it sounded with joy kahlan began to make out the polite voices of men asking the crowd to keep moving imploring them to give others a chance the ragtag collection of people steadily advanced up onto the white marble of the plaza like beggars at a coronation the torchlight was finally being replaced by radiant daylight as the sun cleared the horizon golden rays washed the face of the palace the scenes carved in the stone up on the walls were disturbing if they were any different from the others she had seen in the old world it was only in that they were more gruesome more horrifying more desolately hopeless and more plentiful kahlans mind played over the lines of her statue of spirit the idea of richard having to carve such things as she saw up on the walls sickened her she felt a sense of gloom overcoming her this was the order pain suffering death this was what was in store for the new world at the hands of these monsters she couldnt take her eyes from the scenes on the walls from the fate that awaited the people of her homelandthe fate so many blindly embraced then all of a sudden as the people shuffled around and past kahlan beheld the white marble figures rising up before her the sight took her breath in a gasp the rays of dawn lit them as if the sun itself had risen just to caress the lustrous forms in all their glory cara gripped kahlans arm her fingers digging in painfully as she too was taken by the sight the statue of the man and woman seized kahlans imagination with their nobility of spirit she felt tears run down her cheeks and then she was weeping openly like the people around her at the majesty the dignity the beauty of what stood before her it was everything the carvings on the walls all around were not it offered freely everything they denied life it said at the base kahlan had to gasp through her tears to draw breath she clutched at caras arm and cara clutched at hers the two of them holding on to each other for support as the crowd swept them along in a current of shared emotion the man in the statue was not richard but there was much of richard in it the woman was not kahlan but there was enough of her form in it that kahlan felt her face flushing at others seeing it please look and move along so that others may view it too the men at the sides kept calling they werent wearing uniforms they were as tatteredlooking as everyone else they appeared to be ordinary citizens who had just stepped in to help the woman who had offered the bread fell to her knees in wailing arms respectfully lifted her and helped her to move on the woman living in the old world had probably never seen a thing of such beauty as kahlan shuffled around the statue unable to take her eyes from it she reached out to touch it as did everyone else as she was carried past her fingers met the smooth flesh in stone knowing it was also where richards fingers had been she wept all the harder as she moved past kahlan saw then that the curve of the sundial had words on the back your life is yours alone rise up and live it the words were visible on the lips of many who saw them the crowd kept coming up the steps forcing the people around the statue to move on men at the rear guided people between the columns out through the rear of the partially built palace and out of the way so that others could come up to view the statue i wish benjamin could see this cara said her blue eyes brimming with tears kahlan was overcome with a burble of laughter i was going to say i wish richard could see it cara laughed with her as they were swept away by the river of people kamil grabbed kahlans hand she saw him take caras too yeah he said with authority richard carved it where to kahlan asked him where do you think we can find him i guess we should make our way back up to the blacksmiths place hopefully richard will show up there if not maybe victor will know where he is kamils words richard carved it rang joyfully through her mind chapter richard climbed through the high window and dropped to the ground his boots hitting with a thud he could hardly believe he had slept the whole night under a tarp in the back of a wagon he could hardly believe that jori didnt wake him so he could go home when they were close the man probably didnt think it was his job and so he wouldnt do it richard sighed maybe jori hadnt known he was in the back richard brushed himself off he stood outside the transport company building where he used to work when he had first come to alturrang and where he had been locked in all night of course he had been asleep so he didnt know jori had locked him inside richard didnt know where to gohome or to the retreat the sky glowed orange and violet in the bright sunrise he supposed there was no point in going home that would only make him late to work he decided he had better get to work work what work this was the day of the celebration the dedication when brother narev saw the statue richard was not going to have to worry about work anymore he knew that if he ran tried to escape it would only trigger niccis anger and then kahlans life would be forfeit richard had spent over a year with niccias long a time as he had spent with kahlanand nicci repeatedly had made clear his choices kahlans life was always the price in the balance richard had no real choice at least he would get to see victors face when he saw the statue richard smiled at that thought it was the only pleasant prospect the day held the day was most likely to end in the wet dark hole where he had been before he missed a step at that thought he didnt want to go back into that place it was so small richard didnt like being trappedespecially in small places he didnt like either of those concepts together they were terrifying as fearful as the prospect of such a fate was he had carved the statue with conscious intent and with forethought knowing the probability of the eventual price what he had accomplished was worth that price slavery was not life nicci had once promised him that if he died or chose death that would in itself be her answer and she would not harm kahlan now richard could only put his faith in that promise the statue existed that was what mattered life existed people needed to see that so many people in the old world needed to see that life existed and was to be lived for so early in the morning there was an unusual amount of activity on the streets of alturrang now and again squads of heavily armed city guards rushed down the streets there were a lot of people come to the city for the dedication celebration he supposed that was why there were so many people out on the streets the guards paid him no attention he knew they soon would when he arrived at the retreat richard was shocked by what he saw the open miles of grounds were covered with people they crowded in around the palace walls like ants around spilled honey he couldnt even begin to estimate how many people blanketed the surrounding hills it was disorienting to see the panoply of color where before he had seen only brown dirt and green winter rye he had no idea that this many people had wanted to come to the dedication but then he had been working day and night for months how would he hear what people planned richard skirted the worst of the throngs and made his way up the road toward the blacksmiths shop he wanted to get victor and go down with him to the site to see the statue before the order came out to begin the dedication victor would no doubt be eagerly waiting the road was crowded with people they seemed excited happy and expectant it was a far cry from the way most people in the old world usually appeared or behaved maybe a celebration even one such as this was better than the rest of their dreary days a half mile from victors place a wildlooking brother neal leaped into the road and thrust an arm in richards direction there he is grab him guards combing throughout the surrounding crowds drew weapons at neals command as they swept in around him richards first instinct was to fight in an instant he had assessed the enemy and calculated his attack he had only to grab one sword from a clumsy guard and he would have them all in his own mind the grisly deed was already done he had only to bring it to reality the guards came at him in a dead run people scattered out of the way some screaming in fright there was the matter of neal though neal was a wizard but richard could deal with that threat tooneed powered his ability need and anger he certainly had enough anger for the task that part of him that the sword of truth used that rage of dark violence already thundered through him except that nicci had told him that if he used his magic kahlan would die would she know sooner or later she would richard stood submissively still as the guards roughly seized him by his arms to subdue him others snatched his shirt from behind what did it really matter if he resisted it would only hurt kahlan if they executed him nicci would let kahlan live her life but he didnt want to go back into that dark hole neal raced up shaking a finger in richards face what is the meaning of this cypher what did you think you were going to accomplish may i ask what are you talking about brother neal neals face was crimson the statue what you dont like it with all his might neal slammed his fist into richards middle the guards holding him laughed richard had seen it coming and had tightened his muscles but it still drove the wind from him he finally managed to draw his breath neal found that he enjoyed administering punishment and did it again oh youre going to pay for your blasphemy cypher youre going to pay the price this time youll confess to it all before were done but first youll watch your wicked perversion destroyed neal his face twisted with superior selfrighteous indignation gestured to the burly guards lets get him down there and dont be shy about making way through the crowd by midmorning kahlans hopes of the blacksmith showing up had all but vanished im sorry kamil said looking glum as he watched her pace i dont know why victor isnt here i thought he would be i really did kahlan finally halted and gave the worried lad a pat on the shoulder i know you did kamil with the celebration today and with whats going on down there with the statue this is hardly a normal day around here im sure look cara said kahlan saw she was peering down toward the palace guards with spears are moving the crowd off the plaza kahlan squinted off down at the hill your eyes are better than mine i cant tell she cast a frustrated glare at the closed blacksmiths shop but its doing us no good waiting up here lets see if we can make it down there and get a better look kahlan put a restraining hand on caras arm but lets not start a war with this crowd caras mouth twisted in exasperation kahlan turned to the young man kicking a toe at the dirt looking shamed by his failed plan to help them find richard kamil will you do something for me sure what will you wait up here in case richard comes here or even the blacksmith if the blacksmith comes to his shop he might know something kamil stretched his neck and gazed down at the palace well all right if richard does come here i wouldnt want him to miss you what shall i tell him if i see him kahlan smiled that i love him she thought but said instead tell him im here with cara and weve gone down there looking for him if he does show up i dont want to miss him have him wait herewell come back kahlan thought they could make it down to the plaza to have a look but everyone else seemed to have the same idea it took forever just to make it down the hill to the grounds the closer they got the tighter the people were jammed together kahlans progress ground to a halt it was a struggle just to keep contact with cara everyone in the crowd seemed intent on squeezing forward toward the plaza more people crushed in all the time kahlan soon realized that she and cara were trapped in the press of people the conversation on everyones lips was about only one thing the statue it was late in the day by the time nicci had worked herself partway toward the plaza every inch gained had been a struggle she was close enough to see the people up around the statue but she could get no closer try as she might she could not make any more headway just like her everyone else wanted to get closer too they were pressed up against her pinning her arms it was at times a frightening helpless feeling she managed to pull one arm free so she could help herself maintain her balance it came to her that to fall in such circumstances could be fatal if only she had her power her own arrogance had driven her to trading it away what she had gotten in return though was life but it had cost richard and kahlan their freedom nicci couldnt simply withdraw her power from the link in order to have use of her gift again or kahlan would die nicci didnt want her life at the cost of anothersthat was what she had come to understand was true evil nicci had searched for richard she hadnt found him she hadnt been able to find the blacksmith mr cascella or ishaq either as soon as she could find richard she could tell him that she had been wrong and then they could leave alturrang she wanted so much to see his face when she told him she was taking him back to kahlan and that she was going to reverse the spell of all people they were the last who should have to suffer for what nicci had learned the only place left that she could think to look for him was at the statue he might be there try as she might though she couldnt get any closer now she realized that she probably couldnt even extract herself from the crush of hundreds of thousands of people around her there had to be well over a half million people in the huge throng around the palace and then nicci saw brother narev and his disciples appear up on the plaza all in their dark brown robes brother narev in his creased cap the rest with their faces hidden in deeply cowled hoods crowding the rear of the plaza were a few hundred officials of the order who had traveled in to attend the palace dedicationimportant men all if only she had her power she could have killed them where they stood it was then that she caught a fleeting glimpse of richard behind the officials with guards surrounding him the whole central area around the plaza was thick with the surly guards brother narev stepped out to the edge of the plaza all angles under dark robes beneath his creased cap beneath his hooded brow his dark gaze swept the assembly the people were in a noisy emotional state brother narev did not look pleased but then brother narev never looked pleased pleasure he would say was wicked he raised his anus commanding silence when the crowd quieted he began in that terrible grating voice of his a voice that had haunted her from that day in her house when she was little that voice that she had allowed to rule her mind that voice that along with her mothers had done her thinking for her fellow citizens of the order we have a special event planned for you today today we bring you the spectacle of temptation and more his arm glided back toward the statue his long thin fingers opened his voice rumbled with revulsion evil itself the crowd murmured uneasily brother narev smiled the thin slash of his mouth pleating back his hollow cheeks as he grinned like deaths own skull his eyes were as dark as his robes the setting sun was fleeing the scene taking clarity leaving behind the tremors of flickering light from the dozens of torches to cast their flickering orange light across the massive columns towering behind the plaza and the weak light of the moon to wash the faces of the grim officials the air so cloying with the heavy scents of the crowd had turned chill fellow citizens of the order brother narev said in a voice that nicci thought might crack the stone walls today you will see what happens to evil when confronted by the virtue of the order he hooked a skeletal finger signaling behind the heads of the officials guards muscled richard forward nicci cried out but her voice was lost in the clamor of tens of thousands of other voices brother neal swaggered forward then lugging with him a sledgehammer nicci checked to the sides and saw that there were several thousand armed guards at hand more screened the plaza off from the people brother narev had taken no chances neal with a polite smile and a deferential bow handed the sledgehammer to brother narev brother narev lifted the sledgehammer above his head as if it were a sword held high in triumph evil wherever it is found must be destroyed he aimed the weaving head of the sledgehammer toward the statue this is a thing of evil created by an extremist who hates his fellow man to victimize the weak he contributes nothing to the advancement of his fellow man nothing to the succor of his fellow man nothing to the education or support of his fellow man he offers only lewd and profane images to prey on the susceptible and feebleminded among us the crowd was silent in their bewildered disappointment from what nicci could tell as she had walked among them throughout the day they had come to believe that this statue was some new offering by the order to the peoplesome grand thing for them to see at the emperors palace some bright shining hope they were confused and stunned by what they were hearing brother narev lifted the sledgehammer before this criminals corpse is hung from a pole for his crimes against the order he is to see his vile work destroyed to the cheers of virtuous people as the suns last ray fled below the horizon brother narev lifted the heavy sledgehammer high in the flickering light of smoking torches the sledgehammer wobbled momentarily at the apex of its arc before descending in a heavy swing the crowd sent up a collective gasp as the steel head rang out when it struck the male statues leg a few small chips fell away it had done surprisingly little damage in the absolute silence richard laughed derisively at brother narevs impotent swing even from the distance nicci could see brother narevs face turning crimson as richard stood watching and chuckling the crowd murmured hardly able to believe any man would laugh at a brother of the orderat brother narev himself brother narev could hardly believe it the dozens of guards who had their spears leveled at richard could hardly believe it in the tense silence richards laugh echoed off the semicircle of stone walls and soaring columns behind them deaths grin returned brother narev lifted the sledgehammer by the head its weight awkward in his bony hand and held the handle out to richard you will destroy your depraved work yourself the words or you will die on the spot were not spoken but everyone heard them implied richard accepted the handle of the sledgehammer he could have looked no more noble doing so if he had been taking a jewelencrusted sword richards raptor gaze left brother narev and swept out over the crowd as he took several strides toward the steps brother narev lifted a finger signaling the guards to hold their spears by the smirk on the faces of brothers narev and neal they didnt think the crowd would care to hear anything a sinner had to say you are ruled richard said in a voice that rang out over the multitude by mean little men the people gasped as one to speak against a brother was treason most likely and heresy for sure my crime richard asked aloud i have given you something beautiful to see daring to hold the conviction that you have a right to see it if you wish worse i have said that your lives are your own to live a rolling murmur swept out through the multitude richards voice rose in power demanding in its clarity to be heard above the whispering evil is not one large entity but a collection of countless small depravities brought up from the muck by petty men living under the order you have traded the enrichment of vision for a gray fog of mediocritythe fertile inspiration of striving and growth for mindless stagnation and slow decaythe brave new ground of the attempt for the timid quagmire of apathy with gazes riveted and lips still the crowd listened richard gestured out over their heads with his sledgehammer wielded with the effortless grace of a royal sword you have traded freedom not even for a bowl of soup but worse for the spoken empty feelings of others who say that you deserve to have a full bowl of soup provided by someone else happiness joy accomplishment achievement are not finite commodities to be divided up is a childs laughter to be divided up and allotted no simply make more laughter laughter pleased laughter rippled through the crowd brother narevs scowl grew weve heard enough of your extremist rambling destroy your profane statue now richard cocked his head oh the collective assembly of the order and of brothers fears to hear what one insignificant man could say you fear mere words that much brother narev dark eyes stole a quick glance at the crowd as they leaned forward eager to hear his answer we fear no words virtue is on our side and will prevail speak your blasphemy so all may understand why moral people will side against you richard smiled out at the people but he spoke with brutal honesty every persons life is theirs by right an individuals life can and must belong only to himself not to any society or community or he is then but a slave no one can deny another person their right to their life nor seize by force what is produced by someone else because that is stealing their means to sustain their life it is treason against mankind to hold a knife to a mans throat and dictate how he must live his life no society can be more important than the individuals who compose it or else you ascribe supreme importance not to man but to any notion that strikes the fancy of that society at a neverending cost of lives reason and reality are the only means to just laws mindless wishes if given sovereignty become deadly masters surrendering reason to faith in these men sanctions their use of force to enslave youto murder you you have the power to decide how you will live your life these mean little men up here are but cockroaches if you say they are they have no power to control you but that which you grant them richard pointed with the sledgehammer back at the statue this is life your life to live as you choose he swept the head of the sledgehammer in an arc pointing out the carvings up on the walls this is what the order offers you death weve heard enough of your blasphemy brother narev shrieked destroy your evil creation now or die the spears rose richard calmly swept a fearless glance around at the guards then stepped to his statue niccis heart was pounding against her ribs she didnt want it destroyed it was too good to destroy this couldnt be happening they couldnt take this away richard rested the sledgehammer across his shoulder he lifted his other hand up to the statue as he addressed the crowd one last time this is what the order is taking from youyour humanity your individuality your freedom to live your own life richard briefly touched the sledgehammer to his forehead with a mighty swing the steel head arced around nicci could hear the air whistle the entire statue seemed to shudder as the sledgehammer struck the base with a thunderous boom in a moment of brittle silence she heard the faintest sound the ripping popping crackling whisper of the stone itself then the entire statue crashed down in a roar of fragments and billowing white dust the officials at the back of the plaza cheered the guards hooted and hollered as they waved their weapons in the air they were the only ones the crowd was dead silent as dust rolled out across the plaza all their hope embodied in the statue had just been destroyed nicci stared in a daze her throat constricted with the agony of it her eyes watered they all watched as if having just witnessed a tragic pointless death the guards moved toward richard with their spears leveled prodding him back to other guards waiting with heavy shackles down closer to the steps a clear voice rang out from the stunned crowd no well not stand for it in the gathering darkness nicci saw the man who had yelled he was up close to the front furiously trying to fight his way through the press of people to get to the plaza it was the blacksmith mr cascella well not stand for it he roared ill not let you enslave me any longer do you hear im a free man a free man the entire mass of people before the palace erupted in a deafening roar and then as one they lunged forward fists in the air voices raised in cries of rage the mass of humanity avalanched toward the plaza ranks of heavily armed men marched down the steps to meet the advance they vanished beneath the onslaught nicci screamed with all her might trying to get richards attention but her voice was lost in the hurricane chapter richard didnt know what stunned him more to see his statue in rubble or to see the crowd charging up the steps after victor had declared himself a free man the mob rolled without pause over armed guards descending the steps to meet them a number of people fell wounded or killed the bodies were trampled beneath the surge of people those in front couldnt stop if they wanted tothe weight of tens of thousands behind them propelled them onward but they didnt want to stop the roar was deafening the brothers panicked the officials in the rear panicked the few thousand armed guards panicked in that instant the nature of the world transformed from the omnipotent power of the order assembled on the plaza to every man for himself richard wanted brother narev he saw instead armed men rushing in at him richard swung and buried the head of the sledgehammer in the chest of a man who came at him with sword raised high as the man flew past the handle of the sledgehammer sticking from the crater in his chest richard snatched the sword from his fist and then blade in hand he unleashed himself a small group of guards saw fit to protect the brothers richard charged into them cutting with every stroke every slash or thrust took a man down but guards were not what richard was mainly interested in if he was to lose everything he wanted narevs head in the bargain as he fought his way through the chaos of people crushing into the plaza he couldnt find brother narev anywhere victor appeared out of the melee gripping a brother by the hair other men had joined victorand each had a hand on the brother the burly blacksmith wore a scowl that would bend iron the brothers eyes were rolling around as if hed been hit on the head and couldnt gather his senses richard victor called out the men some still grasping the brothers brown robes rushed in around richard they stood in a sweep around him ten or fifteen deep what should we do with him one man asked richard glanced around at all the people he saw men he knew from the site priska was among them and ishaq too why ask me its your revolt he met the eyes of the men with challenge what do you think you should do with him you tell us richard one of the carvers said richard shook his head no you tell me what you intend to do with him but you should know this man is a wizard when he comes around hes going to start killing people this is a matter of life and death and he knows it do you this is about your lives it is for you to decide what to do not me we want you with us this time richard priska called out but if you still wont join us then were having our lives back having this revolt without you thats the way its going to be the men all shook their fists as they yelled their agreement victor hugged the groggy brother to his chest and wrenched his head until his neck broke the limp body slipped to the floor and thats what we intend to do with him victor said richard held out his hand as he smiled always glad to meet a free man they clasped forearms richard looked into victors eyes im richard rahl victor blinked then his belly laugh rolled out with his free hand he clapped richard on the side of his shoulder sure you are we all are you had me going for a second there richard you really did the press of the crowd drove them back to the columns richard reached down and snatched the dead brothers robes pulling the body along with him the mass of towering stone walls and marble columns afforded some protection from the raging river of people the ground shuddered a blast from the inside blew a hole out through the wall the darkness ignited with light stone fragments whistled through the air dozens of bloodied people were thrown back what was that victor called out through the din of screaming yelling and the roar of the explosion ignoring the danger the crowd continued to advance on the men who had enslaved them throngs swarmed over the spot where the statue had stood scooping up shards of marble they kissed their fingers and as they swept past planted those kisses on the words on the back of the fallen bronze ring they were choosing life hordes of people had captured a number of the brothers and officials and were beating them to death with chunks of white marble from the rubble of the statue brother narev is a sorcerer richard said victor you have to organize some of these menget control of this mob narev can use powerful magic i commend peoples desire to be free but were going to have a great many killed and injured if we dont get this under control i understand victor said as he fought to keep from being swept away a number of men who had been crowded around richard protecting him heard what he said and nodded their agreement the commands to organize started to spread through the crowd these people wanted to succeed they were willing to work toward their goal and saw reason in the orders beginning to be called out many of these men were used to handling large groups of workers they knew the business of organizing men richard started pulling off the dead brothers robes you men have to keep these people out of the palace narev is in there anyone who goes in could easily be killed you have to keep people out it will be a death trap in there with the brothers i understand victor said well keep them back men called to richard richard threw the dead brothers brown robes up over his head victor snatched him by the arm what are you doing richard popped his head up through the neck opening im going in there in the darkness narev will think im a brother and ill be able to get close to him he poked his confiscated sword through the robes to hide the blade he covered the hilt with his wrist keep people out narev commands dangerous magic i have to stop him you watch yourself victor said the men who had assumed command began fanning out urging people to follow their orders some people did and as they did yet more followed with all the officials who theyd captured now dead the mob was slowly being brought to task and not a moment too soon the crushing weight of people flooding up onto the plaza was a danger to everyone passing people wept as they picked up pieces of marble from the statue holding the tokens of freedom and beauty to their breast as they moved on to allow others to do the same these were people who had been offered life and had taken it they had proven themselves victor saw what everyone was doing richard im so sorry a fiery blast exploded through the plaza cutting down well over a hundred people bodies were ripped apart in the violence of it a huge stone column toppled crushing people who couldnt get out of the way because of the press of the throng later richard yelled over the pandemonium ive got to stop narev keep these people outtheyll only die in there victor nodded before he rushed off with the other men he knew to try to gain control of the situation richard put the tumult and confusion behind him and stepped through a gaping doorway between the columns into the darkness there were miles of unfinished corridors some clogged with bodies in the first crush as the people swept up onto the plaza they had chased brothers and officials into the labyrinth of the palace many of those people had been unfortunate enough to find brother narev the stench of burned flesh filled richards nostrils as he moved silently through the darkness richard had been a woods guide long before he became the seeker long before he became lord rahl darkness was his element in his mind he gathered that cloak of darkness around himself within the massive stone walls under the heavy beams partial wooden floors and slate roofs overhead the riot of the crowd was a distant echoing rumble through the gaping openings of undressed doorways stood rooms without roofs or floors above allowing in a flood of moonlight it all created a tangled mesh of shadows and faint light that suggested every form of danger richard came across an older woman lying bleeding in the hall whimpering in agony he bent to one knee putting a hand gently to her shoulder as he kept his eyes on the dark hall ahead and its sockets of blackness to each side he could feel the woman trembling beneath his fingers where are you hurt he whispered he pushed the hood of the robe back so that in the moonlight coming between the unfinished beams above she could see his face im richard a smile of recognition overcame her leg she said she pulled her dress up in faint light he saw a dark wound just above the knee with his sword he sliced off the hem of her dress to use as a bandage to close the wound i want to live i wanted to help she took the strip of cloth and pushed his hands away thank you for cutting me the cloth i can do it now she clutched his robe pulling him closer youve showed us life with your statue thank you richard smiled as he squeezed her shoulder i was trying to get that cockroach will you do it richard kissed his finger and pressed the kiss to her forehead i will bandage up your leg and lie still until we have the situation under control then well send people in to help richard started moving again from the distance came screams of rage and pain guards who had escaped into the maze of the unfinished palace were battling people who had gone in after them richard spotted a brother trembling behind a corner it wasnt narevthere was a hood not a cap playing the part of a brother richard pulled his hood up again and strode to the man the brother looked relieved to see a comrade who are you he whispered toward richard lifting his hand to use his magic to light a small flame above his palm justice richard said to the wide eyes as he drove his sword through the mans heart richard pulled his sword free and concealed it once more under his robes nicci would no doubt take her revenge there seemed nothing he could do about it nicci had often enough made richards choices clear he was bound and determined to at least lay waste to the order if only there were a way to get nicci to see reason to get her to help him at times the look in her blue eyes seemed so tantalizingly close to comprehension he knew nicci had feelings for him he wished he could use those feelings to get her to see reason to help him to cast off her chains but he didnt know how richard stepped back into the blackness of a room as he heard guards running his way as they turned into the hallway richard again drew his sword when they were close he burst out of the doorway and took off the first guards head the second swung his sword missed and lifted it for another strike richard ran his sword through the mans belly the wounded guard pulled back off the blade before richard could finish him more men burst into the hall the man with the gut wound wasnt going to be a problem anymore it would take him hours of agony to die richard retreated through the dark doorway tempting men in after him he stood still in the dark and as they rushed in panting crunching debris beneath the balls of their feet as they turned richard located them by sound alone and cut them down half a dozen men died in the pitch black room before the rest ran richard raced onward toward the sounds of explosions every time gouts of flame flashed through the morass of hallways he hid his eyes with a hand in order to preserve his night vision when the blinding flashes ceased he quickly continued in the direction from which they had come there were mile upon mile of halls in the palace some opened out into grounds where nothing had yet been built others went along between walls open overhead still others tunneled through the darkness enclosed by upper floors or roofs richard descended stairs into blackness into the palace underground following the roar of conjured flames down below the main floor were networks of interconnected rooms made up of a confusing snarl of chambers and narrow halls as he plunged through a labyrinth of shadowy rooms going through holes in unfinished walls and empty doorways he came suddenly upon a cloaked man with a sword he knew none of the people were armed the man spun around his sword leading but since richard was disguised in robes he knew the man might not be a true foe in a flash of moonlight richard was stunned to see the sword of truth over the shoulder of the person it was kahlan he froze in shock she saw only a figure in brown robesa brotherstanding in a shaft of moonlight the hood shadowed his face in the same instant before he could call her name he saw over kahlans shoulder someone running their way nicci in one terrible blinding instant richard knew what he had to do it was his only chancekahlans only chanceto be free in that crystal clear instant of understanding terror flashed through him he didnt know if he could do it he had to richard drew his sword and blocked kahlans thrust and then he attacked her he drove into her with controlled violence careful not to hurt her he knew how she fought he knew because he had taught her he played the role of a clumsy but lucky opponent nicci was getting closer richard couldnt drag it out it had to be timed just right he waited until kahlan was slightly off balance and then with a powerful clash caught her sword near the cross guard she cried out with the shock as her sword flew from her hand and the blow spun her around just as he had intended she didnt hesitate for an instant without pause still spinning her hand reached up and pulled free the sword of truth the air rang with the unique sound of steel he knew so well kahlan whirled around the blade leading he saw for a split second the terrible violent rage in her eyes it hurt him to see that in kahlans beautiful eyes he knew what it did to a person richard entered a numb world all his own he knew what he had to do he felt no emotion he blocked high controlling her attack and where he wanted her to go with the blade he had to get her to put it where he intended if there was to be any chance teeth gritted kahlan drove her sword for the opening he deliberately left her kahlan was in the realm of uncontrollable rage the instant she seized the hilt the sword of truth had inundated her with pounding fury nothing in the world felt better than knowing she was going to kill with it the weapon too demanded blood these people had richard these brothers had twisted their lives these men had sent murderers to her homeland these men had sent assassins to slaughter warren now she had one of them she screamed as she spun screamed with the rage screamed with the demand for blood it was glorious to have the object of such perfect rage within reach he made a mistakeleaving an opening without hesitation she went for it with cold fury the blade leading he was hers richard felt the blade hit him it was shocking it felt unlike what he expected it felt something like he imagined the mighty blow of the sledgehammer on the statue might feel his mouth opened now was the time he had to stop herkeep her from doing any more he had to do it now if she wrenched the blade through him ripped him open any more nicci would never be able to heal him her power could only heal so much nicci would have to free kahlan from the spell in order to regain the use of her sorceresss magicin order to heal him he reasoned that she cared enough for him to do that richards mouth was open as he felt the blade still driving through him it was a sickening shock even expecting it as he had it still seemed unreal it still surprised him he needed to tell her it was him to stop he needed at least to call out her name so she would stop without doing too much damage his mouth was still open he had no breath he couldnt make himself say her name as she searched frantically for richard nicci saw the two people battling one was a brother the other she didnt recognize yet there was something deeply unsettling about it all nicci felt a strange stirring the feeling was oddly familiar but in all the confusion of emotion she just didnt recognize it they were a good distance away the man in the cape lost his sword it looked as if the brother had him nicci wanted to helpbut how she had to find richard someone said they saw him go into the palace she had to find him she ran toward the pair the man pulled free another sword strapped over his shoulder the strange feeling welled up in nicci something was terribly wrong but she didnt know what and then she saw the brother make a mistake nicci halted with a cry of lethal fury the man in the cape drove his sword through the brother when the force of the blow drove the brother back a step a shaft of moonlight fell across his face under in the cowl of the hood and then the feeling slammed into her with full recognition niccis eyes went wide she screamed kahlan stop kahlans eyes twitched up in shock she saw his face in the moonlight in that same instant he heard nicci scream kahlan recoiled her hand flying from the hilt of the sword of truth as if she had been struck by lightning she fell back with a horrified shriek richard seized the blade of the sword his sword to keep the weight from twisting it in him she had driven it through him almost up to the cross guard warm blood ran down the blade onto his fingers richard kahlan cried nooo nooo richard felt his knees hit the stone floor he was surprised it didnt hurt more to have a sword through him it was the shock of it mostly that had scrambled his mind it was hard to think he struggled not to fall forward fall on the blade and wrench it through his insides the room seemed to be moving pull it out he whispered he wanted it out as if that would help he wanted the awful thing out he could feel the razor sharp edges all the way through him he could feel it sticking out his back kahlan nearly hysterical scrambled to do as he asked richard saw cara limping up out of the darkness she seized his shoulders as kahlan drew out the blade in one swift panicked yank as if she hoped the action would somehow undo what she had done what happened cara cried what did you do the world seemed to tip and whirl richard could feel the sickeningly wet warmth of his blood soaking down him he could feel his weight against cara kahlan hovered close richard oh dear spirits no this cant be happening it cant panicked tears streamed down her beautiful face he couldnt understand what she was doing here why was she in the old world what was she doing in the emperors palace he couldnt help smiling at seeing her he wondered if she had seen his statue before he destroyed it he wondered if he had made a terrible mistake no it was kahlans only chance at freedom his only chance to break niccis spell nicci was still running toward them help me nicci richard called it came out as little more than a whisper i need you to save me nicci please even if it was no more than a whisper nicci heard his plea nicci had never run so fast terror had her in its fierce grip kahlan had stabbed her sword through him it was a terrible mistake it was all such a terrible mistake nicci had brought such pain to them both it was her fault even in her shock nicci knew with clarity what she must do she could heal him kahlan was there nicci couldnt begin to imagine why or how but she was with kahlan there nicci could break the spell once the spell was broken nicci could use her gift she could heal richard it was all right she could save him it would be all right she could fix it she could she could do something right and helpreally helpfor once she could help them both an arm swept out of the darkness and hooked her by the neck taking her from her feet she cried out as she was yanked into the blackness she could feel the bulge of hard muscles as she clawed at the arm the man stank she could feel his lice ticking against her face as they sprang at her terror seized her such sudden and intense terror was an unfamiliar sensation smothering her mind she dug her heels into the stone as he drew her back into the black labyrinth she kicked furiously at him she tried to draw her dacra from her sleeve but he seized her arm and twisted it behind her back his forearm crushed against her exposed throat choking off her air as he lifted her from her feet nicci couldnt breathe he chortled with glee as he dragged her into the darker recesses of the rooms beneath jagangs palace their eyes met just when she had been abruptly and violently snatched into the darkness richard saw in those eyes something important saw that nicci intended to help him but she was gone cara desperately clutched his shoulders as he lay back against her he was cold she was warm kahlan fell back writhing in the darkness she clawed at her throat he could hear her choking mother confessor mother confessor whats wrong richard reached up and seized cara behind her head he pulled her face close someone has nicci theyre choking her carayou have to go save nicci or kahlan will die and nicci is the only one who can heal me go hurry he felt cara nodding before he released her head i understand was all she said as she gently but swiftly laid him back on the cold stone and then she was gone it was wet he didnt know if it was blood or water they were underground in the nether reaches of the retreat through open beams where the flooring above hadnt been laid moonlight flooded down to light kahlan struggling not far away he could see then as she fought an invisible foe that it was water thats what it was not blood water the palace was next to the river it was wet in the little rooms and halls down in the bottom kahlan he murmured she didnt respond hold on gripping his abdomen holding the wound closed lest his insides burst out he inched his way through the water across the cold stone the pain had finally and firmly arrived he could feel the terrible damage inside he tried to blink away the tears of hot agony he had to hold on icy sweat drenched his face kahlan had to hold on his hand covered in blood reached out to her his fingers found hers she hardly responded but at least her fingers moved he was thankful beyond words that her fingers moved it had been a good plan he was sure it was it would have worked if only someone hadnt snatched nicci would have worked it seemed a stupid way to die really he thought it should be somehow more grand not in a dark cold wet palace underground he wished he could tell kahlan that he loved her and that she hadnt killed him but that he had done it it was his doing not hers hed just used her in his plan it would have worked kahlan he whispered not knowing if in her stillness she could hear him any longer i love you no one else just you im glad we had our time together i wouldnt trade it for anything richard opened his eyes and groaned in agony he wanted it to end it hurt too much now he just wanted it to end it hadnt worked he would have to pay the price but he wanted the sickening ripping terrifying pain to end he didnt know how much time had passed he looked and saw kahlan sprawled on the wet floor she wasnt moving a shadow fell across him well well richard cypher neal chuckled imagine that he chuckled again as he glanced at kahlan whos the woman richard could sense the sword of truth sense its magic it wasnt far from his fingers dont know shes killed me must be one of yours richards fingers found the sword they curled around the wirewound hilt neal stepped on the blade cant have any of that youve caused enough trouble a glow ignited around neals fingers he was conjuring magic lethal magic richard in his barely conscious condition despite his need could not focus his mind could not call forth his own ability to do anything to stop neal at least the pain would end at least kahlan wouldnt think it was she who had killed him richard heard a sudden terrible bonesnapping crack neal dropped heavily to his knees richard his hand already around the hilt pulled the sword from underneath the mans legs and in one mighty lunge ran it through neals heart neal looked up in surprise his eyes glassy richard saw then that the man was as good as dead before the blade had run him through neals eyes rolled back in his head and he slumped to the side as richard yanked the sword free standing behind neal was the woman richard had helped she had bandaged her leg in both hands she held the marble hand of the woman richard had carved she had crushed neals skull with her keepsake of the statue chapter richard heard footfalls splashing toward him down the wet hallway the woman had gone to find help maybe she had found it in the rooms and hallways in the distance richard could hear occasional screams as blasts of magic exploded through the night as people were injured and killed a woman appeared in the moonlight richard richard richard squinted in the darkness who are you he managed to whisper she rushed to his side and fell to her knees she gasped at seeing kahlan sprawled on the floor close to him what happened to the mother confessor richard frowned she knew kahlan who are you she looked back at him im a sister sister alessandra ive been in the city for a while looking for nicci andnever mind a woman found me just down the halland said you were hurt the man who carved the statue i was trying desperately to get to you earlier but i couldnt get nearthere i go again tell me where youre hurt i can try to heal you i was run through with a sword she was still and silent for a moment under my hands she looked then and spoke a prayer under her breath i think i can help i feared i need nicci to do it sister alessandra glanced about nicci where is she then ive been searching for her ann sent me to find her richards eyes fell on the still form of kahlan can you help her he could see the womans eyes look away from his no i cant shes linked by magic to nicci i met her before and she told me about it i can do nothing through the shield of niccis link is she is she still the woman looked and then leaned back over him shes alive richard he closed his eyes in relief and in pain lie still she said but i need nicci to youre bleeding this is bad richard in a short time more you will have lost too much blood if i wait no one will be able to heal you you will have slipped too far beyond this world for any gift to help you i cant wait besides i came to try to stop nicci i know her better than anyone you cant put your life in her hands you cant put your faith in her its not faith i know shes a sister of the dark im the one who led her down that dark road i came to try to lead her back until and unless that time comes you cant trust her now youve not much time do you want to live or not it had all gone for nothing he felt a tear run from the corner of his eye and across his cheek i choose life he said i know she whispered with a smile i saw the statue now move your hands for me i need to have mine there richard let his hands slip to his sides as hers covered his wound he felt helpless he could focus on nothing but the searing pain he felt magic tingle into him following the damage down deep inside him he clenched his teeth as he held in a cry hold on she whispered this is bad it will hurt but then in a while it will be all right i understand he said he gasped sharply do it then the pain of her magic seared into him like whitehot coals thrown on bare flesh he almost cried out but then the pain abruptly ceased richard lay with his eyes closed panting waiting for it to start again he felt her hands slip from him richard opened his eyes and saw that sister alessandras eyes were opened wide for an instant he wondered why and then he saw a foot of steel jutting from her chest her fingers went to her throat as blood gushed from her open mouth a silent scream formed on her lips a bony hand shoved her aside she had been impaled on the sword richard had used to fight kahlan his hand blindly went for the hilt he knew was there but a foot kicked the sword of truth aside deaths own skull grinned down at him you are a troublesome man richard cypher came the grating voice from the darkness above but at last that trouble is ended the tall angular figure in robes and a creased cap towered above him as he lay helpless on the cold wet floor this little rebellion of yours will be crushed i can promise you that much before you die their foolish little tantrum will be brought to an end the people will soon come to their senses your kind appeals only to the extremist fringe most people see their duty to their fellow man your efforts have been for nothing brother narev swept his arm around as if in introduction an appropriate place for you to die dont you think richard these rooms are the future questioning chambers you eluded the chambers once but not this time you will die in one as you should have died in one before i on the other hand will live here a long long time and see the order bring morality to the world down here in these chambers radicals like you will confess their wickedness i just wanted you to know before you are embraced in the keepers cold arms for all eternity brother narevs skeletal hands clawed as he called forth his magic richard saw whitehot light blossom around the high priests hands and expand downward richard squeezed kahlans hand as he watched the white light of death come for him the bloom of light turned a honey color as if the air had thickened the light slumped off to the sides a howl of fury grew in narevs throat his shook his fists in rage you have the gift of a wizard who are you i am your worst nightmare i am a thinking man who cant be deluded by your lies any more than i can be burned by your foul magic brother narev tried to smash his foot down on richards face but richard was able to deflect the blow he seized narevs ankle the man caught his balance and pulled madly to get free the effort of holding on felt as if it ripped the wound through richards insides he tried to hold on but his fingers slipped from the wet leather once free and out of richards reach narev bent and seized the hilt of the sword lodged in the sisters back he tugged but it didnt come completely out he growled in fury his boots slipping on the slimy floor as he yanked on the sword richard knew that once armed narev would be a swift executioner with all his strength richard lunged at the mans legs brother narev toppled back onto the wet floor richard his middle wrenched in torture threw himself atop narevs legs to hold him down bony fingers clawed at richards face trying to gouge his eyes richard turned his head away with fierce effort he clutched at the heavy robes dragging himself up the mans body ignoring the blows to his face as he did so he seized brother narev by the throat brother narevs bony fingers closed savagely around richards throat both men growled with the effort of trying to strangle each other to death richard twisted his head trying to prevent narev from getting a death grip while at the same time trying to get his own thumbs over narevs windpipe so he could choke off his air narev tried to roll to throw richard off richard spread his legs to make it harder for narev to flip him over and held tight as the man twisted and fought he could feel his insides tearing richard had wielded a chisel and hammer for the order for months he was stronger but he was also losing a lot of blood and that strength was fading he squeezed with all his might the fingers at his throat loosened a little the mans eyes bulged as richard finally managed to start to choke the life out of him bony hands thumped at richards shoulders the hands suddenly and fiercely seized richard by his hair narev freed a leg and brought his knee up into richards wound the world went white with pain nicci woke dazed to the sound of a low wicked laugh she knew the voice she knew the smell kadar kardeef she heard a snapping popping hissing sound a torch she realized he whipped it around in front of her face so close she could feel the terrible heat against her flesh burning pitch dripped off falling on her leg nicci screamed in pain as the pitch burned into the flesh of her thigh what goes around comes around kadar said in her ear i dont care what you do to me nicci cried in rage im glad i burned you im glad youve had to beg oh youll be begging too before long you may not think so but youll be surprised what fire makes a person do you will yet know what it was like you will yet beg with all her might nicci struggled against him she could undo the spell if only kahlan were closer so near but so far the fire before her eyes sent terror scorching through her she had only to snip the cord linking her to kahlan she could break the link she didnt have to undo it in order to have her power back nicci could escape then it would cost kahlan her life but nicci would have her power and she could escape the flames but she would have to kill kahlan to do it shall i burn your face first nicci your lovely face or maybe i should start with your legs which shall it be you pick nicci panted as she struggled trying to back away from the heat on her flesh the hissing torch waved in front of her face she knew she deserved such a fate but she was driven to wild panic by the fear of it she didnt want to snip the link to kill kahlan but she didnt want to die this way she didnt want her flesh to burn i say we start at the bottom so we can hear your screams kadar brought the torch down and touched it to the hem of her dress nicci screamed as the black cloth caught flame such fear was a new sensation for her for the first time since she was very small she had something she cared about and didnt want to lose life in a moment of stark terror nicci knew that no matter how much it was to hurt no matter how frightening it was to be she would not take kahlans life richard had given her the answer she had sought she had taken too much already in return for that lesson she could not now violate it even though kahlan linked to nicci was to suffer the same fate would die the same agonizing death nicci would not be the one who inflicted it she would not take kahlans life from her kadar would be bringing their death but nicci would not she would not kill kahlan to save herself kadar kardeef laughed as he watched her dress ignite he held her in a firm grip nicci could not escape just then a dark shape flew at her from midair crashing into them both they tumbled back the air all around filled with fire as nicci rolled it put the flaming dress out in the water the one who had crashed into them was just getting up shaking her head as if to clear it nicci recognized her it was the mordsith cara kadar sat up saw the woman and lunged at her with the torch nicci threw herself at kadar grabbing the torch in both hands as she pushed it into the big mans face the pitch splashed against his mask of rags the cloth on his chest and around his head ignited with a loud whoosh kadar screamed as the flames burned into his already melted flesh nicci had heard that heat to previously burned flesh was worse than the first burning by the sound of his screams it appeared to be true nicci snatched caras hand as the woman was regaining her feet hurry i must get to richard outside the room where kadars shrieks fell to strangled whimpers as the flames suffocated him cara seized nicci by the hair and held her agiel inches from her face give me one reason why i should trust you with lord rahls life nicci gazed into caras eyes because i saw his statue and i understand now how wrong ive been have you ever been wrong cara really wrong can you ever understand what its like to realize youve been unthinkingly serving evil and hurting good people can you understand that richard has shown me there is something to live for nicci found richard lying on his back unconscious or at least close to it his head was pillowed on a marble hand kahlan lay beside him clinging to him weeping as his life bled away nicci was shocked to see the bodies strewn on the floor around them sister alessandra brother neal brother narev she knew by the way richard looked that there was precious little timeif it was not already too late nicci knelt beside kahlan the woman was in abject misery hanging by the last threads of desperate hope over the black brink of despair she had come all this way wanting to be with him willing to suffer any end to do so and here he lay the lifeblood draining out of the one she loved most in life knowing it was by her hand nicci took kahlan by her shoulders and gently pulled her back kahlan looked up in confusion hatred and hope kahlan i need to remove the spell from you if im to help him theres not much time i dont trust you why would you help because i owe it to himto both of you you have brought nothing but suffering and cara took kahlans arm mother confessor you dont have to trust her trust me im telling you that nicci might be able to save him i believe she will do her best please let her do it why should i trust her with his last few minutes of his life please let nicci have the chance lord rahl once gave me kahlan searched caras eyes for a moment then turned to nicci i know what its like to be where he is now ive been there i chose life now he must what do i need to do you and richard have already done enough nicci took kahlans tearstained face in her hands just be still and let me do this the woman was shivering in misery her long hair was matted and dripping wet she was covered in richards blood she could do no more for him and she knew it nicci had to as kahlan gazed into her eyes nicci reignited the connecting cord of magic hoping that she had enough time kahlan went rigid with the shock of pain it caused nicci knew exactly how it felt because she felt the same pain milky light connected both women heart to heart its wavering glow grew to blinding brightness taking the pain to a new level in intensity kahlans mouth opened in a silent cry her green eyes widened with the torment flooding through them bothas the root of magic embedded in every fiber of their two beings vibrated in response to the call of the light nicci placed her hands over her heart in that incandescent shaft of light and began to withdraw her power chapter richard pulled a shuddering breath as he opened his eyes somehow he was lying in a position that didnt hurt he feared to move lest the crushing pain return how could that be hed been run through with a sword the darkness around him was still and quiet in the distance he could hear the sounds of battle raging on the ground beneath him shuddered with some great impact there were people around him bodies lay on the wet floor he realized he was on a board keeping him up out of the water he was covered in a warm cloak he could see the dark hunched shapes of people huddled around in the little room under his fingers lay the hilt of the sword of truth because the storm of magic was calmed he knew the sword was in its scabbard he looked up and through the openings between beams through broken stone and splintered wood and could see the rosy blush of dawn kahlan he whispered three figures in the room sprang up as if stone had suddenly come to life the closest leaned in im here she took up his hand with his other hand he reluctantly probed for his wound he couldnt find it he felt no pain only a lingering ache another figure leaned in lord rahl are you awake what happened oh richard im so sorry im so sorry i stabbed you it was all my fault i should have taken an instant to be sure before i did it im so sorry richard frowned kahlan i let you win silence greeted him richard kahlan finally said you dont have to try to ease my guilt i know its my fault i ran you through with the sword no richard insisted i let you win cara patted his shoulder of course you did lord rahl of course you did no really when the third figure turned to him richards fingers tightened around the hilt of his sword how do you feel nicci asked in that silken voice he knew so well did you remove the link to kahlan nicci raised her hand and made a scissors motion with two fingers gone for good richard let out a breath then i feel fine he tried to sit up but niccis hand restrained him richard i can never ask your forgiveness because i can never return what i stole from you but i want you to know that i now understand how wrong ive been my whole life i have been blind im not making an excuse its just that i want you to know that you have restored my vision in giving me the answer i sought you gave me my life you gave me a reason to want to live and what did you see nicci life you sculpted it so big that even someone who had so blindly served evil as i had done could see it you must no longer prove yourself to me now it is for me and those here you have inspired to prove ourselves to you you and they have already begun or i would not be alive so you are a sister of the light again kahlan asked nicci shook her head no i am nicci my ability as a sorceress is mine it is who i am my ability does not enslave me to others because they want it its my life it does not belong to anyoneexcept maybe to you two you both have shown me the value of life the rationale of freedom if i am to serve beside anyone now it will be beside others who hold dear the same values richard placed his hand over niccis thank you for saving my life for a while there i thought id made a mistake when i let kahlan run me through richard kahlan objected you dont have to try to assuage my guilt by saying that nicci was gazing into his eyes even as she addressed kahlan hes not hes telling you the truth i saw him do it he was forcing me to make a choice to save him so that i would have to break the spell holding you im sorry you had to endure such a thing richard id already made the choicethe moment i saw your statue richard tried to sit up again nicci restrained him again it is going to take time for you to recover fully you are still suffering the lingering effects of the injury just because you are alive that doesnt mean it wont take some time before you are completely recovered you have gone through a formidable ordeal you lost a lot of blood you will need to rebuild your strength you could yet die if you dont go easy all right richard conceded he sat up carefully with kahlans help ill keep your words in mind but i still have to get up there he turned to kahlan by the way what are you doing all the way down here how did you know where i was whats happening to the north in the new world well talk about all that later she said i had to be with you i decided that it was my life and i wanted to be with you you were right about the war in the new world it took me a long time to come to understand that i finally did i came to be with you because that was all that was left for me he looked to cara and you i always wanted to see the world richard smirked as he rose with the help of kahlan and cara both he felt lightheaded but was joyful to trade that for the way he had been before kahlan handed him his sword he slipped the baldric over his head laying the leather across his shoulder and the scabbard at his hip knowing the weapon a little more intimately now he had a new respect for it i cant tell you how happy i am to return it to you kahlan said she smiled sheepishly like this i mean farther down the hall kamil was anxiously waiting in the darkness pierced by only a couple of candles there were a number of people with him richard didnt know any of the people except kamil he put a hand to the grinning young mans shoulder kamil good to see you richard i saw it i saw the statue his smile faded im sorry it was destroyed it was only a piece of stone it was the ideas it represented that were its true beauty people in the dim hallway nodded richard saw then the woman with the wounded leg he smiled at her she returned a kiss on the end of her fingers to his forehead bless you for your bravery in carving that statue she said we are all joyful to know you survived the night richard he thanked them all for their concern the ground shookagain what is that richard asked the walls one of the men said the people are pulling down the walls with those carvings of death on them even as some people were pulling down the walls others were still engaged in pitched battle richard could see in the faint light of dawn the fighting on the distant hillsides it appeared that many people were not happy about the ideas richards statue had represented there were those who feared freedom and preferred the numb existence of not having to think for themselves the palace grounds though were in secure hands the fires of liberty were spreading outward igniting a conflagration of change in the plaza the semicircle of walls and all the columns but one still stood it felt somehow different here this was the place where people had seen the statue and had chosen life they werent destroying this part of the palace richard dragged his boot through the marble dust in the center of the plaza the layer of white dust was all that remained every precious fragment had been saved as a reminder from out on the grounds where several men were gathered victor spotted richard kamil and nicci whom he knew he called out as he and ishaq came running richard victor raced up the steps richard richard had cara under one arm and kamil under the other supporting him he didnt have the strength to shout so he simply waited until the two men were close both panting from their run richard were winning victor said as he pointed at the hills all those officials gone and we the blacksmith went silent as his eyes fell on kahlan ishaq too stared at her then swept his red hat off his head victors mouth labored a moment before words finally worked their way out his hand usually so expressive simply pointed at her as if she could not be real flesh you he said to kahlan you are richards love kahlan smiled how do you know that i saw the statue in the dawn light richard could see her face go red it didnt look exactly like me she protested graciously not the way it looked but the character you have that quality kahlan smiled pleased by his words victor ishaq this is kahlan my wife both men blinked dumbly and looked as one to nicci as you know nicci said i am not a very good person i am a sorceress i used my power to force richard to come here with me richard has shown me along with many other people the nobility of life then youre the one who saved his life victor asked kamil told us you were hurt richard ishaq said and that a sorceress was healing you nicci healed me richard confirmed victor gestured expansivelyat last well i guess that has to count for something saving richard cypher richard rahl richard said victors rolling laugh rumbled up from deep inside right this day we are all richard rahl nicci leaned in it really is richard rahl mr cascella richard rahl kahlan said adding her nod lord rahl cara said in ill humor show the proper respect to the seeker of truth the master of the dharan empire war wizard and the husband to the mother confessor herself cara lifted her hand in graceful regal introduction lord rahl richard shrugged he lifted the gleaming silverwound hilt of his sword showing them the word truth in gold and then let it drop back into its scabbard what a beauty kamil shouted victor and ishaq both blinked again and then dropped to a knee they bowed their heads deeply richard rolled his eyes will you two stop it he shot cara a scowl victor peered up cautiously but we never knew im sorry youre not angry i made fun of you victor its me richard how many times have we eaten your lardo together lardo kahlan asked you know how to make lardo victor victor rose up a grin growing across his face as he peered at her you know of lardo of course the men who used to come to work on the white marble at the confessors palace used to eat lardo they made themselves in big marble tubs i used to sit and eat it with them when i was little they used to say i would grow up to wear the white dress of the mother confessor one day because i ate their lardo and would grow strong from it victor thumped his chest with a big thumb i make lardo in marble tubs too do you let it age for a year kahlan asked you have to let proper lardo age for a year of course a year i make only proper lardo kahlan gave him her most beautiful greeneyed smile i would love to taste it sometime victor draped his massive arm around kahlans shoulders come richards wife i will give you a taste of my lardo cara a dark look on her face put a hand to the blacksmiths chest to stop him she lifted his arm from kahlans shoulders no one but lord rahl touches the mother confessor victor gave cara a quizzical look have you ever had lardo no victor slapped cara on the back as he laughed come then and i will give you lardo too then you will seeanyone who eats lardo with me is my friend for life kahlan took kamils place under one of richards arms victor under the other and they made their way across newly free ground up to the blacksmiths shop to have some lardo chapter verna pulled the candle close she warmed her hands over it a moment then laid the journey book on the table the sounds of the army camp outside her small tent were by now so familiar she almost didnt hear them it was a cold dharan winter night but at least they and all the people they had helped were safely over the mountains verna understood their quiet anxiety it was a new and mysterious place dhara a land once only a source of nightmares at least they were safe for the time being in the distance the wolves long plaintive howls echoed through the frigid mountains off the moonlit snow blanketing the seemingly endless desolate colossal slopes it was the proper phase of the moon even if it was the moon in a new land a strange and unknown land verna had checked for months but there was never a message she didnt really expect one since kahlan had thrown anns twinned journey book in the fire but still it was a journey book an ancient thing of magic and ann was a resourceful woman it didnt hurt to look verna opened the little book with no real hope there on the first page was a message all it said was verna i am waiting if you are there verna drew the stylus from the spine and immediately began writing prelate you have been able to fix the damaged journey book thats wonderful where are you are you well have you found nathan verna waited shortly the reply began to appear verna i am well i was able to restore the journey book with the help of some people strange people but the important part is that it is restored for the most part i am still searching for the prophet i have some good clues on nathans whereabouts and i am looking into them but how are you verna how goes the war warren kahlan is zedd giving you much trouble that man can try the patience of stone have you had word of richard verna stared at words on the page a tear fell near warrens name she picked up the stylus once more and slowly began her reply oh prelate some terrible things have happened i am sorry verna came the reply verna i am here i am going nowhere for the night take all the time you need tell me what happened tell me how you are first i worry so for you verna i love you like a daughter you know i do verna nodded to the book she did know it and i love you too prelate verna began i fear my heart is broken kahlan stood silently beside him in the warm midday breeze as richard looked out over the river at the city beyond the city was peaceful now battle had raged for weeks various factions struggling for power lusting to be the new local incarnation of the order each faction swearing that they had the best interest of the people at heart each promising that they would be compassionate in their rule each pledging that life would be easier under their mandate because they would see to it that everyone of means contributed to the common good after decades of such altruistic tyranny decay and death had been the only product of the business of the common good despite graveyards full of evidence and a people left impoverished these aspirants to power offered only more of the same and yet many still believed them simply because they uttered such good intentions while a great number of brothers and officials had been killed some had escaped some of those who had not fled thought to take advantage of the confusion and establish control thinking they could rein in the hunger for freedom the ideas loosed and put things back to the way they were the free people of alturrang their numbers growing daily eradicated each of these factions as they emerged from under their rocks nicci had been no small aid in the bloody battles she knew the methods of such people where they went to ground and pounced on them like a wolf on vermin the forces lusting to oversee the welfare and betterment of mankind came to greatly fear that which they had in fact created deaths mistress there was no telling yet if freedoms flame now ignited would spread through the old world it was still a very small flame in a vast and dark place but richard knew that such a flame burned brightly to the north matters were not nearly so auspicious with niccis magic withdrawn richard supposed that the dharans would know where he was and send him messages cara was immensely relieved to be able to sense his location again through her bond he had listened quietly as kahlan and cara had told him all the details of the war and how they had sent the people of aydindril on a long and difficult journey to dhara before jagang could march into the city in the spring it would give them heart to know that lord rahl had struck a mighty blow against the old world to know that the mother confessor was with him and that they were well a number of men had requested the job of carrying that invaluable news north soon the dharan empire and the people they were protecting who had fled their homes would know of the victory to the south the messengers would actually be carrying a more precious commodity than that news they would in reality be carrying hope richard had also sent his grandfather the same word richard could hardly believe that warren his friend was gone the terrible anguish he knew would be slow to fade richard had sent one other thing north nicci had told him of brother narevs importance to emperor jagang of their long history together and of their shared vision of the future of mankind in the spring when jagang finally triumphantly rode in to seize the confessors palace waiting for him there before his empty victory would be his mentors head on a pike topped by his creased brown cap nicci had woven a spell around it to preserve it to keep scavengers away rich and wanted to be sure that when jagang finally saw it he would not mistake who it was in the teeming city of alturrang peace had returned along with freedom life had returned people had begun to open new businesses in a matter of weeks there was already a variety of bread available new enterprises were starting every day ishaq was making a fortune hauling goods but already had competitors vying for the business nabbi had gone to work for him ishaq had begged richard to come work for him when he was strong enough richard had only laughed faval the charcoal maker had beseeched ishaq to ask richard to come to visit and have dinner with him and his family faval had bought a cart and his sons now delivered charcoal richard leaned with his forearms on the railing at the edge of the pier and gazed down over the edge to the swirling water below as if trying to divine what the future held the piers out into the river and the walkway atop them along with the plaza were about all that remained of the palace richard had seen to it that the spellforms were removed from the tops of the columns around the grounds and had priska melt them down richard had regained most of his strength kahlan was strong and as beautiful as he remembered her she had changed though her face had grown more mature in the year they had been apart when he gazed at her he hungered for a piece of marble and his chisels so he could carve her face in stone flesh in stone he turned and looked back along the pier toward the plaza with its semicircle of columns behind it the fallen column had been restored the plaza had been renamed liberty square victors idea richard asked if it shouldnt be called liberty circle since it was round and not square victor thought it sounded better as liberty square so richard called it liberty square after all the first man to declare himself free there had been victor kahlan gazed with him back toward the plaza what do you think richard asked her she shook her head looking at best a little uneasy i dont know richard it just seems so strange to see it so big so white you dont like it she quickly put a hand on his arm to dispel the notion no it isnt that its just that its so her uncertain gaze returned down the pierbig the center of the plaza where the statue richard had carved had briefly stood now held a towering marble statue being worked on by a number of stone carvers who used to work at the site carving misery and death kamil was down there learning the craft of stone carving from masters his education started with a broom richard had hired the carvers with the fortune he had made helping the order build its palace he could easily afford it the carvers were glad for such workto exchange value for value the expert carvers were working on scaling up the small statue of spirit which richard had carved for kahlan way back in their mountain home when she needed to witness vitality courage and indomitable spirit it emerged anew in the best white cavatura marble the bronze ring of the sundial had survived intact and was being added to the piece the statue rising in the center would cast its shadow on the curved dial plane the words so many had touched that day would be there for all to see now kahlan had been enthusiastic about the concept but had spent so many months with the carving richard had done that it was disorienting for her to see it on such a massive scale she was eager for the day when the carvers were finished scaling it up and she could have her own statue of spirit back i hope you dont mind sharing it with the world he said kahlan smiled wistfully no not at all everyone loves it he assured her her wonderful lilting laugh drifted out across the warm afternoon air ill just have to get used to you showing people my body and soul together they watched as the carvers working on the flowing robes checked their work with calipers against the statue richard had carved and the reference points from wooden braces used to scale up the work kahlan rubbed his lower back how are you feeling im fine now that youre with me i couldnt feel better kahlan laughed then as long as i dont run you through richards laugh fell in easily with hers you know when we tell our children how their mother ran their father through with a sword its going to look pretty bad for you are we going to have children richard yes we are then ill risk the tale as the warm breeze ruffled her hair he kissed her brow glancing along the line of trees their leaves shimmering in the sunlight richard watched birds cavort above the riverbank sweep into a group and then soar together up over the semicircle of white marble columns standing in the expanse of green grass kahlan leaned contentedly against his shoulder as they watched men filled with pride smiling while they worked on the statue standing before those columns in altur rang there was a new spirit in the former heart of the order beat freedom
