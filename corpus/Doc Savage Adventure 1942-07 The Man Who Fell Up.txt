 chapter the one who fell the word concerned says the dictionary means to be affected disturbed troubled or anxious one of the men was concerned the other man was just grim so grim that his cheek muscles stood out in hard knots in front of his ears making him look like a large gopher with two walnuts in its mouth they stood on a street corner the city was new york there was nothing distinguished about the street except that george washington had once stayed in a house in the next block the street looked as if nothing in the way of upkeep had been done to it since the green building had been built since the days of george washington of course because it was a skyscraper of sorts sixteen stories and a watertank high it still had most of its windows except for the first three floors above the ground three stories was about as high as the brats in the neighborhood could pitch a stone they were not very strong brats in this neighborhood a surprising percentage of them ended up in tuberculosis sanitariums and some of the survivors graduated to the stone walls at dannemora or sing sing one had even gotten as far as the little island in san francisco bay it was neither a healthy nor a wealthy neighborhood the concerned man and the grim man were gazing at the tall green building you will go to your death said the concerned man the concerned man had lean strength and power and range timbre in his voice character in his face muscles on the backs of his hands and in his neck his suit was blue and good and his face was shaved his hair cut there was however something hard and sharp about him not a criminal look just hard and sharp like a gleaming knife that had cut and could cut again and still be polished i cannot help it strand said the grim man there is nothing else to do nothing the grim man was small and compact with the look of a bull pup and his attitude toward the other was somehow that of a welltrained bull pup toward its master master and servant perhaps certainly at least employer and servant there may be some other way rod said strand name it strand could not name it he was silent baffled uncomfortable and worried im going in there rod said strand pulled a deep breath i order you not to he said rod looked at him strangely rod was thinking of something to say and wondering whether he should say it finally he did say it you are not in the army now strand he said strand got very white like a man who had taken a needle through his stomach in a way that would make a man very sick he did not say anything you will be going to your death strand repeated rod swallowed the trouble he had with his swallow showed he was scared as well as grim its the only thing left to do he said shake hands strand he took strands hand and shook it gravely im going in if it is to death that is the way it will have to be and with that rod walked into the green skyscraper walked in to his death as he had been warned death however came to rod bentley in a fashion which was not immediate but which was startling several things happened first but one of these things was more important than the others as is often the case with incidents the important thing was tottingham strands inability to get into the green building he tried he stood there for a few seconds fighting his impulse to save his friend or at least share his friends danger until he lost the battle then he rushed forward to the door through which rod had gone the door was locked strand wrenched savagely at the knob he was incredulous he stepped back scowled he leaped forward and kicked the door open up he bellowed echoes of his kick on the door and his shout came back from inside the building with about the sound a pebble makes when dropped in a large cavern he tried it again strands anxiety became a kind of frenzy sweat stood like hot grease on his forehead he ran back from the door he stood and stared up at the building and the building was like an old green skeleton nothing moved there was no life anywhere the sweat kept coming out on his forehead he started trembling the calves of his legs first then his knees and finally when he tried to wipe the perspiration off his face it was as if his hand were patting against the skin he stood there for minutes then he began running along the side of the building leaping to get at the windows there were boards nailed inside the windows the glass was broken out almost everywhere but the boards were too solid for him to burst inside he ran back in desperation to look again at the building and it was then that he saw the man on the ledge the ledge was high up one floor down from the roof it was not wide probably two or three feet the man there was rod bentley there was no doubt of that he was backing away along the ledge he had gone out on the ledge fleeing from something there were shots then two rapping reports then three more rod bentley slumped down as if hit in order to see better strand wheeled raced back to the opposite side of the street then stopped and stared upward down the street a couple had stepped out of a doorway to stare a man and a wife probably they had heard the shots the woman leveled an arm at the high ledge and began screaming she screamed twice with a quick intake of breath between then she stopped shrieking with her mouth roundly open a cavity of surprise strand became rigid as if all his muscles were tight strings the figure above had fallen off the ledge possibly the term fallen was not applicable because the figure although coming off the ledge was going upward it fell up it fell up and up until it was small in the sky finally a dot eventually nothing that was visible the form that had been on the window ledge became in plain unvarnished fact if evidence of the eyes was to be believedand there was no reason to disbelieve them an upwardfalling object that fell out into space this of course was not easy to believe even if seeing is believing the two people the man and wife who had come out on their doorstep to see what the shooting was about stood there gapjawed for something like five minutes before they thought of anything to say to each other strand had started running and had run out of sight by that time chapter ii in a green fog tottingham strand did a hard job of thinking he walked streets he got in a subway and rode to the end of the line and back again he stood at the stone wall near the soldiers and sailors monument on riverside drive and looked at the placid hudson he stood there for a long time while he stood there strand saw a man snatch a womans purse actually the man eased the purse off the bench where the woman had placed it at her side the fellow zipped open the purse made a scoop at the contents and put them in his pocket then returned the purse to the bench the man arose idly and strolled away from the bench then stopped abruptly near strand and stood looking out over the river the reason for the man halting strand saw was the approach of a bluecoated policeman an impulse hit strand he thought it was a rather silly idea but something impelled him to go through with it strand arose approached the man spoke out of the corner of his mouth savage is after you strand said huh doc savage said strand wondering why he was doing a silly thing like this is on your trail the sneak thief turned completely white except for shades of green around his mouth for a stark minute he said nothing then he vaulted the stone wall dropped a wild fifteen feet or so down the slope on the other side and lit running strand watched him disappear then strand climbed on a downtown bus rode it to the midtown district got off and entered the tallest building he was calling on doc savage the thing he had done on impulse to the sneak thief had decided him he could not have explained exactly why unless it was because there was suddenly no doubt in his mind but that doc savage was a nemesis of evil he did not meet doc savage however he met two other fellows and they were in a fight when he found them or practically one of them was a dapper man with splendid shoulders was smartly dressed and was holding an innocentlooking black cane the other was a wide short man with a coating of hair that resembled rusty shingle nails and a face that was something to stop clocks tottingham strand stepped forward he cleared his throat to get attention i beg your pardon he said could you tell me where i can find doc savage neither monk nor ham paid him any attention the two had been having an argument monk stood glaring at ham ham where do the flies go in the winter search me ham snapped oh i wont bother monk said smugly i was just wondering ham glowered and lifted the black cane gentlemen strand said sharply please may i have a minute monk turned his head he saw the tight glacial expression on strands face and forgot their quarrel you cant see doc monk said it is impossible strand wet his lips it is important very important monk shrugged i cant help that he said you can talk to us who are you strand inquired we help doc monk explained im monk mayfair this guy with the fancy clothes here is ham brooks strand thought for a while the desperation in his mind moved across his face like grim reflections in a mirror i i would like to talk to you then he said monk and ham conducted strand to an elevator they had met in a small office in a lower floor of the building an office which the elevator starter had informed strand was used to interview persons who wished to see doc savage they rode to the eightysixth floor they crossed a corridor opened a plain bronze door which bore the name clark savage jr in small print strand found himself in a reception room furnished with a few comfortable chairs a safe big enough for a bank and an inlaid table that was really an unusual piece he was shown a seat whats got you looking like that monk asked i looking like what asked strand surprised as if the indians were coming strand tried to be nonchalant and lighted a cigarette his first impression of monk and ham had been that they were a pair who had some bolts loose but now he was not so sure they were as direct now as two roosters after a worm ham said what is worrying you what is this trouble you want doc savage to help you out of strand startled said i have not mentioned any trouble sure ham said but you would not be coming in here with that look on your face unless that was it i see strand said you are accustomed to this sort of thing somewhat i see monk who was no diplomat and had never yearned to be one said what you had better see is that we havent got all day to sit around and listen to you stall did you come up here with something to say strand frowned if you wish me to be blunt i will be that he said i want help i want you to get something it is very valuable does this thing asked monk belong to you it certainly does where is it some men have it where are they i can show you where they are said strand what is this thing ill show you what shape is it we can handle it all right once we get our hands on it strand said monk pointed a finger at him friend youd better be more definite than that monk said if you want us to show much interest strand began talking then his voice was deep and smooth his delivery faultless and his words seemed to have power and persuasiveness monk and ham who were skeptical fellows found themselves listening and nodding thoughtfully monk in particular drank it in while ham was a little more slow on the upbeat ham was a persuasive orator himself but he was up against such a master in the person of tottingham strand that it did not occur to him that he was being talked into something strand told them that he had a friend named montgomery and that the friend had left a chest with him strand did not know what the chest contained but it must be of valuable content because montgomery had been very concerned over its safety then as strand explained it strange things had started happening people watching film an attempt to burglarize his house and finally the chest had been stolen it happened an hour ago finished strand and i came straight to you for help ham nodded he was to find out later that he had just listened to as smooth a cloth of lies as anyone had ever woven before his face but he now thought every word that had been told him was the truth he had been taken in ham said really the thing to do is call the police you can tell them the story and they can do more than we can monk telephone the police in alarm strand held up a hand no he said unfortunately my friend montgomery said i must not under any circumstances involve the police with the box ham frowned we want nothing to do with anything crooked he said sharply strand smiled grimly neither do i he said suppose we do it this way you help me i let you look at the contents of the chest whatever they may be if you think the police should be informed we will do so and they can arrest montgomery you would doublecross your friend monk asked that said strand would not be doublecrossing if the man involved me in something criminal in giving me the chest he is no friend and deserves none of the treatment of one that appealed to ham well help you he declared just a minute until we get our equipment together by equipment ham meant some of the gadgets which doc savage had developed the bronze mans inventive genius had turned out numerous unusual unusual was a mild word for some of them devices for use in their profession the gadgets were unorthodox the bulletproof undergarments made of a chainmesh alloy that was not much heavier than a suit of long winter red flannels was an example and probably the most commonplace of the devices they were in the habit of using monk said you know something where flies go in the wintertime ham sneered no no im not kidding monk insisted you know what i think that guy talked us into something he told a very convincing story he sure did monk said strangely ham scowled you mean he sucked me in ridiculous listen i have heard experts put out a line of talk and ive done it myself more than once all right smart boy monk said i bet you we find out and dont say i didnt tell you so strand looked at them anxiously when they came back out of the laboratory with their equipment he asked are you sure you can handle this it is dangerous were as sure we can handle it as we can be said monk without knowing what it is couldnt you get more help not right away monk said why cant we get hold of doc savage strand asked you have not explained that monk and ham saw no reason why they should not tell him the reason doc monk said is at an uptown hospital performing an operation we can stop for him strand suggested we will telephone ahead and they can get someone else to perform the operation ill pay whatever fee savage was to get for the operation so he wont lose anything they cant get anybody else for this operation monk told him bluntly because nobody else is able to do it and you want some advice advice said strand puzzled dont mention money around doc monk advised i mean dont give him the idea you think money can buy any of docs services that seems rather strange advice doc doesnt work for money i dont believe i understand strand said monk said nothing but he wished he hadnt brought up the subject doc savage had as good an idea of the value of money as the next man but doc was fortunate in having a source of wealth which he could tap at will a secret hoard in a lost central american jungle valley a place presided over by descendants of an ancient mayan civilization the source of wealth was a result of one of their earlier adventures it was also a secret doc doesnt do anything in which he is not interested monk said and let it go at that which was not exactly true what monk meant was that doc could not be hired that the bronze man was sole judge of what needed doing and that his payment for the job was that same knowledge that it needed doing monk had heard johnny littlejohn explain it that way once and the explanation had confused monk until he thought about it johnny littlejohn had a habit of expressing his statements in abstruse phrases or of using words so big that no one could understand them thinking of johnny littlejohn led monk to mention a fact there are three more members of docs group he said there is renny renwick the engineer long tom roberts the electrical expert and johnny littlejohn the archaeologist and geologist all three of them are down in washington at a defenseboard meeting so they are not available to help us tottingham strand nodded i wish we had more help he said monks feeling that strand was shystering them grew stronger and stronger their distrust of strand was actually responsible for what happened to them which was embarrassing usually distrust kept them out of trouble this time it got them into it it happened in an involved way first strand took them into an old building on a side street in a squalid part of town he climbed stairs they followed full of caution they clambered out on the roof keep down urged strand in a tense voice he meant keep down behind the brick walls around the roof they did so they got roof tar on their knees got skinned with gravel and collected dust eventually strand indicated an old dilapidated hulk of an office building which was colored green in there he said that green building asked monk surprised strand nodded in there somewhere that is where the thieves took it its a big place monk pointed out suspiciously it seems to be abandoned strand explained i think they may have rented it or maybe they moved in without any authority to do so anyway that is where they went you sure theyre there now that said strand grimly i wouldnt swear to they were there three hours ago they may have left we can move across this roof and get into one of the windows of the green building three hours ago this guy had said his chest had been stolen only an hour ago now he said three hours monk glanced at ham to see if the dapper lawyer had noticed the slip and ham had they exchanged meaning looks strand monk said by the way you said your name was strand didnt you yes tottingham strand all right strand what does this mysterious chest look like it is green strand said youll know it when you see it green and longer than a man but not as wide thicker though he indicated the building tell you what i will crawl inside and make an investigation if the coast is clear i will come back and tip you fellows if it isnt clear use your own judgment he crawled away monk and ham proceeded to make their mistake they did not have to hold a conference over it they just looked at each other and ham said it smells to me as if he was going in there to tip his friends to be ready for us then plans to come back and get us monk was silent they crawled forward after tottingham strand they climbed in the same window through which strand had eased himself then people began shooting at them there was not much shooting two bullets both were purposefully aimed to one side a voice evidently belonging to the one who had caused the bullets said stand still you two monk and ham stood still the voice said thats fine now listen we havent any great wish to drum up business for the undertakers suppose you two wandering willies go away from here and have a forgetting spell monk said ham i never heard that voice before i either ham said precisely when ham became precise in speech it meant he was very angry the voice said did you come with strand monk and ham looked at each other whos strand monk asked the voice laughed grimly humorists eh we saw you with him incidentally we have him with us now monk lifted his arms slowly to the level of his shoulders then he flexed them at the elbows and clasped his hands over his head you dont need to put your hands up the voice said we could shoot you dead before you could do anything monk said nothing he flexed his biceps he made the muscle get very big so that it pressed against a brittle container in his sleeve and broke it when he felt it break he winked at ham and began holding his breath ham also held his breath monk lowered his arms slowly so that the gas he had released could get out of his sleeve and spread through the room the voice said maybe you would feel better if strand told you to go away boys get strand tell him to advise his two pups to go away we dont want any more trouble than the man stopped there was a sound like a sack loosely filled with potatoes being dumped on the floor what the hell said the voice the voice was speaking to them through a crack in the door on the other side of the room gas a voice screamed it was a new voice they let loose some kinda gas some kinda gas might have been one description for it explicitly the stuff was an odorless and colorless anaesthetic of great power and quick effect one which became quite worthless however after it had mingled with atmosphere for from a minute to a minute and a half doc savage and his associates used it as a regular weapon gas gas the man kept bellowing monk moved fast got down went to the right out of range of the door ham also moved dipped a hand into a pocket brought out a small grenade and put it hard against the door it was the type that would explode on contact when the pin was out it made splinters and flame out of the door monk roared he liked to roar when he was fighting he plunged into the debris that the door had become he saw a man picking himself off the floor twenty feet down a corridor the man had been tumbled that distance by the blast but not stunned the fellow ran monk got another grenade heaved it it did not explode either the grenade was defective or monk had not released the firing pin properly at least the quarry got away up a stairs there were two men spread out on the floor and neither of them was tottingham strand there was only the runner the one who had escaped up the stairs monk chased him be careful ham yelled warningly care was something monk never knew in a fight he hit the door someone was trying to hold it on the other side long enough for someone else to fasten a lock monk yanked there was a short struggle of muscles monk could straighten horseshoes with his unaided hands he got the door open got a man by the neck and another man by the arm the stairway was narrow enough to make it a little complicated as they went around and around and over and over in a cloud of dust and profanity monk was entirely happy for twenty or thirty seconds which was as long as the two foes lasted during the fracas ham tried to join in and monk managed to put an accidental foot in hams face and shove the latter incident made the brief fray a luscious success monk got up and knocked dust off his hands wheres some more he asked ham held his aching nose and demanded was that an accident he added a threat if i thought you kicked me on purpose tottingham strand called to them from above get help he shouted there are too many of them and theyve got that green fog coming judging from the sounds strand was either kicked in the throat or slugged with a blackjack monk and ham went up to see they expected to be shot at and to discourage that they tossed up a smoke grenade and two thinwalled containers holding the powerful anaesthetic gas they got their lungs full of good air held their breaths and climbed the stairs silently they could hear footsteps running away climbing higher into the green building they came out on a floor and found another stairway and went up that into a hall like the other two where they paused to consult each other concerning a rather strange phenomena which had come to their attention ham monk said yes do things look kind of green to you monk asked they do ham admitted kind of as if there was a green fog in the air kind of ham said chapter iii another who fell up the remarkable aspects of encountering a green fog held them there for a short time they did not say anything immediately but they gave the thing considerable thought gas monk suggested i dont think so ham said i dont feel anything nevertheless both hastily dug out their gas protection which consisted of a hood apiece made of a material resembling cellophane in its transparency elastic held the hoods snugly around their necks the things had no oxygen attachments but they would be effective for a short time they went up more stairs there was no one nothing but the fog and that was more green it reminded monk of the color of a pond frogs back they came to a metal door it was locked ham touched monks arm and made signs with his fingers this was next to the top floor ham signaled he had kept track monk was nodding agreement when they heard strand scream strands yelling came from above but from outside they ran to the windows threw them up monk always reckless took a chance and thrust his head out and looked up strand was lying across the ledge his head his arms were visible judging from his actions someone was holding his legs he yelled something monk wrenched off his gas hood to listen he was badly in need of air anyway strand shouted get out of the place get help its hopeless hands grasped strands head they struck him one of the hands had a gun strand was hauled back a moment later the gun exploded the gun report had a dull mushy quality as if the muzzle was against the mans body when the blast came a thin stream of red appeared began to trickle off the ledge the greenish fog was so thick that monk did not see the red string until it began to spatter blown by the breeze over the sill of the window from which he leaned they shot him monk said ham said here let me there ill fix them ham had a machine pistol in his hand the little weapon no larger than a heavy army automatic could discharge an enormous number of bullets per second the bullets were very small in caliber and of infinite variety either mercy slugs which would produce unconsciousness or explosive or smoke pellets he leaned out of the window but he did not shoot monk he squalled suddenly look monk thrust his head out of the window blazes he just fell off the ledge ham said monk gaped unbelievingly but hes falling up the figure hard to distinguish in the green fog but nevertheless a figure with strands clothing and with the shape of a man was falling upward and upward until it was becoming lost in the olive haze monk said you sure thats him ham had to clear his throat before he could speak positive they stood there in iced astonishment until the figure was no longer visible in the sky the iron door blocking the stairs that led on up to the higher floor was strong but it came to pieces under one of the small explosive grenades they went up cautiously and found nothing blast this peasoup fog monk complained while they were looking cautiously around i couldnt see a rabbit twenty feet away ten feet away would be more like it ham said their earnest and wary search disclosed no one which was no end baffling wonder where they went monk muttered think they could all have floated off into the sky we didnt watch ham said something violent and skeptical you really think we saw a man float up into the sky all i know is what i saw monk said what would you say it couldnt happen regardless of what we saw all right monk told him but you called my attention to it yourself monk went to the window there was wet redness in which he put his finger see he said blood this is where they shot strand ham pointed at the sky and theres where he went he said dont tell me we arent crazy monk grimaced i hope nothing unexpected or violent happens like a mouse squeaking or something im in the frame of mind to jump fifty feet straight up they prowled around in the green fog monk discovered he had several small cuts on his legs ham found his own legs bore similar wounds they concluded one of the men they had fought downstairs had been using a small penknife that they hadnt noticed suddenly their minds were relieved they found a fire escape thats the way the others got out of here monk exploded in relief while we were busting down the door they just went down the fire escape ham nodded soberly fine he said now you just find the invisible strings that pulled that man up in the sky and we can go home and say we know everything how about the green chest you mean the one strand had stolen from ham went silent green he muttered after a moment green this fog is green kind of significant huh monk suggested i dont know what it is ham snapped lets go downstairs and collect our prisoners they made the descent of stairways without relaxing caution and found that there were no prisoners they had left at least four unconscious men behind them and now there were none collected ham said yeah the guys went down the fire escape picked them up then took to their heels monk agreed you think theres any use of hunting for the green chest if there was a green chest monk said we might as well look for it they looked and did not find it later they stood on the street disgusted the fog is down here too monk pointed out thicker ham agreed it seems to have covered the whole city it is almost as green as grass the little man with the big hat met them on the corner he was standing there wringing his hands gentlemen please he said he put a hand on hams arm excuse me but have you noticed anything strange for the last halfhour strange ham prompted ier green said the little man ham snorted strange is the word for it you mean this fog dont you yes yes said the little man eagerly yes indeed im so glad you see it too i thought i was going slightly off ham looked up at the sky we can understand your feelings he said im so glad said the little man ill run and tell my wife that were all right after all ham said by the way you havent noticed things going up have you up said the little man vacantly never mind ham said pat savage met them at headquarters pat was sitting in the reception room applying adhesive tape to an extremely wellmolded ankle im sure glad to see you she said what is this stuff this green stuff fog monk suggested dont be funny fog is gray all right you can do what i was doing guess what it is monk told her patricia savage had many of the physical characteristics of her cousin doc she had his flakegold eyes and his remarkably bronze hair a little of the tanned bronze of his skin doc has been hurt she said hurt ham yelled where how badly patricia savage operated an exclusive beauty establishment on park avenue and spent her odd moments trying to chisel in on the excitement that usually surrounded doc and his associates pat liked excitement the difficulty was that doc did not appreciate the presence of pat in his organization it was his belief that the work was too dangerous he had never been able to convince pat on the point pull your eyes back in pat suggested he isnt hurt badly two fellows got in a street fight and one of them had a knife one man knocked the knife out of the others hand and it hit doc cut him a little thats all where is he monk demanded anxiously he will be here before long monk relaxed and eyed pats ankle approvingly what happened to your running gear pat finished applying the adhesive tape you know as much about it as i do something skinned my shin a man on the street clumsy oaf ham went out and threw up a window looked out i cant tell about this fog he said it may be thicker in other parts of the city but i cant be sure pat asked what time did you first notice it about an hour ago i imagine it was ham said pat said i only noticed it about half an hour ago probably it took some time to spread to your part of town pat stared at him you mean you know where it started no i dont ham snapped i dont know anything about it except that it is the color of grass and danged mysterious what is wrong with ham pat stared at ham he doesnt look right to me monk chuckled a trifle horribly ham is on edge he saw a man fall up and it upset him up pat frowned you mean up ham whirled on monk and yelled you shouldnt have told that you silly goon nobody will believe us pat became completely blank you mean to stand there in your skin and bones and tell me you saw a man fall up s a fact monk said gloomily how far up did he fall out of sight and no telling how much farther pat contemplated them for a while in silence somebody she said has been dropped on his head chapter iv fainting spell doc savage said pat when did you first notice this greenfog effect fortyfive minutes ago pat said and you monk an hour and fifteen minutes ago about ham said doc that isnt all either he rubbed his jaw sourly a guy came in here with a story about a green chest that had been stolen from him his name was tottingham strand he said you want to hear that story now it ended when he fell up into the sky doc savage studied ham thoughtfully go ahead with the story he said ham went ahead doc savage was as big a man physically as his reputation this was not apparent until one stood close to him so well proportioned was his big body there was nothing in fact about him that looked ordinary his eyes were like pools of flake gold always stirred with tiny winds full of magnetic power a single glance at him did not leave the slightest doubt about his muscular strength and vitality he looked what he was a scientific product literally a product of science because he had been placed in the hands of physical culturists psychologists educators chemists and a raft of other scientists at childhood he never had a normal youth the scientists might have considered they were making it as normal as they could under the circumstances but they were wrong most of the time the strange upbringing of doc savage had been the idea of his father who had had a fixation of bringing up a son who would be a kind of modern knight and sir galahad with test tubes and scientific gadgets for his sword and horse the fixation of the elder savage long since gone beyond was the result of some terrible thing that had happened to him but the son had never learned exactly what it was ham finished his recital he fell up as sure as im sitting here he said i know how it sounds and monk knows how it sounds but we saw what we saw the green fog came up on you shortly after you had your first fight in the building doc asked ham nodded the building was green he said the chest was green strand said the fog is green pat said there seems to be a green tinge to the thing suddenly doc savage startled the others the big bronze man made a small trilling sound an exotic note that seemed to come from everywhere in the room rather than from a definite point it was very low hardly audible pat and the others knew it meant that doc savage was concerned the sound was a small unconscious thing he made in moments of mental stress pat he said suppose you get on the telephone and check with some friend in another part of the city on the fog pat nodded picked up a telephone and dialed a number hello she said is susan there oh she isnt who is this the maid i see by the way is it foggy up there it is green eh thank you tell susan i called will you but tell her it wasnt important pat hung up the green fog is up in westchester where susan glaspell lives that was her maid on the telephone monk grunted said i know a guy down in jersey i think ill call and ask him he got on the telephone but did not succeed in getting his friend he did get a friend of the friend who was at the friends office and who said the fog was there in jersey as green as peas and as thick as soup monk hung up more than passing strange he said then doc fainted six little devils with hammers walked around on doc savages head in dignified circles testing the ringing qualities of his skull when doc finally managed to awaken he grabbed at the devils with both hands but got fistfuls of his hair you all right doc demanded a voice the face that belonged to the voice seemed to belong to monk doc was silent until he had collected enough of himself to sit erect he asked did you fellows see what made me pass out no said monks face and voice how long have i been out two or three minutes doc distinguished a dapper figure that should belong to ham it was hard to see the lawyers features through the thick green haze the fog getting worse doc asked much worse where is pat she went out said a voice that seemed to emanate from ham she went home why we persuaded her this thing might be too dangerous for her doc savage frowned his head seemed unusually thick it was incredible that pat could have been persuaded anything was too dangerous for her what was wrong with pat he asked was she ill or something i dont know ham said do you fellows feel all right our heads seem kind of thick ham confessed your voice sounds different too doc kind of thick the bronze man had been about to remark on the difference in the voices of monk and ham also he nodded can you fellows find that green office building he asked sure monk said but what is the sense of going there to get on the trail of this mystery the bronze man said that seems to be the only point of attack we have all right monk said if you think thats the thing to do he gave his trousers a hitch im going to get some equipment together he walked through a door into a library equipped with thousands of volumes which as indicated by the titles were all of scientific nature he closed the door behind him crossing the impressive library he entered a laboratory of vast proportions he closed that door too then he listened to be sure he was not being followed having satisfied himself with these precautions monk said all right stinky stinky was a long blade of a man who was hidden behind some chemical cases he showed himself the rest of you come out too monk said four other men appeared they were not badly dressed but they did not look like gentlemen who would put things in christmas stockings monk said boys we will have to pull it he insists on going hunting for strand stinky grunted he did not look happy we go through the motions of a fight with you then escape he asked thats right the others looked as unhappy as stinky you sure this will go off all right one demanded if this would fall through and he caught us i dont like to think of what will happen monk moved over and indicated a rope ladder hanging out of the window you go down this youll have plenty of time what more could you want all right the man agreed reluctantly lets start dropping our eggs monk then slapped the man and the man yelled and slapped back none of the blows that followed was hard but all the noise was vigorous doc savage wheeled around in the reception room at the first fight sounds its monk ham yelled hes in trouble doc hit the library door it was locked and it was also of metal stout enough that breaking it down barehanded was out of the question he drew back produced an explosive grenade that door cost plenty ham wailed doc put the grenade against the door it made flame and noise and changed the shape of the door he went through the other door the one into the laboratory was not locked monk was walking erratic circles in the laboratory and holding his head out of the window he croaked you hurt monk not bad one of them knocked the wits out of me for a minute doc savage went to the window the greenish fog was an impenetrable mass so thick that a dozen feet from his face it was like a solid thing he started to swing out on the rope ladder which he found there monk suddenly had hold of his shoulder dont doc monk gasped thats just what theyre figuring on doc hesitated what do you mean i sneaked up on them and heard them talking monk explained the idea of the attack was not to damage me it was to create a diversion to draw all of us and you in particular doc out of the building the bronze man was grimly silent for a moment he made briefly the strange low exotic trilling which was his unconscious mannerism in moments of stress you sure of that he asked positive monk said for some reason they dont want us in the building ham said that sounds silly monk its what they said seems kind of opposite to me ham grumbled lots of times people have tried to get us to stay in here and not stick our noses into things but this time they want us to leave monk said thats why i say stay here doc savage had one leg over the window sill he withdrew it that might be wise he said but five minutes later when they were alone doc and monk in the laboratory doc savage casually took hold of monks necktie and asked what was the purpose of the attack you had faked on yourself monk blank astonishment made creases in monks face for a while gosh doc you didnt get fooled friends of yours were they not doc inquired quietly it was one of the bronze mans strongest characteristics that he did not lift his voice or show excitement even under extraordinary circumstances yeah monk said or not exactly that is just some guys who were willing to make a buck and not ask too many questions honest guys of course he added hastily what were you trying to do monk groaned gosh i hate getting caught like that what was your idea monk gripped the bronze mans arm doc you know i have been with you a long time yes well i thought it entitled me to try to keep you out of danger monk said and what was the nature of this danger monk groaned again with earnestness ham and i saw that man fall up and we saw the beginning of that green fog this green fog because its still with us said the homely man were worried you know we dont get worried easily doc what makes you think i will be safer here monk said evasively i knew that if i gave you the idea there was an enemy who wanted you to leave here the thing you would do would be to stay why would i be safer here look doc we dont know what this is do we nor are we likely to find out sitting here yes but we better know what were doing before we start barging around monk said i tell you doc this thing is so queer it scares me the bronze man made no comment for at least a minute is that the way your mind works he asked finally uhyes doc said get your equipment you mean were going to that green building that guess doc told him is much better than the idea you had the bronze man then closed his eyes doubled his knees slowly until he was down on the floor and fell forward on his side his breathing was regular measured as if he slept chapter v hams neck ham said it has been about ten minutes you fainted again doc where are we now doc asked down in the street outside headquarters ham explained he pointed see theres the street sign can you read it through the green fog doc looked at the sign it was readable although barely so monk said we thought there must be something upstairs that was making you faint maybe being cooped up in the place so we came down here for air doc said drive to that green building but listen monk exploded do you feel able drive to the green building monk said nothing more he put the car in motion and drove slowly keeping close to the curb blatting his horn warningly there was not much traffic and it moved slowly the drivers leaning out of windows and staring monks manner was sullen and when finally he stopped the car he said this isnt my idea he got out of the machine doc im going back and watch headquarters you think that necessary the bronze man inquired i sure do monk walked away was speedily lost in the green void that the world had become ham coughed uncomfortably doc i think he is scared the bronze man was silent something is sure wrong with monk ham insisted he acted queer back there in headquarters you know what could that attack on him have been fake i sort of got the idea it was doc said it was a fake ham slapped his knee then ill bet he was responsible for you fainting you think so ham said meaningly you feel fine as soon as you regain consciousness dont you doesnt that make you think of something our anaesthetic gas you mean thats it the odorless and colorless anaesthetic gas weve been using for a long time ill bet monk used some of that on you on the sly all he would have to do would be to bust a capsule when you werent looking then pretend you were having some kind of queer spells it wouldnt affect him if he held his breath for a minute and he can do that ive seen him hold it a lot longer doc savages metallic features were composed but his voice showed interest that might be a logical explanation i bet its as logical as cats liking milk you have a theory about his motives hes scared ham said hes worried about you he wants to scare you into not having anything to do with this mystery about a man who came to see you about a green chest and who fell up into the sky and a green fog that came doc all monk is trying to do is protect you i believe his heart is in the right place and you think monk just left us because he is scared as much as im ashamed to say it yes the green building was tall and gaunt and empty full of nothing but stillness and the odors of disuse there were the sounds their feet made of course and there was the green fog and the air mixed with the dust their feet churned up the temperature was low and the humidity heavy enough to be depressing ham pointed to tracks in the dust and they climbed stairways slowly stopping often to listen doc said you chased them all the way to the roof ham replied right topfloor ledge was where strand took off from you searched the place after a fashion doc began to hunt casually where do you think strand was seized downstairs first or second floor probably we dont know they might have got him right after he entered the building but whatever they did to him was done on the top floor what suggests that assumption time said ham they didnt have time to do anything to him on the lower floors we didnt give them time they took him to the top floor and did what they did there we will go to the top floor doc said the vest was lying on a roof below doc savage did not find it for half an hour which was long after he had gone over the top floor painstakingly making no comment except to point out that an old gunny sack had been mopped over every foot of floor space to spoil all tracks and had been swabbed over the ledge outside the vest came later after doc had noted a freshly broken window he had asked ham if he or monk had broken it receiving the answer that they had not it was not a whole vest it was half or a little less actually there was only the left side of a vest from the armhole down its two pockets contained four matches a fivecent stamp a broken cigarette a receipt from a florist and a cube of sugar of the paperwrapped type with the paper wrapper bearing the name southern susan but no address or other information ham said southern susan i wonder what that is doc savage was more interested in the receipt from the florist he went to a telephone and talked to the florist he got an address also a name the name was erica amblerhotts ill drive the car ham said damn this uncanny green fog he directed the car uptown then across town in the traffic there was more traffic than there had been but very few of the cars were moving now and then one was traveling slowly but the others were standing still taxicabs trucks passenger cars all motionless but the drivers and passengers were in them just sitting there and staring so that the effect was somewhat weird they stopped finally at a building which had a doorman who was togged up like a civil war admiral miss erica amblerhotts apartment doc savage said the doorman acted as if he had been hit then he made a dash and came back with a gentleman who was wearing an afternoon suit and perspiration who are you demanded this gentleman i am the manager i must insist that you answer me or i assure you that i shall call the police doc savage made his identity known oh oh said the manager i have heard of you what can i do for you miss amblerhotts doc said the manager turned the palms of his hands up sadly we dont know the boy was found dead on her floor she is not in her apartment the door was standing open one of the porters saw her leaving with several men and the impression was that she was a prisoner boy doc savage said the elevator operator he was found dead in the cage on her floor a very hideous thing an ice pick in the back of his skull she is english miss amblerhotts yes indeed very english works for one of these societies to save england i understand i cannot tell you the exact name of the organization did she have a visitor this afternoon the manager nodded yes indeed gentleman description a very good one said the manager our doorman has an excellent memory fortunately he described a gentleman who was not unhandsome and who had some quality about him that was arresting in a strange way he was as fascinating as a razor blade was the way our doorman put it the manager advised our doorman is very good at descriptives ham emitted an exclamation the visitor he said was tottingham strand doc savage went through the girls apartment miss amblehotts was as the manager had said very english particularly her clothes her knottythorn walking stick the severe pictures of herself judging from what written stuff they were able to find she was an energetic but not an important employee of one of the british groups now working in the united states in behalf of england a telephone call to the british group verified this no one at the place could think of any enemies of miss amblerhotts or any suspicious acts committed by her recently or anything else that would lift the lid on the mystery there was a book with a legend in it that said to erica in appreciation of a faith as pure as the perfume of roses and as sure as gravity tot strand poetic fellow ham remarked doc savage continued his search ham seemed to think the hunt had been thorough enough and that further effort was a waste of energy the manager of the apartment house seemed to share the conviction because he excused himself politely and left them alone ham rubbed his jaw thoughtfully remarked monk kind of worries me he said weve been together a long time doc havent we a good while the bronze man admitted and monk has worked on a lot of experiments with you ham continued hes a great chemist monk is i wouldnt admit it to his face but he is good about the best next to you i imagine doc made no comment ham seemed lost in thought for a while i remember a lot of the experiments you and monk worked on you remember your work on that stuff called compound monk the chemical element combination which was so touchy and cranky that it was like monk monk had very little to do with developing that doc said in fact as i recall he took no part in the experiments gosh i thought he did what did you ever do about that compound i think i remember the description you gave of it as being so sensitive to motion radiation that the absorption of such radiation by its atoms leads to the ejection of three electrons or something like that doc made no comment wasnt that what compound monk was ham asked generally speaking what did you ever do with it doc savage seemed not to hear the query do you still have the formula for it ham asked without making an answer doc savage went downstairs with ham following and got in his car and drove four blocks to a deserted road where he pulled to the curb and stopped the machine he switched off the engine he took ham by the throat with both hands you are going to be fortunate if i do not kill you he told ham there was something horrible in his voice which showed that he meant it chapter vi monk vs monk when monk mayfair had left the vicinity of the green building he had proceeded to do some telephoning stinky he said into the telephone it didnt work he is smarter than we supposed he got wise in an agitated voice stinky said i hope not wise enough to know who we are if so i am going to hurriedly see about plane reservations to south america and points beyond i got out of it monk said i told him enough of the truth to satisfy him how much was that oh that i had hired you to fake an attack on me so that he would think somebody wanted him to leave which i told him i figured would make him stay dont sound so skeptical monk said ive got a job for you i dont think im going to like the job said stinky monk explained the details of the plot with great explicitness and the worst fears of stinky seemed fulfilled why dont you just ask me to cut off my head and be done with it stinky demanded you going to follow orders monk demanded grimly sure what else can i do asked stinky but i dont have to like it monk hung up violently and carried a scowl out of the telephone booth the scowl lasted until he was out on the street and in a taxicab he rode uptown to a hotel room where a young man in a tweed suit gave him a wristpopping salute washington waiting with a report sir said the young man get them soon a man in washington was saying the series of conferences ended an hour and a half ago colonel john renwick william harper littlejohn and major thomas j roberts went to their hotel telephoned the new airport for their plane to be refueled went to their rooms and began packing monk snapped wasnt their plane disabled you had orders to do so sorry sir if you would let me finish the man said they received a telephone report that their plane had been damaged they are now on their way to the airport to investigate you sure the damage was thorough very thorough cancel the three reservations you made on the washingtontonew york plane time it so they will be able to pick up the three reservations when they apply for airline tickets to new york i have just done so sir i think the timing was right although i have not yet had a report report at once if they leave on the plane giving the flight number of the ship yes sir monk hung up with a satisfied expression he lighted a cigar and snapped his fingers and ordered a cold long drink he sat at a window with these enjoying the cool flow from the airconditioning vent at his side and smirking out at the city he spoke only once when he said renny johnny and long tom will take that plane and fall right into my hands i will get rid of them without a hitch he had spoken boastingly after that he did nothing but smoke and rattle the ice against the sides of the glass eventually the telephone rang the man in washington said just leaving flight what is the german word for good monk said gut said the man at the other end of the wire thats what it is said monk in every sense of the word he put the telephone down and gave orders with violence and haste the orders got him in a car with five other men in it in very short order they drove to the vicinity of laguardia field but did not enter the airport instead they turned off on an overpass and parked behind a large moving van there were four more men with the van one of you go to the airport ordered monk give us the signal when flight from washington starts to land the man saluted and departed monk climbed into the van and made sure that the interior was lined with railroad rails carefully bolted in place the steel rails seemed to raise some doubt you sure these things will turn a bullet they will stop a bullet from a tank gun a man told him there are not likely to be any tank guns around the airport the truck had an additional piece of ingenious mechanism an extra control position wheel and brakes throttle and clutch and a rod extending to the gear shift all mounted back in the steelprotected body the truck could be driven from that point got the dummy monk asked a man shoved him a stuffed manlike figure fits right behind the wheel in the cab we fixed clips to hold it there monk grinned probably not necessary but it will keep anyone from getting excited over an apparently driverless truck careening through the streets and we cant take a chance of a man sitting out front driving he might get shot they settled down to consume cigarettes look innocent and wait after a time they drove the truck to the big airport trucking yard and waited a big passenger plane swung in over flushing bay leveled out lowered its tail and settled on the runway a man stepped out of the big operations office lighted a firecracker a big one and tossed it out on the gravel where it let loose with a loud report put her in gear monk said the big engine of the armored truck began rumbling the vehicle backed away casually and went toward the steelwire fence it was going rather fast when it hit the fence and it went through the fence with about the same ease that a fist would go through a cobweb it went on and hit the tail of the plane caving it in the men who got out of the armored truck had short automatic rifles steel helmets bulletproof vests gas masks and a mad determination to do a fantastically bold job in a hurry the plane door was open and people were spilling out the pilot leaned out of the control cabin with a blue revolver in his hand and was promptly and thoroughly made dead by a bullet above his left eye get out everybody ordered the man who had shot the pilot renny renwick long tom roberts and johnny littlejohn you three stand to one side a man with big fists he was an enormous man but his fists were still greater came out of the plane headfirst and rushed forward until a gun muzzle practically speared him in the eye he had a long funeralgoing face renny renwick i believe said the man with the gun get in the truck holy cow said the bigfisted renny get in the truck he got in the truck johnny littlejohn was a man of extreme tallness and startling thinness his clothing fitted him like a sack on a fishing pole and a monocle dangled from his lapel by a ribbon he had one remark which was ill be superamalgamated long tom roberts was a man distinguished for nothing in particular as far as appearances went except his mushroomcellar complexion a completely unhealthy aspect he had nothing whatever to say which was typical of him not one of the three men really looked what he was renny renwick was an engineer one of the greatest johnny littlejohn was known to scientists all over the world for his work in archaeology and geology long tom roberts was an electrical expert whose name would be in the books a hundred years hence they were not three men who looked acted or thought alike they had one strong bond wherein all three were associated with doc savage load in said the man who had killed the pilot dont try anything dont waste our time either renny said they sure caught us flatfooted rennys voice was a rumbling like something deep in a cave they climbed in the truck it developed that there were chains and padlocks with which they were to be lashed to the truck floor the truck began moving by now there was a little desultory shooting the dead pilots head had leaked a plume of bright scarlet down the silver metal side of the plane a wet red banner that had spread alarm and conviction that this was no theatrical stunt the truck withdrew from the mangled tail parts of the plane wheeled slowly and left the airport the same way it had come by plunging headlong through the steel wire fence wire strands snapped like fiddle strings the truck sideswiped a roadster took the highway chipping a slab off a concrete post and bending a sign double you fool said the killer you arent driving a tank i cant see too good said the driver if i was out on the front seat behind the other wheel if you were out there you would be dead the other assured him monk took charge again he had been crouched beside the driver watching the road he got up and went back to the prisoners monk kicked renny renwick in the ribs for a long time ive wanted to do that monk said the kick and the remark got a howl of laughter pleased monk kicked renny again renny said through his teeth have you gone crazy monk that got another bellow of mirth from the onlookers grinning widely monk proceeded to boot long tom in the ribs then gave johnny the same treatment ill be superamalgamated said bigfisted johnny distressed he just knows that one word eh stinky said monk long tom said who is your pal stinky monk what is this anyway monk assumed an air of imparting a great confidence things have come up he said that make it necessary to get rid of you three fellows wheres doc and ham long tom demanded monk said doc himself would be surprised to know and that also got a burst of glee long tom scowled whats the matter with you apes what is so funny stinky shouted suddenly hey theres a state police car trailing us they fell suddenly silent and their faces got white two men crawled back to the rear with long rifles fitted with telescopic sights and crouched there for a while one of them cursed his telescopic sight loudly the other fired the one who had cursed released a bullet both of them shot again theyre dropping back said one of the riflemen monk said slow up when we hit the first bridge dump three or four grenades on the bridge they did this then went on they drove for half an hour turning off into a road that was almost nothing and ending finally on a small bluff beside the grayblue corduroy surface of long island sound monk got out and signaled to a cabin cruiser which lay offshore the boat immediately headed in renny long tom and johnny were tossed out of the truck after being unlocked from the chains renny bellowed whatre you trying to do what is this anyhow monk eyed them and said you remember some experiments doc was working on some time back a compound he called the monk mixture or something like that i dont remember renny said long and bony johnny said say i recall something about some such experiments monk looked at johnny as if he were very glad to hear that well go into it later my friend his statement had an ominous tinge the same tone a dentist would use in saying my friend well have to pull all your teeth stinky said good idea to park your revolvers and pistols in the truck and leave them also the two rifles you shot at the state police with taking chances never pays dividends at this point only monk was standing outside the truck with long tom renny and johnny the others were inside the truck getting rid of their weapons this was the situation when a second monk came around the nearest clump of bushes holy cow gasped renny two monks yes said the second monk and very strange it is too the second monk took hold of the first monk in the way a knife would meet butter the second monk being the knife start shutting off their water he yelled at renny long tom and johnny they began taking hold of the first monk as if they meant to denude him of arms and legs get that truck closed yelled renny he sprang to do it himself he got his big hands on the truck doors and forced the ponderous things shut but not before two men had managed to pile through to the ground one of the two who had gotten out it was stinky had a revolver he scrambled and rolled clear sat up and began taking a deliberate aim at the newly arrived monk from the nearby bush came ham with his sword cane he held the blade for throwing the way a spear is thrown let fly and suddenly eighteen inches or so of the blade was protruding from the other side of stinkys arm stinky made strange noises and finally became still on the ground the tip of hams sword cane being coated with a chemical which produced quick unconsciousness monk said to ham its about time you got into action you fashion plate the other man had dropped his gun and was trying to get to his feet and snatch up the weapon at the same time renny made a rush at the fellow and created much the effect of a locomotive hitting a cow then men began to crawl out of the front of the truck with guns and plenty of rage ham said dont you think wed better run it was obviously the thing to do the second monk the genuine one it was by now apparent gave the first and fake monk one last punch it was terrific monk took it off the ground somewhere near his heels he made it whistle it gave the fake monks jaw the shape of a wet pretzel and made teeth fly like gravel the five hit the brush then traveled a few yards changed direction and went down the slope bullets began hunting them glancing off branches and riddling foliage renny rumbled this way they turned again johnny said susurration might be perspicacious they ran for a while im in no mood for those words monk said what did you say ham translated he said a little less noise might be wise monks eyes came out somewhat as a bullet cut a limb from in front of his face hes got something there he gasped he got down on all fours changed his course at right angles and crawled the others followed the same tactics back of them was shooting and shouting running around but not too recklessly in the undergrowth from the beach came angry inquiring yells the men from the boat wanted to know what in the name of little fish was happening as one of them expressed it in a scream monk and the others sat down to see what would happen now renny punched monk in the ribs how come theres two of you search me monk said strange dont you think the deeper i get into this thing monk said the less i get amazed you cant explain it renny asked him im not going to try monk assured him how did you happen to rescue us oh that was as simple as filling off a log monk explained i telephoned washington and found out what plane you had taken and i was the one who telephoned washington ham reminded him well we telephoned and found what plane you were on monk continued pretending not to hear the interruption so we came down to meet you you saw what happened at the airport yes and we saw we couldnt stop it singlehandedly what did you do got around on the other side of the plane during the uproar monk said and laid down on the front bumper or ham laid on the bumper i took the running board on the off side from the driver its a wonder they didnt see you there renny exclaimed long tom was puzzled how come you rushed out to the airport to meet us trouble monk said what kind green fog green chests and men falling up instead of down monk said and if that isnt enough to make you think youre crazy doc has disappeared long tom started to exclaim something shocked about that but ham hissed and grabbed his arm ham pointed with his sword cane which he had recovered from the man he had speared he indicated the beach those fellows from the boat are confused he said theyre rushing up the hill to help their friends does that give anybody an idea the boat long tom said lets try to take it we might collect a prisoner and make him talk later supermalagorgeous johnny agreed five minutes later renny clubbed down a man with a big fist and he fell in the mud a few feet from the bow of the cabin cruiser which had been gently beached they gathered up the man threw him on the deck of the cruiser and climbed aboard themselves after shoving the boat off renny dashed below and started the engine that boomed the bigfisted engineer was what you would call almost too easy the cruiserit was about fortytwo feet long with a twohundredhorsepower enginechurned backward in a quarter circle then dug its stern down and surged forward it took a bone in its teeth and traveled a few bullets began coming from shore and there was a rush to get below and behind the engine the cabin cruiser was essentially a lightly constructed yacht and offered only slightly more obstruction to a bullet from an army rifle than a tomato can monk and the others hauled the prisoner below with them as if he were precious monk admired the captive nice and plump he remarked looks like he might be a talkative fellow i hope so ham muttered so do i monk said i think i begin to put this mystery together theres a fake monk and a fake ham the two fakes are part of a scheme of some kind there is a trap i believe doc may have fallen into it im even beginning to suspect that green fog what do you suspect about the green fog ham demanded i dont know for sure monk said im going to make this fellow tell about that suppose he doesnt know anything that said monk isnt likely what makes you so sure intelligent face a guy like that would be sure to know what everything was about while monk was thinking of something that would fit to query the captive the bow came off the boat it was a case at last of dynamite or a bomb of some kind or a box of hand grenades the doc savage aids never did decide exactly what but a rifle bullet from shore probably hit something and started the blast the air inside the boat seemed suddenly to turn to water and smoke chapter vii plot labyrinth doc savage had given up choking ham and had belted the man senseless with his fist then doc had seized the wheel of the car and had driven away rapidly with the horn blowing a steady moan he traveled in that fashion until he reached the nearest police precinct station two blocks away where he crashed the car over the sidewalk and against the precinct steps he got a sudden flow of cops out of the place which was what he wanted grab anyone who looks as if he might be following me he called loudly particularly in a car one of the officers recognized the bronze man and relayed the order there was some running two shots finally the police returned doc had remained in his car by now almost blinded by the green fog there was someone following me he asked i dont understand this darned thing one of the officers said was there following you the policeman exploded they were all around you in cars in big machines marked with red signs the policeman explained the signs read danger they also read beware the car carrying dangerous high explosive the officer came closer what is this anyway doc savage was silent for a moment he asked did the signs on the cars also warn all traffic to stop or go slowly while the car they were escorting passed sure the cop said you were supposed to be the car carrying the explosive is there any in there doc savage was silent again then he said that explains how they made the traffic go slowly it sure went slow said the cop reports of this cavalcade have been coming in as it crossed town it went to that old green building downtown then went up to the apartmenthouse district that right and traffic stopped all the way the policeman approached thats right why hello lieutenant evers doc said evers dropped his jaw great grief did you just recognize me you just came close enough for me to see you lieutenant evers was concerned something happened to your eyes he looked into the car what have you got there that is your aid ham brooks isnt it an excellent imitation only the bronze man said he did not elaborate on the remark although evers was puzzled lieutenant will you drive me to my headquarters why sure said lieutenant evers he moved in behind the wheel as doc savage climbed into the back fast or slow he asked fast doc said grimly he had not mentioned the green fog ill have a squad car pace us the officer said the pacing was somewhat but not much under seventy miles an hour they took the long wide sweep of eighth avenue then turned left and stopped at the stone skyscraper which housed the bronze mans establishment lieutenant evers pointed at ham you need any help getting him upstairs doc shook his head slightly no thanks evers but you might tell me something sure anything you want to know do you see anything that looks like a green fog evers swung slowly staring everywhere no no green fog he said thats a strange question pat savage ran across the eightysixthfloor reception room to greet doc doc youre safe she gasped then she saw the man doc was carrying ham what has happened to him doc carried his burden into the laboratory placed the man on a table he asked you remember that knife scar on hams back pat nodded doc then stripped open the mans shirt and exhibited an expanse of unmarred skin there was no scar it isnt ham pat exclaimed no doc savage said grimly it is a very good imitation though pat said doc those fainting spells we had they did something to us gas or something doc nodded something of the kind they knocked all of us out then took me away he eyed pat did they harm you or monk or ham no pat shook her head we just woke up and you were gone that was when they sprang the trap doc said puzzled pat said how do you mean seized me the bronze man explained and took me away they had a fake monk and ham all ready for me i think at least here is the fake ham the bronze man frowned they were unbelievably clever about it they had an escort of cars marked with signs that kept everyone away from my car that was so i would think the green fog was all over the city and that no one was out driving the signs caused motorists to pull over to the curb and stop the signs labeled me as carrying dangerous explosives doc began strapping the false ham to a table that was narrow enough for the purpose where are monk and ham he asked color went out of pats face in a quick rush they went to the airport to meet renny johnny and long tom she said she waited and when doc savage made no comment she asked havent you heard what happened at the airport doc straightened suddenly what a big truck and a bunch of heavily armed men smashed into the plane carrying renny long tom and johnny pat said the pilot of the plane was shot dead when he resisted renny long tom and johnny were seized and carried off in the truck monk and ham not a word from them since pat said doc was silent a moment will you check the telephone he said pat reached for the instrument outside i mean doc said go to the drugstore in the lobby or the restaurant and telephone me here pat nodded and left several minutes later she returned with a surprised expression telephone operator told me the telephone was out of order she said remember when you called your friend susan glaspell to ask if the green fog was present in westchester county he asked yes of course i recall pat said i got susans maid notice any resemblance between this telephone operators voice you just heard find that of susan glaspells maid pat nibbled a lower lip and a frown began crowding her eyebrows together come to think of it the voices were very much alike suddenly pat sprang to the telephone dialed a number at random and said give me mr jonathan doe she listened to a voice put the instrument down and stamped a foot i was assured mr doe was out of the building she said that was my own telephone number i dialed and there is certainly no doe working for me without comment doc returned to work on the fake ham pat snapped i get it theyve got our telephone line tapped with a girl riding it and telling us that the people we want to talk to arent there whats the idea of that a trick but why theyre pulling a fast one on us for some reason but why the green fog i dont said pat get it there is no green fog pat jumped wait a minute they say seeing is believing i see a fog when doc did not answer she demanded dont you see one he nodded slightly but it does not exist he said the man who had masqueraded as ham was wearing a womans tight oldfashioned corset to give himself the rather waspish midriff which was hams proud possession a chemical test showed that his hair was dyed that his skin was shaded that he wore a metal arrangement inside his nostrils to shape them doc glanced at the labels in his clothes the name was the same tailor which ham patronized pat had been thinking about the fog doesnt exist she said but i see it doc said step into the chemical storeroom will you and get no thats the truth serum isnt it pat remarked she went to the cubicle where they stored the chemicals the storeroom was a cubicle only in relation to the general size of the rest of the laboratory actually the place was larger than most living rooms the fake ham opened his eyes he had been hit very hard the man did not say anything doc said you did a commendable job of acting the man wet his lips his first effort to speak was a croaking noise which embarrassed him thank you he managed to say it should have been good i have studied day and night for the part for over a month it was very good doc agreed the man expanded naturally as i say it was not bad matter of fact i memorized everything about ham brooks which ten detectives were able to unearth you should hear me spout legal terminology i bet i could pass a bar examination no doubt kept you fooled didnt i said the man proudly for about thirty seconds you mean the mans eyes popped you got wise to us right away almost i dont believe it hell we thought of everything every possible means of making you think we were monk and ham and that there was a green fog we used them all we didnt overlook anything doc savage said you recall when you told me pat was not there because she had gone home yes what was wrong with that you said she had gone because you had persuaded her there might be danger for her yes that said doc was an impossibility no one could persuade pat anything was too dangerous pat had come back in time to hear the last thank you kindly she said cheerfully you should know doc youve tried often enough the bronze man slapped the fake ham on the chest not hard but with enough force to remove some air he said what we want out of you is conversation the mans eyes became stony hell of a bit youll get he said doc savage contemplated the man for a while said abruptly we will not waste time with you he picked up a hypo needle and used it and the man barked once more in anger than pain then doc stepped back watch him he sold pat the stuff will take about fifteen minutes to work whats that junk you gimme snarled the man pat said ominously you wont care the chemical the bronze man had used was a type of truth serum which he had developed after considerable research it was violent in its effect on the victim so dangerous that doc rarely used it except in extreme emergencies the bronze man proceeded to change clothes apply a light coloring to his face put dark optical caps over his eyeballs to change the distinct coloration of his eyes and pull on a coat with a builtin back deformity he whitened his hair and took a cane he made a tour of the neighborhood moving casually stooping to conceal his extraordinary height and wearing gloves he did not have to pretend to be nearsighted he was unable to see more than twenty or thirty feet because of the greenish haze in his eyes the fog he studied the taxicabs at the stand on the corner taxicab drivers in the city frequent the same stands day after day there was only one strange cab in the line doc approached the machine opened the rear door sorry mister the driver said sharply this cab is engaged doc got into the cab never mind that he said when do they move in on savage the driver jumped turned his head stared what you talking about brother doc said didnt you turn in the word savage had come back here the man seemed to consider the point elmer send you what makes you think anybody sent me the man was suspicious brother you better identify yourself doc put an angry note in his voice you better not waste my time fellow the man who was playing the part of ham is in serious trouble not that anybody gives a hoot about him but savage may have ways of making him talk oh the driver settled back in his seat so its that way the boys are meeting down the street that side street on the left didnt they tell you no whats the plan straight raid they will go into savages garage in the basement and take the private elevator how will they manage that doc was genuinely surprised existence of the basement garage was supposed to be more or less of a secret and certainly no one could gain admission who did not understand the operation of a number of secret devices the mechanic who worked on the place will lead the way said the taxicab driver doc made no immediate comment a mechanic had made some repairs on the private elevator recently the fellow had been highly recommended but someone evidently had made a mistake the bronze man got out of the cab keep your eyes open he said he took the fast elevator to the eightysixth floor swung into the laboratory picked up a knife and slashed the lines with which he had secured the fake ham to the table come on he told pat they are on the verge of raiding the place pat said why cant we stay and fight the bronze man shook his head slightly he carried the false ham to the elevator went down a dozen floors and stopped at the private apartment which he had maintained in the place for some time pat was surprised i didnt know you had this apartment keep him here doc put the fake ham on a bed the man was going under the effects of the truth serum acting as if he was completely drunk if he begins to have spasmodic attacks break some of these vials under his nostrils he gave pat several thinwalled gauzewrapped vials of the type sometimes used for smelling salts where you going pat asked concerned the bronze man seemed not to hear the question he went to the door if i should be delayed he said you proceed with questioning the man pat nodded pry out of him what this green fog is what is in the green chest and what made men fall up that the idea we want the reason for this mystery sure ill get it doc went to the elevator and dropped down to the garage for convenience he kept a store of gadgets in the garage he selected a pair of large hand grenades and took a position near the elevator he watched the relays and motors which controlled the big outer door that the foe might gain admission through the garage was surprising they would have to operate a radio control and the device had a combination which was changed regularly it functioned after the fashion of relay office calls on telegraph lines for instance this week only a combination of dotdotdashdotdashdashspacedotdot would make the device function next week the combination would be changed if they got in they would be ingenious they were ingenious enough for suddenly relays clicked and motors whined and the big door moved up men started to come in a dozen of them at the least doc tossed the grenade so that it hopped across the floor and blew up in their faces the blast was not close enough to kill anyone but it brushed them back out of the opening as if a great hand had slapped them the second grenade was a combination of tear gas and smoke and he threw that one directly in their midst they broke and ran doc wheeled raced up a stairway pounded across the lobby floor and dived out on the sidewalk with great commotion and haste still wearing his makeshift disguise he piled into the taxicab run by the driver to whom he had talked it went wrong he said excitedly clear out of here quick the driver was not excitable they put out orders to get back to the meeting place in case this went wrong he said doc settled back on the seat the meeting place eh by all means chapter viii fear is a goatherd the taxi driver took him forty miles out on long island and turned left on a deserted road and stopped the man pointed up there on the hill doc savage surveyed the place in the increasing darkness of early evening it was not yet night red color mixed with gold splashed over the foliage as the sun rode just out of sight below the horizon a single spike of sunlight came through a split cleft in the trees and made a long thing like a steel broadsword blade across the deepblue surface of long island sound deserted spot doc said what do you want the middle of a sidewalk the driver started his car again pulled over to a wall of brush worked his way through it and there was suddenly a ramshackle shed with two other cars and a truck the truck was a huge thing marked by bullets since it was undoubtedly the truck which had seized renny long tom and johnny at the airport doc savage made his small trilling noise briefly and unconsciously whats that noise the driver grunted doc silenced himself he never knew that he was making the sound until he made it it was something that when the circumstances were right was as natural as breathing the wind probably doc said there aint no wind to speak of a man came out of the shadows with a rifle what went wrong i guess plenty said the taxi driver the attack on savages place to rescue that guy who was playing ham brooks blew up like a skyrocket the man looked into the back seat whos your pal one of the boys which one i dunno the taxi driver turned around whats your name he asked doc the other sniffed and said mean to tell me you never even asked who he was hell why not just pick up anybody and bring him out here the taxi driver did not like that he and the man seemed to have quarreled before the driver got out he knows all the answers he said indicating doc then he reached for the others collar pal ive told you before about getting tough with me i dont take it see doc savage alighted from the cab doing his best to look as if he was interested in nothing but the fight that was about to develop the man with the rifle hastily backed away from the taxi driver now wait a minute freddy he said this aint no time to get each other skinned up it looks like a good time to me said the taxi driver freddy nix nix you sap weve got trouble here of our own freddy scowled whatcha mean we got all five of doc savages aids cornered the man explained and its a hell of a job grabbing them freddy was incredulous all five i thought only three were coming in on the plane the man shrugged monk and ham the genuine ones showed up took their three friends away from us got on our boat we had a box of hand grenades in the boat stinkys brother put a bullet in them and the boat sank what became of savages men they got on a pile of rocks that is exposed at low tide theres cover for them theyre holding us off if you cant get them off the rocks freddy said why not get the blazes out of here and leave them suppose a coastguard boat shows up well get em the man laughed grimly the tide is coming in and fast there was automobile noise that approached from the direction of the highway freddy said that will be the rest of the men who were going to raid doc savages place the other man scowled at doc who is this bird i still want to know doc said quietly i can prove that he walked over to the man and held out a sheet of paper that was blank although this was not important and when the man started to look at it he hit the fellow neatly on the jaw freddy was somewhat more difficult he was quick he went back like a skater twisted with serpentine speed lifting his hands as if he was surrendering but coming out with a short blunt black pistol that had been under his tightly fitting uniform cap doc got his hands on the gun and they went to the ground fighting to see whether the safety of the automatic would be on or off off it was freddy croaked dont hit me just as doc savage hit him on the jaw freddy was evidently thinking of a set of false teeth parts of which flew out of his mouth he rolled over on his side spat out the rest of the teeth and was silent motionless doc left the shed he heard four quick shots from toward the sea he made for the sound the rock pile in the sea seemed to consist of four large boulders and enough smaller ones to make a rampart the tide had come in until no more than two feet of the stone bulwarks projected and waves were breaking over this a long lean and fastlooking boat cruised slowly across the blade of sunlight that was fading from the water the craft was painted as a pleasure vessel but it was larger and slimmer seemed charged with power doc savage studied the vessel decided it was no pleasure craft at all the boat nosed slowly toward the cluster of rocks there was a report not loud then an enormously louder blast and a geyser of water ahead of the craft that would be one of the supermachine pistols the compact little weapons which monk and ham no doubt had brought with them an explosive pellet the boat was keeping out of range for it now sheered off doc savage studied the scene as best he could handicapped by the greenish haze in his eyes the powerful prisms of the monocular which he carried was a help even with its strong magnification he was not positive of the situation he moved downward through the brush attracted by a man who was standing in view of the boat but out of sight of the rocks the man had two shirts tied to sticks doc came close to the man with the wigwag equipment all right all right the man called impatiently to someone on the boat they want to know what to do what shall i tell them a voice cursed the gathering night give us an hour and the tide will drown them out we wont have an hour the other swore again tell them to wait hold that torpedo doc savage moved away hastily and used his strong monocular on the long slim boat again he saw now what had made the craft look queer a rather bulky buildup on the forward deck giving that part of a boat a homemade appearance that did not fit the rest of the craft there was a housing that covered a pair of torpedo tubes he suddenly decided a socalled mosquito boat not american either he decided he went back to the flagman cautiously skirted the fellow and found that the man who had been giving the orders had gone away for the moment doc took a long chance he imitated the voice of the man who had been giving orders to the flagman and said tell them to lay a smoke screen around that rock the flagman jumped are you crazy he scowled toward the bush where doc was concealed whats the matter with your voice under other conditions doc would have been embarrassed he had studied voice imitation under a master usually he was more successful he said sharply signal them you fool the smoke screen the flagman jumped at the tone saluted he began an expert waggling with the sticks to which the shirts were tied tell them doc ordered to lay the smoke screen then stand by on the other side they are to capture anyone they see but there is to be no shooting right sir said the flagman be sure they wait on the other side of the smoke screen right sir doc worked down to a point where close inshore the water was deep he watched the long torpedo boat lift its nose and charge around the rock at a respectful distance trailing a great worm of smoke that flattened the fact that they had smokescreen equipment aboard checked his conviction that the craft was a naval one the breeze drifted the smoke toward shore as soon as it reached the beach doc scrambled down and entered the water behind him there was suddenly profane excitement the flagman was assuring someone he had done nothing but follow orders doc swam strongly he would not have much time as fully equipped as they were they would have radio apparatus the boat waiting on the other side of the smoke could not see the wigwag signals but a single radio contact could tip them off that something was wrong nearing the rocks doc called monk monks small voice squawked astonishment and renny rumbled holy cow doc reached the stony refuge waves were breaking over his men he demanded all of you safe i wouldnt call it safe long tom said dryly were all here though doc said wait five minutes then swim out of the smoke he pointed head in that direction their boat is out there we heard the motors your job doc said is to divert their attention while i climb aboard by the stern all right long tom said but this wont be easy those guys have a regular navy here i never saw such efficiency doc asked is there a loose rock around here about the size of a mans head plenty of them the bronze man put on one of the transparent hoods of cellophanelike material which pulled over his head was held tightly about his neck with elastic inside this clamped between his teeth he placed a compact breathpurifier of the artificiallung type it was not of course as efficient but it would keep him supplied with oxygen for possibly ten minutes he got his bearings took the rock and went under locating the boat was more a matter of patience than superhuman ability the water was not deep he merely spotted the dark hulk of the craft outlined on the water above let go the stone and swam up cautiously to the stern the propellers were motionless two big dark blades he ran a hand over the hull rough with barnacles the boat had been in the water a long time with extreme care hanging to the rudder he got his head above the surface no one above he reached upward the rail was too far away he unlimbered the collapsible grapple attached to a silken cord of great strength he always carried the thing he tossed the grapple hooked it over the rail waited to see that no one had been alarmed then he went down into the water again and waited there was a shout sudden rush from the propellers nearly threw him out of the water he fought the cord managed to get hold of the rail they were crowded on the forward deck except for two men who were at the wheel and controls the last pair were amidships forward a man bellowed get your hands up monks voice answered come and get us were surrendering the darn tide covered those rocks the man who had bellowed said careful men this smells like a trick doc was on deck by that time he went forward the boat was traveling fast now making a wide circle around the swimming figures of monk and the others the bronze man hit the pair at the controls he struck hard with a shoulder sent one man overboard the other whirled gasped dodged the fist doc sent at him he stepped backward got out of reach doc knocked the engine throttles wide open he put the port engine into reverse the starboard one full speed ahead he put the wheel hard to port the result was a hairpin turn by the boat narrow beam of the craft had never been designed for such turns it went over not completely capsizing but tipping fully half over the starboard rail and half the cabin under this happened at near forty miles an hour and the result was like an avalanche of stone as water came over the bows everyone on deck was washed overboard with the exception of one man who got hold of a cleat doc picked a cover off the binnacle and hurled it at that man and the fellow slid over the side it was then no trouble to go back and pick up monk ham long tom renny and johnny the latter immediately piled below decks to see if there was anyone left there there was a commotion excited voices doc listened to them longbodied bigworded johnny put his head out of a companion and said a syzygy emphatically monk also came up from below monks face was blank with astonishment a syzygy monk said is probably the word for it johnny seemed surprised that monk should know what such a word meant you know what it means he asked suspiciously syzygy monk said is when one planet meets another or something like that isnt that it johnny nodded doc savage said what are you two talking about a meeting of planets monk explained the way that fellow tottingham strand fell up into the sky we supposed he would be floating around among the stars by now but hes back to earth you mean he is on board he is tied to a bunk down below monk said chapter ix syzygy was no good johnny made another statement he used small words so he was very impressed there is also a girl he said a princess monk corrected him such a regal creature as to make your heart go flopflop her name is erica she says johnny added erica ambler hotts she says doc savage changed the subject by pointing upward that plane he said is coming down as if it had a purpose the plane was a yellow craft with two flat fishshaped floats and a lean shark snout of a watercooled motor it came down in a long falling dive not steep enough to strip off the wings the wing slots were set after the fashion of a dive bomber monk said i dont like the way that thing acts doc savage he had turned the boat back to pick up the crew members who had been dumped overboard suddenly knocked the throttles wide open again and spun the wheel he began to make snaky s curves over the surface the plane changed course two or three times pulled out of its dive there was a whistling then commotion and water and smoke climbing into the air and deep underwater noise a little closer monk said and there would really have been a syzygy bombs johnny muttered ill be superamalgamated a regular dive bomber navy type doc said what navy that would be hard to tell the bronze man said johnny rubbed his jaw thoughtfully nice mixture of events wouldnt you say he remarked a man comes monk tells me about a green chest which was stolen from him he doesnt know what is in the chest because it belonged to a friend named montgomery for whom he was keeping it then the man falls up into the sky then a green fog affects doc monk ham and pat wait a minute monk yelled arent you seeing the green fog certainly not johnny replied and now a naval plane is divebombing us its a little mixed up if you ask me some explanations would help clear part of it monk collared the gaunt geologist and archaeologist are you seeing any fog no monk looked blank thats funny i see a fog doc savage had been watching the plane as it arched up and came back again machinegun bullets began boiling the water as guns on its wings two on each wing two through the propeller hung out red tongues doc changed the course of the boat rapidly get below he said sharply the decks are probably armored monk and johnny dived for the hatch doc yanked at a projection which proved to be what he thought it was a steel shell which hinged up over the steersmans post and would turn machinegun slugs and possibly the lightcannon shells with which modern planes are equipped ham shouted doc you want to put out a smoke screen good idea the bronze man said his voice was composed in contrast to the gnashing rip and tear of machinegun slugs the shotgunloud smash of a cannon shell that suddenly tore away deck planking and exposed the silver shine of armor plate below the boat put out smoke and they moved around under it after a while the night was dark enough to escape the bronze man noted that the gas tanks were well filled he sent the boat toward the city monk watched the lights of the triborough bridge move overhead like a great monocolored rainbow on which moved the luminous patches of automobile headlights the boat motors were a rumble like a subway train underfoot and two white ram horns of spray stood out from the bows and now and then grew longer or shorter long tom came on deck you want to talk to the state police on the radio doc the bronze man asked did you give them the story all but the silly parts long tom said i didnt mention green chests men falling up or green fogs i told them there were some foreign agents or something stirring up a mess were they caught every one of them was gone by the time the police got there no clues not yet they are checking on the plane have the roads blocked and the coast guard is starting to search all boats ham and monk furnished descriptions of all those we had seen monk came on deck in time to say the best description i gave was of that fake monk that sure gets me you wouldnt believe anyone could look so much like me you sure said something there ham told him what you mean looking like you is a feat i didnt think anyone could do look monk said bitterly im in no mood for that stuff you call wit renny put his head out to look at the breathless spectacle which was new york seen at night from the river they swung past the sutton place and tudor city districts high apartment houses with many lighted windows they wont talk renny reported which one both of them said renny the girl claims she doesnt know anything tottingham strand says he cant imagine what it is all about doc savage inquired quietly is he sticking to the story about a mysterious green chest which a friend gave him to keep thats his story and hes stuck with it if you ask me renny rumbled personally i dont believe it any more than i believe storks bring little babies doc turned the boat in to a pier surprised long tom asked arent we going around to the warehouse the warehouse was an innocent lump of a building on the hudson side of manhattan island a structure that bore the legend hidalgo trading company the interior had been converted into a seaplane hangar and boathouse a pneumatic mancarrying tube of docs design one gadget which would never become popular with the public a ride in the tube was about as soothing as a trip through a forest on a skyrocket led directly to headquarters no we shall stay away from there doc said it is probably being watched not many people know about it doc was silent a moment these men we are fighting whoever they are know an incredible amount about us they knew enough to substitute two impostors for monk and ham to gain access to our headquarters at will long toms mouth jerked open then closed doc isnt pat at headquarters with the fake ham doesnt that mean she may be in danger pat the bronze man explained is in the same building but on a different floor in my apartment apartment long tom said i didnt know you had one there nor did anyone else doc said so pat probably is safe pat savage looked anything but safe when they walked in on her she was ghostpale have you got smelling salts or something she asked the idea of pat needing smelling salts was startling what happened monk demanded did the fake ham fall up too pat shuddered he went down if anything the part of him that left what monk stared blankly a button off his vest i think it was pat explained she sank in a chair it was awful i thought i was tough i was the one who ate up excitement whew button monk asked pat said he ate it before the truth serum got him that is he began to feel the effects of the serum and he ate the button it was a hollow shell and there was some powder chemical of some kind in it the man the false ham bragged about it he said it would keep him unconscious for days so we could not get anything out of him you know like spies do and like we have done on occasion its an old trick poison doc savage put in pat nodded i dont think im sure he did not know it that was horrible wasnt it whoever he was working for knew he would be in very desperate straits before he ever used that chemicalfilled button it was murder doc savage glanced at erica amblerhotts she was as cool as cream in a refrigerator i would like you to look at the body doc told her she did not flinch i dont mind she said she went into the other room and glanced at the body on the floor the man had gone through motions in dying that had clawed up the rug and upset things erica amblerhotts was not all cold stone she lost color i never saw him before she said she turned quickly and walked out doc brought in tottingham strand the man was composed but it was the composure of a steel spring tightened to its last turn more than ever the man was like a tempered blade a fine cutting instrument impersonal always on his feet like a cat he went to the body and turned the face into different positions i have seen him he straightened looked at his hands distastefully took out a handkerchief and wiped them this man tried to kill me a few days ago he was in a car that sought to run me down doc asked did you go to the police about that strand shrugged i have explained to your associates why i did not go to the police with any of this my friend montgomery he left me the green chest requested me not to go to the police you must have been willing to do a great deal for your friend montgomery docs metallic eyes were suddenly as still as hardened gold strand spread his hands i did not know what i was getting into and what did you get into doc asked that said strand quickly is something i wish you would tell me what part do you want me to tell you why men fall up strand said doc was silent strand after smiling wryly added and why miss ambler hotts was seized they were going to kill her but first they were going to torture her to make her tell what she knew about my actions and what i knew and what i had done doc said you know then why they seized you no doc savages face was usually expressionless but that did not mean he could not show emotion he displayed feeling now the feeling was profound skepticism it was so plain that strand could not miss it strand flushed my friend montgomery got me into something strand said grimly i wish you would tell me what it is while doc savage was answering strands last statement with silence monk and ham came into the room monk gestured skyward with a thumb said ham and i are going up to headquarters be careful was all doc savage had to say it was a rare occasion when doc gave a warning so monk and ham were impressed when they walked out doc savage watched strand for a while docs face was now expressionless then he made the low trilling which was his peculiarity the sound was almost inaudible strand he said there is a place for everything strand halfclosed one eye so ive heard this is the place doc said for the truth the englishmans face jerked into a mask telling nothing except that he was on guard sorry he said you have not told the truth strand wheeled stiffly sorry he said he walked out a moment later there was a rumble from the outer room doc went to the door strand was trying to leave and renny had his way barred with big fists cocked holy cow renny told him youre not just walking out get out of my way strand said coldly renny looked at the steel expression of the man and said you dont make me shake in my boots friend go back and sit down strand did something that was hard to do he went back and took a chair and made it seem that he had not been bluffed in the least later renny got doc aside that fellow renny muttered is not someone i would want to find in a dark alley if he didnt like me doc savage made no comment he went to the telephone and dialed his headquarters upstairs using the unlisted number which would get a quick response monk answered and said they have been in here doc but theyre gone weve got the photographs from the concealed camera that takes pictures of intruders you want us to develop the film bring the film and developing chemicals downstairs doc directed and there are some other chemicals you can also bring better get a paper and pencil and make a list the list of chemicals which doc savage named was long and complicated he added a few pieces of equipment its a good thing you told me to write them down monk said he and ham soon appeared heavily burdened ham patted his pocket herere the films want us to use the bathroom or the kitchen bathroom doc savage picked up the chemicals and carried them into the kitchen he worked for some time mixing and testing monk came in with a print which he had made this is the best one he said look here weve seen these guys some of them were in the gang that we fought out on long island part of the crew that cornered us on that rock doc examined the print then he looked at monk and asked how is the green fog monk still see it monk said renny and the others say it doesnt exist but pat and ham and i sure see it we see a fog and its green ham had come to lean against the door doc ive noticed a queer thing about this fog you mean that it seems to turn red at times doc asked ham stared how did you know ever hear of santonin doc asked monk popped his palms together blazes for the love of little fishes you know what it is ham demanded sure monk explained great grief doc how did they administer it to us santonin they couldnt have done that doc savage said the fact that we saw only green indicates they used either a developed form of santonin or a similar compound it may have been a gas it probably was im going back upstairs to see how they gave it to us monk yelled the homely chemist burst out of the room ham shook his head i still dont know what this santonin stuff is a chemical doc savage explained it makes things appear all green or all red to its victims for several days it is a drug ham gave that deep thought why he asked did they do that monk came bursting back into the apartment with triumph all over his clockstopping face it was easy when i knew what to look for you found how they gave us that chemical ham demanded did i monk grinned how do you think dont be cute you lummox ham advised you remember one of the very first things that happened to doc when this thing began monk demanded the green fog no no before that doc was up at a hospital performing an operation nobody else could perform right after that monk said why doc had an accident there was a fight some stranger with a knife the knife was knocked out of the fellows hand and struck doc cutting him slightly but doc wasnt even involved in that monk grinned remember what pat was doing when we found her at headquarters bandaging her ankle why oh some fellow on the street had kicked her shin or something and skinned ham went silent his eyes narrowed wait a minute thats a kind of a coincidence monk said remember what you and i did just before we began seeing the green fog we were in a fight exactly monk said and no doubt that was when we got jabbed with a hypodermic needle containing this advanced form of santonin ham looked disgruntled you mean to tell me the santonin was administered with the knife that cut doc with a needle in the toe of somebodys shoe that skinned pats ankle and to us during that fight that monk said is how we got it how did you find it out monk tapped his forehead by using whats in here ham snorted whats in there will never trouble einstein ham sat down in a chair rubbed his jaw and began to realize just how puzzled he was he scowled at monk he did not like to discuss serious matters with monk because the impulse to insult monk was overwhelming rather it was a necessary act of selfpreservation for monk would do plenty of insulting himself if not held at bay in some fashion ham strained his hair with his fingers doc he said why did they give us that stuff that santonin to make us think there was a green fog for what purpose the bronze mans features were inscrutable it was part of an astoundingly clear and elaborate plot hams eyes flew wide when doc referred to a thing as astounding and elaborate it meant a great deal one of the bronze mans habits were understatement ham had heard him call an earthquake a minor tremor when the quake was strong enough to shake the hat off a mans head plot ham said plot eh he was puzzled they gave us santonin that made us see a greenish film because of what it did to our eyes they made us think it was a fog i remember when monk and i were around that building we met a fellow who asked us if there wasnt a green fog that fellow was one of their men he was helping to make us think there was a fog but why monk asked to make it easier to deceive me doc explained rather loudly at least there was perceptibly greater volume in his voice although for no apparent reason ham nodded i think i get it they wanted to hamper your vision so you wouldnt recognize the fake ham and the fake monk but they gave us the stuff too so that when we were first with you it would be common youd think the fog was overall doc said yes and they did not want me to realize i was in a fake headquarters ham stared there was a phony headquarters then an exact duplicate monk muttered thats a hard one to believe i dont see how they duplicated it there have been weeks of patient effort behind this doc savage advised him the bronze mans voice was becoming louder by degrees the gradual increase in volume had not gone unnoticed by monk and ham but they were more or less excited over the fantastic evidence that someone had gone to the enormous pains of duplicating their headquarters exactly they were now doing as people will do when another lifts his voice they were speaking with more volume themselves ham paused to rub his jaw reflectively what he asked was the idea of the fooling us with the fake headquarters a psychological trick ham frowned i dont see the psychology in it the idea doc explained was to make me think i was safe in headquarters among friends the fake monk and ham were to be the friends for that occasion and get me talking monk got into the conversation with a grunt i can see how it might have worked monk declared we always talk freely to each other if doc thought he was with me or if i thought i was with doc or with ham in other words if we thought we were together and nobody else around we might let something slip sure itd work ham put in a skeptical snort if he said we knew anything to let slip monk forgot himself and nodded agreement with ham thats right he said we dont have anything they would want doc savage said quietly but we have they stared at him huh monk said compound monk doc said ham brooks chuckled heartily monk is a compound all right he said he glanced at monk a compound of a missing link and nobody could figure what else then ham stopped speaking his jaw fell he had remembered something say he exploded you mean that stuff that chemical stuff you developed a long time ago i remember hearing somebody say something about some new discovery you had named compound monk but nothing more was ever said about it and it slipped my mind monk said i remember that stuff it was very sensitive to motion radiation the absorption of such radiation by its atoms led to the ejection of three electrons as against twoelectron ejection by socalled photoelectric substances sensitive to light radiation greek ham said its not greek either monk snapped its a perfectly simple thing youve seen light meters photographers use them to measure light what asked ham has a light meter got to do with this affair nothing monk looked exasperated but i can take the perfectly simple principle of the light meter and explain it to you and use that to illustrate compound monk doc savage interrupted there was even more volume in his voice now the formula for compound monk is in the big safe upstairs he said we might get it look it over and see if it would explain what the mystery is about a moment later tottingham strand appeared in the door i can explain what it is all about he said renny long tom johnny pat and erica amblerhotts had evidently been listening because they appeared behind strand strand stepped aside and they entered strand remained in the doorway noting that and realizing there was now no one between strand and the outer door monk arose and sauntered past the man then stood where he could shut off an escape attempt it was because they were fools strand said doc made a slight negative gesture on the contrary they were clever strand showed his teeth with no humor they were trying to deceive me and failed doc said after a moment you are not making yourself very clear they were going to let me escape and go to you for help doc savage spoke quietly in mayan the tongue which he and his associates used for consultation when they did not wish to be understood by others he spoke to monk he told monk to come back out of the other room and leave the way free for strand to take flight what did you say strand demanded monk swallowed his surprise though fast and said all right doc ill go into the kitchen and mix more of that stuff to clear the green fog out of our eyes the homely chemist walked past strand into the kitchen strand was relieved the explanation of all that elaborate deceit was this mr savage first they wanted you in a fake headquarters where you were virtually a prisoner guarded by two of their men by two men guarding you i of course mean the false monk and ham strand stared at them he said i was permitted to escape or so they planned i would go to you they knew and they knew i would talk to you tell you everything the fake monk and ham would be present and overhear all i told you then doc said our guess at the purpose of the green fog and the fake headquarters was correct yes it was to get information out of you and me doc asked they had reason for thinking you would try to reach me excellent reason what was it strand drew himself up i came to america from england to see you he said they knew that monks curiosity got so strong that he put his head out of the kitchen and demanded what did they expect to learn they wished to hear what i would tell you when i came to see you said tottingham strand they had the fake monk and ham planted for that purpose but his face darkened and his hands closed i was too experienced for that gag i saw through it at once i told them so monk rather derisively said youre clever huh strand smiled again and it was like a knife blade showing its steel i was not fool enough for savage to deceive me he said monk looked as if he had been slapped hey what do you mean i mean snapped strand that i do not think savage could have been deceived by those men even for a moment therefore he was not deceived hence he is working with them brother said monk coldly words like those may lose you your teeth savage has you duped strand said coldly he did not want you to know he had sold out so he pulled that elaborate and impossible yarn about a fake headquarters to deceive you he did not want me coming here he wanted me away from you but he knew i would expect to find some of his associates with him you and ham brooks are the most prominent therefore savage prepared a fake monk and a fake ham for me monk shook his head slowly man youre as crazy as a box full of loons he said strand showed most of his teeth ill just leave you with that thought he said then strand leaped back slammed the door and locked it sound of his feet went away from the door fast monk bounced forward bellowing he scrammed i knew he was fixing to erica amblerhotts stood with her hands pressed to her cheeks and made an extremely coherent statement poor tot strand is so terrified by the magnitude of this thing she said that he has made a frightful mistake chapter x the monk compound the eightysixth floor of the midtown building had been doc savages headquarters since the beginning of his rather strange career of righting wrongs and punishing evildoers from time to time he had made changes in the place added gadgets and trick devices until it was a remarkable labyrinth of the unexpected there was for example the wall passages by which they could move from one room to another and watch through disguised loopholes it was possible to move from these to a lower floor thence out of the building by the regular elevator service doc savage watched tot strand crouch before the big safe in the reception room and go through the contents doc stood in a narrow passage and looked on through the glass eye of a large stuffed fish which hung on the wall strand had found the safe open he had located a file marked confidential formulae there were envelopes in this file fat ones each of which contained a notebook a record of the experiments in developing the formula and a package which contained samples of the formula itself whenever the stuff was not perishable strand found a package grunted loudly he put his find in his pocket and fled the place he was so nervous that he was perspiring down in the lobby he took a great deal of care to make sure no one was waiting for him this information was relayed to doc savage by renny renwick who said he got off on the mezzanine floor hes looking over the railing scouting to see if the coast is clear renny was sitting in the lobby barber shop which had huge glass windows that offered a full view of the lobby renny had seated himself in a chair lathered his face and leaned back the barber who knew what was expected had handed renny a telephone when the latter gestured doc said tell me when he leaves and what route he takes hes doing it now renny said the south door he is going west doc directed go back upstairs keep an eye on that girl erica amblerhotts she knows more about this than she has told us that will be a pleasure renny said is bob following strand doc asked yes bob was bob gaston he operated the newsstand in the south lobby of the building bob gaston was also a product of the institution which doc savage and his associates referred to as the college the college was located in a remote section of upstate new york and its purpose and even its existence were unknown to the general public the purpose of the college was the renovating of criminals by unusual methods when doc caught a chronic crook he committed the fellow to the place where the patient underwent a delicate brain operation at the hands of specialists trained by doc himself as a result of the operation all memory of past was wiped out the patient was then trained to hate crime and taught a trade after which he was graduated as a useful citizen bob gaston was such a graduate once a criminal he now bore no traces of it no more trace than he had recollection bob watched tottingham strand enter a small apartment house in the jackson heights section he calmly walked into the lobby and entered the elevator with strand the place did not have a doorman and the front door was left carefully unlocked during the day strand got out at the fifth floor so did bob strand entered apartment c bob went back downstairs hurried to a drugstore and telephoned doc savage he told doc where strand would be found watch the place and wait for me doc said the bronze mans voice was pleased and bob gaston felt very good about the matter as he left the drugstore and walked back toward the apartment house bob understood vaguely that in some way he owed a great debt to doc savage although he did not know exactly what it was something to do with his earlier life he suspected his past was a blank largely it did not bother him except that once or twice he had met men who seemed to know him but whom he did not recognize such memories as he had were only very vague stirrings nothing tangible enough to shape into an actual recollection bob was perfectly satisfied he operated the newsstand and cigar counter in the great skyscraper which contained doc savages headquarters and he made a good living he knew that he owed his prosperity to doc so he was particularly anxious to please he now noticed a taxicab in front of the apartment house it had been there earlier not exactly in front of the place but at a parking spot designated as set aside for cabs hit by an idea bob approached the cab care to rent this heap for a couple of hours buddy he asked let me drive it i mean the taxi driver stared in astonishment huh i would like to take over your cab for a while bob explained the driver had a round pumpkin of a head and small eyes as gray as pencil erasers gwan somewhere else he growled i got no time for stews i am not drunk bob explained carefully i wish to hire your cab i will pay you for it you think im crazy countered the driver hell i dont know you i own this cab myself think im going to turn it over to a stranger this was a logical argument bob chuckled look he said would it make any difference if you knew i was working for doc savage the taxi driver seemed to jump an inch off his seat savage doc savage bob explained innocently im on a job for him so your cab will be safe enough the driver had trouble getting his chin up off his chest you work for doc savage he asked bob gaston nodded what you doing asked the driver im shadowing a man bob said i want to use your cab to keep track of him so driver you can see it is perfectly all right here ill give you ten dollars for the rental of your cab the next hour ten dollars the cab driver sounded utterly amazed sure pal here let me get out he alighted from the cab he removed his cap here take my cap bob reached for the cap and the driver used the blackjack he had managed to slip unobserved out of his pocket used it so hard that the leather split and small shot flew and bounced and scampered over the sidewalk long after bob gaston was lying motionless on his face with uncanny abruptness two more men were beside the driver what happened joey one demanded this guy followed strand to the place said the driver he came up and tried to hire my cab to trail strand the fool he even told me he was working for savage hell if strand left savage that means hes got what he came after exploded the other we better see about that said joey there were more than the three of them the others were concealed in the adjacent darkness joey made a series of gestures with his arms semaphore signals tanding under the light in front of the apartment house i told em to stand by for trouble he said they went upstairs using the stairway instead of the elevator and climbed warily they did not knock on strands door two of them simply hit it together and the third stood back with a gun it was not a wellmade apartment house and the door split letting them inside the man who had stood back was instantly inside with his gun tottingham strand dropped a suitcase another suitcase stood on a chair partially packed joey said getting ready to leave us tot strand stood very stiff with hands splayed against his legs he trembled slightly when he spoke it was to make low guttural remarks that went into great detail about the debased nature of joeys ancestry joey whitened and said shut up then joey went looking around the room he located on a table a packet and noted its markings compound monk you got it he yelled he bounced over in front of strand so excited that he drooled you got it you got what you came all the way from england to get strand who had composed himself coldly said nothing joey saw the expression he chilled what you looking so smug about strand indicated the package no good what a plant a fake just something savage put in his safe for me to find joey glared i dont believe it strand shrugged oh he sucked me in properly i fell for an old trick one of the oldest he let me escape and get this that package he even let a clue drop to where it was joey suddenly frenzied ripped open the package he examined the contents stuff which looked somewhat like quicksilver in a small glass bottle it was heavy when joey noticed how heavy the stuff was he began getting pale he dug a silver coin a quarter out of his pocket and uncorked the bottle put some of the contents on the coin he rubbed the coin got a wet silver sheen mercury joey bellowed ordinary mercury strand shrugged i told you it was just a bait joeys eyebrows pulled together yeah i guess that explains why savages man was following you he wheeled get out of here he told his men what about me strand asked you go with us joey advised him and this time well see if we cant do a better job of holding you they got down on the street with scared haste joey had rolled unfortunate bob gaston into the cab he rolled him out again bob was still unconscious joey got behind the wheel his two men and strand climbed in the rear joey made semaphore signals with his arms and they left they drove fast and cautiously and in silence for a time then strand spoke got some new helpers havent you joey he asked joey only grunted then he demanded what do you mean earlier today the two boats the plane all those men going around giving each other snappy salutes what about em rather an augmented organization i would say strand remarked grimly they work for me joey snapped what of it you and stinky and the other two didnt have money enough to hire such a collection youre nuts joey said i got more money than you think strand showed his teeth unpleasantly in the strange knifeblade way he could manage you have an excess of brains he added an impossible excess joey drove into a stretch of deserted road and watched the rearview mirror carefully only one car followed he blinked his headlights the other car blinked its lights three times quickly in response and joey breathed easily again they were his men following whats excessive about my brains he demanded you didnt have the sense joey to think up that rather fantastic but shrewd scheme to get doc savage to a fake headquarters with a false monk and ham so that i would escape and go to them and reveal you hoped to your false monk and ham all i knew and doc savage would in turn reveal all he knew you hoped joey grunted disgustedly strand said you did not think that up joey i dont see why it didnt work joey said you could not put a thing like that over on doc savage strand advised him hell it was fantastic enough to have worked joey snapped they told me savage wouldnt fall for anything ordinary but this would be so wild he would joey then caught himself and swallowed uncomfortably strand gave a laugh with an edge so you do have a boss now joey someone with brains joey said youre nuts unconvincingly strand leaned back and sighed joey he said you have no imagination you could have sold this thing for an empire and i actually mean an empire a kingdom you could have been king of any one of a dozen countries you could have named strand laughed what did you get a hundred thousand dollars i got half a mil joey began indignantly then caught himself again there was genuine mirth of a cold desperate kind in strands laugh a kingdom you could have gotten joey he said you could have been king of england perhaps how would you like that you miserable gutter rat joey did not say anything he was white joey went to a deserted woodland section and got a portable radio out of a tree he also produced a code book and began rather painfully a coded transmission that was supposed to sound like an airplane pilot attempting to contact a control airport he got an answer also ostensibly from an airport and worked frantically with a pencil paper and a flashlight finally he came back to the car he was triumphant we got a plan to get hold of savage he said this time it will work is savage supposed to fall for this one because it is so fantastic strand asked witheringly joey snorted this one is so simple anybody would be taken in were gonna work through somebody that savage wont suspect in a million years strand said you do function well when you connect up with someone who has brains dont you joey joey snarled pop that guy if he dont close his mouth one of the men slapped strand undisturbed strand said you sold too cheap joey a kingdom think of it you miserable dupe joey got in the car and drove on but he had become pale again chapter xi the undercover agent doc savage was quietly undisturbed with bob gaston it could happen to anyone bob he said bob gaston was miserable over his failure to anyone who has no sense whatever he declared myself for example forget it its nice of you to say that bob muttered but i made a mistake in blabbing too much to that fellow i thought was a taxi driver i guess being a detective isnt my line of work how is the newsstand going floe inquired oh fine bob said i owe you so much thats what makes me feel particularly bad about lousing up the job you gave me doc savage left bob gaston at the newsstand in the lobby of the building it was now late night long past closing time and the lobby was deserted except for scrubwomen and janitors doc rode an elevator up to his apartment monk and pat and the others including erica ambler hotts met him the bronze man explained quietly that the enemy had knocked bob gaston senseless and had apparently made off with tottingham strand there was nothing in strands apartment to shed light on the mystery he finished except that strand rented the place only two weeks ago there were stickers on his luggage when he arrived indicating he had come by steamship to south america thence to new york by plane the stickers had been steamed off his luggage indicating he did not want anyone to know about his recent arrival the information about the stickers came from the superintendent of the apartment house who is a travel bug bigfisted renny spoke in mayan saying that he wanted to speak with doc privately the bronze man moved into the bedroom someone had covered the body of the fake ham with a sheet strand showed us one thing renny said they are after the compound monk as we call it was that what you wanted to discuss no not exactly renny blocked out his big fists thoughtfully its this erica amblerhotts what about her i dont place her in this renny said she says she doesnt know a thing but when strand cleared out she said something about his being so terrified by the magnitude of the affair that he was making a terrible mistake i ask you this doesnt that sound as if she knew something doc savage nodded slowly did you question her about that renny snorted yes he said and you can guess about how much she told me what the little boy shot at nothing the bronze man said we might hear her story again he returned to the outer room he took his time opening a conversation with erica amblerhotts as if he had no particular motive by the way he said how did you become acquainted with strand erica smiled wryly with tot oh ive known the fellow for ages his father was garnetender on my fathers estate when i was so high she indicated something an inch or two long with thumb and forefinger weve plowed into each other at intervals ever since really nothing close between us just a gabbing acquaintance you might say can you tell us anything about strand doc asked idly nothing im afraid nothing at all nothing doc savage picked up the telephone i want the transatlantic operator he said i am placing a call to scotland yard in london erica amblerhotts jerked up straight just a minute you calling about tot yes in that case erica said i had better tell you about him myself rather you get the information from a sympathetic source doc told the telephone operator never mind cancel the call and hung up erica amblerhotts took a deep breath poor tot strand is wanted in england for murder she said monk dropped an apple he was peeling habeas corpus monks runt hog stooped up the apple and scuttled into the kitchen pursued by hams pet chimp chemistry blank astonishment was all over monks homely face he said thats hard to believe strand is a tough guy i could see that but it seemed to me that it was a clean kind of toughness erica half nodded he is also wanted for treason she said monk muttered blazes both of those crimes erica announced grimly are punishable by the death penalty monk shook his head i still cant see him as that kind of a man tot would like to hear you say that erica said monk eyed her thoughtfully you seem to believe he is not guilty thats right what makes you think he isnt guilty i know tot thats jolly well enough for me doc savage entered the discussion again with a completely emotionless request suppose you give us the details about the murder and treason charge against tottingham strand he said there was something about the flat emotionlessness of his voice that compelled an answer more than a show of agitated interest would have really i cant give you the exact details erica told him but the way i understand it tot was doing a spot of service for the war department he was working with a man named coxwell what kind of work was strand doing for the war ministry doc asked too quickly erica said i do not know coxwell the man who was working with strand went to his superior officers and told them that he suspected strand of selling out the english government coxwell had no proof he just suspected he was a rather sleazy sort this coxwell chap was and i fancy the chaps in the war ministry rather doubted his word she paused to give dramatic effect to her next statement coxwell was found killed in strands apartment off kensington she said strand disappeared when was that not quite six months ago doc savage said had you been in constant contact with him since oh certainly not i had not seen him for months not until a few days ago in fact when he gave me a ring on the telephone any particular reason for his calling you not that i was able to learn any reason doc asked for you to go out with a murderer she tightened visibly really i dont believe you think ive told you the truth doc reached for the telephone into the telephone the bronze man said transatlantic operator please to the operator doc said i want to talk to carl morenta of the international game association longacre road london england he listened for a few moments that is too bad he said put the call through immediately after the wire is made available he hung up and explained the wire is being used for military matters it will be turned back to civilian use again in half an hour there is nothing to do but wait erica amblerhotts leaned back in her chair she took out a cigarette and lighted it they had not seen her smoke before cigarette she asked pat and pat shook her head doc savage spoke to monk he used the mayan tongue which only his associates understood give this girl a chance to escape doc said answer me in mayan as if we were holding a conversation so you think shes been lying to us monk said in an astonished voice using the mayan lingo thats good doc told him now you will receive orders to leave and perform certain duties ignore the orders instead follow this girl if she leaves we do not want any slips she is our one chance to get back in contact with the mystery pat savage was not supposed to understand the mayan lingo she said in mayan what am i to do doc a flicker of astonishment crossed the bronze mans usually emotionless face where did you learn the language pat oh i talked monk into teaching it to me she said monk looked embarrassed doc said monk take ham and johnny and visit your laboratory downtown get together equipment that we might need take it to the waterfront hangar pat you and renny and long tom had better get out and talk to the british consular officials i want to know whether they have any inkling about this mystery better talk to them personally to get results pat nodded if we started talking to them over the telephone about men falling up she said fat lot of information we would get they departed leaving doc savage alone with erica amblerhotts doc told erica i am waiting for the telephone call to england to go through the halfhour delay will have elapsed shortly she nodded can i do anything to help you are not scared are you i imagine so she said i have no impulse to wring my hands and moan however doc asked would you be afraid to go downstairs and get something for my associates to eat when they get back there is a delicatessen in the next block you take the south side entrance and turn right the girl was expressionless as enigmatic as the bronze man i would like to help she said of course i will go thank you erica amblerhotts arose by the way mr savage why do you think tot strand fled the way he did you recall he said he had come all the way from england to see you and it sounded as if he was telling the truth doc faced the young woman tottingham strand got into our safe and seized a package marked compound monk the bronze man said erica was shocked she lowered her head did things with her hands calculated to make it seem she was not concerned she moved to the door i will get the food she said she went out five minutes passed and ten an hour finally and a bit more then the telephone rang it was renny with his big bullinabox voice shes scramming renny said holy cow doc she met three very smoothlooking guys who probably live on nails and sandpaper and theyre out at a private airport on long island theyre warming up a plane doc asked have you a portable radio yes keep in touch with me the bronze man said and give me the location of the airport the telephone began ringing as soon as the bronze man put it down and the operator said this is the transatlantic operator i am ready with your call to london chapter xii the flying man andrew blodgett monk mayfair and theodore marley ham brooks had been goodnatured enemies since they had known each other the brand of good nature was hard to recognize strangers often yelled for the police upon hearing them engaging in what was a minor bit of persiflage comparatively speaking an hour before dawn the following morning they were crawling through brush with their two pets habeas corpus and chemistry they were discussing a small matter about which monk was feeling injured this compound monk theyre talking about monk said grimly how come i didnt know the stuff was named after me i wouldnt know ham said there are probably two or three things since the beginning of creation that you dont know or did that ever occur to you dont try to be nasty monk advised im asking you a simple question simple describes most of your questions whyd they name that stuff compound monk ham began grinning but the grin was lost on monk because of the darkness however when ham burst into smothered laughter monk realized the state of the dapper lawyers feelings you shyster monk sounded bitter theres some gag connected to them naming that chemical or whatever it is after me and how ham chortled monk thought of several bitter things he wished to say and said none of them because they were crawling through the runt bushes which fringed a beach the sand was hard and gritty under their hands imitate a loon ham said you do it monk snarled it should come more natural to you ham gave a passable imitation of a loons cry got an answer and they headed for the sound shortly they came upon the others bigfisted renny said we began to think you two fellows were never going to join us all the others were here an hour ago aw ham had to go past his club and get the proper clothes for the occasion monk growled does he figure he knows what the proper occasion will be asked renny from the size of his suitcase i guess he prepared for an assortment of occasions monk said doc savage was soundlessly beside them he had come from the night somewhere doc said the plane is preparing to take off erica ambler hotts and her three companions apparently have been waiting for daylight renny rumbled ill wake up pat she could sleep through the end of the world he went over and tickled pats nose with a grass blade she promptly slapped him then tried to go back to sleep wake up renny advised were about to start cutting oats around here they must be pretty wild pat complained if you have to sneak up on them in the dark this way doc savages plane was the large experimental job which he had developed in transparent plastic not that it was an invisible ship nothing of the kind but the skin fabric was almost as transparent as glass and some of the control cables were made of the same stuff which was almost as tough as duralumin the motor and the other solid parts were painted a dark color above to blend with the earth a light color below to merge with the sky riding along in the experimental craft was somewhat eerie and did not please monk he picked his way through the cabin with a ghastly expression if there was a hole in the floor of this thing you couldnt see it he complained pat watched the ground at least it makes sightseeing easy that was true at first they had felt no need whatever for windows this was one of the great military values of the transparent plastic it would enable the occupants to watch for attacking planes from any direction but as the flight had progressed the inevitable oil vapor from the motors had stained the plastic hull hampering vision renny pointed at the ground rumbled nice country for a giant to walk over he would sure stub his toe pat agreed it was the rugged coast above maine a snaggletoothed coast line that was noted for its high tides and brittle weather the rocks were like black teeth and back inland the earth had been clawed by the weather into great ravines that stretched for miles long tom roberts lowered a telescope almost as long as his arm he rubbed his eye theyre about five thousand feet above us he said just went through that rift in the clouds they seem to know where theyre going ineluctable dialecticism johnny remarked my my pat said two very nice words what do they mean i think he means its obvious long tom said whats obvious where erica amblerhotts and her three friends are going thats the idea what makes it so obvious if i may ask theyve flown a straight line ever since they left long island long tom pointed out that shows they know where theyre going monk grabbed a seat felt of the transparent cushions to make sure they were solid and sank on them doc he said yes called the bronze man doc was at the controls you ever get that call to london through monk asked yes that carl morenta you asked for isnt that a name you call to get hold of the head office of the british army intelligence service monk inquired yes i was just wondering monk continued why you went to such pains to let erica amblerhotts know you were calling carl morenta long tom burst out in a howl of astonishment down there he bellowed he jabbed with his telescope right north of that big ravine that runs down into the sea monk stared what the heck is it youve got the telescope its a man long tom shouted monk snorted whats so remarkable about a man this one long tom said is falling up into the sky if we keep going the way we are well pass right by him or hell pass by us doc savage said get on your parachutes quick there was a rippling grimness in the bronze mans tone that was like cold ice against their backs getting into a parachute is not something to be done in a hurry there are two straps over the shoulders that snap together across the chest and two more that snap one around each leg but haste makes an inexplicable snarl out of the webbing straps renny started it off nicely by getting the wrong chute there was only one on the plane that would fit him holy cow he rumbled it did not help that they all tried to watch the man falling up by now they could see the man falling up with their unaided eyes also they could see the plane ahead the craft had turned suddenly it appeared and was coming back it became more prominent in the morning sky monk said looks as if theyve seen the man falling up and are coming back to investigate he was wrong how wrong it was suddenly obvious when the other ship banked wildly gosh looks as if they saw the man falling up and are fleeing from him monk said long tom used his telescope the man is falling toward them he yelled ham said youre crazy a man falls up he doesnt fall toward airplanes dont call me crazy long tom snapped you get in the habit of that talking to monk itll get you new skin on your nose if you arent careful and a man does not fall up ham shrugged well yonder is one falling somewhere doc savage asked can you distinguish the features of the man who is falling up long tom puckered an eye against the small end of the telescope too far away he said hes got his arms and legs spread out stifflike the next development they could all see with naked eyes ill be superamalgamated said bigworded johnny the occupants of the distant plane were jumping four figures in quick succession black forms that fell down through the sky at least they arent falling up monk said they tumbled for a long way almost to the earth before the parachutes opened as a result they landed close together coming down in a small clearing the only one in miles apparently the plane which they had deserted lifted its nose into a stall fell off in a left spin and went down and down after them blazes renny rumbled he was popeyed the man who was falling up is now falling down the figure did not fall downward for long it seemed to follow the spinning plane a while then it began dropping behind it floated around idly it started to fall up again then it changed direction holy cow renny boomed now its after us doc savage spoke again and there was more crashing concern in his voice than had been there when he had ordered them to put on the parachutes jump he said stupefied they watched the figure coming toward them it was traveling they began to realize with surprising speed jump doc savage rapped take to the parachutes do like the others did fall to within a few hundred feet of the ground before you pull your ripcords doc boosted open the door began shoving the others out into space pat was pale when she went out she did not care much for parachute jumping not that the others were enthusiastic about it either monk and ham carried their pets each animal had a collar and they had snapped these inside the chest rings of their parachutes they fell for a long distance closely packed only a few score of yards between them then they cracked open the chutes had a few moments to tug at shrouds to stop swaying and to direct their descent slightly then they were busy getting out of the harness ready to free themselves the moment they hit ground so that they would not be dragged doc ran in search of the others he found monk first monk was sitting on the ground as pale as anyone had ever seen him what happened doc asked i aged fifty years in that jump monk said weakly my hog got to kicking around and got a leg through the ripcord ring so that i couldnt grab hold of it i thought i was never going to crack that chute ham came up in time to hear that and snort your chute opened ahead of anyone elses monk was too shaken to answer doc savage was watching the sky the others looked upward also suddenly there was an explosion a sharp blast although not a terrific one distance took away some of its force what had happened was plain to the eye but hard for a brain to accept it was manifestly impossible a man falling up was impossible to begin with and the fact that a man falling up could overtake a plane plunge directly into the plane and blow it to more or less small pieces at least into such a condition that it fell helplessly toward earth was even harder to accept rationally all of them watched with breath corked tightly in their lungs for the same thing a glimpse of the man who had fallen up they did not see him they watched with eyes out and lips getting dry and arms and legs beginning to ache from being held stiff until parts of the plane heavier parts such as motor assembly began striking the ground but no man it was the man that blew up monk breathed hams expression became strange suddenly he emitted a blurt of laughter blurt was the word the laughter came out of him without his consciously authoring it it had a silly sound so asinine that he caught his lips involuntarily monk stared and asked whats the matter with you ham shook his head wordlessly he was pale the horrible jackass laugh he had made had given him a start he was wondering if his mind had suddenly snapped so that he was crazy pat said i know how it feels i could make a noise like that too bigfisted renny renwick nodded soberly it was the man blowing up thats what does it for me does what long tom asked him makes me sure im crazy renny said doc savage said do not let it worry you there is a perfectly logical if somewhat unusual explanation renny rumbled the only thing that would sound logical to me is that a man did not fall up a brisk twist of an emotion that probably was humor appeared in the bronze mans eyes you can rest assured he said that a man did not fall up chapter xiii deceit erica amblerhotts called mr savage please dont answer me dont let them know where you are she was to the right some distance away her voice had a kind of vibrating terror get away if you can she added loudly get plenty of help call on the american government telephone the naval intelligence department and tell them morenta told you to get help dont forget that morenta her tone got louder repeat that name to be sure no no dont they might hear your voice and locate you please go monk said that girl sure sounds as if somebody was trying to make her eat a snake the bronze man made no audible comment but he gestured emphatically indicating that he and his men were to take cover and make no noise they crawled several yards a wing fragment of their plane the last to fall hit the rocky ridge to the south ham caught docs eye and used the deafanddumb finger language to say im going to use chemistry to spot them doc nodded ham collared his pet and proceeded to give several hand signals the chimp or runt ape for there was some scientific doubt about chemistrys ancestry seemed to understand monk watched with no pleasure he prided himself on the intelligence of his pet hog habeas corpus but it had not occurred to him to teach habeas to understand hand signals which could be given silently obeying hams gestures chemistry took to the trees humph monk said they waited the undergrowth thick about them was drawn tight with a kind of uneasy stillness not stillness either the sea was close by the sound it made was a sobbing one rising and falling but it was always loud enough to cover small noises around them finally chemistry dropped silently out of a tree near them the chimp went to ham danced up and down turned and took off the way he had come he looked back with an almost human appeal for them to follow probably found a bird nest monk muttered he sucks eggs doesnt her doc savage asked ham will chemistry guide me alone probably ham admitted if you want to try it alone but wouldnt it be safer if all of us you stay here doc said do not move and do not make any noise the bronze man moved after the chimp he went quietly so silently that it was uncanny the chief of the mok native tribe in the amazon jungles who had taught him woodcraft would have been proud of the way he merged with the undergrowth and shadows chemistry discovered that doc alone was following and showed a spell of indecision over the matter that would have embarrassed ham doc repeated the gestures ham had used after he did it the second time chemistry surrendered and went ahead erica amblerhotts was talking to the man called stinky and the one who had played the part of monk in the greenfogandfakeheadquarters trick there were other men there was freddy the taxi driver who had been duped by doc savage into taking the bronze man from headquarters to the spot where monk and the others were besieged on long island freddy wore a white bandage around his jaw evidently part of repairs made necessary by the blow doc savage had struck ericas three companions were there renny renwick had described them as three very smoothlooking gentlemen who probably lived on sandpaper and nails that was right they looked exactly like that the three stood there holding their hands in the air and looking like men who knew they were the same as dead erica was smiling she talked animatedly with stinky and the fake monk and the others it was clear that erica was engaged in some kind of a double cross doc savage got the small telescope out of his clothing and began to watch the girls lips he was an excellent lipreader her english accent in so far as it changed her lip movements bothered him slightly but he was able to make out what she said his face got grim as he listened one of the three smoothlooking men spoke angrily to erica she slapped the man the fake monk then knocked the fellow down erica showed her teeth in a kind of shewolf smile that was utterly convincing if one wanted to be convinced that she was a very capable thing which headed for a goal about the same as a bullet after it leaves an army rifle when doc savage rejoined monk and the others ham jumped and dropped his sword cane which he had managed somehow to retain the bronze mans reappearance was abrupt and silent chemistry dropped out of a tree beside the bronze man ham pointed at chemistry he find them for you very efficiently doc replied how much equipment have we on hand monk and the others immediately dug into their clothing they brought to life what was in total a startling assortment it ranged from grenades explosive smoke gas flashers for producing momentary blindness to several drums of cartridges for the supermachine pistols gas equipmentmasks suits and various other gadgets doc selected certain items that surprised the others then he went away silently as before it was almost an hour later when doc savage appeared unexpectedly in front of erica amblerhotts oh exclaimed the english girl she was alone doc asked where are your companions they were captured she said without hesitating at all why didnt you flee after i called to you the bronze man shrugged it seemed senseless to get so close then flee you think you are close he said this is one of the most deserted sections of the country a very good place for a foreign power to land its agents and for them to headquarter she seemed startled you seem to know a great deal about this affair it is clearing up bit by bit he gestured suppose we join my men and pat erica nodded again her response was without hesitation doc indicated the direction they were to take they walked through the undergrowth using care in moving bushes looking for the quiet places to put their feet monk and renny were suddenly in front of them with machine pistols holy cow renny said you were making so much noise we thought it must be someone else erica showed surprise i thought we were being very quiet she looked around you are all safe renny nodded pat frowned at erica how are you morenta she asked erica stared at them you already knew i was a british agent didnt you pat said doc seemed to know it he was going to call somebody named morenta in england what is morenta a password erica shook her head morenta isnt exactly a password she said it is headquarters of a branch of english espionage service there are various branches the morentas are engaged primarily in developing or securing war inventions each morenta is a number rather than an individual i happen to be morenta doc savage said tottingham strand was once morenta was he not erica started how did you find that out i talked to morenta on the telephone after you fled doc explained i fled because i knew you were getting too close to the truth erica frankly admitted our orders are not to allow our identity or our missions to become known to outsiders under any conditions you were beginning to discover the truth i had no choice but to clear out doc said morenta headquarters made that fairly clear at least they surmised that must be your motive ham put in miss amblerhotts you say tottingham strand used to be one of these morenta agents yes i told you what happened the girl said sharply a man named coxwell was found murdered in strands apartment and strand disappeared who was coxwell another morenta erica said doc savage put in what was behind the murder didnt morenta tell you no its a long and bally involved story erica said we cant stay here they are all through the woods i think we can reach the spot where they keep their boat i know where it is come on and well straighten this out later doc savage said good we will travel in single file you and i and long tom and monk will lead the others will follow the girl seemed dissatisfied how will they follow us by keeping us in sight doc opened a small case it contained a chemical and a pair of rather bulky goggles the chemical is not noticeable to the unaided eye he said but seen through these glasses it is a brilliant yellow we will blaze the trail with the chemical the others will have the spectacles and can follow erica swallowed you fellows have the darnedest gadgets she said doc savage monk long tom and erica moved forward the girl led the way from time to time doc savage made brief marks with the swab contained in the bottle of chemical erica was confident moving straight ahead as if her destination was definitely in mind and it was the destination was several men with rifles one of them was the fake monk the cab driver called freddy was another freddy cocked his rifle said one of you want to make a noise erica stamped a foot quiet you fool his aids are following us be still they will appear in a minute good freddy said they waited waited a long time and no one came ham pat renny and johnny did not put in their appearance freddy growled he must have got wise erica snapped he couldnt have he did not speak a word to the others except to tell them to follow he did not even use that strange language in which they occasionally converse nevertheless said freddy something just must have come uncorked doc savage monk and tom were led forward there was no path exactly but men had gone that way before frequently always taking a slightly different route so that there would not be a trail the gadgets and chemical mixtures which doc savage employs may seem unusual to the point of being fantastic but scientific investigation will show any reader that the bronze man is ahead of other scientists only in degree of development rarely does the bronze man use anything which has not already had laboratory treatment because unscrupulous individuals have been known to make criminal use of such information specific details and chemical formulae are purposely omitted chapter xiv battle stations submerged the trail led down to the sea to a cove that was a cup in which green water churned and made sobbing noises among the rocks the boat in the cove was a sailing yacht schooner rigged not more than forty feet over all slightly less at the waterline a fat old woman of a hull patched sails seagrid new york that was what lettering on the stern of the old boat said but it was tied out there in the cove with lines that were too heavy they got into an old twelvefoot dinghy the dinghy ferried them out to the schooner freddy ordered take them below a man shoved monk the homely chemist took a couple of steps stopped started to swing on the man who had pushed him then monk became more interested in the construction of the boat he stamped a foot doc theres something phony about this hooker he said its made of steel he leaned forward suddenly to ogle the sails heck these arent sails he exploded they are made of steel and painted imitations thats what they are he got shoved again and was menaced with a rifle muzzle they were pushed to a hatchway and started down a ladder the ladder had wooden rungs for six feet where there was an opening in the floor then the rungs turned to steel carrying them on down into the interior of the submarine doc monk and long tom were locked in a steel compartment that was evidently the skippers cabin monk expressed his feelings by kicking the door it looks like were mixed up in an international incident he complained if you ask me long tom said we fell for a womans story doc said do not be too concerned about it they gaped at him doc you dont mean you expected this to happen something like it the bronze man said he was without expression that was all they got out of doc savage because he began to comment on the cleverness of the submarine disguise the imitation boat which had been constructed around the conning tower the bronze man seemed to have an extensive knowledge of the craft because he mentioned the way it was jointed how it was fastened to the conningtower structure so that in an emergency it could be jettisoned by mechanical means the entire craft was of steel so cleverly fashioned that they had not realized it was not a genuine yacht until after they were aboard it the periscope doc explained is actually inside the mast presumably it is an accessory periscope and can be cast off when the false structure is released the disguise is particularly effective he added because it gives the submarine a means of working along the coast and enabling it to enter almost any harbor which it would care to enter the underwater surface of the submarine is painted so that only a close observer from an airplane would notice anything peculiar then from an airplane it would only appear that the schooner was under way leaving a wake the boat structure is on the forward portion of the submarine and the after portion is painted white mottled so that from a height it would look like a wake being trailed by the schooner monk was suspicious by now doc you seem to know a lot about this sub he said doc savage dropped the subject of the submarine without making an answer he selected a chair looked over the reading matter the cabin offered and selected a copy of the atlantic pilot the government volume of information for masters of small coastwise vessels when pat ham and long tom were brought aboard not more than half an hour had gone by the three prisoners were marched past and crowded into a steel niche that passed for a cabin across the corridor how did you get caught monk asked your blasted hog ham said they trailed him to us then after monk had felt the shock ham corrected they just had a piece of luck and caught us where is johnny theyre hunting him ham explained this gets no better fast monk muttered another fortyfive minutes brought erica amblerhotts to the small steel network which ventilated the steel door she was sobbing they will not let him go she said doc asked let who go poor tot she said stiffly tot strand they promised to free him if i would trick you into a trap from across the steel hall pat said i like that bargain sister i hope i get my hands on you erica tightened oh it was dirty but i thought you could take care of yourselves and i wanted poor tot out of it pat snapped why should you think they would keep their word why not erica sounded baffled they have all of tots notes his apparatus his working models they even have the compound monk that tot came to america to get doc savage put in they do not have the compound monk we misled strand into thinking he had taken it then they lied to me erica said miserably they told me they wanted merely to seize you and hold you prisoner so that you would not molest them until they got back to europe but that wasnt it they wanted to force you to give up the compound monk a man came down the corridor hurriedly a sailor in the uniform of one of the warring nations ruhig he yelled quiet what is this erica amblerhotts whirled said get away from me you lying pig she had a wrench under her arm and she suddenly tried to lay it against the sailors head he dodged clutched the girl she crowded the sailor against the door of docs cell doc managed to get two fingers through the steel grille and clamped them on the sailors arm it was not much of a grip the sailor began to scream more sailors came struggled and got the sailor loose meine mutter he croaked he tore the flesh out of my arm a sailor shoved a pistol through the grille and fired five times it was for effect the effect was impressive the bullets moved around like hornets splashing lead that was like driving redhot needles the group spent the next fifteen minutes hunting in their hides for particles of lead that looked impressive monk said what kind of an act do you suppose it was no trick doc said huh she told too much of the truth that time doc said long tom complained i like this less and less these cookies are naileaters from way back when they go to work on us for information it will not be any taffy pull the door of their cubicle had no inner lock so that when sailors came for them there was not much they could do about it they were led to the control room below the conning tower another group arrived shortly with pat ham and long tom the hatch was open above their heads they could look straight up through it and see two or three stars motionless in an inky night the night wind was like a perfume after the oil stench a tall dark handsome man faced them he said i want information bitte with a heavy accent you will tell me where is the other member of your party the one called johnny monk said you want in on a little secret brother the man bowed politely yes of course we will tell you nothing monk said not even the time of day a half inch of red appeared above the handsome mans collar you misunderstood us he said we wish no trouble with you his face was wooden where is johnny mister trouble is what id like to have with you monk told him the half inch of red became an inch and the man suddenly popped his palms together as if he was summoning a waiter bring strand he ordered he did not look irritated but he must have been in a bad humor from the way the sailors jumped four of them doublequicked out while they were gone no one said anything they came back with strand tottingham strand had not been improved by handling one eye resembled an apple that had been in the hot sun too long skin was missing from his knuckles among other missing thing was a smile more skin a shirt sleeve and possibly a handful of hair although it was hard to be positive about the latter monk told him you look as if you and our friends here have had a conference strand said five words which expressed fully his opinion of his captors some of the captors got red necks pat smiled beg pardon strand told pat its all right pat told him i was trying to think of something like that to say strand bowed slightly thank you he was calm enough his surface was ice his eyes and his muscles were like edged steel doc savage asked in a conversational tone they have everything but the compound monk have they not strand returned the bronze mans look with no visible emotion yes he said they have but then they have had it for weeks i was not aware of it until two days ago how did you make the discovery doc asked the man called freddy put in shut up you two let them talk please snapped the handsome man his tone left no doubt about who was boss here my friend rod bentleythe only real friend i had in the worldfound it out for me strand told doc savage he discovered they were conducting experiments in that green building in new york city we went there to investigate i was cautious and rod was reckless i would not go into the building he went in instead they caught and killed him and when they killed him they demonstrated that they had my invention doc asked there was no green chest strand shook his head there was never one you told us a man named montgomery gave you a green chest to keep doc reminded i told you several things that were not quite true strand said monk put in disgustedly no green chest no green fog no sense to anything what is this anyway did a man fall up or didnt he strand showed his teeth briefly a man did not fall up not at any time monk started to say something else but caught docs eye monk went silent doc asked strand you came to america to get the formula for compound monk correct it is essential for the operation of your device correct again how did you expect to get the compound monk strands smile was steel by stealth or by force any way i could doc said you did not think of trying a frank approach on the subject strand shrugged i thought that out it was no good to get the formula i would have to explain things you are too smooth to be fooled i tried to concoct some jimcrack invention that i could use to make you think i needed the formula for some innocent purpose it was what you americans call no dice i knew i couldnt deceive you so i wasnt trying doc said but others these fellows we are mixed up with went ahead and tried a trick strand nodded i guess you know what they did they used that fakeheadquarters gag and the phony monk and ham they thought you could be taken in particularly after they used the stuff that made the green fog effect in your eyes they were after the formula which they didnt have they were in the same position as i myself they had my invention but it was useless without the key secret which you had developed and which no one but yourself knew of course i didnt know at first that they had my invention you first found out your device was in their hands when doc inquired two days ago strand said how my friend rod bentley told me that was the first time you realized yes doc savage was silent a moment during the interval he made the small trilling which was his peculiarity when disturbed monk and the others stared at him puzzled doc inquired what were you going to do with the device in the end strand strand became strangely white what do you think i do not believe doc told him that you were going to sell it the whiteness went slowly out of strands face he smiled and it was the first genuine smile any of them had seen on his face thank you he said but you are wrong in a way i wanted the device to make a trade trade strand asked stiffly you know my record in england you mean the murder and treason charges strand displayed his eyeteeth i see you do know yes that is it i was going to try to trade this gadget for freedom from the charge trade it to the english government strand drew himself erect exactly quick and warm lights of approval appeared briefly in the bronze mans strangely flakegold eyes did you receive offers from others doc indicated their captors from these gentlemen for instance strand stared at the dark handsome man at freddy with contempt you would not believe how much they offered me he said doc savage said nothing after a while strand lowered his eyes this may not matter he said but if get out of this there will be no trade i will give the thing to america and england jointly doc said you mean that something in the bronze mans voice startled the darkly handsome man the fellows hand made a flashing gesture and held a gun he held the weapon with muzzle on the floor said you had better lift your hands mr savage doc did not move schnell the man snapped quickly your hands doc put up his arms and his hands touched an ibeam which surprised one of the submarine ribs only ham was watching the bronze man closely and he saw that none of the others had noticed a small globule not larger than a pigeon egg fastened to the side of the beam with a strip of adhesive tape ham saw doc pluck the object loose observing the bronze man get hold of the gadget in such a fashion ham understood something he became positive that doc had been aboard the submarine earlier in the day ham shut his eyes tightly he knew what was coming was prepared for it even then with his eyes shut and his nerves steeled he got a shock the object was a flash grenade tiny as the thing was it gave off a completely blinding light actually what it emanated was more than light the chemical contents burned in such a fashion that they emitted rays of a wave length extremely shocking to the optic nerves the effect was something like looking at an arcwelding flame for a period of time except that it was created in a fraction of a minute following the flash a man screamed and a pistol exploded feet pounded up the steel companionway they got the hatch closed crash dive shouted the dark goodlooking man he repeated the order in his native tongue there was fighting monk was one of the battlers monks warfare was always noisy a pair of fists were making big noises which was probably renny the place began to fill with sailors who were not blinded the submarine began sinking under their feet rumbling a little water displacing air in the tanks doc said loudly monk renny stop fighting we have no chance of breaking out of here holy cow renny complained but they stopped chapter xv the warship the bronze mans next statement made renny feel better doc said commander you will surrender to us immediately the dark man jumped he said several things which were not complimentary and which expressed his personal feelings thoroughly doc said very well was nun the man snapped what do you mean very well you might doc said put a man on your underwater sonic apparatus the dark man swore and yelled at a sailor the underwater sonic equipment was part of all warship equipment in the present modern form it was a most efficient device for locating a ship by sound of its engines and propellers the sailor made an excited report a vessel he said very near sir what type the listeneroperator seemed puzzled an expert trained for the job could identify crafttell destroyer from cruiser freighter from battleship by the difference in sound rather difficult to identify sir he reported what is it yelled the commander suddenly nervous the listener said it is a strange type of vessel sir doc savage spoke again his voice had volume enough to cut through the excitement and a calm power that was convincing tune your radio to the navy band he directed the commander stared whirled and gave an order to that effect the radio room for convenience adjoined the control compartment the operator cut in a loudspeaker from which a brisk voice came saying crew how are you coming with those mines across the cove entrance the radio clicked off came on again and another voice very muffled said we are on the fourth row lieutenant a fish could hardly get out of that cove now much less a submarine good said the first voice send one of the light boats into the cove and put down a small depth charge there was a short wait then the listener reported a boat seems to be coming closer sir i do not identify its motor it has a strange sound he hardly finished when there was a thumping jar the submarine rolled violently tumbling people off their feet monk took occasion to land a hard blow on a sailors square jaw another sailor instantly menaced the homely chemist with a pistol ham suddenly pale warned theyll shoot you monk the radio said hello the submarine wie geht es ihnen how are you there was deathly stillness somewhere a thin stream of water was snarling through a sprung seam hello the submarine said the radio voice you better answer us if you know what is good for you there was another silence and it was pretty bad doc savage said i suggest you answer at this close range your radio will function the commander swore he sounded as if something had hold of his throat the radio said light boat put down another small depth charge they were prepared for the blast that came but it was bad anyway the submarine rolled jarred the backrush of water into the vacuum created by the blast made a suction that lifted the conningtower hatch and a sheet of spray knifed in and drenched them it shut off in an instant but everyone dodged wildly the radio said remorselessly hello submarine more silence and a sailor made the sounds of a small duck as he breathed from the radio all right we wont fool with them any more boats and get in there with heavy depth charges blow all the water out of that cove with a face completely drained of everything including expression the submarine commander stepped to the radioroom door tell them we surrender he said the radio operator relayed the information having difficulty with his english the radio in great relief said ill be superamalgamated doc savage hit the control panel as renny got a sailor by the neck and bellowed holy cow he gave it away monk for once was a little slow getting into a fight the homely chemist had known it was johnny up there somewhere but he had not expected johnny in his excitement to use a big word and give away the deception he was caught by surprise johnny usually did not makes mistakes in a crisis the others ham and long tom and pat joined the fight renny slammed his victim against a bulkhead he went on in a rush for the engine room distances were short inside the submarine he got to the engine room being an engineer renny knew the intricacies of a submarine he knew that if they could blow the air supply out of the tanks the submarine would not dare submerge again because without compressed air it could not expel water from the tanks to rise again he worked valves at the same time shouting at astonished engineers that they were prisoners at the controlroom valves and levers doc savage did the same thing renny was attempting blew the banks and brought the submarine to the surface like a cork they could hear the rush and roar as the sub broke surface it is a trick screamed the commander down again quickly but there was no trick about the sudden rending blast from the bow section nothing false about the stream of water that flooded through a gaping aperture johnny had put a highexplosive grenade against the bow of the submarine as soon as it came out of the water doc said loudly get overboard the boat is going to sink he repeated it in the language the sailors spoke for effect the fighting broke up in an anxious rush for the conningtower hatch monk and doc fought side by side with fists strand can you swim doc demanded excellently strand said he was cool again so can miss amblerhotts the north shore of the inlet doc said righto strand took ericas arm started her up the companion stairs he followed there was no actual fighting now only struggle to get out water coming in the rent bow was like roaring thunder doc savage backed his men to the ladder they climbed pat first then ham and renny and monk and long tom doc followed them kicking off clutching hands the north shore he said as they swam away they could hear the commander bellowing to his men to head for the south shore johnny was standing in the shallow water holding a long paddle affair and a notched stick with which he had been imitating the underwater sound of a boat monk scrambled out beside him and said those big words of yours danged near upset the cart ill be superamalgamated johnny gasped what happened what went wrong i imitated boats used the radio and threw hand grenades into the water near the submarine just as doc had planned what went wrong monk said a word eh that superamalgamated i do not said johnny comprehend you were imitating a navy in firstclass style monk told him in fact you were a regular warship all by yourself then you got excited and used that word i johnny groaned i did didnt i it slipped out ill be superamalgamated the word monk assured him expresses what danged near happened to us someone took a shot at them with a sidearm they crawled away rocks shoved up around them heavy cover they took shelter doc tasked did you contact the coast guard by radio johnny johnny was gloomy yes they will be here shortly erica amblerhotts put a hand on docs arm it looks as if you pulled a trick of your own ham told her doc saw you getting the ultimatum to turn him in to save strands life he can read lips he knew you agreed so he hatched a scheme erica was silent a moment the submarine was mentioned in that conversation the fact that the supposed sailing craft in the cove was really the sub right monk told her so doc went aboard erica gasped i do not see how he could do that she turned to doc how did you manage doc said it was luck largely the guard on the forward deck mistook my voice for that of the man they called freddy i went below and made a tour of the vessel managing to plant various gadgets you put the flash grenade i guess you call it thaton the controlroom ceiling then yes doc admitted however there were other gadgets concealed at various vantage points we had the submarine well prepared for a fight when we permitted ourselves to be seized and taken aboard ham added something else the submarine couldnt have left the cove anyway astonished erica demanded why not doc jammed the steering mechanism when he was aboard the beam of a searchlight appeared like a white needle out of the sea and ham said that must be the coast guard which was a good guess chapter xvi the friend sunlight slanted against the panes of doc savages skyscraper laboratory and was cut into thin bright sheets by the venetian blinds rooftops were a forest below the windows and out beyond the vista was lost in a blue haze of incipient fog doc savage watched tottingham strand without emotion you are sure strand that you wish to give this thing to the american and british governments jointly right strand said much of the steel was gone from strands manner as if something bitter had been taken out of his existence you understand this is no trade it will not affect the murder and treason charges which are against you strand nodded i understand that fully pat came into the room she was looking pleased with herself and in the frock she was wearing she was something to make men walk into lampposts pat indicated the roof those generals and other officers are ready for the demonstration she said doc savage nodded erica amblerhotts jumped to her feet she took strands hand tot im glad you did this she said strands eyes fell im not proud he muttered i should have done it in the first place it makes me no happier because i know exactly why i didnt i was looking out for myself i wanted to trade the thing for my freedom erica said you were always an efficient fellow tot sure strand agreed wryly and see what it got me erica smiled it is getting america and england an amazing war weapon you are giving it to them voluntarily tot nothing can take that from you you have not only a great inventive mind tot you have a heart she kissed strand then and nobody was surprised her tone had said that was exactly what she was going to do strands reaction was a little more surprising he seemed to tighten from head to toes then give way his arms went about erica and he buried his face against her hair they saw that there were tears in his eyes ham looked on utterly disgusted he knew love when he saw it what disgusted him was the fact that he had been giving erica some admiring attention himself monk shoved open the receptionroom door without knocking looked at the embraced couple grimaced said anybody want to look at what the coast guard caught strand and erica came apart wheeled monk said i only brought one the coast guard caught most of them but this was the really interesting specimen monk shoved a man into the room a man who somehow resembled a whipped bull pup rod bentley gasped strand rod bentley said nothing there seemed to be nothing he could say the handcuffs on his wrists were explanation enough of his present status strand said finally i looked on you as the best friend i ever had he laughed it was not pleasant you made a fool of me in the greatest way rod bentley stared at space strand said rod you were an enemy agent bentley curled his lips slightly i am not english i am proud of it monk said bentley was kind enough to explain why he disappeared so that you would think he was dead he had the idea miss amblerhotts had gotten wise to the fact that he was not what he seemed i did suspect erica said i never told tot because no one could have made him believe that incidentally is why i was seized by the agents here in the city after tot called on me strand seemed beyond words doc savage produced a packet of papers bound with a rubber band this seems to be an appropriate time for these he tossed the packet on the table your pardon strand strand nodded slowly pardon doc nodded at the documents the orders rod bentley received over a period of two years he kept them they were on the submarine i found them when i went over the craft before we faked the capture and were brought aboard strand looked at the papers as if they were gold what do you mean by the word pardon doc said rod bentley rigged the murder of which you are accused his orders there will show that he planted the suspicion of coxwell the man you killed he planted suspicion of you also then he told coxwell you were framing him and egged coxwell into attacking you he warned you and you killed coxwell when he came strand shut his eyes tightly so that is how it happened doc added they wanted you to be an outlaw it would give them a chance to buy your contraption strands nod was slow yes i can see now pat said theyre about ready on the roof the thing was about seven feet high and fatter than a man because it was full of gas it looked somewhat like a man too because there were four distended limbs that somewhat resembled arms and legs on the ends of these projections were the devices that made the thing so uncanny the assembled army officers united states and british watched with interest tottingham strand told them the device really has two vital parts first is the gas which is lighter than air and highly explosive thus i get both lift and explosive violence in one operation what asked an officer makes it go fast enough to overtake a plane the rocket principle strand said a thing as light as that could not carry enough rocket fuel to push it around over the sky until it found a plane said the officer strand nodded agreement the rocket fuel will drive it only a mile or two as a matter of fact it cannot overtake a fast plane but it can meet one he stepped over and slashed a cord which held the unusual manlike gadget to the roof the thing immediately began rising a man falling up renny rumbled holy cow strand said watch it will rise slowly to five thousand feet when the builtin altimeter will automatically arm the detonator device the thing thereafter will be explosive upon contact somewhat like an ordinary mine the army man said it hits a plane and explodes we understand that righto strand smiled the altimeter keeps it from being effective below five thousand feet your own planes can fly under it with perfect safety wont it chase them no the pursuit device cuts in at the same time the detonators are armed then this altimeter arrangement will keep it from rushing at objects on earth yes strand said but it will chase any moving thing in the sky not any moving thing strand corrected only very hot objects such as airplane motors giving off heat and movement the army man grunted will you explain that fully strand hesitated then turned to doc savage mr savage would you attempt that i am afraid i can not go into the details without becoming too technical doc savage nodded quietly you gentlemen he told the army men are familiar with the ordinary photoelectric cell which is in light meters ive got one for my camera admitted an officer it registers light thats all i know about it doc nodded again the device in mr strands apparatus is similar in principle he said the photoelectric cell is composed of a compound which upon the absorption of motion ejects two electrons this compound differs in that the absorption of motion and heat by its atoms leads to the ejection of three electrons the officer pondered i take it that one of the arms which is nearest a plane motor picks up this radiation and that sets off the rocket affair so as to drive the thing in that direction that it that doc said is exactly it what is this compound it is called compound monk ham pointed upward the thing is after a plane now he said strand watched placidly there is no need for alarm he said the pilot of the plane understands that the gas will not explode because the detonators have been removed they watched the device strike the army plane in the sky the pilot shut off his motors before the collision occurred so that no harm was done the plane began to spiral slowly toward floyd bennett airport they saw the crew reach out with hooks attached to poles and gather the device into the ship holy cow renny muttered later monk got doc aside monk was perturbed who named that stuff compound monk he demanded how come i never knew about this the bronze man smiled slightly a display of emotion was rare with him it seemed a good idea at the time he said i dont get it monk growled pat overheard and laughed i thought it was a perfect name she said this compound is very sensitive to the presence of movement and warmth it chases movement and warmth everyone knows that you chase after any pretty girl who happens along both you and compound monk chase hot numbers get it monk didnt like getting it i can see that was one of hams ideas he growled where is that shyster ill make a compound out of him doc savage sat at a dinner in a restaurant with monk and a friend the girl appeared and walked directly to their table she was very pretty she was a stranger she seemed to know what she was doing she carried a small soft purse and she jammed this against doc savages left side below the shoulder blade and squeezed then she opened the purse took out the hypo needle which she had just emptied into doc savages back and placed it on the table in front of them you naturally know what that is she said however it might be interesting if you also knew it was was mind you filled with germs doc savage contemplated the girl what he asked do i do now you help me the girl said i need your help i had to have it so i used those germs on you youve now got to do something about those germs and you cant do anything about them without helping me get the idea this seems a little strange doc said you havent seen anything yet the girl said wait until you find out about the three wild men the remainder of this affair of the three wild men is related in the issue of doc savage magazine on sale next month the end
