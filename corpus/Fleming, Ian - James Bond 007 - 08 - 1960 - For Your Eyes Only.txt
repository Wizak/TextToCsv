for your eyes only five secret occasions in the life of james bond ian fleming table of contents for your eyes only from a view to a kill for your eyes only quantum of solace risico the hildebrand rarity from a view to a kill the eyes behind the wide black rubber goggles were cold as flint in the howling speedturmoil of a bsa m doing seventy they were the only quiet things in the hurtling flesh and metal protected by the glass of the goggles they stared fixedly ahead from just above the centre of the handlebars and their dark unwavering focus was that of gun muzzles below the goggles the wind had got into the face through the mouth and had wrenched the lips back into a square grin that showed big tombstone teeth and strips of whitish gum on both sides of the grin the cheeks had been blown out by the wind into pouches that fluttered slightly to right and left of the hurtling face under the crash helmet the black gauntlets brokenwristed at the controls looked like the attacking paws of a big animal the man was dressed in the uniform of a dispatchrider in the royal corps of signals and his machine painted olive green was with certain modifications to the valves and the carburettor and the removal of some of the silencer baffles to give more speed identical with a standard british army machine there was nothing in the man or his equipment to suggest that he was not what he appeared to be except a fully loaded luger held by a clip to the top of the petrol tank it was seven oclock on a may morning and the dead straight road through the forest glittered with the tiny luminous mist of spring on both sides of the road the moss and flowercarpeted depths between the great oak trees held the theatrical enchantment of the royal forests of versailles and st germain the road was d a secondary road serving local traffic in the st germain area and the motorcyclist had just passed beneath the parismantes autoroute already thundering with commuter traffic for paris he was heading north towards st germain and there was no one else in sight in either direction except perhaps half a mile ahead an almost identical figure another royal corps dispatchrider he was a younger slimmer man and he sat comfortably back on his machine enjoying the morning and keeping his speed to around forty he was well on time and it was a beautiful day he wondered whether to have his eggs fried or scrambled when he got back to hq around eight five hundred yards four hundred three two one the man coming up from behind slowed to fifty he put his right gauntlet up to his teeth and pulled it off he stuffed the gauntlet between the buttons of his tunic and reached down and unclipped the gun by now he must have been big in the drivingmirror of the young man ahead for suddenly the young man jerked his head round surprised to find another dispatchrider on his run at that time of the morning he expected that it would be an american or perhaps french military police it might be anyone from the eight nato nations that made up the staff of shape but when he recognized the uniform of the corps he was astonished and delighted who the hell could it be he raised a cheerful right thumb in recognition and cut his speed to thirty waiting for the other man to drift up alongside with one eye on the road ahead and the other on the approaching silhouette in the mirror he ran through the names of the british riders in the special service transportation unit at headquarters command albert sid wally might be wally same thick build good show hed be able to pull his leg about that little frog bit in the canteen louise elise lise what the hell was her name the man with the gun had slowed now he was fifty yards away his face undistorted by the wind had set into blunt hard perhaps slav lines a red spark burned behind the black aimed muzzles of the eyes forty yards thirty a single magpie flew out of the forest ahead of the young dispatchrider it fled clumsily across the road into the bushes behind a michelin sign that said that st germain was one kilometre to go the young man grinned and raised an ironical finger in salute and selfprotection one magpie is sorrow twenty yards behind him the man with the gun took both hands off the handlebars lifted the luger rested it carefully on his left forearm and fired one shot the young mans hands whipped off his controls and met across the centre of his backwardarching spine his machine veered across the road jumped a narrow ditch and ploughed into a patch of grass and lilies of the valley there it rose up on its screaming back wheel and slowly crashed backwards on top of its dead rider the bsa coughed and kicked and tore at the young mans clothes and at the flowers and then lay quiet the killer executed a narrow turn and stopped with his machine pointing back the way he had come he stamped down the wheelrest pulled his machine up on to it and walked in among the wild flowers under the trees he knelt down beside the dead man and brusquely pulled back an eyelid just as roughly he tore the black leather dispatchcase off the corpse and ripped open the buttons of the tunic and removed a battered leather wallet he wrenched a cheap wristwatch so sharply off the left wrist that the chrome expanding bracelet snapped in half he stood up and slung the dispatchcase over his shoulder while he stowed the wallet and the watch away in his tunic pocket he listened there were only forest sounds and the slow tick of hot metal from the crashed bsa the killer retraced his steps to the road he walked slowly scuffing leaves over the tyre marks in the soft earth and moss he took extra trouble over the deep scars in the ditch and the grass verge and then stood beside his motorcycle and looked back towards the lily of the valley patch not bad probably only the police dogs would get it and with ten miles of road to cover they would be hours perhaps days plenty long enough the main thing in these jobs was to have enough safety margin he could have shot the man at forty yards but he had preferred to get to twenty and taking the watch and the wallet had been nice touches pro touches pleased with himself the man heaved his machine off its rest vaulted smartly into the saddle and kicked down on the starter slowly so as not to show skid marks he accelerated away back down the road and in a minute or so he was doing seventy again and the wind had redrawn the empty turnip grin across his face around the scene of the killing the forest which had held its breath while it was done slowly began to breathe again james bond had his first drink of the evening at fouquets it was not a solid drink one cannot drink seriously in french cafs out of doors on a pavement in the sun is no place for vodka or whisky or gin a fine ieau is fairly serious but it intoxicates without tasting very good a quart de champagne or a champagne iorange is all right before luncheon but in the evening one quart leads to another quart and a bottle of indifferent champagne is a bad foundation for the night pernod is possible but it should be drunk in company and anyway bond had never liked the stuff because its liquorice taste reminded him of his childhood no in cafes you have to drink the least offensive of the musical comedy drinks that go with them and bond always had the same thing an americano bitter campari cinzano a large slice of lemon peel and soda for the soda he always stipulated perrier for in his opinion expensive soda water was the cheapest way to improve a poor drink when bond was in paris he invariably stuck to the same addresses he stayed at the terminus nord because he liked station hotels and because this was the least pretentious and most anonymous of them he had luncheon at the caf de la paix the rotonde or the dme because the food was good enough and it amused him to watch the people if he wanted a solid drink he had it at harrys bar both because of the solidity of the drinks and because on his first ignorant visit to paris at the age of sixteen he had done what harrys advertisement in the continental daily mail had told him to do and had said to his taxidriver sank roo doe noo that had started one of the memorable evenings of his life culminating in the loss almost simultaneous of his virginity and his notecase for dinner bond went to one of the great restaurants vfour the caneton lucascarton or the cochon dor these he considered whatever michelin might say about the tour dargent maxims and the like to have somehow avoided the tarnish of the expense account and the dollar anyway he preferred their cooking after dinner he generally went to the place pigalle to see what would happen to him when as usual nothing did he would walk home across paris to the gare du nord and go to bed tonight bond decided to tear up this dusty addressbook and have himself an oldfashioned ball he was on his way through paris after a dismally failed assignment on the austrohungarian border it had been a question of getting a certain hungarian out bond had been sent from london specially to direct the operation over the head of station v this had been unpopular with the vienna station there had been misunderstandings wilful ones the man had been killed in the frontier minefield there would have to be a court of inquiry bond was due back at his london headquarters on the following day to make his report and the thought of it all depressed him today had been so beautiful one of those days when you almost believe that paris is beautiful and gay and bond had decided to give the town just one more chance he would somehow find himself a girl who was a real girl and he would take her to dinner at some makebelieve place in the bois like the armenonville to clean the moneylook out of her eyes for it would certainly be there he would as soon as possible give her fifty thousand francs he would say to her i propose to call you donatienne or possibly solange because these are names that suit my mood and the evening we knew each other before and you lent me this money because i was in a jam here it is and now we will tell each other what we have been doing since we last met in st tropez just a year ago in the meantime here is the menu and the wine list and you must choose what will make you happy and fat and she would look relieved at not having to try any more and she would laugh and say but james i do not want to be fat and there they would be started on the myth of paris in the spring and bond would stay sober and be interested in her and everything she said and by god by the end of the evening it would not be his fault if it transpired that there was in fact no shred of stuffing left in the hoary old fairytale of a good time in paris sitting in fouquets waiting for his americano bond smiled at his vehemence he knew that he was only playing at this fantasy for the satisfaction of launching a last kick at a town he had cordially disliked since the war since he had not had a happy day in paris it was not that the town had sold its body many towns have done that it was its heart that was gone pawned to the tourists pawned to the russians and roumanians and bulgars pawned to the scum of the world who had gradually taken the town over and of course pawned to the germans you could see it in the peoples eyes sullen envious ashamed architecture bond glanced across the pavement at the shiny black ribbons of cars off which the sun glinted painfully everywhere it was the same as in the champselyses there were only two hours in which you could even see the town between five and seven in the morning after seven it was engulfed in a thundering stream of black metal with which no beautiful buildings no spacious treelined boulevards could compete the waiters tray clattered down on the marbletopped table with a slick onehanded jerk that bond had never been able to copy the waiters bottleopener prised the cap off the perrier the man slipped the tab under the icebucket said a mechanical voil msieur and darted away bond put ice into his drink filled it to the top with soda and took a long pull at it he sat back and lit a laurens jaune of course the evening would be a disaster even supposing he found the girl in the next hour or so the contents would certainly not stand up to the wrapping on closer examination she would turn out to have the heavy dank widepored skin of the bourgeois french the blonde hair under the rakish velvet beret would be brown at the roots and as coarse as piano wire the peppermint on the breath would not conceal the midday garlic the alluring figure would be intricately scaffolded with wire and rubber she would be from lille and she would ask him if he was american and bond smiled to himself she or her maquereau would probably steal his notecase la ronde he would be back where he came in more or less that was well to hell with it a battered black peugeot broke out of the centre stream of traffic cut across the inside line of cars and pulled in to double park at the kerb there was the usual screaming of brakes hooting and yelling quite unmoved a girl got out of the car and leaving the traffic to sort itself out walked purposefully across the sidewalk bond sat up she had everything but absolutely everything that belonged in his fantasy she was tall and although her figure was hidden by a light raincoat the way she moved and the way she held herself promised that it would be beautiful the face had the gaiety and bravado that went with her driving but now there was impatience in the compressed lips and the eyes fretted as she pushed diagonally through the moving crowd on the pavement bond watched her narrowly as she reached the edge of the tables and came up the aisle of course it was hopeless she was coming to meet someone her lover she was the sort of woman who always belongs to somebody else she was late for him thats why she was in such a hurry what damnable luck right down to the long blonde hair under the rakish beret and she was looking straight at him she was smiling before bond could pull himself together the girl had come up to his table and had drawn out a chair and sat down she smiled rather tautly into his startled eyes im sorry im late and im afraid weve got to get moving at once youre wanted at the office she added under her breath crash dive bond jerked himself back to reality whoever she was she was certainly from the firm crash dive was a slang expression the secret service had borrowed from the submarine service it meant bad news the worst bond dug into his pocket and slid some coins over the table he said right lets go and got up and followed her down through the tables and across to her car it was still obstructing the inner lane of traffic any minute now there would be a policeman angry faces glared at them as they climbed in the girl had left the engine running she banged the gears into second and slid out into the traffic bond looked sideways at her the pale skin was velvet the blonde hair was silk to the roots he said where are you from and whats it all about she said concentrating on the traffic from the station grade two assistant number on duty mary ann russell off ive no idea what its all about i just saw the signal from hq personal from m to head of station most immediate and all that he was to find you at once and if necessary use the deuxiљme to help head of f said you always went to the same places when you were in paris and i and another girl were given a list she smiled id only tried harrys bar and after fouquets i was going to start on the restaurants it was marvellous picking you up like that she gave him a quick glance i hope i wasnt very clumsy bond said you were fine how were you going to handle it if id had a girl with me she laughed i was going to do much the same except call you sir i was only worried about how youd dispose of the girl if she started a scene i was going to offer to take her home in my car and for you to take a taxi you sound pretty resourceful how long have you been in the service five years this is my first time with a station how do you like it i like the work all right the evenings and days off drag a bit its not easy to make friends in paris without her mouth turned down with irony without all the rest i mean she hastened to add im not a prude and all that but somehow the french make the whole business such a bore i mean ive had to give up taking the metro or buses whatever time of day it is you end up with your behind black and blue she laughed apart from the boredom of it and not knowing what to say to the man some of the pinches really hurt its the limit so to get around i bought this car cheap and other cars seem to keep out of my way as long as you dont catch the other drivers eye you can take on even the meanest of them theyre afraid you havent seen them and theyre worried by the bashedabout look of the car they give you a wide berth they had come to the rond point as if to demonstrate her theory she tore round it and went straight at the line of traffic coming up from the place de la concorde miraculously it divided and let her through into the avenue matignon bond said pretty good but dont make it a habit there may be some french mary anns about she laughed she turned into the avenue gabrielle and pulled up outside the paris headquarters of the secret service i only try that sort of manouvre in the line of duty bond got out and came round to her side of the car he said well thanks for picking me up when this whirl is over can i pick you up in exchange i dont get the pinches but im just as bored in paris as you are her eyes were blue and wide apart they searched his she said seriously id like that the switchboard here can always find me bond reached in through the window and pressed the hand on the wheel he said good and turned and walked quickly in through the archway wing commander rattray head of station f was a fattish man with pink cheeks and fair hair brushed straight back he dressed in a mannered fashion with turnedback cuffs and double slits to his coat bowties and fancy waistcoats he made a goodliving wineandfoodsociety impression in which only the slow rather cunning blue eyes struck a false note he chainsmoked gauloises and his office stank of them he greeted bond with relief who found you russell at fouquets is she new six months shes a good one but take a pew theres the hell of a flap on and ive got to brief you and get you going he bent to his intercom and pressed down a switch signal to m please personal from head of station located briefing now okay he let go the switch bond pulled a chair over by the open window to keep away from the fog of gauloises the traffic on the champselyses was a soft roar in the background half an hour before he had been fed up with paris glad to be going now he hoped he would be staying head of f said somebody got our dawn dispatchrider from shape to the st germain station yesterday morning the weekly run from the shape intelligence division with the summaries joint intelligence papers iron curtain order of battle all the top gen one shot in the back took his dispatchcase and his wallet and watch bond said thats bad no chance that it was an ordinary holdup or do they think the wallet and watch were cover shape security cant make up their minds on the whole they guess it was cover seven oclock in the mornings a rum time for a holdup but you can argue it out with them when you get down there ms sending you as his personal representative hes worried as hell apart from the loss of the intelligence dope their i people have never liked having one of our stations outside the reservation so to speak for years theyve been trying to get the st germain unit incorporated in the shape intelligence setup but you know what m is independent old devil hes never been happy about nato security why right in the shape intelligence division there are not only a couple of frenchmen and an italian but the head of their counter intelligence and security section is a german bond whistled the trouble is that this damnable business is all shape needs to bring m to heel anyway he says youre to get down there right away ive fixed up clearance for you got the passes youre to report to colonel schreiber headquarters command security branch american efficient chap hes been handling the thing from the beginning as far as i can gather hes already done just about all there was to be done whats he done what actually happened head of f picked up a map from his desk and walked over with it it was the bigscale michelin environs de paris he pointed with a pencil heres versailles and here just north of the park is the big junction of the parismantes and the versailles autoroutes a couple of hundred yards north of that on n is shape every wednesday at seven in the morning a special services dispatchrider leaves shape with the weekly intelligence stuff i told you about he has to get to this little village called fourqueux just outside st germain deliver his stuff to the duty officer at our hq and report back to shape by seventhirty rather than go through all this builtup area for security reasons his orders are to take this n to st nom turn righthanded on to d and go under the autoroute and through the forest of st germain the distance is about twelve kilometres and taking it easy hell do the trip in under a quarter of an hour well yesterday it was a corporal from the corps of signals good solid man called bates and when he hadnt reported back to shape by sevenfortyfive they sent another rider to look for him not a trace and he hadnt reported at our hq by eightfifteen the security branch was on the job and by nine the roadblocks were up the police and the deuxiљme were told and search parties got under way the dogs found him but not till the evening around six and by that time if there had been any clues on the road theyd have been wiped out by the traffic head of f handed the map to bond and walked back to his desk and thats about the lot except that all the usual steps have been taken frontiers ports aerodromes and so forth but that sort of thing wont help if it was a professional job whoever did it could have had the stuff out of the country by midday or into an embassy in paris inside an hour bond said impatiently exactly and so what the hell does m expect me to do tell shape security to do it all over again but better this sort of thing isnt my line at all bloody waste of time head of f smiled sympathetically matter of fact i put much the same point of view to m over the scrambler tactfully the old man was quite reasonable said he wanted to show shape he was taking the business just as seriously as they were you happened to be available and more or less on the spot and he said you had the sort of mind that might pick up the invisible factor i asked him what he meant and he said that at all closely guarded headquarters theres bound to be an invisible man a man everyone takes so much for granted that he just isnt noticed gardener window cleaner postman i said that shape had thought of that and that all those sort of jobs were done by enlisted men m told me not to be so literalminded and hung up bond laughed he could see ms frown and hear the crusty voice he said all right then ill see what i can do who do i report back to here m doesnt want the st germain unit to get involved anything you have to say ill put straight on the printer to london but i may not be available when you call up ill make someone your duty officer and youll be able to get them any time in the twentyfour hours russell can do it she picked you up she might as well carry you suit you yes said bond thatll be all right the battered peugeot commandeered by rattray smelled of her there were bits of her in the glove compartment half a packet of suchard milk chocolate a twist of paper containing bobby pins a paperback john ohara a single black suede glove bond thought about her as far as the etoile and then closed his mind to her and pushed the car along fast through the bois rattray had said it would take about fifteen minutes at fifty bond said to halve the speed and double the time and to tell colonel schreiber that he would be with him by ninethirty after the porte de st cloud there was little traffic and bond held seventy on the autoroute until the second exit road came up on his right and there was the red arrow for shape bond turned up the slope and on to n two hundred yards farther in the centre of the road was the traffic policeman bond had been told to look out for the policeman waved him in through the big gates on the left and he pulled up at the first checkpoint a greyuniformed american policeman hung out of his cabin and glanced at his pass he was told to pull inside and hold it now a french policeman took his pass noted the details on a printed form clipped to a board gave him a large plastic windscreen number and waved him on as bond pulled in to the car park with theatrical suddenness a hundred arclights blazed and lit up the acre of lowlying hutments in front of him as if it was day feeling naked bond walked across the open gravel beneath the flags of the nato countries and ran up the four shallow steps to the wide glass doors that gave entrance to the supreme headquarters allied forces europe now there was the main security desk american and french military police checked his pass and noted the details he was handed over to a redcapped british mp and led off down the main corridor past endless office doors they bore no names but the usual alphabetical abracadabra of all headquarters one said comstrikfltlant and saclant liaison to saceur bond asked what it meant the military policeman either ignorant or more probably securityminded said stolidly couldnt rightly say sir behind a door that said colonel g a schreiber chief of security headquarters command was a ramrodstraight middleaged american with greying hair and the politely negative manner of a bank manager there were several family photographs in silver frames on his desk and a vase containing one white rose there was no smell of tobacco smoke in the room after cautiously amiable preliminaries bond congratulated the colonel on his security he said all these checks and double checks dont make it easy for the opposition have you ever lost anything before or have you ever found signs of a serious attempt at a coup no to both questions commander im quite satisfied about headquarters its only the outlying units that worry me apart from this section of your secret service we have various detached signal units then of course there are the home ministries of fourteen different nations i cant answer for what may leak from those quarters it cant be an easy job agreed bond now about this mess has anything else come up since wing commander rattray spoke to you last got the bullet luger severed the spinal cord probably fired at around thirty yards give or take ten yards assuming our man was riding a straight course the bullet must have been fired from dead astern on a level trajectory since it cant have been a man standing in the road the killer must have been moving in or on some vehicle so your man would have seen him in the drivingmirror probably if your riders find themselves being followed do they have any instructions about taking evasive action the colonel smiled slightly sure theyre told to go like hell and at what speed did your man crash not fast they think between twenty and forty what are you getting at commander i was wondering if youd decided whether it was a pro or an amateur job if your man wasnt trying to get away and assuming he saw the killer in his mirror which i agree is only a probability that suggests that he accepted the man on his tail as friend rather than foe that could mean some sort of disguise that would fit in with the setup here something your man would accept even at that hour of the morning a small frown had been gathering across colonel schreibers smooth forehead commander there was an edge of tension in the voice we have of course been considering every angle of this case including the one you mention at midday yesterday the commanding general declared emergency in this matter standing security and security ops committees were set up and from that moment on every angle every hint of a clue has been systematically run to earth and i can tell you commander the colonel raised one wellmanicured hand and let it descend in soft emphasis on his blottingpad any man who can come up with an even remotely original idea on this case will have to be closely related to einstein there is nothing repeat nothing to go on in this case whatsoever bond smiled sympathetically he got to his feet in that case colonel i wont waste any more of your time this evening if i could just have the minutes of the various meetings to bring myself up to date and if one of your men could show me the way to the canteen and my quarters sure sure the colonel pressed a bell a young crewcutted aide came in proctor show the commander to his room in the vip wing would you and then take him along to the bar and the canteen he turned to bond ill have those papers ready for you after youve had a meal and a drink theyll be in my office they cant be taken out of course but youll find everything to hand next door and proctor will be able to fill you in on anything thats missing he held out his hand okay then well meet again in the morning bond said goodnight and followed the aide out as he walked along the neutralpainted neutralsmelling corridors he reflected that this was probably the most hopeless assignment he had ever been on if the top security brains of fourteen countries were stumped what hope had he got by the time he was in bed that night in the spartan luxury of the visitors overnight quarters bond had decided he would give it a couple more days largely for the sake of keeping in touch with mary ann russell for as long as possible and then chuck it on this decision he fell immediately into a deep and untroubled sleep not two but four days later as the dawn came up over the forest of st germain james bond was lying along the thick branch of an oak tree keeping watch over a small empty glade that lay deep among the trees bordering d the road of the murder he was dressed from head to foot in parachutists camouflage green brown and black even his hands were covered with the stuff and there was a hood over his head with slits cut for the eyes and mouth it was good camouflage which would be still better when the sun was higher and the shadows blacker and from anywhere on the ground even directly below the high branch he could not be seen it had come about like this the first two days at shape had been the expected waste of time bond had achieved nothing except to make himself mildly unpopular with the persistence of his doublechecking questions on the morning of the third day he was about to go and say his goodbyes when he had a telephone call from the colonel oh commander thought id let you know that the last team of police dogs got in late last night your idea that it might be worth while covering the whole forest sorry the voice sounded unsorry but negative absolutely negative oh my fault for the wasted time as much to annoy the colonel as anything bond said mind if i have a talk with the handler sure sure anything you want by the way commander how long are you planning to be around glad to have you with us for as long as you like but its a question of your room seems theres a big party coming in from holland in a few days time top level staff course or something of the kind and admin says theyre a bit pushed for space bond had not expected to get on well with colonel schreiber and he had not done so he said amiably ill see what my chief has to say and call you back colonel do that would you the colonels voice was equally polite but the manners of both men were running out and the two receivers broke the line simultaneously the chief handler was a frenchman from the landes he had the quick sly eyes of a poacher bond met him at the kennels but the handlers proximity was too much for the alsatians and to get away from the noise he took bond into the dutyroom a tiny office with binoculars hanging from pegs and waterproofs gumboots dogharness and other gear stacked round the walls there were a couple of deal chairs and a table covered with a largescale map of the forest of st germain this had been marked off into pencilled squares the handler made a gesture over the map our dogs covered it all monsieur there is nothing there do you mean to say they didnt check once the handler scratched his head we had trouble with a bit of game monsieur there was a hare or two a couple of foxes earths we had quite a time getting them away from a clearing near the carrefour royal they probably still smelled the gipsies oh bond was only mildly interested show me who were these gipsies the handler pointed daintily with a grimy little finger these are the names from the old days here is the etoile parfaite and here where the killing took place is the carrefour des curieux and here forming the bottom of the triangle is the carrefour royal it makes he added dramatically a cross with the road of death he took a pencil out of his pocket and made a dot just off the crossroads and this is the clearing monsieur there was a gipsy caravan there for most of the winter they left last month cleaned the place up all right but for the dogs their scent will hang about there for months bond thanked him and after inspecting and admiring the dogs and making some small talk about the handlers profession he got into the peugeot and went off to the gendarmerie in st germain yes certainly they had known the gipsies real romanylooking fellows hardly spoke a word of french but they had behaved themselves there had been no complaints six men and two women no no one had seen them go one morning they just werent there any more might have been gone a week for all one knew they had chosen an isolated spot bond took the d through the forest when the great autoroute bridge showed up a quarter of a mile ahead over the road bond accelerated and then switched off the engine and coasted silently until he came to the carrefour royal he stopped and got out of the car without a sound and feeling rather foolish softly entered the forest and walked with great circumspection towards where the clearing would be twenty yards inside the trees he came to it he stood in the fringe of bushes and trees and examined it carefully then he walked in and went over it from end to end the clearing was about as big as two tennis courts and floored in thick grass and moss there was one large patch of lilies of the valley and under the bordering trees a scattering of bluebells to one side there was a low mound perhaps a tumulus completely surrounded and covered with brambles and brier roses now thickly in bloom bond walked round this and gazed in among the roots but there was nothing to see except the earthy shape of the mound bond took one last look round and then went to the corner of the clearing that would be nearest to the road here there was easy access through the trees were there traces of a path a slight flattening of the leaves not more than would have been left by the gipsies or last years picnickers on the edge of the road there was a narrow passage between two trees casually bond bent to examine the trunks he stiffened and dropped to a crouch with a fingernail he delicately scraped away a narrow sliver of caked mud it hid a deep scratch in the treetrunk he caught the scraps of mud in his free hand he now spat and moistened the mud and carefully filled up the scratch again there were three camouflaged scratches on one tree and four on the other bond walked quickly out of the trees on to the road his car had stopped on a slight slope leading down under the autoroute bridge although there was some protection from the boom of the traffic on the autoroute bond pushed the car jumped in and only engaged the gears when he was well under the bridge and now bond was back in the clearing above it and he still did not know if his hunch had been right it had been ms dictum that had put him on the scent if it was a scent and the mention of the gipsies it was the gipsies the dogs smelled most of the winter they went last month no complaints one morning they just werent there any more the invisible factor the invisible man the people who are so much part of the background that you dont know if theyre there or not six men and two girls and they hardly spoke a word of french good cover gipsies you could be a foreigner and yet not a foreigner because you were only a gipsy some of them had gone off in the caravan had some of them stayed built themselves a hideout during the winter a secret place from which the hijacking of the top secret dispatches had been the first sortie bond had thought he was building fantasies until he found the scratches the carefully camouflaged scratches on the two trees they were just at the height where if one was carrying any kind of a cycle the pedals might catch against the bark it could all be a pipedream but it was good enough for bond the only question in his mind was whether these people had made a onetimeonly coup or whether they were so confident of their security that they would try again he confided only in station f mary ann russell told him to be careful head of f more constructively ordered his unit at st germain to cooperate bond said goodbye to colonel schreiber and moved to a camp bed in the units hq an anonymous house in an anonymous village back street the unit had provided the camouflage outfit and the four secret service men who ran the unit had happily put themselves under bonds orders they realised as well as bond did that if bond managed to wipe the eye of the whole security machine of shape the secret service would have won a priceless feather in its cap visvis the shape high command and ms worries over the independence of his unit would be gone for ever bond lying along the oak branch smiled to himself private armies private wars how much energy they siphoned off from the common cause how much fire they directed away from the common enemy sixthirty time for breakfast cautiously bonds right hand fumbled in his clothing and came up to the slit of his mouth bond made the glucose tablet last as long as possible and then sucked another his eyes never left the glade the red squirrel that had appeared at first light and had been steadily eating away at young beech shoots ever since ran a few feet nearer to the rosebushes on the mound picked up something and began turning it in his paws and nibbling at it two wood pigeons that had been noisily courting among the thick grass started to make clumsy fluttering love a pair of hedge sparrows went busily on collecting bits and pieces for a nest they were tardily building in a thornbush the fat thrush finally located its worm and began pulling at it its legs braced bees clustered thick among the roses on the mound and from where he was perhaps twenty yards away from and above the mound bond could just hear their summery sound it was a scene from a fairytale the roses the lilies of the valley the birds and the great shafts of sunlight lancing down through the tall trees into the pool of glistening green bond had climbed to his hideout at four in the morning and he had never examined so closely or for so long the transition from night to a glorious day he suddenly felt rather foolish any moment now and some damned bird would come and sit on his head it was the pigeons that gave the first alarm with a loud clatter they took off and dashed into the trees all the birds followed and the squirrel now the glade was quiet except for the soft hum of the bees what had sounded the alarm bonds heart began to thump his eyes hunted quartering the glade for a clue something was moving among the roses it was a tiny movement but an extraordinary one slowly inch by inch a single thorny stem an unnaturally straight and rather thick one was rising through the upper branches it went on rising until it was a clear foot above the bush then it stopped there was a solitary pink rose at the tip of the stem separated from the bush it looked unnatural but only if one happened to have watched the whole process at a casual glance it was a stray stem and nothing else now silently the petals of the rose seemed to swivel and expand the yellow pistils drew aside and sun glinted on a glass lens the size of a shilling the lens seemed to be looking straight at bond but then very very slowly the roseeye began to turn on its stem and continued to turn until the lens was again looking at bond and the whole glade had been minutely surveyed as if satisfied the petals softly swivelled to cover the eye and very slowly the single rose descended to join the others bonds breath came out with a rush he momentarily closed his eyes to rest them gipsies if that piece of machinery was any evidence inside the mound deep down in the earth was certainly the most professional leftbehind spy unit that had ever been devised far more brilliant than anything england had prepared to operate in the wake of a successful german invasion far better than what the germans themselves had left behind in the ardennes a shiver of excitement and anticipation almost of fear ran down bonds spine so he had been right but what was to be the next act now from the direction of the mound came a thin highpitched whine the sound of an electric motor at very high revs the rose bush trembled slightly the bees took off hovered and settled again slowly a jagged fissure formed down the centre of the big bush and smoothly widened now the two halves of the bush were opening like double doors the dark aperture broadened until bond could see the roots of the bush running into the earth on both sides of the opening doorway the whine of machinery was louder and there was a glint of metal from the edges of the curved doors it was like the opening of a hinged easter egg in a moment the two segments stood apart and the two halves of the rose bush still alive with bees were splayed widely open now the inside of the metal caisson that supported the earth and the roots of the bush were naked to the sun there was a glint of pale electric light from the dark aperture between the curved doors the whine of the motor had stopped a head and shoulders appeared and then the rest of the man he climbed softly out and crouched looking sharply round the glade there was a gun a luger in his hand satisfied he turned and gestured into the shaft the head and shoulders of a second man appeared he handed up three pairs of what looked like snowshoes and ducked out of sight the first man selected a pair and knelt and strapped them over his boots now he moved about more freely leaving no footprints for the glass flattened only momentarily under the wide mesh and then rose slowly again bond smiled to himself clever bastards the second man emerged he was followed by a third between them they manhandled a motorcycle out of the shaft and stood holding it slung between them by harness webbing while the first man who was clearly the leader knelt and strapped the snowshoes under their boots then in single file they moved off through the trees towards the road there was something extraordinarily sinister about the way they softly highstepped along through the shadows lifting and carefully placing each big webbed foot in turn bond let out a long sigh of released tension and laid his head softly down on the branch to relax the strain in his neck muscles so that was the score even the last small detail could now be added to the file while the two underlings were dressed in grey overalls the leader was wearing the uniform of the royal corps of signals and his motorcycle was an olive green bsa m with a british army registration number on its petrol tank no wonder the shape dispatchrider had let him get within range and what did the unit do with its top secret booty probably radioed the cream of it out at night instead of the periscope a rosestalk aerial would rise up from the bush the pedal generator would get going deep down under the earth and off would go the highspeed cipher groups ciphers there would be many good enemy secrets down that shaft if bond could round up the unit when it was outside the hideout and what a chance to feed back phoney intelligence to gru the soviet military intelligence apparat which was presumably the control bonds thoughts raced the two underlings were coming back they went into the shaft and the rose bush closed over it the leader with his machine would be among the bushes on the verge of the road bond glanced at his watch sixfiftyfive of course he would be waiting to see if a dispatchrider came along either he did not know the man he had killed was doing a weekly run which was unlikely or he was assuming that shape would now change the routine for additional security these were careful people probably their orders were to clean up as much as possible before the summer came and there were too many holidaymakers about in the forest then the unit might be pulled out and put back again in the winter who could say what the longterm plans were sufficient that the leader was preparing for another kill the minutes ticked by at seventen the leader reappeared he stood in the shadow of a big tree at the edge of the clearing and whistled once on a brief high birdlike note immediately the rose bush began to open and the two underlings came out and followed the leader back into the trees in two minutes they were back with the motorcycle slung between them the leader after a careful look round to see that they had left no traces followed them down into the shaft and the two halves of the rose bush closed swiftly behind him half an hour later life had started up in the glade again an hour later still when the high sun had darkened the shadows james bond silently edged backwards along his branch dropped softly on to a patch of moss behind some brambles and melted carefully back into the forest that evening bonds routine call with mary ann russell was a stormy one she said youre crazy im not going to let you do it im going to get head of f to ring up colonel schreiber and tell him the whole story this is shapes job not yours bond said sharply youll do nothing of the sort colonel schreiber says hes perfectly happy to let me make a dummy run tomorrow morning instead of the duty dispatchrider thats all he needs to know at this stage reconstruction of the crime sort of thing he couldnt care less hes practically closed the file on this business now be a good girl and do as youre told just put my report on the printer to m hell see the point of me cleaning this thing up he wont object damn m damn you damn the whole silly service there were angry tears in the voice youre just a lot of children playing at red indians taking these people on by yourself its its showing off thats all it is showing off bond was beginning to get annoyed he said thats enough mary ann put that report on the printer im sorry but its an order there was resignation in the voice oh all right you dont have to pull your rank on me but dont get hurt at least youll have the boys from the local station to pick up the bits good luck thanks mary ann and will you have dinner with me tomorrow night some place like armenonville pink champagne and gipsy violins paris in the spring routine yes she said seriously id like that but then take care all the more would you please of course i will dont worry goodnight night bond spent the rest of the evening putting a last high polish on his plans and giving a final briefing to the four men from the station it was another beautiful day bond sitting comfortably astride the throbbing bsa waiting for the off could hardly believe in the ambush that would now be waiting for him just beyond the carrefour royal the corporal from the signal corps who had handed him his empty dispatchcase and was about to give him the signal to go said you look as if youd been in the royal corps all your life sir time for a haircut soon id say but the uniforms bang on how dyou like the bike sir goes like a dream id forgotten what fun these damned things are give me a nice little austin a any day sir the corporal looked at his watch seven oclock just coming up he held up his thumb okay bond pulled the goggles down over his eyes lifted a hand to the corporal kicked the machine into gear and wheeled off across the gravel and through the main gates off and on to through bailly and noisyleroi and there was the straggle of st nom here he would be turning sharp right on to d the route de la mort as the handler had called it bond pulled into the grass verge and once more looked to the longbarrel colt he put the warm gun back against his stomach and left the jacket button undone on your marks get set bond took the sharp corner and accelerated up to fifty the viaduct carrying the paris autoroute loomed up ahead the dark mouth of the tunnel beneath it opened and swallowed him the noise of his exhaust was gigantic and for an instant there was a tunnel smell of cold and damp then he was out in the sunshine again and immediately across the carrefour royal ahead the oily tarmac glittered dead straight for two miles through the enchanted forest and there was a sweet smell of leaves and dew bond cut his speed to forty the drivingmirror by his left hand shivered slightly with his speed it showed nothing but an empty unfurling vista of road between lines of trees that curled away behind him like a green wake no sign of the killer had he taken fright had there been some hitch but then there was a tiny black speck in the centre of the convex glass a midge that became a fly and then a bee and then a beetle now it was a crash helmet bent low over handlebars between two big black paws god he was coming fast bonds eyes flickered from the mirror to the road ahead and back to the mirror when the killers right hand went for his gun bond slowed thirtyfive thirty twenty ahead the tarmac was smooth as metal a last quick look in the mirror the right hand had left the handlebars the sun on the mans goggles made huge fiery eyes below the rim of the crash helmet now bond braked fiercely and skidded the bsa through fortyfive degrees killing the engine he was not quite quick enough on the draw the killers gun flared twice and a bullet tore into the saddlesprings beside bonds thigh but then the colt spoke its single word and the killer and his bsa as if lassoed from within the forest veered crazily off the road leapt the ditch and crashed headon into the trunk of a beech for a moment the tangle of man and machinery clung to the broad trunk and then with a metallic deathrattle toppled backwards into the grass bond got off his machine and walked over to the ugly twist of khaki and smoking steel there was no need to feel for a pulse wherever the bullet had struck the crash helmet had smashed like an eggshell bond turned away and thrust his gun back into the front of his tunic he had been lucky it would not do to press his luck he got on the bsa and accelerated back down the road he leant the bsa up against one of the scarred trees just inside the forest and walked softly through to the edge of the clearing he took up his stand in the shadow of the big beech he moistened his lips and gave as near as he could the killers birdwhistle he waited had he got the whistle wrong but then the bush trembled and the high thin whine began bond hooked his right thumb through his belt within inches of his gunbutt he hoped he would not have to do any more killing the two underlings had not seemed to be armed with any luck they would come quietly now the curved doors were open from where he was bond could not see down the shaft but within seconds the first man was out and putting on his snowshoes and the second followed snowshoes bonds heart missed a beat he had forgotten them they must be hidden back there in the bushes blasted fool would they notice the two men came slowly towards him delicately placing their feet when he was about twenty feet away the leading man said something softly in what sounded like russian when bond did not reply the two men stopped in their tracks they stared at him in astonishment waiting perhaps for the answer to a password bond sensed trouble he whipped out his gun and moved towards them crouching hands up he gestured with the muzzle of the colt the leading man shouted an order and threw himself forward at the same time the second man made a dash back towards the hideout a rifle boomed from among the trees and the mans right leg buckled under him the men from the station broke cover and came running bond fell to one knee and clubbed upwards with his gunbarrel at the hurtling body it made contact but then the man was on him bond saw fingernails flashing towards his eyes ducked and ran into an uppercut now a hand was at his right wrist and his gun was being slowly turned on him not wanting to kill he had kept the safety catch up he tried to get his thumb to it a boot hit him in the side of the head and he let the gun go and fell back through a red mist he saw the muzzle of the gun pointing at his face the thought flashed through his mind that he was going to die die for showing mercy suddenly the gun muzzle had gone and the weight of the man was off him bond got to his knees and then to his feet the body spreadeagled in the grass beside him gave a last kick there were bloody rents in the back of the dungarees bond looked round the four men from the station were in a group bond undid the strap of his crash helmet and rubbed the side of his head he said well thanks who did it nobody answered the men looked embarrassed bond walked towards them puzzled whats up suddenly bond caught a trace of movement behind the men an extra leg showed a womans leg bond laughed out loud the men grinned sheepishly and looked behind them mary ann russell in a brown shirt and black jeans came out from behind them with her hands up one of the hands held what looked like a target pistol she brought her hands down and tucked the pistol into the top of her jeans she came up to bond she said anxiously you wont blame anybody will you i just wouldnt let them leave this morning without me her eyes pleaded rather lucky i did come really i mean i just happened to get to you first no one wanted to shoot for fear of hitting you bond smiled into her eyes he said if you hadnt come id have had to break that dinner date he turned back to the men his voice businesslike all right one of you take the motorbike and report the gist of this to colonel schreiber say were waiting for his team before we take a look at the hideout and would he include a couple of antisabotage men that shaft may be boobytrapped all right bond took the girl by the arm he said come over here i want to show you a birds nest is that an order yes for your eyes only the most beautiful bird in jamaica and some say the most beautiful bird in the world is the streamertail or doctor hummingbird the cock bird is about nine inches long but seven inches of it are tail two long black feathers that curve and cross each other and whose inner edges are in a form of scalloped design the head and crest are black the wings dark green the long bill is scarlet and the eyes bright and confiding are black the body is emerald green so dazzling that when the sun is on the breast you see the brightest green thing in nature in jamaica birds that are loved are given nicknames trochilus polytmus is called doctor bird because his two black streamers remind people of the black tailcoat of the oldtime physician mrs havelock was particularly devoted to two families of these birds because she had been watching them sipping honey fighting nesting and making love since she married and came to content she was now over fifty so many generations of these two families had come and gone since the original two pairs had been nicknamed pyramus and thisbe and daphnis and chloe by her motherinlaw but successive couples had kept the names and mrs havelock now sat at her elegant tea service on the broad cool veranda and watched pyramus with a fierce teeteetee divebomb daphnis who had finished up the honey on his own huge bush of japanese hat and had sneaked in among the neighbouring monkeyfiddle that was pyramuss preserve the two tiny black and green comets swirled away across the fine acres of lawn dotted with brilliant clumps of hibiscus and bougainvillaea until they were lost to sight in the citrus groves they would soon be back the running battle between the two families was a game in this big finely planted garden there was enough honey for all mrs havelock put down her teacup and took a patum peperium sandwich she said they really are the most dreadful showoffs colonel havelock looked over the top of his daily gleaner who pyramus and daphnis oh yes colonel havelock thought the names idiotic he said it looks to me as if batista will be on the run soon castros keeping up the pressure pretty well chap at barclays told me this morning that theres a lot of funk money coming over here already said that belairs been sold to nominees one hundred and fifty thousand pounds for a thousand acres of cattletick and a house the red antsll have down by christmas somebodys suddenly gone and bought that ghastly blue harbour hotel and theres even talk that jimmy farquharson has found a buyer for his place leafspot and panama disease thrown in for good measure i suppose thatll be nice for ursula the poor dear cant stand it out here but i cant say i like the idea of the whole island being bought up by these cubans but tim where do they get all the money from anyway rackets union funds government money god knows the place is riddled with crooks and gangsters they must want to get their money out of cuba and into something else quick jamaicas as good as anywhere else now weve got this convertibility with the dollar apparently the man who bought belair just shovelled the money on to the floor of aschenheims office out of a suitcase i suppose hell keep the place for a year or two and when the troubles blown over or when castros got in and finished cleaning up hell put it on the market again take a reasonable loss and move off somewhere else pity in a way belair used to be a fine property it could have been brought back if anyone in the family had cared it was ten thousand acres in bills grandfathers day it used to take the busher three days to ride the boundary fat lot bill cares i bet hes booked his passage to london already thats one more of the old families gone soon wont be anyone left of that lot but us thank god judy likes the place mrs havelock said yes dear calmingly and pinged the bell for the tea things to be cleared away agatha a huge blueblack negress wearing the oldfashioned white headcloth that has gone out in jamaica except in the hinterland came out through the white and rose drawingroom followed by fayprince a pretty young quadroon from port maria whom she was training as second housemaid mrs havelock said its time we started bottling agatha the guavas are early this year agathas face was impassive she said yesm but we done need more bottles why it was only last year i got you two dozen of the best i could find at henriques yesm someone done mash five six of dose oh dear how did that happen couldnt saym agatha picked up the big silver tray and waited watching mrs havelocks face mrs havelock had not lived most of her life in jamaica without learning that a mash is a mash and that one would not get anywhere hunting for a culprit so she just said cheerfully oh all right agatha ill get some more when i go into kingston yesm agatha followed by the young girl went back into the house mrs havelock picked up a piece of petitpoint and began stitching her fingers moving automatically her eyes went back to the big bushes of japanese hat and monkeyfiddle yes the two male birds were back with gracefully cocked tails they moved among the flowers the sun was low on the horizon and every now and then there was a flash of almost piercingly beautiful green a mockingbird on the topmost branch of a frangipani started on its evening repertoire the tinkle of an early treefrog announced the beginning of the short violet dusk content twenty thousand acres in the foothills of candlefly peak one of the most easterly of the blue mountains in the county of portland had been given to an early havelock by oliver cromwell as a reward for having been one of the signatories to king charless death warrant unlike so many other settlers of those and later times the havelocks had maintained the plantation through three centuries through earthquakes and hurricanes and through the boom and bust of cocoa sugar citrus and copra now it was in bananas and cattle and it was one of the richest and best run of all the private estates in the island the house patched up or rebuilt after earthquake or hurricane was a hybrid a mahoganypillared twostoreyed central block on the old stone foundations flanked by two singlestoreyed wings with widely overhung flatpitched jamaican roofs of silver cedar shingles the havelocks were now sitting on the deep veranda of the central block facing the gently sloping garden beyond which a vast tumbling jungle vista stretched away twenty miles to the sea colonel havelock put down his gleaner i thought i heard a car mrs havelock said firmly if its those ghastly feddens from port antonio youve simply got to get rid of them i cant stand any more of their moans about england and last time they were both quite drunk when they left and dinner was cold she got up quickly im going to tell agatha to say ive got a migraine agatha came out through the drawingroom door she looked fussed she was followed closely by three men she said hurriedly gemmun from kingstonm to see de colonel the leading man slid past the housekeeper he was still wearing his hat a panama with a short very upcurled brim he took this off with his left hand and held it against his stomach the rays of the sun glittered on hairgrease and on a mouthful of smiling white teeth he went up to colonel havelock his outstretched hand held straight in front of him major gonzales from havana pleased to meet you colonel the accent was the sham american of a jamaican taxidriver colonel havelock had got to his feet he touched the outstretched hand briefly he looked over the majors shoulder at the other two men who had stationed themselves on either side of the door they were both carrying that new holdall of the tropics a pan american overnight bag the bags looked heavy now the two men bent down together and placed them beside their yellowish shoes they straightened themselves they wore flat white caps with transparent green visors that cast green shadows down to their cheekbones through the green shadows their intelligent animal eyes fixed themselves on the major reading his behaviour they are my secretaries colonel havelock took a pipe out of his pocket and began to fill it his direct blue eyes took in the sharp clothes the natty shoes the glistening fingernails of the major and the blue jeans and calypso shirts of the other two he wondered how he could get these men into his study and near the revolver in the top drawer of his desk he said what can i do for you as he lit his pipe he watched the majors eyes and mouth through the smoke major gonzales spread his hands the width of his smile remained constant the liquid almost golden eyes were amused friendly it is a matter of business colonel i represent a certain gentleman in havana he made a throwaway gesture with his right hand a powerful gentleman a very fine guy major gonzales assumed an expression of sincerity you would like him colonel he asked me to present his compliments and to inquire the price of your property mrs havelock who had been watching the scene with a polite halfsmile on her lips moved to stand beside her husband she said kindly so as not to embarrass the poor man what a shame major all this way on these dusty roads your friend really should have written first or asked anyone in kingston or at government house you see my husbands family have lived here for nearly three hundred years she looked at him sweetly apologetically im afraid there just isnt any question of selling content there never has been i wonder where your important friend can possibly have got the idea from major gonzales bowed briefly his smiling face turned back to colonel havelock he said as if mrs havelock had not opened her mouth my gentleman is told this is one of the finest estancias in jamaica he is a most generous man you may mention any sum that is reasonable colonel havelock said firmly you heard what mrs havelock said the property is not for sale major gonzales laughed it sounded quite genuine laughter he shook his head as if he was explaining something to a rather dense child you misunderstand me colonel my gentleman desires this property and no other property in jamaica he has some funds some extra funds to invest these funds are seeking a home in jamaica my gentleman wishes this to be their home colonel havelock said patiently i quite understand major and i am so sorry you have wasted your time content will never be for sale in my lifetime and now if youll forgive me my wife and i always dine early and you have a long way to go he made a gesture to the left along the veranda i think youll find this is the quickest way to your car let me show you colonel havelock moved invitingly but when major gonzales stayed where he was he stopped the blue eyes began to freeze there was perhaps one less tooth in major gonzaless smile and his eyes had become watchful but his manner was still jolly he said cheerfully just one moment colonel he issued a curt order over his shoulder both the havelocks noticed the jolly mask slip with the few sharp words through the teeth for the first time mrs havelock looked slightly uncertain she moved still closer to her husband the two men picked up their blue pan american bags and stepped forward major gonzales reached for the zipper on each of them in turn and pulled the taut mouths sprang open the bags were full to the brim with neat solid wads of american money major gonzales spread his arms all hundred dollar bills all genuine half a million dollars that is in your money let us say one hundred and eighty thousand pounds a small fortune there are many other good places to live in the world colonel and perhaps my gentleman would add a further twenty thousand pounds to make the round sum you would know in a week all i need is half a sheet of paper with your signature the lawyers can do the rest now colonel the smile was winning shall we say yes and shake hands on it then the bags stay here and we leave you to your dinner the havelocks now looked at the major with the same expression a mixture of anger and disgust one could imagine mrs havelock telling the story next day such a common greasy little man and those filthy plastic bags full of money timmy was wonderful he just told him to get out and take the dirty stuff away with him colonel havelocks mouth turned down with distaste he said i thought i had made myself clear major the property is not for sale at any price and i do not share the popular thirst for american dollars i must now ask you to leave colonel havelock laid his cold pipe on the table as if he was preparing to roll up his sleeves for the first time major gonzaless smile lost its warmth the mouth continued to grin but it was now shaped in an angry grimace the liquid golden eyes were suddenly brassy and hard he said softly colonel it is i who have not made myself clear not you my gentleman has instructed me to say that if you will not accept his most generous terms we must proceed to other measures mrs havelock was suddenly afraid she put her hand on colonel havelocks arm and pressed it hard he put his hand over hers in reassurance he said through tight lips please leave us alone and go major otherwise i shall communicate with the police the pink tip of major gonzaless tongue came out and slowly licked along his lips all the light had gone out of his face and it had become taut and hard he said harshly so the property is not for sale in your lifetime colonel is that your last word his right hand went behind his back and he clicked his fingers softly once behind him the gunhands of the two men slid through the opening of their gay shirts above the waistbands the sharp animal eyes watched the majors fingers behind his back mrs havelocks hand went up to her mouth colonel havelock tried to say yes but his mouth was dry he swallowed noisily he could not believe it this mangy cuban crook must be bluffing he managed to say thickly yes it is major gonzales nodded curtly in that case colonel my gentleman will carry on the negotiations with the next owner with your daughter the fingers clicked major gonzales stepped to one side to give a clear field of fire the brown monkeyhands came out from under the gay shirts the ugly sausageshaped hunks of metal spat and thudded again and again even when the two bodies were on their way to the ground major gonzales bent down and verified where the bullets had hit then the three small men walked quickly back through the rose and white drawingroom and across the dark carved mahogany hall and out through the elegant front door they climbed unhurriedly into a black ford consul sedan with jamaican number plates and with major gonzales driving and the two gunmen sitting upright in the back seat they drove off at an easy pace down the long avenue of royal palms at the junction of the drive and the road to port antonio the cut telephone wires hung down through the trees like bright lianas major gonzales slalomed the car carefully and expertly down the rough parochial road until he was on the metalled strip near the coast then he put on speed twenty minutes after the killing he came to the outer sprawl of the little banana port there he ran the stolen car on to the grass verge beside the road and the three men got out and walked the quarter of a mile through the sparsely lit main street to the banana wharves the speedboat was waiting its exhaust bubbling the three men got in and the boat zoomed off across the still waters of what an american poetess has called the most beautiful harbour in the world the anchor chain was already half up on the glittering fiftyton chriscraft she was flying the stars and stripes the two graceful antennae of the deepsea rods explained that these were tourists from kingston perhaps or from montego bay the three men went on board and the speedboat was swung in two canoes were circling begging major gonzales tossed a fiftycent piece to each of them and the stripped men dived the twin diesels awoke to a stuttering roar and the chriscraft settled her stern down a fraction and made for the deep channel below the titchfield hotel by dawn she would be back in havana the fishermen and wharfingers ashore watched her go and went on with their argument as to which of the filmstars holidaying in jamaica this could have been up on the broad veranda of content the last rays of the sun glittered on the red stains one of the doctor birds whirred over the balustrade and hovered close above mrs havelocks heart looking down no this was not for him he flirted gaily off to his roostingperch among the closing hibiscus there came the sound of someone in a small sports car making a racing change at the bend of the drive if mrs havelock had been alive she would have been getting ready to say judy im always telling you not to do that on the corner it scatters gravel all over the lawn and you know how it ruins joshuas lawnmower it was a month later in london october had begun with a week of brilliant indian summer and the noise of the mowers came up from regents park and in through the wide open windows of ms office they were motormowers and james bond reflected that one of the most beautiful noises of summer the drowsy iron song of the old machines was going for ever from the world perhaps today children felt the same about the puff and chatter of the little twostroke engines at least the cut grass would smell the same bond had time for these reflections because m seemed to be having difficulty in coming to the point bond had been asked if he had anything on at the moment and he had replied happily that he hadnt and had waited for pandoras box to be opened for him he was mildly intrigued because m had addressed him as james and not by his number this was unusual during duty hours it sounded as if there might be some personal angle to this assignment as if it might be put to him more as a request than as an order and it seemed to bond that there was an extra small cleft of worry between the frosty damnably clear grey eyes and three minutes was certainly too long to spend getting a pipe going m swivelled his chair round square with the desk and flung the box of matches down so that it skidded across the red leather top towards bond bond fielded it and skidded it politely back to the middle of the desk m smiled briefly he seemed to make up his mind he said mildly james has it ever occurred to you that every man in the fleet knows what to do except the commanding admiral bond frowned he said it hadnt occurred to me sir but i see what you mean the rest only have to carry out orders the admiral has to decide on the orders i suppose its the same as saying that supreme command is the loneliest post there is m jerked his pipe sideways same sort of idea someones got to be tough someones got to decide in the end if you send a havering signal to the admiralty you deserve to be put on the beach some people are religious pass the decision on to god ms eyes were defensive i used to try that sometimes in the service but he always passed the buck back again told me to get on and make up my own mind good for one i suppose but tough trouble is very few people keep tough after about forty theyve been knocked about by life had troubles tragedies illnesses these things soften you up m looked sharply at bond hows your coefficient of toughness james you havent got to the dangerous age yet bond didnt like personal questions he didnt know what to answer nor what the truth was he had not got a wife or children had never suffered the tragedy of a personal loss he had not had to stand up to blindness or a mortal disease he had absolutely no idea how he would face these things that needed so much more toughness than he had ever had to show he said hesitantly i suppose i can stand most things if i have to and if i think its right sir i mean he did not like using such words if the cause is er sort of just sir he went on feeling ashamed at himself for throwing the ball back at m of course its not easy to know what is just and what isnt i suppose i assume that when im given an unpleasant job in the service the cause is a just one dammit ms eyes glittered impatiently thats just what i mean you rely on me you wont take any damned responsibility yourself he thrust the stem of his pipe towards his chest im the one who has to do that im the one who has to decide if a thing is right or not the anger died out of the eyes the grim mouth bent sourly he said gloomily oh well i suppose its what im paid for somebodys got to drive the bloody train m put his pipe back in his mouth and drew on it deeply to relieve his feelings now bond felt sorry for m he had never before heard m use as strong a word as bloody nor had m ever given a member of his staff any hint that he felt the weight of the burden he was carrying and had carried ever since he had thrown up the certain prospect of becoming fifth sea lord in order to take over the secret service m had got himself a problem bond wondered what it was it would not be concerned with danger if m could get the odds more or less right he would risk anything anywhere in the world it would not be political m did not give a damn for the susceptibilities of any ministry and thought nothing of going behind their backs to get a personal ruling from the prime minister it might be moral it might be personal bond said is there anything i can help over sir m looked briefly thoughtfully at bond and then swivelled his chair so that he could look out of the window at the high summery clouds he said abruptly do you remember the havelock case only what i read in the papers sir elderly couple in jamaica the daughter came home one night and found them full of bullets there was some talk of gangsters from havana the housekeeper said three men had called in a car she thought they might have been cubans it turned out the car had been stolen a yacht had sailed from the local harbour that night but as far as i remember the police didnt get anywhere thats all sir i havent seen any signals passing on the case m said gruffly you wouldnt have theyve been personal to me we werent asked to handle the case just happens m cleared his throat this private use of the service was on his conscience i knew the havelocks matter of fact i was best man at their wedding malta nineteentwentyfive i see sir thats bad m said shortly nice people anyway i told station c to look into it they didnt get anywhere with the batista people but weve got a good man with the other side with this chap castro and castros intelligence people seem to have the government pretty well penetrated i got the whole story a couple of weeks ago it boils down to the fact that a man called hammerstein or von hammerstein had the couple killed there are a lot of germans well dug in in these banana republics theyre nazis who got out of the net at the end of the war this ones exgestapo he got a job as head of batistas counter intelligence made a packet of money out of extortion and blackmail and protection he was set up for life until castros lot began to make headway he was one of the first to start easing himself out he cut one of his officers in on his loot a man called gonzales and this man travelled around the caribbean with a couple of gunmen to protect him and began salting away hammersteins money outside cuba put it in real estate and suchlike under nominees only bought the best but at top prices hammerstein could afford them when money didnt work hed use force kidnap a child burn down a few acres anything to make the owner see reason well this man hammerstein heard of the havelocks property one of the best in jamaica and he told gonzales to go and get it i suppose his orders were to kill the havelocks if they wouldnt sell and then put pressure on the daughter theres a daughter by the way should be about twentyfive by now never seen her myself anyway thats what happened they killed the havelocks then two weeks ago batista sacked hammerstein may have got to hear about one of these jobs i dont know but anyway hammerstein cleared out and took his little team of three with him timed things pretty well i should say it looks as if castro may get in this winter if he keeps the pressure up bond said softly where have they gone to america right up in the north of vermont up against the canadian border those sort of men like being close to frontiers place called echo lake its some kind of a millionaires ranch hes rented looks pretty from the photographs tucked away in the mountains with this little lake in the grounds hes certainly chosen himself somewhere where he wont be troubled with visitors how did you get on to this sir i sent a report of the whole case to edgar hoover he knew of the man i guessed he would hes had a lot of trouble with this gunrunning from miami to castro and hes been interested in havana ever since the big american gangster money started following the casinos there he said that hammerstein and his party had come into the states on six months visitors visas he was very helpful wanted to know if id got enough to build up a case on did i want these men extradited for trial in jamaica i talked it over here with the attorney general and he said there wasnt a hope unless we could get the witnesses from havana theres no chance of that it was only through castros intelligence that we even know as much as we do officially the cubans wont raise a finger next hoover offered to have their visas revoked and get them on the move again i thanked him and said no and we left it at that m sat for a moment in silence his pipe had died and he relit it he went on i decided to have a talk with our friends the mounties i got on to the commissioner on the scrambler hes never let me down yet he strayed one of his frontier patrol planes over the border and took a full aerial survey of this echo lake place said that if i wanted any other cooperation hed provide it and now m slowly swivelled his chair back square with the desk ive got to decide what to do next now bond realised why m was troubled why he wanted someone else to make the decision because these had been friends of m because a personal element was involved m had worked on the case by himself and now it had come to the point when justice ought to be done and these people brought to book but m was thinking is this justice or is it revenge no judge would take a murder case in which he had personally known the murdered person m wanted someone else bond to deliver judgement there were no doubts in bonds mind he didnt know the havelocks or care who they were hammerstein had operated the law of the jungle on two defenceless old people since no other law was available the law of the jungle should be visited upon hammerstein in no other way could justice be done if it was revenge it was the revenge of the community bond said i wouldnt hesitate for a minute sir if foreign gangsters find they can get away with this kind of thing theyll decide the english are as soft as some other people seem to think we are this is a case for rough justice an eye for an eye m went on looking at bond he gave no encouragement made no comment bond said these people cant be hung sir but they ought to be killed ms eyes ceased to focus on bond for a moment they were blank looking inward then he slowly reached for the top drawer of his desk on the lefthand side pulled it open and extracted a thin file without the usual title across it and without the topsecret red star he placed the file squarely in front of him and his hand rummaged again in the open drawer the hand brought out a rubber stamp and a redink pad m opened the pad tamped the rubber stamp on it and then carefully so that it was properly aligned with the top righthand corner of the docket pressed it down on the grey cover m replaced the stamp and the ink pad in the drawer and closed the drawer he turned the docket round and pushed it gently across the desk to bond the red sansserif letters still damp said for your eyes only bond said nothing he nodded and picked up the docket and walked out of the room two days later bond took the friday comet to montreal he did not care for it it flew too high and too fast and there were too many passengers he regretted the days of the old stratocruiser that fine lumbering old plane that took ten hours to cross the atlantic then one had been able to have dinner in peace sleep for seven hours in a comfortable bunk and get up in time to wander down to the lower deck and have that ridiculous boac country house breakfast while the dawn came up and flooded the cabin with the first bright gold of the western hemisphere now it was all too quick the stewards had to serve everything almost at the double and then one had a bare two hours snooze before the hundredmilelong descent from forty thousand feet only eight hours after leaving london bond was driving a hertz udrive plymouth saloon along the broad route from montreal to ottawa and trying to remember to keep on the right of the road the headquarters of the royal canadian mounted police are in the department of justice alongside parliament buildings in ottawa like most canadian public buildings the department of justice is a massive block of grey masonry built to look stodgily important and to withstand the long and hard winters bond had been told to ask at the front desk for the commissioner and to give his name as mr james he did so and a young freshfaced rcmp corporal who looked as if he did not like being kept indoors on a warm sunny day took him up in the lift to the third floor and handed him over to a sergeant in a large tidy office which contained two girl secretaries and a lot of heavy furniture the sergeant spoke on an intercom and there was a ten minutes delay during which bond smoked and read a recruiting pamphlet which made the mounties sound like a mixture between a dude ranch dick tracy and rose marie when he was shown in through the connecting door a tall youngish man in a dark blue suit white shirt and black tie turned away from the window and came towards him mr james the man smiled thinly im colonel lets say er johns they shook hands come along and sit down the commissioners very sorry not to be here to welcome you himself he has a bad cold you know one of those diplomatic ones colonel johns looked amused thought it might be best to take the day off im just one of the help ive been on one or two hunting trips myself and the commissioner fixed on me to handle this little holiday of yours the colonel paused on me only right bond smiled the commissioner was glad to help but he was going to handle this with kid gloves there would be no comeback on his office bond thought he must be a careful and very sensible man he said i quite understand my friends in london didnt want the commissioner to bother himself personally with any of this and i havent seen the commissioner or been anywhere near his headquarters that being so can we talk english for ten minutes or so just between the two of us colonel johns laughed sure i was told to make that little speech and then get down to business you understand commander that you and i are about to connive at various felonies starting with obtaining a canadian hunting licence under false pretences and being an accessory to a breach of the frontier laws and going on down from there to more serious things it wouldnt do anyone one bit of good to have any ricochets from this little lot get me thats how my friends feel too when i go out of here well forget each other and if i end up in singsing thats my worry well now colonel johns opened a drawer in the desk and took out a bulging file and opened it the top document was a list he put his pencil on the first item and looked across at bond he ran his eye over bonds old black and white houndstooth tweed suit and white shirt and thin black tie he said clothes he unclipped a plain sheet of paper from the file and slid it across the desk this is a list of what i reckon youll need and the address of a big secondhand clothing store here in the city nothing fancy nothing conspicuous khaki shirt dark brown jeans good climbing boots or shoes see theyre comfortable and theres the address of a chemist for walnut stain buy a gallon and give yourself a bath in the stuff there are plenty of browns in the hills at this time and you wont want to be wearing parachute cloth or anything that smells of camouflage right if youre picked up youre an englishman on a hunting trip in canada whos lost his way and got across the border by mistake rifle went down myself and put it in the boot of your plymouth while you were waiting one of the new savage fs weatherby x scope fiveshot repeater with twenty rounds of highvelocity lightest big game lever action on the market only six and a half pounds belongs to a friend glad to have it back one day but he wont miss it if it doesnt turn up its been tested and its okay up to five hundred gun licence colonel johns slid it over issued here in the city in your real name as that fits with your passport hunting licence ditto but small game only vermin as it isnt quite the deer season yet also driving licence to replace the provisional one i had waiting for you with the hertz people haversack compass used ones in the boot of your car oh by the way colonel johns looked up from his list you carrying a personal gun yes walther ppk in a burns martin holster right give me the number ive got a blank licence here if that gets back to me its quite okay ive got a story for it bond took out his gun and read off the number colonel johns filled in the form and pushed it over now then maps heres a local esso map thats all you need to get you to the area colonel johns got up and walked round with the map to bond and spread it out you take this route back to montreal get on to over the bridge at st annes and then over the river again on to follow on down to pike river get on at stanbridge turn right in stanbridge for frelighsburg and leave the car in a garage there good roads all the way whole trip shouldnt take you more than five hours including stops okay now this is where youve got to get things right make it that you get to frelighsburg around three am garagehandll be half asleep and youll be able to get the gear out of the boot and move off without him noticing even if you were a doubleheaded chinaman colonel johns went back to his chair and took two more pieces of paper off the file the first was a scrap of pencilled map the other a section of aerial photograph he said looking seriously at bond now here are the only inflammable things youll be carrying and ive got to rely on you getting rid of them just as soon as theyve been used or at once if theres a chance of you getting into trouble this he pushed the paper over is a rough sketch of an old smuggling route from prohibition days its not used now or i wouldnt recommend it colonel johns smiled sourly you might find some rough customers coming over in the opposite direction and theyre apt to shoot and not even ask questions afterwards crooks druggers whiteslavers but nowadays they mostly travel up by viscount this route was used for runners between franklin just over the derby line and frelighsburg you follow this path through the foothills and you detour franklin and get into the start of the green mountains there its all vermont spruce and pine with a bit of maple and you can stay inside that stuff for months and not see a soul you get across country here over a couple of highways and you leave enosburg falls to the west then youre over a steep range and down into the top of the valley you want the cross is echo lake and judging from the photographs id be inclined to come down on top of it from the east got it whats the distance about ten miles ten and a half take you about three hours from frelighsburg if you dont lose your way so youll be in sight of the place around six and have about an hours light to help you over the last stretch colonel johns pushed over the square of aerial photograph it was a central cut from the one bond had seen in london it showed a long low range of wellkept buildings made of cut stone the roofs were of slate and there was a glimpse of graceful bow windows and a covered patio a dust road ran past the front door and on this side were garages and what appeared to be kennels on the garden side was a stone flagged terrace with a flowered border and beyond this two or three acres of trim lawn stretched down to the edge of the small lake the lake appeared to have been artificially created with a deep stone dam there was a group of wroughtiron garden furniture where the dam wall left the bank and halfway along the wall a divingboard and a ladder to climb out of the lake beyond the lake the forest rose steeply up it was from this side that colonel johns suggested an approach there were no people in the photograph but on the stone flags in front of the patio was a quantity of expensivelooking aluminium garden furniture and a central glass table with drinks bond remembered that the larger photograph had shown a tennis court in the garden and on the other side of the road the trim white fences and grazing horses of a stud farm echo lake looked what it was the luxurious retreat in deep country well away from atom bomb targets of a millionaire who liked privacy and could probably offset a lot of his running expenses against the stud farm and an occasional good let it would be an admirable refuge for a man who had had ten steamy years of caribbean politics and who needed a rest to recharge his batteries the lake was also convenient for washing blood off hands colonel johns closed his now empty file and tore the typewritten list into small fragments and dropped them in the wastepaper basket the two men got to their feet colonel johns took bond to the door and held out his hand he said well i guess thats all id give a lot to come with you talking about all this has reminded me of one or two sniping jobs at the end of the war i was in the army then we were under monty in eighth corps on the left of the line in the ardennes it was much the same sort of country as youll be using only different trees but you know how it is in these police jobs plenty of paper work and keep your nose clean for the pension well so long and the best of luck no doubt ill read all about it in the papers he smiled whichever way it goes bond thanked him and shook him by the hand a last question occurred to him he said by the way is the savage single pull or double i wont have a chance of finding out and there may not be much time for experimenting when the target shows single pull and its a hairtrigger keep your finger off until youre sure youve got him and keep outside three hundred if you can i guess these men are pretty good themselves dont get too close he reached for the door handle his other hand went to bonds shoulder our commissioners got a motto never send a man where you can send a bullet you might remember that so long commander bond spent the night and most of the next day at the kozee motor court outside montreal he paid in advance for three nights he passed the day looking to his equipment and wearing in the soft ripple rubber climbing boots he had bought in ottawa he bought glucose tablets and some smoked ham and bread from which he made himself sandwiches he also bought a large aluminium flask and filled this with threequarters bourbon and a quarter coffee when darkness came he had dinner and a short sleep and then diluted the walnut stain and washed himself all over with the stuff even to the roots of his hair he came out looking like a red indian with bluegrey eyes just before midnight he quietly opened the side door into the automobile bay got into the plymouth and drove off on the last lap south to frelighsburg the man at the allnight garage was not as sleepy as colonel johns had said he would be goin huntin mister you can get far in north america with laconic grunts huh hun and hi in their various modulations together with sure guess so that so and nuts will meet almost any contingency bond slinging the strap of his rifle over his shoulder said hun man got a fine beaver over by highgate springs saturday bond said indifferently that so paid for two nights and walked out of the garage he had stopped on the far side of the town and now he only had to follow the highway for a hundred yards before he found the dirt track running off into the woods on his right after half an hour the track petered out at a brokendown farmhouse a chained dog set up a frenzied barking but no light showed in the farmhouse and bond skirted it and at once found the path by the stream he was to follow this for three miles he lengthened his stride to get away from the dog when the barking stopped there was silence the deep velvet silence of woods on a still night it was a warm night with a full yellow moon that threw enough light down through the thick spruce for bond to follow the path without difficulty the springy cushioned soles of the climbing boots were wonderful to walk on and bond got his second wind and knew he was making good time at around four oclock the trees began to thin and he was soon walking through open fields with the scattered lights of franklin on his right he crossed a secondary tarred road and now there was a wider track through the woods and on his right the pale glitter of a lake by five oclock he had crossed the black rivers of us highways and on the latter was a sign saying enosburg falls mi now he was on the last lap a small hunting trail that climbed steeply well away from the highway he stopped and shifted his rifle and knapsack round had a cigarette and burned the sketchmap already there was a faint paling in the sky and small noises in the forest the harsh melancholy cry of a bird he did not know and the rustlings of small animals bond visualised the house deep down in the little valley on the other side of the mountain ahead of him he saw the blank curtained windows the crumpled sleeping faces of the four men the dew on the lawn and the widening rings of the early rise on the gunmetal surface of the lake and here on the other side of the mountain was the executioner coming up through the trees bond closed his mind to the picture trod the remains of his cigarette into the ground and got going was this a hill or a mountain at what height does a hill become a mountain why dont they manufacture something out of the silver bark of birch trees it looks so useful and valuable the best things in america are chipmunks and oyster stew in the evening darkness doesnt really fall it rises when you sit on top of a mountain and watch the sun go down behind the mountain opposite the darkness rises up to you out of the valley will the birds one day lose their fear of man it must be centuries since man has killed a small bird for food in these woods yet they are still afraid who was this ethan allen who commanded the green mountain boys of vermont now in american motels they advertise ethan allen furniture as an attraction why did he make furniture army boots should have rubber soles like these with these and other random thoughts bond steadily climbed upwards and obstinately pushed away from him the thought of the four faces asleep on the white pillows the round peak was below the treeline and bond could see nothing of the valley below he rested and then chose an oak tree and climbed up and out along a thick bough now he could see everything the endless vista of the green mountains stretching in every direction as far as he could see away to the east the golden ball of the sun just coming up in glory and below two thousand feet down a long easy slope of treetops broken once by a wide band of meadow through a thin veil of mist the lake the lawns and the house bond lay along the branch and watched the band of pale early morning sunshine creeping down into the valley it took a quarter of an hour to reach the lake and then seemed to flood at once over the glittering lawn and over the wet slate tiles of the roofs then the mist went quickly from the lake and the target area washed and bright and new lay waiting like an empty stage bond slipped the telescopic sight out of his pocket and went over the scene inch by inch then he examined the sloping ground below him and estimated ranges from the edge of the meadow which would be his only open field of fire unless he went down through the last belt of trees to the edge of the lake it would be about five hundred yards to the terrace and the patio and about three hundred to the divingboard and the edge of the lake what did these people do with their time what was their routine did they ever bathe it was still warm enough well there was all day if by the end of it they had not come down to the lake he would just have to take his chance at the patio and five hundred yards but it would not be a good chance with a strange rifle ought he to get on down straight away to the edge of the meadow it was a wide meadow perhaps five hundred yards of going without cover it would be as well to get that behind him before the house awoke what time did these people get up in the morning as if to answer him a white blind rolled up in one of the smaller windows to the left of the main block bond could distinctly hear the final snap of the spring roller echo lake of course did the echo work both ways would he have to be careful of breaking branches and twigs probably not the sounds in the valley would bounce upwards off the surface of the water but there must be no chances taken a thin column of smoke began to trickle up straight into the air from one of the lefthand chimneys bond thought of the bacon and eggs that would soon be frying and the hot coffee he eased himself back along the branch and down to the ground he would have something to eat smoke his last safe cigarette and get on down to the firing point the bread stuck in bonds throat tension was building up in him in his imagination he could already hear the deep bark of the savage he could see the black bullet lazily like a slow flying bee homing down into the valley towards a square of pink skin there was a light smack as it hit the skin dented broke and then closed up again leaving a small hole with bruised edges the bullet ploughed on unhurriedly towards the pulsing heart the tissues the bloodvessels parting obediently to let it through who was this man he was going to do this to what had he ever done to bond bond looked thoughtfully down at his trigger finger he crooked it slowly feeling in his imagination the cool curve of metal almost automatically his left hand reached out for the flask he held it to his lips and tilted his head back the coffee and whisky burned a small fire down his throat he put the top back on the flask and waited for the warmth of the whisky to reach his stomach then he got slowly to his feet stretched and yawned deeply and picked up the rifle and slung it over his shoulder he looked round carefully to mark the place when he came back up the hill and started slowly off down through the trees now there was no trail and he had to pick his way slowly watching the ground for dead branches the trees were more mixed among the spruce and silver birch there was an occasional oak and beech and sycamore and here and there the blazing bengal fire of a maple in autumn dress under the trees was a sparse undergrowth of their saplings and much dead wood from old hurricanes bond went carefully down his feet making little sound among the leaves and mosscovered rocks but soon the forest was aware of him and began to pass on the news a large doe with two bambilike young saw him first and galloped off with an appalling clatter a brilliant woodpecker with a scarlet head flew down ahead of him screeching each time bond caught up with it and always there were the chipmunks craning up on their hind feet lifting their small muzzles from their teeth as they tried to catch his scent and then scampering off to their rock holes with chatterings that seemed to fill the woods with fright bond willed them to have no fear that the gun he carried was not meant for them but with each alarm he wondered if when he got to the edge of the meadow he would see down on the lawn a man with glasses who had been watching the frightened birds fleeing the treetops but when he stopped behind a last broad oak and looked down across the long meadow to the final belt of trees and the lake and the house nothing had changed all the other blinds were still down and the only movement was the thin plume of smoke it was eight oclock bond gazed down across the meadow to the trees looking for one which would suit his purpose he found it a big maple blazing with russet and crimson this would be right for his clothes its trunk was thick enough and it stood slightly back from the wall of spruce from there standing he would be able to see all he needed of the lake and the house bond stood for a while plotting his route down through the thick grass and goldenrod of the meadow he would have to do it on his stomach and slowly a small breeze got up and combed the meadow if only it would keep blowing and cover his passage somewhere not far off up to the left on the edge of the trees a branch snapped it snapped once decisively and there was no further noise bond dropped to one knee his ears pricked and his senses questing he stayed like that for a full ten minutes a motionless brown shadow against the wide trunk of the oak animals and birds do not break twigs dead wood must carry a special danger signal for them birds never alight on twigs that will break under them and even a large animal like a deer with antlers and four hooves to manipulate moves quite silently in a forest unless he is in flight had these people after all got guards out gently bond eased the rifle off his shoulder and put his thumb on the safe perhaps if the people were still sleeping a single shot from high up in the woods would pass for a hunter or a poacher but then between him and approximately where the twig had snapped two deer broke cover and cantered unhurriedly across the meadow to the left it was true that they stopped twice to look back but each time they cropped a few mouthfuls of grass before moving on and into the distant fringe of the lower woods they showed no fright and no haste it was certainly they who had been the cause of the snapped branch bond breathed a sigh so much for that and now to get on across the meadow a fivehundredyard crawl through tall concealing grass is a long and wearisome business it is hard on knees and hands and elbows there is a vista of nothing but grass and flower stalks and the dust and small insects get into your eyes and nose and down your neck bond focused on placing his hands right and maintaining a slow even speed the breeze had kept up and his wake through the grass would certainly not be noticeable from the house from above it looked as if a big ground animal a beaver perhaps or a woodchuck was on its way down the meadow no it would not be a beaver they always move in pairs and yet perhaps it might be a beaver for now from higher up on the meadow something somebody else had entered the tall grass and behind and above bond a second wake was being cut in the deep sea of grass it looked as if whatever it was would slowly catch up on bond and that the two wakes would converge just at the next treeline bond crawled and slithered steadily on stopping only to wipe the sweat and dust off his face and from time to time to make sure that he was on course for the maple but when he was close enough for the treeline to hide him from the house perhaps twenty feet from the maple he stopped and lay for a while massaging his knees and loosening his wrists for the last lap he had heard nothing to warn him and when the soft threatening whisper came from only feet away in the thick grass on his left his head swivelled so sharply that the vertebrae of his neck made a cracking sound move an inch and ill kill you it had been a girls voice but a voice that fiercely meant what it said bond his heart thumping stared up the shaft of the steel arrow whose bluetempered triangular tip parted the grass stalks perhaps eighteen inches from his head the bow was held sideways flat in the grass the knuckles of the brown fingers that held the binding of the bow below the arrowtip were white then there was the length of glinting steel and behind the metal feathers partly obscured by waving strands of grass were grimly clamped lips below two fierce grey eyes against a background of sunburned skin damp with sweat that was all bond could make out through the grass who the hell was this one of the guards bond gathered saliva back into his dry mouth and began slowly to edge his right hand his outofsight hand round and up towards his waistband and his gun he said softly who the hell are you the arrowtip gestured threateningly stop that right hand or ill put this through your shoulder are you one of the guards no are you dont be a fool what are you doing here the tension in the voice had slackened but it was still hard suspicious there was a trace of accent what was it scots welsh it was time to get to level terms there was something particularly deadly about the blue arrowtip bond said easily put away your bow and arrow robina then ill tell you you swear not to go for your gun all right but for gods sake lets get out of the middle of this field without waiting bond rose on hands and knees and started to crawl again now he must get the initiative and hold it whoever this damned girl was she would have to be disposed of quickly and discreetly before the shooting match began god as if there wasnt enough to think of already bond reached the trunk of the tree he got carefully to his feet and took a quick look through the blazing leaves most of the blinds had gone up two slowmoving coloured maids were laying a large breakfast table on the patio he had been right the field of vision over the tops of the trees that now fell sharply to the lake was perfect bond unslung his rifle and knapsack and sat down with his back against the trunk of the tree the girl came out of the edge of the grass and stood up under the maple she kept her distance the arrow was still held in the bow but the bow was unpulled they looked warily at each other the girl looked like a beautiful unkempt dryad in ragged shirt and trousers the shirt and trousers were olive green crumpled and splashed with mud and stains and torn in places and she had bound her pale blonde hair with goldenrod to conceal its brightness for her crawl through the meadow the beauty of her face was wild and rather animal with a wide sensuous mouth high cheekbones and silvery grey disdainful eyes there was the blood of scratches on her forearms and down one cheek and a bruise had puffed and slightly blackened the same cheekbone the metal feathers of a quiver full of arrows showed above her left shoulder apart from the bow she carried nothing but a hunting knife at her belt and at her other hip a small brown canvas bag that presumably carried her food she looked like a beautiful dangerous customer who knew wild country and forests and was not afraid of them she would walk alone through life and have little use for civilisation bond thought she was wonderful he smiled at her he said softly reassuringly i suppose youre robina hood my names james bond he reached for his flask and unscrewed the top and held it out sit down and have a drink of this firewater and coffee and ive got some biltong or do you live on dew and berries she came a little closer and sat down a yard from him she sat like a red indian her knees splayed wide and her ankles tucked up high under her thighs she reached for the flask and drank deeply with her head thrown back she handed it back without comment she did not smile she said thanks grudgingly and took her arrow and thrust it over her back to join the others in the quiver she said watching him closely i suppose youre a poacher the deerhunting season doesnt open for another three weeks but you wont find any deer down here they only come so low at night you ought to be higher up during the day much higher if you like ill tell you where there are some quite a big herd its a bit late in the day but you could still get to them theyre upwind from here and you seem to know about stalking you dont make much noise is that what youre doing here hunting lets see your licence her shirt had buttoneddown breast pockets without protest she took out from one of them the white paper and handed it over the licence had been issued in bennington vermont it had been issued in the name of judy havelock there was a list of types of permit nonresident hunting and nonresident bow and arrow had been ticked the cost had been payable to the fish and game service montpelier vermont judy havelock had given her age as twentyfive and her place of birth as jamaica bond thought god almighty he handed the paper back so that was the score he said with sympathy and respect youre quite a girl judy its a long walk from jamaica and you were going to take him on with your bow and arrow you know what they say in china before you set out on revenge dig two graves have you done that or did you expect to get away with it the girl was staring at him who are you what are you doing here what do you know about it bond reflected there was only one way out of this mess and that was to join forces with the girl what a hell of a business he said resignedly ive told you my name ive been sent out from london by er scotland yard i know all about your troubles and ive come out here to pay off some of the score and see youre not bothered by these people in london we think that the man in that house might start putting pressure on you about your property and theres no other way of stopping him the girl said bitterly i had a favourite pony a palomino three weeks ago they poisoned it then they shot my alsatian id raised it from a puppy then came a letter it said death has many hands one of these hands is now raised over you i was to put a notice in the paper in the personal column on a particular day i was just to say i will obey judy i went to the police all they did was to offer me protection it was people in cuba they thought there was nothing else they could do about it so i went to cuba and stayed in the best hotel and gambled big in the casinos she gave a little smile i wasnt dressed like this i wore my best dresses and the family jewels and people made up to me i was nice to them i had to be and all the while i asked questions i pretended i was out for thrills that i wanted to see the underworld and some real gangsters and so on and in the end i found out about this man she gestured down towards the house he had left cuba batista had found out about him or something and he had a lot of enemies i was told plenty about him and in the end i met a man a sort of highup policeman who told me the rest after i had she hesitated and avoided bonds eyes after i had made up to him she paused she went on i left and went to america i had read somewhere about pinkertons the detective people i went to them and paid to have them find this mans address she turned her hands palm upwards on her lap now her eyes were defiant thats all how did you get here i flew up to bennington then i walked four days up through the green mountains i kept out of the way of people im used to this sort of thing our house is in the mountains in jamaica theyre much more difficult than these and there are more people peasants about in them here no one ever seems to walk they go by car and what were you going to do then im going to shoot von hammerstein and walk back to bennington the voice was as casual as if she had said she was going to pick a wild flower from down in the valley came the sound of voices bond got to his feet and took a quick look through the branches three men and two girls had come on to the patio there was talk and laughter as they pulled out chairs and sat down at the table one place was left empty at the head of the table between the two girls bond took out his telescopic sight and looked through it the three men were very small and dark one of them who smiled all the time and whose clothes looked the cleanest and smartest would be gonzales the other two were low peasant types they sat together at the foot of the oblong table and took no part in the talk the girls were swarthy brunettes they looked like cheap cuban whores they wore bright bathing dresses and a lot of gold jewellery and laughed and chattered like pretty monkeys the voices were almost clear enough to understand but they were talking spanish bond felt the girl near him she stood a yard behind him bond handed her the glass he said the neat little man is called major gonzales the two at the bottom of the table are gunmen i dont know who the girls are von hammerstein isnt there yet she took a quick look through the glass and handed it back without comment bond wondered if she realised that she had been looking at the murderers of her father and mother the two girls had turned and were looking towards the door into the house one of them called out something that might have been a greeting a short square almost naked man came out into the sunshine he walked silently past the table to the edge of the flagged terrace facing the lawn and proceeded to go through a fiveminute programme of physical drill bond examined the man minutely he was about five feet four with a boxers shoulders and hips but a stomach that was going to fat a mat of black hair covered his breasts and shoulder blades and his arms and legs were thick with it by contrast there was not a hair on his face or head and his skull was a glittering whitish yellow with a deep dent at the back that might have been a wound or the scar of a trepanning the bone structure of the face was that of the conventional prussian officer square hard and thrusting but the eyes under the naked brows were closeset and piggish and the large mouth had hideous lips thick and wet and crimson he wore nothing but a strip of black material hardly larger than an athletic supportbelt round his stomach and a large gold wristwatch on a gold bracelet bond handed the glass to the girl he was relieved von hammerstein looked just about as unpleasant as ms dossier said he was bond watched the girls face the mouth looked grim almost cruel as she looked down on the man she had come to kill what was he to do about her he could see nothing but a vista of troubles from her presence she might even interfere with his own plans and insist on playing some silly role with her bow and arrow bond made up his mind he just could not afford to take chances one short tap at the base of the skull and he would gag her and tie her up until it was all over bond reached softly for the butt of his automatic nonchalantly the girl moved a few steps back just as nonchalantly she bent down put the glass on the ground and picked up her bow she reached behind her for an arrow and fitted it casually into the bow then she looked up at bond and said quietly dont get any silly ideas and keep your distance ive got whats called wideangled vision i havent come all the way here to be knocked on the head by a flatfooted london bobby i cant miss with this at fifty yards and ive killed birds on the wing at a hundred i dont want to put an arrow through your leg but i shall if you interfere bond cursed his previous indecision he said fiercely dont be a silly bitch put that damned thing down this is mans work how in hell do you think you can take on four men with a bow and arrow the girls eyes blazed obstinately she moved her right foot back into the shooting stance she said through compressed angry lips you go to hell and keep out of this it was my mother and father they killed not yours ive already been here a day and a night i know what they do and i know how to get hammerstein i dont care about the others theyre nothing without him now then she pulled the bow half taut the arrow pointed at bonds feet either you do what i say or youre going to be sorry and dont think i dont mean it this is a private thing ive sworn to do and nobodys going to stop me she tossed her head imperiously well bond gloomily measured the situation he looked the ridiculously beautiful wild girl up and down this was good hard english stock spiced with the hot peppers of a tropical childhood dangerous mixture she had keyed herself up to a state of controlled hysteria he was quite certain that she would think nothing of putting him out of action and he had absolutely no defence her weapon was silent his would alert the whole neighbourhood now the only hope would be to work with her give her part of the job and he would do the rest he said quietly now listen judy if you insist on coming in on this thing wed better do it together then perhaps we can bring it off and stay alive this sort of thing is my profession i was ordered to do it by a close friend of your family if you want to know and ive got the right weapon its got at least five times the range of yours i could take a good chance of killing him now on the patio but the odds arent quite good enough some of them have got bathing things on theyll be coming down to the lake then im going to do it you can give supporting fire he ended lamely itll be a great help no she shook her head decisively im sorry you can give what you call supporting fire if you like i dont care one way or the other youre right about the swimming yesterday they were all down at the lake around eleven its just as warm today and theyll be there again i shall get him from the edge of the trees by the lake i found a perfect place last night the bodyguard men bring their guns with them sort of tommygun things they dont bathe they sit around and keep guard i know the moment to get von hammerstein and ill be well away from the lake before they take in whats happened i tell you ive got it all planned now then i cant hang around any more i ought to have been in my place already im sorry but unless you say yes straight away theres no alternative she raised the bow a few inches bond thought damn this girl to hell he said angrily all right then but i can tell you that if we get out of this youre going to get such a spanking you wont be able to sit down for a week he shrugged he said with resignation go ahead ill look after the others if you get away all right meet me here if you dont ill come down and pick up the pieces the girl unstrung her bow she said indifferently im glad youre seeing sense these arrows are difficult to pull out dont worry about me but keep out of sight and mind the sun doesnt catch that glass of yours she gave bond the brief pitying selfcongratulatory smile of the woman who has had the last word and turned and made off down through the trees bond watched the lithe dark green figure until it had vanished among the treetrunks then he impatiently picked up the glass and went back to his vantagepoint to hell with her it was time to clear the silly bitch out of his mind and concentrate on the job was there anything else he could have done any other way of handling it now he was committed to wait for her to fire the first shot that was bad but if he fired first there was no way of knowing what the hotheaded bitch would do bonds mind luxuriated briefly in the thought of what he would do to the girl once all this was over then there was movement in front of the house and he put the exciting thoughts aside and lifted his glass the breakfast things were being cleared away by the two maids there was no sign of the girls or the gunmen von hammerstein was lying back among the cushions of an outdoor couch reading a newspaper and occasionally commenting to major gonzales who sat astride an iron garden chair near his feet gonzales was smoking a cigar and from time to time he delicately raised a hand in front of his mouth leant sideways and spat a bit of leaf out on the ground bond could not hear what von hammerstein was saying but his comments were in english and gonzales answered in english bond glanced at his watch it was tenthirty since the scene seemed to be static bond sat down with his back to the tree and went over the savage with minute care at the same time he thought of what would shortly have to be done with it bond did not like what he was going to do and all the way from england he had had to keep on reminding himself what sort of men these were the killing of the havelocks had been a particularly dreadful killing von hammerstein and his gunmen were particularly dreadful men whom many people around the world would probably be very glad to destroy as this girl proposed to do out of private revenge but for bond it was different he had no personal motives against them this was merely his job as it was the job of a pest control officer to kill rats he was the public executioner appointed by m to represent the community in a way bond argued to himself these men were as much enemies of his country as were the agents of smersh or of other enemy secret services they had declared and waged war against british people on british soil and they were currently planning another attack bonds mind hunted round for more arguments to bolster his resolve they had killed the girls pony and her dog with two casual sideswipes of the hand as if they had been flies they a burst of automatic fire from the valley brought bond to his feet his rifle was up and taking aim as the second burst came the harsh racket of noise was followed by laughter and handclapping the kingfisher a handful of tattered blue and grey feathers thudded to the lawn and lay fluttering von hammerstein smoke still dribbling from the snout of his tommygun walked a few steps and put the heel of his naked foot down and pivoted sharply he took his heel away and wiped it on the grass beside the heap of feathers the others stood round laughing and applauding obsequiously von hammersteins red lips grinned with pleasure he said something which included the word crackshot he handed the gun to one of the gunmen and wiped his hands down his fat backsides he gave a sharp order to the two girls who ran off into the house then with the others following he turned and ambled down the sloping lawn towards the lake now the girls came running back out of the house each one carried an empty champagne bottle chattering and laughing they skipped down after the men bond got himself ready he clipped the telescopic sight on to the barrel of the savage and took his stance against the trunk of the tree he found a bump in the wood as a rest for his left hand put his sights at and took broad aim at the group of people by the lake then holding the rifle loosely he leaned against the trunk and watched the scene it was going to be some kind of a shooting contest between the two gunmen they snapped fresh magazines on to their guns and at gonzaless orders stationed themselves on the flat stone wall of the dam some twenty feet apart on either side of the divingboard they stood with their backs to the lake and their guns at the ready von hammerstein took up his place on the grass verge a champagne bottle swinging in each hand the girls stood behind him their hands over their ears there was excited jabbering in spanish and laughter in which the two gunmen did not join through the telescopic sight their faces looked sharp with concentration von hammerstein barked an order and there was silence he swung both arms back and counted un dos tres with the tres he hurled the champagne bottles high into the air over the lake the two men turned like marionettes the guns clamped to their hips as they completed the turn they fired the thunder of the guns split the peaceful scene and racketed up from the water birds fled away from the trees screeching and some small branches cut by the bullets pattered down into the lake the lefthand bottle disintegrated into dust the righthand one hit by only a single bullet split in two a fraction of a second later the fragments of glass made small splashes over the middle of the lake the gunman on the left had won the smokeclouds over the two of them joined and drifted away over the lawn the echoes boomed softly into silence the two gunmen walked along the wall to the grass the rear one looking sullen the leading one with a sly grin on his face von hammerstein beckoned the two girls forward they came reluctantly dragging their feet and pouting von hammerstein said something asked a question of the winner the man nodded at the girl on the left she looked sullenly back at him gonzales and hammerstein laughed hammerstein reached out and patted the girl on the rump as if she had been a cow he said something in which bond caught the words una noche the girl looked up at him and nodded obediently the group broke up the prize girl took a quick run and dived into the lake perhaps to get away from the man who had won her favours and the other girl followed her they swam away across the lake calling angrily to each other major gonzales took off his coat and laid it on the grass and sat down on it he was wearing a shoulder holster which showed the butt of a mediumcalibre automatic he watched von hammerstein take off his watch and walk along the dam wall to the divingboard the gunmen stood back from the lake and also watched von hammerstein and the two girls who were now out in the middle of the little lake and were making for the far shore the gunmen stood with their guns cradled in their arms and occasionally one of them would glance round the garden or towards the house bond thought there was every reason why von hammerstein had managed to stay alive so long he was a man who took trouble to do so von hammerstein had reached the divingboard he walked along to the end and stood looking down at the water bond tensed himself and put up the safe his eyes were fierce slits it would be any minute now his finger itched on the triggerguard what in hell was the girl waiting for von hammerstein had made up his mind he flexed his knees slightly the arms came back through the telescopic sight bond could see the thick hair over his shoulder blades tremble in a breeze that came to give a quick shiver to the surface of the lake now his arms were coming forward and there was a fraction of a second when his feet had left the board and he was still almost upright in that fraction of a second there was a flash of silver against his back and then von hammersteins body hit the water in a neat dive gonzales was on his feet looking uncertainly at the turbulence caused by the dive his mouth was open waiting he did not know if he had seen something or not the two gunmen were more certain they had their guns at the ready they crouched looking from gonzales to the trees behind the dam waiting for an order slowly the turbulence subsided and the ripples spread across the lake the dive had gone deep bonds mouth was dry he licked his lips searching the lake with his glass there was a pink shimmer deep down it wobbled slowly up von hammersteins body broke the surface it lay head down wallowing softly a foot or so of steel shaft stuck up from below the left shoulder blade and the sun winked on the aluminium feathers major gonzales yelled an order and the two tommyguns roared and flamed bond could hear the crash of the bullets among the trees below him the savage shuddered against his shoulder and the righthand man fell slowly forward on his face now the other man was running for the lake his gun still firing from the hip in short bursts bond fired and missed and fired again the mans legs buckled but his momentum still carried him forward he crashed into the water the clenched finger went on firing the gun aimlessly up towards the blue sky until the water throttled the mechanism the seconds wasted on the extra shot had given major gonzales a chance he had got behind the body of the first gunman and now he opened up on bond with the tommygun whether he had seen bond or was only firing at the flashes from the savage he was doing well bullets zipped into the maple and slivers of wood spattered into bonds face bond fired twice the dead body of the gunman jerked too low bond reloaded and took fresh aim a snapped branch fell across his rifle he shook it free but now gonzales was up and running forward to the group of garden furniture he hurled the iron table on its side and got behind it as two snap shots from bond kicked chunks out of the lawn at his heels with this solid cover his shooting became more accurate and burst after burst now from the right of the table and now from the left crashed into the maple tree while bonds single shots clanged against the white iron or whined off across the lawn it was not easy to traverse the telescopic sight quickly from one side of the table to the other and gonzales was cunning with his changes again and again his bullets thudded into the trunk beside and above bond bond ducked and ran swiftly to the right he would fire standing from the open meadow and catch gonzales off guard but even as he ran he saw gonzales dart from behind the iron table he also had decided to end the stalemate he was running for the dam to get across and into the woods and come up after bond bond stood and threw up his rifle as he did so gonzales also saw him he went down on one knee on the dam wall and sprayed a burst at bond bond stood icily hearing the bullets the crossed hairs centred on gonzaless chest bond squeezed the trigger gonzales rocked he half got to his feet he raised his arms and with his gun still pumping bullets into the sky dived clumsily face forward into the water bond watched to see if the face would rise it did not slowly he lowered his rifle and wiped the back of his arm across his face the echoes the echoes of much death rolled to and fro across the valley away to the right in the trees beyond the lake he caught a glimpse of the two girls running up towards the house soon they if the maids had not already done so would be on to the state troopers it was time to get moving bond walked back through the meadow to the lone maple the girl was there she stood up against the trunk of the tree with her back to him her head was cradled in her arms against the tree blood was running down the right arm and dripping to the ground and there was a black stain high up on the sleeve of the dark green shirt the bow and quiver of arrows lay at her feet her shoulders were shaking bond came up behind her and put a protective arm across her shoulders he said softly take it easy judy its all over now how bads the arm she said in a muffled voice its nothing something hit me but that was awful i didnt i didnt know it would be like that bond pressed her arm reassuringly it had to be done theyd have got you otherwise those were pro killers the worst but i told you this sort of thing was mans work now then lets have a look at your arm weve got to get going over the border the troopersll be here before long she turned the beautiful wild face was streaked with sweat and tears now the grey eyes were soft and obedient she said its nice of you to be like that after the way i was i was sort of sort of wound up she held out her arm bond reached for the huntingknife at her belt and cut off her shirtsleeve at the shoulder there was the bruised bleeding gash of a bullet wound across the muscle bond took out his own khaki handkerchief cut it into three lengths and joined them together he washed the wound dean with the coffee and whisky and then took a thick slice of bread from his haversack and bound it over the wound he cut her shirtsleeve into a sling and reached behind her neck to tie the knot her mouth was inches from his the scent of her body had a warm animal tang bond kissed her once softly on the lips and once again hard he tied the knot he looked into the grey eyes close to his they looked surprised and happy he kissed her again at each corner of the mouth and the mouth slowly smiled bond stood away from her and smiled back he softly picked up her right hand and slipped the wrist into the sling she said docilely where are you taking me bond said im taking you to london theres this old man who will want to see you but first weve got to get over into canada and ill talk to a friend in ottawa and get your passport straightened out youll have to get some clothes and things itll take a few days well be staying in a place called the kozee motel she looked at him she was a different girl she said softly thatll be nice ive never stayed in a motel bond bent down and picked up his rifle and knapsack and slung them over one shoulder then he hung her bow and quiver over the other and turned and started up through the meadow she fell in behind and followed him and as she walked she pulled the tired bits of goldenrod out of her hair and undid a ribbon and let the pale gold hair fall down to her shoulders quantum of solace james bond said ive always thought that if i ever married i would marry an air hostess the dinner party had been rather sticky and now that the other two guests had left accompanied by the adc to catch their plane the governor and bond were sitting together on a chintzy sofa in the large office of works furnished drawingroom trying to make conversation bond had a sharp sense of the ridiculous he was never comfortable sitting deep in soft cushions he preferred to sit up in a solidly upholstered armed chair with his feet firmly on the ground and he felt foolish sitting with an elderly bachelor on his bed of rose chintz gazing at the coffee and liqueurs on the low table between their outstretched feet there was something clubable intimate even rather feminine about the scene and none of these atmospheres was appropriate bond didnt like nassau everyone was too rich the winter visitors and the residents who had houses on the island talked of nothing but their money their diseases and their servant problems they didnt even gossip well there was nothing to gossip about the winter crowd were all too old to have love affairs and like most rich people too cautious to say anything malicious about their neighbours the harvey millers the couple that had just left were typical a pleasant rather dull canadian millionaire who had got into natural gas early on and stayed with it and his pretty chatterbox of a wife it seemed that she was english she had sat next to bond and chattered vivaciously about what shows he had recently seen in town and didnt he think the savoy grill was the nicest place for supper one saw so many interesting people actresses and people like that bond had done his best but since he had not seen a play for two years and then only because the man he was following in vienna had gone to it he had had to rely on rather dusty memories of london night life which somehow failed to marry up with the experiences of mrs harvey miller bond knew that the governor had asked him to dinner only as a duty and perhaps to help out with the harvey millers bond had been in the colony for a week and was leaving for miami the next day it had been a routine investigation job arms were getting to the castro rebels in cuba from all the neighbouring territories they had been coming principally from miami and the gulf of mexico but when the us coastguards had seized two big shipments the castro supporters had turned to jamaica and the bahamas as possible bases and bond had been sent out from london to put a stop to it he hadnt wanted to do the job if anything his sympathies were with the rebels but the government had a big export programme with cuba in exchange for taking more cuban sugar than they wanted and a minor condition of the deal was that britain should not give aid or comfort to the cuban rebels bond had found out about the two big cabin cruisers that were being fitted out for the job and rather than make arrests when they were about to sail thus causing an incident he had chosen a very dark night and crept up on the boats in a police launch from the deck of the unlighted launch he had tossed a thermite bomb through an open port of each of them he had then made off at high speed and watched the bonfire from a distance bad luck on the insurance companies of course but there were no casualties and he had achieved quickly and neatly what m had told him to do so far as bond was aware no one in the colony except the chief of police and two of his officers knew who had caused the two spectacular and to those in the know timely fires in the roadstead bond had reported only to m in london he had not wished to embarrass the governor who seemed to him an easily embarrassable man and it could in fact have been unwise to give him knowledge of a felony which might easily be the subject of a question in the legislative council but the governor was no fool he had known the purpose of bonds visit to the colony and that evening when bond had shaken him by the hand the dislike of a peaceable man for violent action had been communicated to bond by something constrained and defensive in the governors manner this had been no help to the dinner party and it had needed all the chatter and gush of a hardworking adc to give the evening the small semblance of life it had achieved and now it was only ninethirty and the governor and bond were faced with one more polite hour before they could go gratefully to their beds each relieved that he would never have to see the other again not that bond had anything against the governor he belonged to a routine type that bond had often encountered round the world solid loyal competent sober and just the best type of colonial civil servant solidly competently loyally he would have filled the minor posts for thirty years while the empire crumbled around him and now just in time by sticking to the ladders and avoiding the snakes he had got to the top in a year or two it would be the gcb and out out to godalming or cheltenham or tunbridge wells with a pension and a small packet of memories of places like the trucial oman the leeward islands british guiana that no one at the local golf club would have heard of or would care about and yet bond had reflected that evening how many small dramas such as the affair of the castro rebels must the governor have witnessed or been privy to how much he would know about the chequerboard of the smallpower politics the scandalous side of life in small communities abroad the secrets of people that lie in the files of government houses round the world but how could one strike a spark off this rigid discreet mind how could he james bond whom the governor obviously regarded as a dangerous man and as a possible source of danger to his own career extract one ounce of interesting fact or comment to save the evening from being a futile waste of time bonds careless and slightly mendacious remark about marrying an air hostess had come at the end of some desultory conversation about air travel that had followed dully inevitably on the departure of the harvey millers to catch their plane for montreal the governor had said that boac were getting the lions share of the american traffic to nassau because though their planes might be half an hour slower from idlewild the service was superb bond had said boring himself with his own banality that he would rather fly slowly and comfortably than fast and uncosseted it was then that he had made the remark about air hostesses indeed said the governor in the polite controlled voice that bond prayed might relax and become human why oh i dont know it would be fine to have a pretty girl always tucking you up and bringing you drinks and hot meals and asking if you had everything you wanted and theyre always smiling and wanting to please if i dont marry an air hostess therell be nothing for it but marry a japanese they seem to have the right ideas too bond had no intention of marrying anyone if he did it would certainly not be an insipid slave he only hoped to amuse or outrage the governor into a discussion of some human topic i dont know about the japanese but i suppose it has occurred to you that these air hostesses are only trained to please that they might be quite different when theyre not on the job so to speak the governors voice was reasonable judicious since im not really very interested in getting married ive never taken the trouble to investigate there was a pause the governors cigar had gone out he spent a moment or two getting it going again when he spoke it seemed to bond that the even tone had gained a spark of life of interest the governor said there was a man i knew once who must have had the same ideas as you he fell in love with an air hostess and married her rather an interesting story as a matter of fact i suppose the governor looked sideways at bond and gave a short selfdeprecatory laugh you see quite a lot of the seamy side of life this story may seem to you on the dull side but would you care to hear it very much bond put enthusiasm into his voice he doubted if the governors idea of what was seamy was the same as his own but at least it would save him from making any more asinine conversation now to get away from this damnably cloying sofa he said could i have some more brandy he got up dashed an inch of brandy into his glass and instead of going back to the sofa pulled up a chair and sat down at an angle from the governor on the other side of the drink tray the governor examined the end of his cigar took a quick pull and held the cigar upright so that the long ash would not fall off he watched the ash warily throughout his story and spoke as if to the thin trickle of blue smoke that rose and quickly disappeared in the hot moist air he said carefully this man ill call him masters philip masters was almost a contemporary of mine in the service i was a year ahead of him he went to fettes and took a scholarship for oxford the name of the college doesnt matter and then he applied for the colonial service he wasnt a particularly clever chap but he was hard working and capable and the sort of man who makes a good solid impression on interview boards they took him into the service his first post was nigeria he did well in it he liked the natives and he got on well with them he was a man of liberal ideas and while he didnt actually fraternize which the governor smiled sourly would have got him into trouble with his superiors in those days he was lenient and humane towards the nigerians it came as quite a surprise to them the governor paused and took a pull at his cigar the ash was about to fall and he bent carefully over towards the drink tray and let the ash hiss into his coffee cup he sat back and for the first time looked across at bond he said i daresay the affection this young man had for the natives took the place of the affection young men of that age in other walks of life have for the opposite sex unfortunately philip masters was a shy and rather uncouth young man who had never had any kind of success in that direction when he hadnt been working to pass his various exams he had played hockey for his college and rowed in the third eight in the holidays he had stayed with an aunt in wales and climbed with the local mountaineering club his parents by the way had separated when he was at his public school and though he was an only child had not bothered with him once he was safe at oxford with his scholarship and a small allowance to see him through so he had very little time for girls and very little to recommend him to those he did come across his emotional life ran along the frustrated and unhealthy lines that were part of our inheritance from our victorian grandfathers knowing how it was with him i am therefore suggesting that his friendly relations with the coloured people of nigeria were what is known as a compensation seized on by a basically warm and fullblooded nature that had been starved of affection and now found it in their simple kindly natures bond interrupted the rather solemn narrative the only trouble with beautiful negresses is that they dont know anything about birth control i hope he managed to stay out of that sort of trouble the governor held up his hand his voice held an undertone of distaste for bonds earthiness no no you misunderstand me i am not talking about sex it would never have occurred to this young man to have relations with a coloured girl in fact he was sadly ignorant of sexual matters not a rare thing even today among young people in england but very common in those days and the cause as i expect you will agree of many very many disastrous marriages and other tragedies bond nodded no i am only explaining this young man at some length to show you that what was to come fell upon a frustrated young innocent with a warm but unawakened heart and body and a social clumsiness which made him seek companionship and affection amongst the negroes instead of in his own world he was in short a sensitive misfit physically uninteresting but in all other respects healthy and able and a perfectly adequate citizen bond took a sip of his brandy and stretched out his legs he was enjoying the story the governor was telling it in a rather elderly narrative style which gave it a ring of truth the governor continued young masters service in nigeria coincided with the first labour government if you remember one of the first things they got down to was a reform of the foreign services nigeria got a new governor with advanced views on the native problem who was surprised and pleased to find that he had a junior member of his staff who was already in his modest sphere putting something like the governors own views into practice he encouraged philip masters gave him duties which were above his rank and in due course when masters was due for a move he wrote such a glowing report that masters jumped a grade and was transferred to bermuda as assistant secretary to government the governor looked through his cigar smoke at bond he said apologetically i hope you arent being too bored by all this i shant be long in coming to the point im very interested indeed i think ive got a picture of the man you must have known him well the governor hesitated he said i got to know him still better in bermuda i was just his senior and he worked directly under me however we havent quite got to bermuda yet it was the early days of the air services to africa and for one reason or another philip masters decided to fly home to london and so have a longer home leave than if he had taken ship from freetown he went by train to nairobi and caught the weekly service of imperial airways the forerunner of boac he had never flown before and he was interested but slightly nervous when they took off after the air hostess whom he noticed was very pretty had given him a sweet to suck and shown him how to fasten his seatbelt when the plane had levelled out and he found that flying seemed a more peaceful business than he had expected the hostess came back down the almost empty plane she smiled at him you can undo the belt now when masters fumbled with the buckle she leant down and undid it for him it was an intimate little gesture masters had never been so close to a woman of about his own age in his life he blushed and felt an extraordinary confusion he thanked her she smiled rather saucily at his embarrassment and sat on the arm of the empty seat across the aisle and asked him where he had come from and where he was going he told her in his turn he asked her about the plane and how fast they were flying and where they would stop and so forth he found her very easy to talk to and almost dazzlingly pretty to look at he was surprised at her easy way with him and her apparent interest in what he had to say about africa she seemed to think he led a far more exciting and glamorous life than to his mind he did she made him feel important when she went away to help the two stewards prepare lunch he sat and thought about her and thrilled to his thoughts when he tried to read he could not focus on the page he had to be looking up the plane to catch a glimpse of her once she caught his gaze and gave him what seemed to him a secret smile we are the only young people on the plane it seemed to say we understand each other were interested in the same sort of things philip masters gazed out of the window seeing her in the sea of white clouds below in his minds eye he examined her minutely marvelling at her perfection she was small and trim with a milkandroses complexion and fair hair tied in a neat bun she had cherry red smiling lips and blue eyes that sparkled with mischievous fun knowing wales he guessed that she had welsh blood in her and this was confirmed by her name rhoda llewellyn which when he went to wash his hands before luncheon he found printed at the bottom of the crew list above the magazine rack beside the lavatory door he speculated deeply about her she would be near him now for nearly two days but how could he get to see her again she must have hundreds of admirers she might even be married did she fly all the time how many days off did she get between trips would she laugh at him if he asked her out to dinner and a theatre might she even complain to the captain of the aircraft that one of the passengers was getting fresh a sudden vision came to masters of being turned off the plane at aden a complaint to the colonial office his career ruined luncheon came and reassurance when she fitted the little tray across his knees her hair brushed his cheek masters felt that he had been touched by a live electric wire she showed him how to deal with the complicated little cellophane packages how to get the plastic lid off the salad dressing she told him that the sweet was particularly good a rich layer cake in short she made a fuss of him and masters couldnt remember when it had ever happened before even when his mother had looked after him as a child at the end of the trip when the sweating masters had screwed up his courage to ask her out to dinner it was almost an anticlimax when she readily agreed a month later she resigned from imperial airways and they were married a month after that masters leave was up and they took ship for bermuda bond said i fear the worst she married him because his life sounded exciting and grand she liked the idea of being the belle of the tea parties at government house i suppose masters had to murder her in the end no said the governor mildly but i daresay youre right about why she married him that and being tired of the grind and danger of flying perhaps she really meant to make a go of it and certainly when the young couple arrived and settled into their bungalow on the outskirts of hamilton we were all favourably impressed by her vivacity and her pretty face and by the way she made herself pleasant to everyone and of course masters was a changed man life had become a fairytale for him looking back it was almost pitiful to watch him try to spruce himself up so that he could live up to her he took trouble about his clothes put some dreadful brilliantine on his hair and even grew a militarytype moustache presumably because she thought it looked distinguished at the end of the day he would hurry back to the bungalow and it was always rhoda this and rhoda that and when do you think lady burford who was the governors wife is going to ask rhoda to lunch but he worked hard and everyone liked the young couple and things went along like a marriage bell for six months or so then and now im only guessing the occasional word began to drop like acid in the happy little bungalow you can imagine the sort of thing why doesnt the colonial secretarys wife ever take me out shopping with her how long must we wait before we can give another cocktail party you know we cant afford to have a baby when are you due for promotion its awfully dull here all day with nothing to do youll have to get the dinner tonight i simply cant be bothered you have such an interesting time its all right for you and so on and so forth and of course the cosseting quickly went by the board now it was masters and of course he was delighted to do it who brought the air hostess breakfast in bed before he went off to work it was masters who tidied up the house when he came back in the evening and found cigarette ash and chocolate papers all over the place it was masters who had to give up smoking and his occasional drink to buy her new clothes so that she could live up to the other wives some of this showed at any rate to me who knew masters well in the secretariat the preoccupied frown the occasional enigmatic oversolicitous telephone call in office hours the ten minutes stolen at the end of the day so that he could take rhoda to the cinema and of course the occasional half joking questions about marriage in general what do other wives do all day long do most women find it a bit hot out here i suppose women are much more easily upset than men and so forth the trouble or at least most of it was that masters was besotted she was his sun and his moon and if she was unhappy or restless it was all his fault he cast about desperately for something that would occupy her and make her happy and finally of all things he settled or rather they settled together on golf golf is very much the thing in bermuda there are several fine links including the famous midocean club where all the quality play and get together at the club afterwards for gossip and drinks it was just what she wanted a smart occupation and high society god knows how masters saved up enough to join and buy her the clubs and the lessons and all the rest but somehow he did it and it was a roaring success she took to spending all day at the midocean she worked hard at her lessons and got a handicap and met people through the little competitions and the monthly medals and in six months she was not only playing a respectable game but had become quite the darling of the men members i wasnt surprised i remember seeing her there from time to time a delicious sunburned little figure in the shortest of shorts with a white eyeshade with a green lining and a trim compact swing that flattered her figure and i can tell you the governor twinkled briefly she was the prettiest thing ive ever seen on a golf course of course the next step didnt take long there was a mixedfoursome competition she was partnered with the oldest tattersall boy theyre the leading hamilton merchants and more or less the ruling clique in bermudan society he was a young hellion handsome as be damned a beautiful swimmer and a scratch golfer with an open mg and a speedboat and all the trimmings you know the type got all the girls he wanted and if they didnt sleep with him pretty quickly they didnt get the rides in the mg or the chriscraft or the evenings in the local night clubs the couple won the competition after a hard fight in the final and philip masters was in the fashionable crowd round the eighteenth green to cheer them home that was the last time he cheered for many a long day perhaps for all his life almost at once she started going with young tattersall and once started she went like the wind and believe me mr bond the governor closed a fist and brought it softly down on the edge of the drinks table it was ghastly to see she didnt make the smallest attempt to soften the blow or hide the affair in any way she just took young tattersall and hit masters in the face with him and went on hitting she would come home at any hour of the night she had insisted that masters should move into the spare room some pretext about it being too hot to sleep together and if she ever tidied the house or cooked him a meal it was only makeshift and to keep up some kind of appearance of course in a month the whole thing was public property and poor masters was wearing the biggest pair of horns that had ever been seen in the colony lady burford finally stepped m and gave rhoda masters a talking to said she was ruining her husbands career and so forth but the trouble was that lady burford found masters a pretty dull dog and having perhaps had one or two escapades in her own youth she was still a handsome woman with a twinkle in her eye she was probably a bit too lenient with the girl of course masters himself as he was to tell me later went through the usual dreary sequence remonstrance bitter quarrel furious rage violence and finally icy withdrawal and sullen misery the governor paused i dont know if youve ever seen a heart being broken mr bond broken slowly and deliberately well thats what i saw happening to philip masters and it was a dreadful thing to watch there he had been a man with paradise in his face and within a year of his arrival in bermuda hell was written all over it of course i did my best we all did in one way or another but once it had happened on that eighteenth green at the midocean there was really nothing to do but try and pick up the bits but masters was like a wounded dog he just drew away from us into a corner and snarled when anyone tried to come near him i even went to the length of writing him one or two letters he later told me he had torn them up without reading them one day several of us got together and asked him to a stag party in my bungalow we tried to get him drunk we got him drunk all right the next thing that happened was a crash from the bathroom masters had tried to cut his wrists with my razor that broke our nerve and i was deputed to go and see the governor about the whole business the governor knew about it of course but had hoped he wouldnt have to interfere now the question was whether masters could even stay on in the service his work had gone to pieces his wife was a public scandal he was a broken man could we stick the bits together again the governor was a fine man once action had been forced on him he was determined to make a last effort to stave off the almost inevitable report to whitehall which would finally smash what remained of masters and providence stepped in to lend a hand the very next day after my interview with the governor there was a dispatch from the colonial office saying there was to be a meeting in washington to delineate offshore fishing rights and that bermuda and the bahamas had been invited to send representatives of their governments the governor sent for masters spoke to him like a dutch uncle told him that he was being sent to washington and that he had better have his domestic affairs settled one way or the other in the next six months and packed him off masters left in a week and sat in washington talking fish for five months and we all heaved a sigh of relief and cut rhoda masters whenever we could find an opportunity to do it the governor stopped speaking and it was silent in the big brightly lit drawingroom he took out a handkerchief and wiped it over his face his memories had excited him and his eyes were bright in the flushed face he got to his feet and poured a whisky and soda for bond and one for himself bond said what a mess i suppose something like that was bound to happen sooner or later but it was bad luck on masters that it had to happen so soon she must have been a hardhearted little bitch did she show any signs of being sorry for what shed done the governor had finished lighting a fresh cigar he looked at the glowing tip and blew on it he said oh no she was having a wonderful time she probably knew it wouldnt last for ever but it was what she had dreamed about what the readers of womens magazines dream about and she was pretty typical of that sort of mentality she had everything the best catch on the island love on the sands under the palm trees gay times in the town and at the midocean fast drives in the car and the speedboat all the trappings of cheap romance and to fall back on a slave of a husband well out of the way and a house to have a bath in and change her clothes and get some sleep and she knew she could get philip masters back he was so abject there would be no difficulty and then she could go round and apologize to everyone and turn on the charm again and everyone would forgive her it would be all right if it wasnt all right there were plenty of other men in the world besides philip masters and more attractive ones at that why look at all the men at the golf club she could have her pick of them at the drop of a hat no life was good and if one was being a bit naughty it was after all only the way plenty of other people behaved look at the way the filmstars went on in hollywood well she was soon put to the test tattersall got a bit tired of her and thanks to the governors wife the tattersall parents were making the hell of a fuss that gave tattersall a good excuse to get out of it all without too much of a scene and it was summer and the island was flooded with pretty american girls it was time for some fresh blood so he chucked rhoda masters like that just told her they were through that his parents had insisted or they would cut off his allowance it was a fortnight before philip masters was due back from washington and i will say she took it well she was tough and she had known it would have to come some time or other she didnt squeal for that matter there was no one to squeal to she just went and told lady burford that she was sorry and that she was now going to be a good wife to philip masters and she started on the house and cleaned it up and got everything shipshape ready for the big reconciliation scene the necessity for bringing about this reconciliation was made clear to her by the attitude of her former cronies at the midocean she had suddenly become bad news there you know how these things can happen even in an openhanded place like a country club in the tropics now not only the government house set but also the hamilton merchants clique frowned on her she was suddenly shoddy goods used and discarded she tried to be the same gay little flirt but it didnt work any more she got sharply snubbed once or twice and stopped going now it was vital to get back to a secure base and start slowly working her way up again she stayed at home and set to with a will rehearsing over and over again the act she would put on the tears the air hostess cosseting the lengthy sincere excuses and explanations the double bed and then philip masters came home the governor paused and looked reflectively over at bond he said youre not married but i think its the same with all relationships between a man and a woman they can survive anything so long as some kind of basic humanity exists between the two people when all kindness has gone when one person obviously and sincerely doesnt care if the other is alive or dead then its just no good that particular insult to the ego worse to the instinct of selfpreservation can never be forgiven ive noticed this in hundreds of marriages ive seen flagrant infidelities patched up ive seen crimes and even murder forgiven by the other party let alone bankruptcy and every other form of social crime incurable disease blindness disaster all these can be overcome but never the death of common humanity in one of the partners ive thought about this and ive invented a rather highsounding title for this basic factor in human relations i have called it the law of the quantum of solace bond said thats a splendid name for it its certainly impressive enough and of course i see what you mean i should say youre absolutely right quantum of solace the amount of comfort yes i suppose you could say that all love and friendship is based in the end on that human beings are very insecure when the other person not only makes you feel insecure but actually seems to want to destroy you its obviously the end the quantum of solace stands at zero youve got to get away to save yourself did masters see that the governor didnt answer the question he said rhoda masters should have been warned when her husband walked through the bungalow door it wasnt so much what she saw on the surface though the moustache had gone and masterss hair was once again the untidy mop of their first meeting it was the eyes and the mouth and the set of the chin rhoda masters had put on her quietest frock she had taken off most of her makeup and had arranged herself in a chair where the light from the window left her face in half shadow and illuminated the pages of a book on her lap she had decided that when he came through the door she would look up from her book docilely submissively and wait for him to speak then she would get up and come quietly to him and stand in front of him with her head bowed she would tell him all and let the tears come and he would take her in his arms and she would promise and promise she had practised the scene many times until she was satisfied she duly glanced up from her book masters quietly put down his suitcase and walked slowly over to the mantelpiece and stood looking vaguely down at her his eyes were cold and impersonal and without interest he put his hand in his inside pocket and took out a piece of paper he said in the matteroffact voice of a house agent here is a plan of the house i have divided the house in two your rooms are the kitchen and your bedroom mine are this room and the spare bedroom you may use the bathroom when i am not in it he leant over and dropped the paper on the open pages of her book you are never to enter my rooms except when we have friends in rhoda masters opened her mouth to speak he held up his hand this is the last time i shall speak to you in private if you speak to me i shall not answer if you wish to communicate you may leave a note in the bathroom i shall expect my meals to be prepared punctually and placed in the diningroom which you may use when i have finished i shall give you twenty pounds a month to cover the housekeeping and this amount will be sent to you by my lawyers on the first of each month my lawyers are preparing the divorce papers i am divorcing you and you will not fight the action because you cannot a private detective has provided full evidence against you the action will take place in one year from now when my time in bermuda is up in the meantime in public we shall behave as a normal married couple masters put his hands in his pockets and looked politely down at her by this time tears were pouring down her face she looked terrified as if someone had hit her masters said indifferently is there anything else youd like to know if not you had better collect your belongings from here and move into the kitchen he looked at his watch i would like dinner every evening at eight it is now seventhirty the governor paused and sipped his whisky he said ive put all this together from the little that masters told me and from fuller details rhoda masters gave to lady burford apparently rhoda masters tried every way to shake him arguments pleadings hysterics he was unmoved she simply couldnt reach him it was as if he had gone away and had sent someone else to the house to represent him at this extraordinary interview and in the end she had to agree she had no money she couldnt possibly afford the passage to england to have a bed and food she had to do what he told her and so it was for a year they lived like that polite to each other in public but utterly silent and separate when they were alone of course we were all astonished by the change neither of them told anyone of the arrangement she would have been ashamed to do so and there was no reason why masters should he seemed to us a bit more withdrawn than before but his work was firstclass and everyone heaved a sigh of relief and agreed that by some miracle the marriage had been saved both of them gained great credit from the fact and they became a popular couple with everything forgiven and forgotten the year passed and it was time for masters to go he announced that rhoda would stay behind to close the house and they went through the usual round of farewell parties we were a bit surprised that she didnt come to see him off in the ship but he said she wasnt feeling well so that was that until in a couple of weeks news of the divorce case began leaking back from england then rhoda masters turned up at government house and had a long interview with lady burford and gradually the whole story including its really terrible next chapter leaked out the governor swallowed the last of his whisky the ice made a hollow rattle as he put the glass softly down he said apparently on the day before masters left he found a note from his wife in the bathroom it said that she simply must see him for one last talk before he left her for ever there had been notes like this before and masters had always torn them up and left the bits on the shelf above the basin this time he scribbled a note giving her an appointment in the sittingroom at six oclock that evening when the time arrived rhoda masters came meekly in from the kitchen she had long since given up making emotional scenes or trying to throw herself on his mercy now she just quietly stood and said that she had only ten pounds left from that months housekeeping money and nothing else in the world when he left she would be destitute you have the jewels i gave you and the fur cape id be lucky if i got fifty pounds for them youll have to get some work itll take time to find something ive got to live somewhere i have to be out of the house in a fortnight wont you give me anything at all i shall starve masters looked at her dispassionately youre pretty youll never starve you must help me philip you must it wont help your career having me begging at government house nothing in the house belonged to them except a few odds and ends they had taken it furnished the owner had come the week before and agreed the inventory there only remained their car a morris that masters had bought second hand and a radiogramophone he had bought as a last resort to try and keep his wife amused before she took up golf philip masters looked at her for the last time he was never to see her again he said all right you can have the car and the radiogram now thats all ive got to pack goodbye and he walked out of the door and up to his room the governor looked across at bond at least one last little gesture yes the governor smiled grimly when he had gone and rhoda masters was left alone she took the car and her engagement ring and her few trinkets and the fox fur tippet and went into hamilton and drove round the pawnbrokers in the end she collected forty pounds for the jewellery and seven pounds for the bit of fur then she went to the car dealers whose nameplate was on the dashboard of the car and asked to see the manager when she asked how much he would give her for the morris he thought she was pulling his leg but madam mr masters bought the car by hire purchase and hes very badly behind on his payments surely he told you that we had to send him a solicitors letter about it only a week ago we heard he was leaving he wrote back that you would be coming in to make the necessary arrangements let me see he reached for a file and leafed through it yes theres exactly two hundred pounds owing on the car well of course rhoda masters burst into tears and in the end the manager agreed to take back the car although it wasnt worth two hundred pounds by then but he insisted that she should leave it with him then and there petrol in the tank and all rhoda masters could only accept and be grateful not to be sued and she walked out of the garage and along the hot street and already she knew what she was going to find when she got to the radio shop and she was right it was the same story only this time she had to pay ten pounds to persuade the man to take back the radiogram she got a lift back to within walking distance of the bungalow and went and threw herself down on the bed and cried for the rest of the day she had already been a beaten woman now philip masters had kicked her when she was down the governor paused pretty extraordinary really a man like masters kindly sensitive who wouldnt normally hurt a fly and here he was performing one of the cruellest actions i can recall in all my experience it was my law operating the governor smiled thinly whatever her sins if she had given him that quantum of solace he could never have behaved to her as he did as it was she had awakened in him a bestial cruelty a cruelty that perhaps lies deeply hidden in all of us and that only a threat to our existence can bring to the surface masters wanted to make the girl suffer not as much as he had suffered because that was impossible but as much as he could possibly contrive and that false gesture with the motor car and the radiogramophone was a fiendishly brilliant bit of delayed action to remind her even when he was gone how much he hated her how much he wanted still to hurt her bond said it must have been a shattering experience its extraordinary how much people can hurt each other im beginning to feel rather sorry for the girl what happened to her in the end and to him for the matter of that the governor got to his feet and looked at his watch good heavens its nearly midnight and ive been keeping the staff up all this time he smiled as well as you he walked across to the fireplace and rang a bell a negro butler appeared the governor apologized for keeping him up and told him to lock up and turn the light out bond was on his feet the governor turned to him come along and ill tell you the rest ill walk through the garden with you and see that the sentry lets you out they walked slowly through the long rooms and down the broad steps to the garden it was a beautiful night under a full moon that raced over their heads through the thin high clouds the governor said masters went on in the service but somehow he never lived up to his good start after the bermuda business something seemed to go out of ham part of him had been killed by the experience he was a maimed man mostly her fault of course but i guess that what he did to her lived on with him and perhaps haunted him he was good at his work but he had somehow lost the human touch and he gradually dried up of course he never married again and in the end he got shunted off into the ground nuts scheme and when that was a failure he retired and went to live in nigeria back to the only people in the world who had shown him any kindness back to where it had all started from bit tragic really when i remember what he was like when we were young and the girl oh she went through a pretty bad time we handed round the hat for her and she pottered in and out of various jobs that were more or less charity she tried to go back to being an air hostess but the way she had broken her contract with imperial airways put her out of the running for that there werent so many airlines in those days and there was no shortage of applicants for the few hostess jobs that were going the burfords got transferred to jamaica later in that same year and that removed her main prop as i said lady burford had always had a soft spot for her rhoda masters was pretty nearly destitute she still had her looks and various men had kept her for a while but you cant make the rounds for very long in a small place like bermuda and she was very near to becoming a harlot and getting into trouble with the police when providence again stepped in and decided she had been punished enough a letter came from lady burford enclosing her fare to jamaica and saying she had got her a job as receptionist at the blue hills hotel one of the best of the kingston hotels so she left and i expect id been transferred to rhodesia by then that bermuda was heartily relieved to see the last of her the governor and bond had come to the wide entrance gates to the grounds of government house beyond them shone white and black and pink under the moon the huddle of narrow streets and pretty clapboard houses with gingerbread gables and balconies that is nassau with a terrific clatter the sentry came to attention and presented arms the governor raised a hand all right stand at ease again the clockwork sentry rattled briefly into life and there was silence the governor said and thats the end of the story except for one final quirk of fate one day a canadian millionaire turned up at the blue hills hotel and stayed for the winter at the end of the time he took rhoda masters back to canada and married her shes lived in clover ever since good heavens that was a stroke of luck hardly deserved it i suppose not one cant tell lifes a devious business perhaps for all the harm shed done to masters fate decided that she had paid back enough perhaps masterss father and mother were the true guilty people they turned masters into an accidentprone man inevitably he was involved in the emotional crash that was due to him and that they had conditioned him for fate had chosen rhoda for its instrument now fate reimbursed her for her services difficult to judge these things anyway she made her canadian very happy i thought they both seemed happy tonight bond laughed suddenly the violent dramatics of his own life seemed very hollow the affair of the castro rebels and the burned out yachts was the stuff of an adventurestrip in a cheap newspaper he had sat next to a dull woman at a dull dinner party and a chance remark had opened for him the book of real violence of the comdie humaine where human passions are raw and real where fate plays a more authentic game than any secret service conspiracy devised by governments bond faced the governor and held out his hand he said thank you for the story and i owe you an apology i found mrs harvey miller a bore thanks to you i shall never forget her i must pay more attention to people youve taught me a lesson they shook hands the governor smiled im glad the story interested you i was afraid you might be bored you lead a very exciting life to tell you the truth i was at my wits end to know what we could talk about after dinner life in the colonial service is very humdrum they said goodnight bond walked off down the quiet street towards the harbour and the british colonial hotel he reflected on the conference he would be having in the morning with the coastguards and the fbi in miami the prospect which had previously interested even excited him was now edged with boredom and futility risico in this pizniss is much risico the words came softly through the thick brown moustache the hard black eyes moved slowly over bonds face and down to bonds hands which were carefully shredding a paper match on which was printed albergo colombo doro james bond felt the inspection the same surreptitious examination had been going on since he had met the man two hours before at the rendezvous in the excelsior bar bond had been told to look for a man with a heavy moustache who would be sitting by himself drinking an alexandra bond had been amused by this secret recognition signal the creamy feminine drink was so much cleverer than the folded newspaper the flower in the buttonhole the yellow gloves that were the hoary slipshod callsigns between agents it had also the great merit of being able to operate alone without its owner and kristatos had started off with a little test when bond had come into the bar and looked round there had been perhaps twenty people in the room none of them had a moustache but on a corner table at the far side of the tall discreet room flanked by a saucer of olives and another of cashew nuts stood the tallstemmed glass of cream and vodka bond went straight over to the table pulled out a chair and sat down the waiter came good evening sir signor kristatos is at the telephone bond nodded a negroni with gordons please the waiter walked back to the bar negroni uno gordons i am so sorry the big hairy hand picked up the small chair as if it had been as light as a matchbox and swept it under the heavy hips i had to have a word with alfredo there had been no handshake these were old acquaintances in the same line of business probably something like import and export the younger one looked american no not with those clothes english bond returned the fast serve hows his little boy the black eyes of signor kristatos narrowed yes they had said this man was a professional he spread his hands much the same what can you expect polio is a terrible thing the negroni came the two men sat back comfortably each one satisfied that he had to do with a man in the same league this was rare in the game so many times before one had even started on a tandem assignment like this one had lost confidence in the outcome there was so often at least in bonds imagination a faint smell of burning in the air at such a rendezvous he knew it for the sign that the fringe of his cover had already started to smoulder in due course the smouldering fabric would burst into flames and he would be brl then the game would be up and he would have to decide whether to pull out or wait and get shot at by someone but at this meeting there had been no fumbling later that evening at the little restaurant off the piazza di spagna called the colomba doro bond was amused to find that he was still on probation kristatos was still watching and weighing him wondering if he could be trusted this remark about the risky business was as near as kristatos had so far got to admitting that there existed any business between the two of them bond was encouraged he had not really believed in kristatos but surely all these precautions could only mean that ms intuition had paid off that kristatos knew something big bond dropped the last shred of match into the ashtray he said mildly i was once taught that any business that pays more than ten per cent or is conducted after nine oclock at night is a dangerous business the business which brings us together pays up to one thousand per cent and is conducted almost exclusively at night on both counts it is obviously a risky business bond lowered his voice funds are available dollars swiss francs venezuelan bolivars anything convenient that makes me glad i have already too much lire signor kristatos picked up the folio menu but let us feed on something one should not decide important pizniss on a hollow stomach a week earlier m had sent for bond m was in a bad temper got anything on only paper work sir what do you mean only paper work m jerked his pipe towards his loaded intray who hasnt got paper work i meant nothing active sir well say so m picked up a bundle of dark red files tied together with tape and slid them so sharply across the desk that bond had to catch them and heres some more paper work scotland yard stuff mostly their narcotics people wads from the home office and the ministry of health and some nice thick reports from the international opium control people in geneva take it away and read it youll need today and most of tonight tomorrow you fly to rome and get after the big men is that clear bond said that it was the state of ms temper was also explained there was nothing that made him more angry than having to divert his staff from their primary duty this duty was espionage and when necessary sabotage and subversion anything else was a misuse of the service and of secret funds which god knows were meagre enough any questions ms jaw stuck out like the prow of a ship the jaw seemed to tell bond to pick up the files and get the hell out of the office and let m move on to something important bond knew that a part of all this if only a small part was an act m had certain bees in his bonnet they were famous in the service and m knew they were but that did not mean that he would allow them to stop buzzing there were queen bees like the misuse of the service and the search for true as distinct from wishful intelligence and there were worker bees these included such idiosyncrasies as not employing men with beards or those who were completely bilingual instantly dismissing men who tried to bring pressure to bear on him through family relationships with members of the cabinet mistrusting men or women who were too dressy and those who called him sir offduty and having an exaggerated faith in scotsmen but m was ironically conscious of his obsessions as thought bond a churchill or a montgomery were about theirs he never minded his bluff as it partly was being called on any of them moreover he would never have dreamed of sending bond out on an assignment without proper briefing bond knew all this he said mildly two things sir why are we taking this thing on and what lead if any have station i got towards the people involved in it m gave bond a hard sour look he swivelled his chair sideways so that he could watch the high scudding october clouds through the broad window he reached out for his pipe blew through it sharply and then as if this action had let off the small head of steam replaced it gently on the desk when he spoke his voice was patient reasonable as you can imagine i do not wish the service to become involved in this drug business earlier this year i had to take you off other duties for a fortnight so that you could go to mexico and chase off that mexican grower you nearly got yourself killed i sent you as a favour to the special branch when they asked for you again to tackle this italian gang i refused ronnie vallance went behind my back to the home office and the ministry of health the ministers pressed me i said that you were needed here and that i had no one else to spare then the two ministers went to the pm m paused and that was that i must say the pm was very persuasive took the line that heroin in the quantities that have been coming in is an instrument of psychological warfare that it saps a countrys strength he said he wouldnt be surprised to find that this wasnt just a gang of italians out to make big money that subversion and not money was at the back of it m smiled sourly i expect ronnie vallance thought up that line of argument apparently his narcotics people have been having the devil of a time with the traffic trying to stop it getting a hold on the teenagers as it has in america seems the dance halls and the amusement arcades are full of pedlars vallances ghost squad have managed to penetrate back up the line to one of the middlemen and theres no doubt its all coming from italy hidden in italian tourists cars vallance has done what he can through the italian police and interpol and got nowhere they get so far back up the pipeline arrest a few little people and then when they seem to be getting near the centre theres a blank wall the inner ring of distributors are too frightened or too well paid bond interrupted perhaps theres protection somewhere sir that montesi business didnt look so good m shrugged impatiently maybe maybe and youll have to watch out for that too but my impression is that the montesi case resulted in a pretty extensive cleanup anyway when the pm gave me the order to get on with it it occurred to me to have a talk with washington cia were very helpful you know the narcotics bureau have a team in italy have had ever since the war theyre nothing to do with cia run by the american treasury department of all people the american treasury control a socalled secret service that looks after drug smuggling and counterfeiting pretty crazy arrangement often wonder what the fbi must think of it however m slowly swivelled his chair away from the window he linked his hands behind his head and leaned back looking across the desk at bond the point is that the cia rome station works pretty closely with this little narcotics team has to to prevent crossed lines and so on and cia alan dulles himself as a matter of fact gave me the name of the top narcotics agent used by the bureau apparently hes a double does a little smuggling as cover chap called kristatos dulles said that of course he couldnt involve his people in any way and he was pretty certain the treasury department wouldnt welcome their rome bureau playing too closely with us but he said that if i wished he would get word to this kristatos that one of our er best men would like to make contact with a view to doing business i said i would much appreciate that and yesterday i got word that the rendezvous is fixed for the day after tomorrow m gestured towards the files in front of bond youll find all the details in there there was a brief silence in the room bond was thinking that the whole affair sounded unpleasant probably dangerous and certainly dirty with the last quality in mind bond got to his feet and picked up the files all right sir it looks like money how much will we pay for the traffic to stop m let his chair tip forward he put his hands flat down on the desk side by side he said roughly a hundred thousand pounds in any currency thats the pms figure but i dont want you to get hurt certainly not picking other peoples coals out of the fire so you can go up to another hundred thousand if theres bad trouble drugs are the biggest and tightest ring in crime m reached for his inbasket and took out a file of signals without looking up he said look after yourself signor kristatos picked up the menu he said i do not beat about bushes mr bond how much fifty thousand pounds for one hundred per cent results kristatos said indifferently yes those are important funds i shall have melon with prosciutto ham and a chocolate icecream i do not eat greatly at night these people have their own chianti i commend it the waiter came and there was a brisk rattle of italian bond ordered tagliatelli verdi with a genoese sauce which kristatos said was improbably concocted of basil garlic and fir cones when the waiter had gone kristatos sat and chewed silently on a wooden toothpick his face gradually became dark and glum as if bad weather had come to his mind the black hard eyes that glanced restlessly at everything in the restaurant except bond glittered bond guessed that kristatos was wondering whether or not to betray somebody bond said encouragingly in certain circumstances there might be more kristatos seemed to make up his mind he said so he pushed back his chair and got up forgive me i must visit the toiletta he turned and walked swiftly towards the back of the restaurant bond was suddenly hungrier and thirsty he poured out a large glass of chianti and swallowed half of it he broke a roll and began eating smothering each mouthful with deep yellow butter he wondered why rolls and butter are delicious only in france and italy there was nothing else on his mind it was just a question of waiting he had confidence in kristatos he was a big solid man who was trusted by the americans he was probably making some telephone call that would be decisive bond felt in good spirits he watched the passersby through the plateglass window a man selling one of the party papers went by on a bicycle flying from the basket in front of the handlebars was a pennant in red on white it said progresso si avventuri no bond smiled that was how it was let it so remain for the rest of the assignment on the far side of the square rather plain room at the corner table by the caisse the plump fairhaired girl with the dramatic mouth said to the jovial goodliving man with the thick rope of spaghetti joining his face to the plate he has a rather cruel smile but he is very handsome spies arent usually so goodlooking are you sure you are right mein tubchen the mans teeth cut through the rope he wiped his mouth on a napkin already streaked with tomato sauce belched sonorously and said santos is never wrong about these things he has a nose for spies that is why i chose him as the permanent tail for that bastard kristatos and who else but a spy would think of spending an evening with the pig but we will make sure the man took out of his pocket one of those cheap tin snappers that are sometimes given out with paper hats and whistles on carnival nights it gave one sharp click the maњtre dhtel on the far side of the room stopped whatever he was doing and hurried over si padrone the man beckoned the maњtre dhtel went over and received the whispered instructions he nodded briefly walked over to a door near the kitchens marked ufficio and went in and closed the door behind him phase by phase in a series of minute moves an exercise that had long been perfected was then smoothly put into effect the man near the caisse munched his spaghetti and critically observed each step in the operation as if it had been a fast game of chess the maњtre dhtel came out of the door marked ufficio hurried across the restaurant and said loudly to his no an extra table for four immediately the no gave him a direct look and nodded he followed the maњtre dhtel over to a space adjoining bonds table clicked his fingers for help borrowed a chair from one table a chair from another table and with a bow and an apology the spare chair from bonds table the fourth chair was being carried over from the direction of the door marked ufficio by the maњtre dhtel he placed it square with the others a table was lowered into the middle and glass and cutlery were deftly laid the maњtre dhtel frowned but you have laid a table for four i said three for three people he casually took the chair he had himself brought to the table and switched it to bonds table he gave a wave of the hand to dismiss his helpers and everyone dispersed about their business the innocent little flurry of restaurant movement had taken about a minute an innocuous trio of italians came into the restaurant the maњtre dhtel greeted them personally and bowed them to the new table and the gambit was completed bond had hardly been conscious of it kristatos returned from whatever business he had been about their food came and they got on with the meal while they ate they talked about nothing the election chances in italy the latest alfa romeo italian shoes compared with english kristatos talked well he seemed to know the inside story of everything he gave information so casually that it did not sound like bluff he spoke his own kind of english with an occasional phrase borrowed from other languages it made a lively mixture bond was interested and amused kristatos was a tough insider a useful man bond was not surprised that the american intelligence people found him good value coffee came kristatos lit a thin black cigar and talked through it the cigar jumping up and down between the thin straight lips he put both hands flat on the table in front of him he looked at the tablecloth between them and said softly this pizniss i will play with you to now i have only played with the americans i have not told them what i am about to tell you there was no requirement this machina does not operate with america these things are closely regulated this machina operates only with england yes capito i understand everyone has his own territory its the usual way in these things exact now before i give you the informations like good commercials we make the terms yes of course signor kristatos examined the tablecloth more closely i wish for ten thousand dollars american in paper of small sizes by tomorrow lunchtime when you have destroyed the machina i wish for a further twenty thousand signor kristatos briefly raised his eyes and surveyed bonds face i am not greedy i do not take all your funds isnt it the price is satisfactory bueno second term there is no telling where you get these informations from even if you are beaten fair enough third term the head of this machina is a bad man signor kristatos paused and looked up the black eyes held a red glint the clenched dry lips pulled away from the cigar to let the words out he is to be destrutto killed bond sat back he gazed quizzically at the other man who now leaned slightly forward over the table waiting so the wheels had now shown within the wheels this was a private vendetta of some sort kristatos wanted to get himself a gunman and he was not paying the gunman the gunman was paying him for the privilege of disposing of an enemy not bad the fixer was certainly working on a big fix this time using the secret service to pay off his private scores bond said softly why signor kristatos said indifferently no questions catch no lies bond drank down his coffee it was the usual story of big syndicate crime you never saw more than the tip of the iceberg but what did that matter to him he had been sent to do one specific job if his success benefited others nobody least of all m could care less bond had been told to destroy the machine if this unnamed man was the machine it would be merely carrying out orders to destroy the man bond said i cannot promise that you must see that all i can say is that if the man tries to destroy me i will destroy him signor kristatos took a toothpick out of the holder stripped off the paper and set about cleaning his fingernails when he had finished one hand he looked up he said i do not often gamble on incertitudes this time i will do so because it is you who are paying me and not me you is all right so now i will give you the informations then you are alone solo tomorrow night i fly to karachi i have important pizniss there i can only give you the informations after that you run with the ball and he threw the dirty toothpick down on the table che sera sera all right signor kristatos edged his chair nearer to bond he spoke softly and quickly he gave specimen dates and names to document his narrative he never hesitated for a fact and he did not waste time on irrelevant detail it was a short story and a pithy one there were two thousand american gangsters in the country italianamericans who had been convicted and expelled from the united states these men were in a bad way they were on the blackest of all police lists and because of their records their own people were wary of employing them a hundred of the toughest among them had pooled their funds and small groups from this elite had moved to beirut istanbul tangier and macao the great smuggling centres of the world a further large section acted as couriers and the bosses had acquired through nominees a small and respectable pharmaceutical business in milan to this centre the outlying groups smuggled opium and its derivatives they used small craft across the mediterranean a group of stewards in an italian charter airline and as a regular weekly source of supply the through carriage of the orient express in which whole sections of bogus upholstery were fitted by bribed members of the train cleaners in istanbul the milan firm pharmacia colomba sa acted as a clearinghouse and as a convenient centre for breaking down the raw opium into heroin thence the couriers using innocent motor cars of various makes ran a delivery service to the middlemen in england bond interrupted our customs are pretty good at spotting that sort of traffic there arent many hiding places in a car they dont know about where do these men carry the stuff always in the spare wheel you can carry twenty thousand pounds worth of heroin in one spare wheel dont they ever get caught either bringing the stuff in to milan or taking it on certainly many times but these are welltrained men and they are tough they never talk if they are convicted they receive ten thousand dollars for each year spent in prison if they have families they are cared for and when all goes well they make good money it is a cooperative each man receives his tranche of the brutto only the chief gets a special tranche all right well who is this man signor kristatos put his hand up to the cheroot in his mouth he kept the hand there and spoke softly from behind it is a man they call the dove enrico colombo is the padrone of this restaurant that is why i bring you here so that you may see him is the fat man who sits with a blonde woman at the table by the cassa she is from vienna her name is lisl baum a luxus whore bond said reflectively she is is she he did not need to look he had noticed the girl as soon as he had sat down at the table every man in the restaurant would have noticed her she had the gay bold forthcoming looks the viennese are supposed to have and seldom do there was a vivacity and a charm about her that lit up her corner of the room she had the wildest possible urchin cut in ash blonde a pert nose a wide laughing mouth and a black ribbon round her throat james bond knew that her eyes had been on him at intervals throughout the evening her companion had seemed just the type of rich cheerful goodliving man she would be glad to have as her lover for a while he would give her a good time he would be generous there would be no regrets on either side on the whole bond had vaguely approved of him he liked cheerful expansive people with a zest for life since he bond could not have the girl it was at least something that she was in good hands but now bond glanced across the room the couple were laughing about something the man patted her cheek and got up and went to the door marked ufficio and went through and shut the door so this was the man who ran the great pipeline into england the man with ms price of a hundred thousand pounds on his head the man kristatos wanted bond to kill well he had better get on with the job bond stared rudely across the room at the girl when she lifted her head and looked at him he smiled at her her eyes swept past him but there was a half smile as if for herself on her lips and when she took a cigarette out of her case and lit it and blew the smoke straight up towards the ceiling there was an offering of the throat and the profile that bond knew were for him it was nearing the time for the aftercinema trade the maњtre dhtel was supervising the clearing of the unoccupied tables and the setting up of new ones there was the usual bustle and slapping of napkins across chairseats and tinkle of glass and cutlery being laid vaguely bond noticed the spare chair at his table being whisked away to help build up a nearby table for six he began asking kristatos specific questions the personal habits of enrico colombo where he lived the address of his firm in milan what other business interests he had he did not notice the casual progress of the spare chair from its fresh table to another and then to another and finally through the door marked ufficio there was no reason why he should when the chair was brought into his office enrico colombo waved the maњtre dhtel away and locked the door behind him then he went to the chair and lifted off the squab cushion and put it on his desk he unzipped one side of the cushion and withdrew a grundig taperecorder stopped the machine ran the tape back took it off the recorder and put it on a playback and adjusted the speed and volume then he sat down at his desk and lit a cigarette and listened occasionally making further adjustments and occasionally repeating passages at the end when bonds tinny voice said she is is she and there was a long silence interspersed with background noises from the restaurant enrico colombo switched off the machine and sat looking at it he looked at it for a full minute his face showed nothing but acute concentration on his thoughts then he looked away from the machine and into nothing and said softly out loud sonabeech he got slowly to his feet and went to the door and unlocked it he looked back once more at the grundig said sonabeech again with more emphasis and went out and back to his table enrico colombo spoke swiftly and urgently to the girl she nodded and glanced across the room at bond he and kristatos were getting up from the table she said to colombo in a low angry voice you are a disgusting man everybody said so and warned me against you they were right just because you give me dinner in your lousy restaurant you think you have the right to insult me with your filthy propositions the girls voice had got louder now she had snatched up her handbag and had got to her feet she stood beside the table directly in the line of bonds approach on his way to the exit enrico colombos face was black with rage now he too was on his feet you goddam austrian beech dont dare insult my country you italian toad she reached for a halffull glass of wine and hurled it accurately in the mans face when he came at her it was easy for her to back the few steps into bond who was standing with kristatos politely waiting to get by enrico colombo stood panting wiping the wine off his face with a napkin he said furiously to the girl dont ever show your face inside my restaurant again he made the gesture of spitting on the floor between them turned and strode off through the door marked ufficio the maњtre dhtel had hurried up everyone in the restaurant had stopped eating bond took the girl by the elbow may i help you find a taxi she jerked herself free she said still angry all men are pigs she remembered her manners she said stiffly you are very kind she moved haughtily towards the door with the men in her wake there was a buzz in the restaurant and a renewed clatter of knives and forks everyone was delighted with the scene the maњtre dhtel looking solemn held open the door he said to bond i apologize monsieur and you are very kind to be of assistance a cruising taxi slowed he beckoned it to the pavement and held open the door the girl got in bond firmly followed and closed the door he said to kristatos through the window ill telephone you in the morning all right without waiting for the mans reply he sat back in the seat the girl had drawn herself away into the farthest corner bond said where shall i tell him hotel ambassadori they drove a short way in silence bond said would you like to go somewhere first for a drink no thank you she hesitated you are very kind but tonight i am tired perhaps another night perhaps but i go to venice tomorrow i shall also be there will you have dinner with me tomorrow night the girl smiled she said i thought englishmen were supposed to be shy you are english arent you what is your name what do you do yes im english my names bond james bond i write books adventure stories im writing one now about drug smuggling its set in rome and venice the trouble is that i dont know enough about the trade i am going round picking up stories about it do you know any so that is why you were having dinner with that kristatos i know of him he has a bad reputation no i dont know any stories i only know what everybody knows bond said enthusiastically but thats exactly what i want when i said stories i didnt mean fiction i meant the sort of highlevel gossip thats probably pretty near the truth that sort of things worth diamonds to a writer she laughed you mean that diamonds bond said well i dont earn all that as a writer but ive already sold an option on this story for a film and if i can make it authentic enough i dare say theyll actually buy the film he reached out and put his hand over hers in her lap she did not take her hand away yes diamonds a diamond clip from van cleef is it a deal now she took her hand away they were arriving at the ambassadori she picked up her bag from the seat beside her she turned on the seat so that she faced him the commissionaire opened the door and the light from the street turned her eyes into stars she examined his face with a certain seriousness she said all men are pigs but some are lesser pigs than others all right i will meet you but not for dinner what i may tell you is not for public places i bathe every afternoon at the lido but not at the fashionable plage i bathe at the bagni alberoni where the english poet byron used to ride his horse it is at the tip of the peninsula the vaporetto will take you there you will find me there the day after tomorrow at three in the afternoon i shall be getting my last sunburn before the winter among the sanddunes you will see a pale yellow umbrella underneath it will be me she smiled knock on the umbrella and ask for fraulein lisl baum she got out of the taxi bond followed she held out her hand thank you for coming to my rescue goodnight bond said three oclock then i shall be there goodnight she turned and walked up the curved steps of the hotel bond looked after her thoughtfully and then turned and got back into the taxi and told the man to take him to the nazionale he sat back and watched the neon signs ribbon past the window things including the taxi were going almost too fast for comfort the only one over which he had any control was the taxi he leant forward and told the man to drive more slowly the best train from rome to venice is the laguna express that leaves every day at midday bond after a morning that was chiefly occupied with difficult talks with his london headquarters on station is scrambler caught it by the skin of his teeth the laguna is a smart streamlined affair that looks and sounds more luxurious than it is the seats are made for small italians and the restaurant car staff suffer from the disease that afflicts their brethren in the great trains all over the world a genuine loathing for the modern traveller and particularly for the foreigner bond had a gangway seat over the axle in the rear aluminium coach if the seven heavens had been flowing by outside the window he would not have cared he kept his eyes inside the train read a jerking book spilled chianti over the tablecloth and shifted his long aching legs and cursed the ferrovie italiane dello stato but at last there was mestre and the dead straight finger of rail across the eighteenth century aquatint into venice then came the unfailing shock of the beauty that never betrays and the soft swaying progress down the grand canal into a bloodred sunset and the extreme pleasure so it seemed of the gritti palace that bond should have ordered the best double room on the first floor that evening scattering thousandlira notes like leaves in vallombrosa james bond sought at harrys bar at florians and finally upstairs in the admirable quadri to establish to anyone who might be interested that he was what he had wished to appear to the girl a prosperous writer who lived high and well then in the temporary state of euphoria that a first night in venice engenders however high and serious the purpose of the visitor james bond walked back to the gritti and had eight hours dreamless sleep may and october are the best months in venice the sun is soft and the nights are cool the glittering scene is kinder to the eyes and there is a freshness in the air that helps one to hammer out those long miles of stone and terrazza and marble that are intolerable to the feet in summer and there are fewer people although venice is the one town in the world that can swallow up a hundred thousand tourists as easily as it can a thousand hiding them down its sidestreets using them for crowd scenes on the piazzas stuffing them into the vaporetti it is still better to share venice with the minimum number of packaged tours and lederhosen bond spent the next morning strolling the backstreets in the hope that he would be able to uncover a tail he visited a couple of churches not to admire their interiors but to discover if anyone came in after him through the main entrance before he left by the side door no one was following him bond went to florians and had an americano and listened to a couple of french culturesnobs discussing the imbalance of the containing facade of st marks square on an impulse he bought a postcard and sent it off to his secretary who had once been with the georgian group to italy and had never allowed bond to forget it he wrote venice is wonderful have so far inspected the railway station and the stock exchange very aesthetically satisfying to the municipal waterworks this afternoon and then an old brigitte bardot at the scala cinema do you know a wonderful tune called o sole mio its v romantic like everything here jb pleased with his inspiration bond had an early luncheon and went back to his hotel he locked the door of his room and took off his coat and ran over the walther ppk he put up the safe and practised one or two quick draws and put the gun back in the holster it was time to go he went along to the landingstage and boarded the twelveforty vaporetto to alberoni out of sight across the mirrored lagoons then he settled down in a seat in the bows and wondered what was going to happen to him from the jetty at alberoni on the venice side of the lido peninsula there is a half mile dusty walk across the neck of land to the bagni alberoni facing the adriatic it is a curiously deserted world this tip of the famous peninsula a mile down the thin neck of land the luxury real estate development has petered out in a scattering of cracked stucco villas and bankrupt housing projects and here there is nothing but the tiny fishing village of alberoni a sanatorium for students a derelict experimental station belonging to the italian navy and some massive weedchoked gun emplacements from the last war in the no mans land in the centre of this thin tongue of land is the golf du lido whose brownish undulating fairways meander around the ruins of ancient fortifications not many people come to venice to play golf and the project is kept alive for its snob appeal by the grand hotels of the lido the golf course is surrounded by a high wire fence hung at intervals as if it protected something of great value or secrecy with threatening vietatos and prohibitos around this wired enclave the scrub and sandhills have not even been cleared of mines and amongst the rusting barbed wire are signs saying minas pericolo di morte beneath a roughly stencilled skull and crossbones the whole area is strange and melancholy and in extraordinary contrast to the gay carnival world of venice less than an hour away across the lagoons bond was sweating slightly by the time he had walked the half mile across the peninsula to the plage and he stood for a moment under the last of the acacia trees that had bordered the dusty road to cool off while he got his bearings in front of him was a rickety wooden archway whose central span said bagni alberoni in faded blue paint beyond were the lines of equally dilapidated wooden cabins and then a hundred yards of sand and then the quiet blue glass of the sea there were no bathers and the place seemed to be closed but when he walked through the archway he heard the tinny sound of a radio playing neapolitan music it came from a ramshackle hut that advertised cocacola and various italian soft drinks deckchairs were stacked against its walls and there were two pedallos and a childs half inflated seahorse the whole establishment looked so derelict that bond could not imagine it doing business even at the height of the summer season he stepped off the narrow duckboards into the soft burned sand and moved round behind the huts to the beach he walked down to the edge of the sea to the left until it disappeared in the autumn heat haze the wide empty sand swept away in a slight curve towards the lido proper to the right was half a mile of beach terminating in the seawall at the tip of the peninsula the seawall stretched like a finger out into the silent mirrored sea and at intervals along its top were the flimsy derricks of the octopus fishermen behind the beach were the sandhills and a section of the wire fence surrounding the golf course on the edge of the sandhills perhaps five hundred yards away there was a speck of bright yellow bond set off towards it along the tideline ahem the hands flew to the top scrap of bikini and pulled it up bond walked into her line of vision and stood looking down the bright shadow of the umbrella covered only her face the rest of her a burned cream body in a black bikini on a black and white striped bathtowel lay offered to the sun she looked up at him through half closed eyelashes you are five minutes early and i told you to knock bond sat down close to her in the shade of the big umbrella he took out a handkerchief and wiped his face you happen to own the only palm tree in the whole of this desert i had to get underneath it as soon as i could this is the hell of a place for a rendezvous she laughed i am like greta garbo i like to be alone are we alone she opened her eyes wide why not you think i have brought a chaperone since you think all men are pigs ah but you are a gentleman pig she giggled a milord pig and anyway it is too hot for that kind of thing and there is too much sand and besides this is a business meeting no i tell you stories about drugs and you give me a diamond clip from van cleef or have you changed your mind no thats how it is where shall we begin you ask the questions what is it you want to know she sat up and pulled her knees to her between her arms flirtation had gone out of her eyes and they had become attentive and perhaps a little careful bond noticed the change he said casually watching her they say your friend colombo is a big man in the game tell me about him he would make a good character for my book disguised of course but its the detail i need how does he operate and so on thats not the sort of thing a writer can invent she veiled her eyes she said enrico would be very angry if he knew that i had told any of his secrets i dont know what he would do to me he will never know she looked at him seriously lieber mr bond there is very little that he does not know and he is also quite capable of acting on a guess i would not be surprised bond caught her quick glance at his watch if it had crossed his mind to have me followed here he is a very suspicious man she put her hand out and touched his sleeve now she looked nervous she said urgently i think you had better go now this has been a great mistake bond openly looked at his watch it was threethirty he moved his head so that he could look behind the umbrella and back down the beach far down by the bathing huts their outlines dancing slightly in the heat haze were three men in dark clothes they were walking purposefully up the beach their feet keeping step as if they were a squad bond got to his feet he looked down at the bent head he said drily i see what you mean just tell colombo that from now on im writing his lifestory and im a very persistent writer so long bond started running up the sand towards the tip of the peninsula from there he could double back down the other shore to the village and the safety of people down the beach the three men broke into a fast jogtrot elbows and legs pounding in time with each other as if they were longdistance runners out for a training spin as they jogged past the girl one of the men raised a hand she raised hers in answer and then lay down on the sand and turned over perhaps so that her back could now get its toasting or perhaps because she did not want to watch the manhunt bond took off his tie as he ran and put it in his pocket it was very hot and he was already sweating profusely but so would the three men be it was a question who was in better training at the tip of the peninsula bond clambered up on to the seawall and looked back the men had hardly gained but now two of them were fanning out to cut round the edge of the golf course boundary they did not seem to mind the danger notices with the skull and crossbones bond running fast down the wide seawall measured angles and distances the two men were cutting across the base of the triangle it was going to be a close call bonds shirt was already soaked and his feet were beginning to hurt he had run perhaps a mile how much farther to safety at intervals along the seawall the breeches of antique cannon had been sunk in the concrete they would be mooring posts for the fishing fleets sheltering in the protection of the lagoons before taking to the adriatic bond counted his steps between two of them fifty yards how many black knobs to the end of the wall to the first houses of the village bond counted up to thirty before the line vanished into the heat haze probably another mile to go could he do it and fast enough to beat the two flankers bonds breath was already rasping in his throat now even his suit was soaked with sweat and the cloth of his trousers was chafing his legs behind him three hundred yards back was one pursuer to his right dodging among the sanddunes and converging fast were the other two to his left was a twentyfoot slope of masonry to the green tide ripping out into the adriatic bond was planning to slow down to a walk and keep enough breath to try and shoot it out with the three men when two things happened in quick succession first he saw through the haze ahead a group of spearfishermen there were about half a dozen of them some in the water and some sunning themselves on the seawall then from the sanddunes came the deep roar of an explosion earth and scrub and what might have been bits of a man fountained briefly into the air and a small shockwave hit him bond slowed the other man in the dunes had stopped he was standing stockstill his mouth was open and a frightened jabber came from it suddenly he collapsed on the ground with his arms wapped round his head bond knew the signs he would not move again until someone came and carried him away from there bonds heart lifted now he had only about two hundred yards to go to the fishermen they were already gathering into a group looking towards him bond summoned a few words of italian and rehearsed them mi ingles prego dove il carabinieri bond glanced over his shoulder odd but despite the witnessing spearfishers the man was still coming on he had gained and was only about a hundred yards behind there was a gun in his hand now ahead the fishermen had fanned out across bonds path they had harpoon guns held at the ready in the centre was a big man with a tiny red bathingslip hanging beneath his stomach a green mask was slipped back on to the crown of his head he stood with his blue swimfins pointing out and his arms akimbo he looked like mr toad of toad hall in technicolor bonds amused thought died in him stillborn panting he slowed to a walk automatically his sweaty hand felt under his coat for the gun and drew it out the man in the centre of the arc of pointing harpoons was enrico colombo colombo watched him approach when he was twenty yards away colombo said quietly put away your toy mr bond of the secret service these are co harpoon guns and stay where you are unless you wish to make a copy of mantegnas st sebastian he turned to the man on his right he spoke in english at what range was that albanian last week twenty yards padrone and the harpoon went right through but he was a fat man perhaps twice as thick as this one bond stopped one of the iron bollards was beside him he sat down and rested the gun on his knee it pointed at the centre of colombos big stomach he said five harpoons in me wont stop one bullet in you colombo colombo smiled and nodded and the man who had been coming softly up behind bond hit him once hard in the base of the skull with the butt of his luger when you come to from being hit on the head the first reaction is a fit of vomiting even in his wretchedness bond was aware of two sensations he was in a ship at sea and someone a man was wiping his forehead with a cool wet towel and murmuring encouragement in bad english is okay amigo take him easy take him easy bond fell back on his bunk exhausted it was a comfortable small cabin with a feminine smell and dainty curtains and colours a sailor in a tattered vest and trousers bond thought he recognized him as one of the spearfishermen was bending over him he smiled when bond opened his eyes is better yes subito okay he rubbed the back of his neck in sympathy it hurts for a little soon it will only be a black beneath the hair the girls will see nothing bond smiled feebly and nodded the pain of the nod made him screw up his eyes when he opened them the sailor shook his head in admonition he brought his wristwatch close up to bonds eyes it said seven oclock he pointed with his little finger at the figure nine mangiare con padrone si bond said si the man put his hand to his cheek and laid his head on one side dormire bond said si again and the sailor went out of the cabin and closed the door without locking it bond got gingerly off the bunk and went over to the wash basin and set about cleaning himself on top of the chest of drawers was a neat pile of his personal belongings everything was there except his gun bond stowed the things away in his pockets and sat down again on the bunk and smoked and thought his thoughts were totally inconclusive he was being taken for a ride or rather a sail but from the behaviour of the sailor it did not seem that he was regarded as an enemy yet a great deal of trouble had been taken to make him prisoner and one of colombos men had even though inadvertently died in the process it did not seem to be just a question of killing him perhaps this soft treatment was the preliminary to trying to make a deal with him what was the deal and what was the alternative at nine oclock the same sailor came for bond and led him down a short passage to a small blowzy saloon and left him there was a table and two chairs in the middle of the room and beside the table a nickelplated trolley laden with food and drinks bond tried the hatchway at the end of the saloon it was bolted he unlatched one of the portholes and looked out there was just enough light to see that the ship was about two hundred tons and might once have been a large fishingvessel the engine sounded like a single diesel and they were carrying sail bond estimated the ships speed at six or seven knots on the dark horizon there was a tiny cluster of yellow lights it seemed probable that they were sailing down the adriatic coast the hatchway bolt rattled back bond pulled in his head colombo came down the steps he was dressed in a sweatshirt dungarees and scuffed sandals there was a wicked amused gleam in his eyes he sat down in one chair and waved to the other come my friend food and drink and plenty of talk we will now stop behaving like little boys and be grownup yes what will you have gin whisky champagne and this is the finest sausage in the whole of bologna olives from my own estate bread butter provelone that is smoked cheese and fresh figs peasant food but good come all that running must have given you an appetite his laugh was infectious bond poured himself a stiff whisky and soda and sat down he said why did you have to go to so much trouble we could have met with out all these dramatics as it is you have prepared a lot of grief for yourself i warned my chief that something like this might happen the way the girl picked me up in your restaurant was too childish for words i said that i would walk into the trap to see what it was all about if i am not out of it again by tomorrow midday youll have interpol as well as italian police on top of you like a load of bricks colombo looked puzzled he said if you were ready to walk into the trap why did you try and escape from my men this afternoon i had sent them to fetch you and bring you to my ship and it would all have been much more friendly now i have lost a good man and you might easily have had your skull broken i do not understand i didnt like the look of those three men i know killers when i see them i thought you might be thinking of doing something stupid you should have used the girl the men were unnecessary colombo shook his head lisl was willing to find out more about you but nothing else she will now be just as angry with me as you are life is very difficult i like to be friends with everyone and now i have made two enemies in one afternoon it is too bad colombo looked genuinely sorry for himself he cut a thick slice of sausage impatiently tore the rind off it with his teeth and began to eat while his mouth was still full he took a glass of champagne and washed the sausage down with it he said shaking his head reproachfully at bond it is always the same when i am worried i have to eat but the food that i eat when i am worried i cannot digest and now you have worried me you say that we could have met and talked things over that i need not have taken all this trouble he spread his hands helplessly how was i to know that by saying that you put the blood of mario on my hands i did not tell him to take a short cut through that place colombo pounded the table now he shouted angrily at bond i do not agree that this was all my fault it was your fault yours only you had agreed to kill me how does one arrange a friendly meeting with ones murderer eh just tell me that colombo snatched up a long roll of bread and stuffed it into his mouth his eyes furious what the hell are you talking about colombo threw the remains of the roll on the table and got to his feet holding bonds eyes locked in his he walked sideways still gazing fixedly at bond to a chest of drawers felt for the knob of the top drawer opened it groped and lifted out what bond recognized as a taperecorder playback machine still looking accusingly at bond he brought the machine over to the table he sat down and pressed a switch when bond heard the voice he picked up his glass of whisky and looked into it the tinny voice said exact now before i give you the informations like good commercials we make the terms yes the voice went on ten thousand dollars american there is no telling where you get these informations from even if you are beaten the head of this machina is a bad man he is to be destrutto killed bond waited for his own voice to break through the restaurant noises there had been a long pause while he thought about the last condition what was it he had said his voice came out of the machine answering him i cannot promise that you must see that all i can say is that if the man tries to destroy me i will destroy him colombo switched off the machine bond swallowed down his whisky now he could look up at colombo he said defensively that doesnt make me a murderer colombo looked at him sorrowfully to me it does coming from an englishman i worked for the english during the war in the resistance i have the kings medal he put his hand in his pocket and threw the silver freedom medal with the red white and blue striped ribbon on to the table you see bond obstinately held colombos eyes he said and the rest of the stuff on that tape you long ago stopped working for the english now you work against them for money colombo grunted he tapped the machine with his forefinger he said impassively i have heard it all it is lies he banged his fist on the table so that the glasses jumped he bellowed furiously it is lies lies every word of it he jumped to his feet his chair crashed down behind him he slowly bent and picked it up he reached for the whisky bottle and walked round and poured four fingers into bonds glass he went back to his chair and sat down and put the champagne bottle on the table in front of him now his face was composed serious he said quietly it is not all lies there is a grain of truth in what that bastard told you that is why i decided not to argue with you you might not have believed me you would have dragged in the police there would have been much trouble for me and my comrades even if you or someone else had not found reason to kill me there would have been scandal ruin instead i decided to show you the truth the truth you were sent to italy to find out within a matter of hours tomorrow at dawn your mission will have been completed colombo clicked his fingers presto like that bond said what part of kristatoss story is not lies colombos eyes looked into bonds calculating finally he said my friend i am a smuggler that part is true i am probably the most successful smuggler in the mediterranean half the american cigarettes in italy are brought in by me from tangier gold i am the sole supplier of the black valuta market diamonds i have my own purveyor in beirut with direct lines to sierra leone and south africa in the old days when these things were scarce i also handled aureomycin and penicillin and such medicines bribery at the american base hospitals and there have been many other things even beautiful girls from syria and persia for the houses of naples i have also smuggled out escaped convicts but colombos fist crashed on the table drugs heroin opium hemp no never i will have nothing to do with these things these things are evil there is no sin in the others colombo held up his right hand my friend this i swear to you on the head of my mother bond was beginning to see daylight he was prepared to believe colombo he even felt a curious liking for this greedy boisterous pirate who had so nearly been put on the spot by kristatos bond said but why did kristatos put the finger on you whats he got to gain colombo slowly shook a finger to and fro in front of his nose he said my friend kristatos is kristatos he is playing the biggest double game it is possible to conceive to keep it up to keep the protection of american intelligence and their narcotics people he must now and then throw them a victim some small man on the fringe of the big game but with this english problem it is different that is a huge traffic to protect it a big victim was required i was chosen by kristatos or by his employers and it is true that if you had been vigorous in your investigations and had spent enough hard currency on buying information you might have discovered the story of my operations but each trail towards me would have led you further away from the truth in the end for i do not underestimate your service i would have gone to prison but the big fox you are after would only be laughing at the sound of the hunt dying away in the distance why did kristatos want you killed colombo looked cunning my friend i know too much in the fraternity of smugglers we occasionally stumble on a corner of the next mans business not long ago in this ship i had a running fight with a small gunboat from albania a lucky shot set fire to their fuel there was only one survivor he was persuaded to talk i learnt much but like a fool i took a chance with the minefields and set him ashore on the coast north of tirana it was a mistake ever since then i have had this bastard kristatos after me fortunately colombo grinned wolfishly i have one piece of information he does not know of and we have a rendezvous with this piece of information at first light tomorrow at a small fishingport just north of ancona santa maria and there colombo gave a harsh cruel laugh we shall see what we shall see bond said mildly whats your price for all this you say my mission will have been completed tomorrow morning how much colombo shook his head he said indifferently nothing it just happens that our interests coincide but i shall need your promise that what i have told you this evening is between you and me and if necessary your chief in london it must never come back to italy is that agreed yes i agree to that colombo got to his feet he went to the chest of drawers and took out bonds gun he handed it to bond in that case my friend you had better have this because you are going to need it and you had better get some sleep there will be rum and coffee for everyone at five in the morning he held out his hand bond took it suddenly the two men were friends bond felt the fact he said awkwardly all right colombo and went out of the saloon and along to his cabin the colombina had a crew of twelve they were youngish toughlooking men they talked softly among themselves as the mugs of hot coffee and rum were dished out by colombo in the saloon a storm lantern was the only light the ship had been darkened and bond smiled to himself at the treasure island atmosphere of excitement and conspiracy colombo went from man to man on a weapon inspection they all had lugers carried under the jersey inside the trouserband and flickknives in the pocket colombo had a word of approval or criticism for each weapon it struck bond that colombo had made a good life for himself a life of adventure and thrill and risk it was a criminal life a running fight with the currency laws the state tobacco monopoly the customs the police but there was a whiff of adolescent rascality in the air which somehow changed the colour of the crime from black to white or at least to grey colombo looked at his watch he dismissed the men to their posts he dowsed the lantern and in the oyster light of dawn bond followed him up to the bridge he found the ship was close to a black rocky shore which they were following at reduced speed colombo pointed ahead round that headland is the harbour our approach will not have been observed in the harbour against the jetty i expect to find a ship of about this size unloading innocent rolls of newsprint down a ramp into a warehouse round the headland we will put on full speed and come alongside this ship and board her there will be resistance heads will be broken i hope it is not shooting we shall not shoot unless they do but it will be an albanian ship manned by a crew of albanian toughs if there is shooting you must shoot well with the rest of us these people are enemies of your country as well as mine if you get killed you get killed okay thats all right as bond said the words there came a ting on the engineroom telegraph and the deck began to tremble under his feet making ten knots the small ship rounded the headland into the harbour it was as colombo had said alongside a stone jetty lay the ship its sails flapping idly from her stern a ramp of wood planks sloped down towards the dark mouth of a ramshackle corrugated iron warehouse inside which burned feeble electric lights the ship carried a deck cargo of what appeared to be rolls of newsprint and these were being hoisted one by one on to the ramp whence they rolled down under their own momentum through the mouth of the warehouse there were about twenty men in sight only surprise would straighten out these odds now colombos craft was fifty yards away from the other ship and one or two of the men had stopped working and were looking in their direction one man ran off into the warehouse simultaneously colombo issued a sharp order the engines stopped and went into reverse a big searchlight on the bridge came on and lit the whole scene brightly as the ship drifted up alongside the albanian trawler at the first hard contact grapplingirons were tossed over the albanians rail fore and aft and colombos men swarmed over the side with colombo in the lead bond had made his own plans as soon as his feet landed on the enemy deck he ran straight across the ship climbed the far rail and jumped it was about twelve feet to the jetty and he landed like a cat on his hands and toes and stayed for a moment crouching planning his next move shooting had already started on deck an early shot killed the searchlight and now there was only the grey luminous light of dawn a body one of the enemy crunched to the stone in front of him and lay spreadeagled motionless at the same time from the mouth of the warehouse a light machine gun started up firing short bursts with a highly professional touch bond ran towards it in the dark shadow of the ship the machinegunner saw him and gave him a burst the bullets zipped round bond clanged against the iron hull of the ship and whined off into the night bond got to the cover of the sloping ramp of boards and dived forward on his stomach the bullets crashed into the wood above his head bond crept forward into the narrowing space when he had got as close as he could he would have a choice of breaking cover either to right or left of the boards there came a series of heavy thuds and a swift rumble above his head one of colombos men must have cut the ropes and sent the whole pile of newsprint rolls down the ramp now was bonds chance he leapt out from under cover to the left if the machinegunner was waiting for him he would expect bond to come out firing on the right the machinegunner was there crouching up against the wall of the warehouse bond fired twice in the split second before the bright muzzle of the enemy weapon had swung through its small arc the dead mans finger clenched on the trigger and as he slumped his gun made a brief catherinewheel of flashes before it shook itself free from his hand and clattered to the ground bond was running forward towards the warehouse door when he slipped and fell headlong he lay for a moment stunned his face in a pool of black treacle he cursed and got to his hands and knees and made a dash for cover behind a jumble of the big newsprint rolls that had crashed into the wall of the warehouse one of them sliced by a burst from the machine gun was leaking black treacle bond wiped as much of the stuff off his hands and face as he could it had the musty sweet smell that bond had once smelled in mexico it was raw opium a bullet whanged into the wall of the warehouse not far from his head bond gave his gunhand a last wipe on the seat of his trousers and leapt for the warehouse door he was surprised not to be shot at from the interior as soon as he was silhouetted against the entrance it was quiet and cool inside the place the lights had been turned out but it was now getting brighter outside the pale newsprint rolls were stacked in orderly ranks with a space to make a passageway down the centre at the far end of the passageway was a door the whole arrangement leered at him daring him bond smelled death he edged back to the entrance and out into the open the shooting had become spasmodic colombo came running swiftly towards him his feet close to the ground as fat men run bond said peremptorily stay at this door dont go in or let any of your men in im going round to the back without waiting for an answer he sprinted round the corner of the building and down along its side the warehouse was about fifty feet long bond slowed and walked softly to the far corner he flattened himself against the corrugated iron wall and took a swift look round he immediately drew back a man was standing up against the back entrance his eyes were at some kind of spyhole in his hand was a plunger from which wires ran under the bottom of the door a car a black lancia granturismo convertible with the hood down stood beside him its engine ticking over softly it pointed inland along a deeply tracked dust road the man was kristatos bond knelt he held his gun in both hands for steadiness inched swiftly round the corner of the building and fired one shot at the mans feet he missed almost as he saw the dust kick up inches off the target there was the rumbling crack of an explosion and the tin wall hit him and sent him flying bond scrambled to his feet the warehouse had buckled crazily out of shape now it started to collapse noisily like a pack of tin cards kristatos was in the car it was already twenty yards away dust fountaining up from the traction on the rear wheels bond stood in the classic pistolshooting pose and took careful aim the walther roared and kicked three times at the last shot at fifty yards the figure crouched over the wheel jerked backwards the hands flew sideways off the wheel the head craned briefly into the air and slumped forward the right hand remained sticking out as if the dead man was signalling a righthand turn bond started to run up the road expecting the car to stop but the wheels were held in the ruts and with the weight of the dead right foot still on the accelerator the lancia tore onwards in its screaming third gear bond stopped and watched it it hurried on along the flat road across the burnedup plain and the cloud of white dust blew gaily up behind at any moment bond expected it to veer off the road but it did not and bond stood and saw it out of sight into the early morning mist that promised a beautiful day bond put his gun on safe and tucked it away in the belt of his trousers he turned to find colombo approaching him the fat man was grinning delightedly he came up with bond and to bonds horror threw open his arms clutched bond to him and kissed him on both cheeks bond said for gods sake colombo colombo roared with laughter ah the quiet englishman he fears nothing save the emotions but me he hit himself in the chest me enrico colombo loves this man and he is not ashamed to say so if you had not got the machinegunner not one of us would have survived as it is i lost two of my men and others have wounds but only half a dozen albanians remain on their feet and they have escaped into the village no doubt the police will round them up and now you have sent that bastard kristatos motoring down to hell what a splendid finish to him what will happen when the little racinghearse meets the main road he is already signalling for the righthand turn on to the autostrada i hope he will remember to drive on the right colombo clapped bond boisterously on the shoulder but come my friend it is time we got out of here the cocks are open in the albanian ship and she will soon be on the bottom there are no telephones in this little place we will have a good start on the police it will take them some time to get sense out of the fishermen i have spoken to the head man no one here has any love for albanians but we must be on our way we have a stiff sail into the wind and there is no doctor i can trust this side of venice flames were beginning to lick out of the shattered warehouse and there was billowing smoke that smelled of sweet vegetables bond and colombo walked round to windward the albanian ship had settled on the bottom and her decks were awash they waded across her and climbed on board the colombina where bond had to go through some more handshaking and backslapping they cast off at once and made for the headland guarding the harbour there was a small group of fishermen standing by their boats that lay drawn up on the beach below a huddle of stone cottages they made a surly impression but when colombo waved and shouted something in italian most of them raised a hand in farewell and one of them called back something that made the crew of the colombina laugh colombo explained they say we were better than the cinema at ancona and we must come again soon bond suddenly felt the excitement drain out of him he felt dirty and unshaven and he could smell his own sweat he went below and borrowed a razor and a clean shirt from one of the crew and stripped in his cabin and cleansed himself when he took out his gun and threw it on the bunk he caught a whiff of cordite from the barrel it brought back the fear and violence and death of the grey dawn he opened the porthole outside the sea was dancing and gay and the receding coastline that had been black and mysterious was now green and beautiful a sudden delicious scent of frying bacon came downwind from the galley abruptly bond pulled the porthole to and dressed and went along to the saloon over a mound of fried eggs and bacon washed down with hot sweet coffee laced with rum colombo dotted the is and crossed the ts this we have done my friend he said through crunching toast that was a years supply of raw opium on its way to kristatoss chemical works in naples it is true that i have such a business in milan and that it is a convenient depot for some of my wares but it fabricates nothing more deadly than cascara and aspirin for all that part of kristatoss story read kristatos instead of colombo it is he who breaks the stuff down into heroin and it is he who employs the couriers to take it to london that huge shipment was worth perhaps a million pounds to kristatos and his men but do you know something my dear james it cost him not one solitary cent why because it is a gift from russia the gift of a massive and deadly projectile to be fired into the bowels of england the russians can supply unlimited quantities of the charge for the projectile it comes from their poppy fields in the caucasus and albania is a convenient entrept but they have not the apparatus to fire this projectile the man kristatos created the necessary apparatus and it is he on behalf of his masters in russia who pulls the trigger today between us we have destroyed in half an hour the entire conspiracy you can now go back and tell your people in england that the traffic will cease you can also tell them the truth that italy was not the origin of this terrible underground weapon of war that it is our old friends the russians no doubt it is some psychological warfare section of their intelligence apparatus that i cannot tell you perhaps my dear james colombo smiled encouragingly they will send you to moscow to find out if that should happen let us hope you will find some girl as charming as your friend fraulein lisl baum to put you on the right road to the truth what do you mean my friend shes yours colombo shook his head my dear james i have many friends you will be spending a few more days in italy writing your report and no doubt he chuckled checking on some of the things i have told you perhaps you will also have an enjoyable half an hour explaining the facts of life to your colleagues in american intelligence in between these duties you will need companionship someone to show you the beauties of my beloved homeland in uncivilized countries it is the polite custom to offer one of your wives to a man whom you love and wish to honour i also am uncivilized i have no wives but i have many such friends as lisl baum she will not need to receive any instructions in this matter i have good reason to believe that she is awaiting your return this evening colombo fished in his trousers pocket and tossed something down with a clang on the table in front of bond here is the good reason colombo put his hand to his heart and looked seriously into bonds eyes i give it to you from my heart perhaps also from hers bond picked the thing up it was a key with a heavy metal tag attached the metal tag was inscribed albergo danielli room the hildebrand rarity the stingray was about six feet from wingtip to wingtip and perhaps ten feet long from the blunt wedge of its nose to the end of its deadly tail it was dark grey with that violet tinge that is so often a danger signal in the underwater world when it rose up from the pale golden sand and swam a little distance it was as if a black towel was being waved through the water james bond his hands along his flanks and swimming with only a soft trudge of his fins followed the black shadow across the wide palmfringed lagoon waiting for a shot he rarely killed fish except to eat but there were exceptions big moray eels and all the members of the scorpionfish family now he proposed to kill the stingray because it looked so extraordinarily evil it was ten oclock in the morning of a day in april and the lagoon belle anse near the southernmost tip of mahe the largest island in the seychelles group was glassy calm the northwest monsoon had blown itself out months before and it would be may before the southeast monsoon brought refreshment now the temperature was eighty in the shade and the humidity ninety and in the enclosed waters of the lagoon the water was near blood heat even the fish seemed to be sluggish a tenpound green parrotfish nibbling algae from a lump of coral paused only to roll its eyes as bond passed overhead and then went back to its meal a school of fat grey chub swimming busily broke courteously in half to let bonds shadow by and then joined up and continued on their opposite course a chorus line of six small squids normally as shy as birds did not even bother to change their camouflage at his passage bond trudged lazily on keeping the stingray just in sight soon it would get tired or else be reassured when bond the big fish on the surface did not attack then it would settle on to a patch of flat sand change its camouflage down to the palest almost translucent grey and with soft undulations of its wingtips bury itself in the sand the reef was coming nearer and now there were outcrops of coral niggerheads and meadows of seagrass it was like arriving in a town from open country everywhere the jewelled reef fish twinkled and glowed and the giant anemones of the indian ocean burned like flames in the shadows colonies of spined seaeggs made sepia splashes as if someone had thrown ink against the rock and the brilliant blue and yellow feelers of langoustes quested and waved from their crevices like small dragons now and then among the seaweed on the brilliant floor there was the speckled glitter of a cowrie bigger than a golf ball the leopard cowrie and once bond saw the beautiful splayed fingers of a venuss harp but all these things were now commonplace to him and he drove steadily on interested in the reef only as cover through which he could get to seaward of the ray and then pursue it back towards the shore the tactic worked and soon the black shadow with its pursuing brown torpedo were moving back across the great blue mirror in about twelve feet of water the ray stopped for the hundredth time bond stopped also treading water softly cautiously he lifted his head and emptied water out of his goggles by the time he looked again the ray had disappeared bond had a champion harpoongun with double rubbers the harpoon was tipped with a needlesharp trident a shortrange weapon but the best for reef work bond pushed up the safe and moved slowly forward his fins pulsing softly just below the surface so as to make no sound he looked around him trying to pierce the misty horizons of the great hail of the lagoon he was looking for any big lurking shape it would not do to have a shark or a large barracuda as witness of the kill fish sometimes scream when they are hurt and even when they do not the turbulence and blood caused by a sharp struggle bring the scavengers but there was not a living thing in sight and the sand stretched away into the smoky wings like the bare boards of a stage now bond could see the faint outline on the bottom he swam directly over it and lay motionless on the surface looking down there was a tiny movement in the sand two minute fountains of sand were dancing above the nostrillike holes of the spiracles behind the holes was the slight swelling of the things body that was the target an inch behind the holes bond estimated the possible upward lash of the tail and slowly reached his gun down and pulled the trigger below him the sand erupted and for an anxious moment bond could see nothing then the harpoon line came taut and the ray showed pulling away from him while its tail in reflex aggression lashed again and again over the body at the base of the tail bond could see the jagged poisonspines standing up from the trunk these were the spines that were supposed to have killed ulysses that pliny said would destroy a tree in the indian ocean where the sea poisons are at their most virulent one scratch from the rays sting would mean certain death cautiously keeping the ray on a taut line bond trudged after the furiously wrestling fish he swam to one side to keep the line away from the lashing tail which could easily sever it this tail was the old slavedrivers whip of the indian ocean today it is illegal even to possess one in the seychelles but they are handed down in the families for use on faithless wives and if the word goes round that this or that woman a eu la crapule the provenal name for the sting ray it is as good as saying that that woman will not be about again for at least a week now the lashes of the tall were getting weaker and bond swam round and ahead of the ray pulling it after him towards the shore in the shallows the ray went limp and bond pulled it out of the water and well up on the beach but he still kept away from it it was as well he did so suddenly at some move from bond and perhaps in the hope of catching its enemy unawares the giant ray leapt clean into the air bond sprang aside and the ray fell on its back and lay with its white underbelly to the sun and the great ugly sickle of the mouth sucking and panting bond stood and looked at the stingray and wondered what to do next a short fat white man in khaki shirt and trousers came out from under the palm trees and walked towards bond through the scattering of seagrape and sundried wrack above highwater mark when he was near enough he called out in a laughing voice the old man and the sea who caught who bond turned it would be the only man on the island who doesnt carry a machete fidele be a good chap and call one of your men this animal wont die and hes got my spear stuck in him fidele barbey the youngest of the innumerable barbeys who own nearly everything in the seychelles came up and stood looking down at the ray thats a good one lucky you hit the right spot or hed have towed you over the reef and youd have had to let go your gun they take the hell of a time to die but come on ive got to get you back to victoria somethings come up something good ill send one of my men for the gun do you want the tail bond smiled i havent got a wife but what about some raie au beurre noir tonight not tonight my friend come where are your clothes on their way down the coast road in the station wagon fidele said ever hear of an american called milton krest well apparently he owns the krest hotels and a thing called the krest foundation one thing i can tell you for sure he owns the finest damned yacht in the indian ocean put in yesterday the wawekrest nearly two hundred tons hundred feet long everything in her from a beautiful wife down to a big transistor gramophone on gimbals so the waves wont jerk the needle walltowall carpeting an inch deep airconditioned throughout the only dry cigarettes this side of the african continent and the best afterbreakfast bottle of champagne since the last time i saw paris fidele barbey laughed delightedly my friend that is one hell of a bloody fine ship and if mr krest is a grand slam redoubled in bastards who the hell cares who cares anyway whats it got to do with you or me for the matter of that just this my friend we are going to spend a few days sailing with mr krest and mrs krest the beautiful mrs krest i have agreed to take the ship to chagrin the island i have spoken to you about it is bloody miles from here off the african banks and my family have never found any use for it except for collecting boobies eggs its only about three feet above sealevel i havent been to the damned place for five years any way this man krest wants to go there he s collecting marine specimens something to do with his foundation and theres some blasted little fish thats supposed to exist only around chagrin island at least krest says the only specimen in the world came from there sounds rather fun where do i come in i knew you were bored and that youd got a week before you sail so i said that you were the local under water ace and that youd soon find the fish if it was there and anyway that i wouldnt go without you mr krest was willing and thats that i knew youd be fooling around somewhere down the coast so i just drove along until one of the fishermen told me there was a crazy white man trying to commit suicide alone at belle anse and i knew that would be you bond laughed extraordinary the way these island people are afraid of the sea youd think theyd have got on terms with it by now damned few of the seychellois can even swim roman catholic church doesnt like them taking their clothes off bloody nonsense but there it is and as for being afraid dont forget youve only been here for a month shark barracuda you just havent met a hungry one and stonefish ever seen a man thats stepped on a stonefish his body bends backwards like a bow with the pain sometimes its so frightful his eyes literally fall out of their sockets they very seldom live bond said unsympathetically they ought to wear shoes or bind their feet up when they go on the reef theyve got these fish in the pacific and the giant clam into the bargain its damned silly everybody moans about how poor they are here although the seas absolutely paved with fish and there are fifty varieties of cowrie under those rocks they could make another good living selling those round the world fidele barbey laughed boisterously bond for governor thats the ticket next meeting of legco ill put the idea up youre just the man for the job farsighted full of ideas plenty of drive cowries thats splendid theyll balance the budget for the first time since the patchouli boom after the war we sell seashells from the seychelles thatll be our slogan ill see you get the credit youll be sir james in no time make more money that way than trying to grow vanilla at a loss they continued to wrangle with lighthearted violence until the palm groves gave way to the giant sangdragon trees on the outskirts of the ramshackle capital of mahe it had been nearly a month before when m had told bond he was sending him to the seychelles admiralty are having trouble with their new fleet base in the maldives communists creeping in from ceylon strikes sabotage the usual picture may have to cut their losses and fall back on the seychelles a thousand miles farther south but at least they look pretty secure but they dont want to be caught again colonial office say its safe as houses all the same ive agreed to send someone to give an independent view when makarios was locked up there a few years ago there were quite a few security scares japanese fishingboats hanging about one or two refugee crooks from england strong ties with france just go and have a good look m glanced out of the window at the driving march sleet dont get sunstroke bonds report which concluded that the only conceivable security hazard in the seychelles lay in the beauty and ready availability of the seychelloises had been finished a week before and then he had nothing to do but wait for the ss kampala to take him to mombasa he was thoroughly sick of the heat and the drooping palm trees and the plaintive cry of the terns and the interminable conversations about copra the prospect of a change delighted him bond was spending his last week in the barbey house and after calling there to pick up their bags they drove out to the end of long pier and left the car in the customs shed the gleaming white yacht lay half a mile out in the roadstead they took a pirogue with an outboard motor across the glassy bay and through the opening in the reef the wawekrest was not beautiful the breadth of beam and cluttered superstructure stunted her lines but bond could see at once that she was a real ship built to cruise the world and not just the florida keys she seemed deserted but as they came alongside two smartlooking sailors in white shorts and singlets appeared and stood by the ladder with boathooks ready to fend the shabby pirogue off the yachts gleaming paint they took the two bags and one of them slid back an aluminium hatch and gestured for them to go down a breath of what seemed to bond to be almost freezing air struck him as he went through and down a few steps into the lounge the lounge was empty it was not a cabin it was a room of solid richness and comfort with nothing to associate it with the interior of a ship the windows behind the halfclosed venetian blinds were full size as were the deep armchairs round the low central table the carpet was the deepest pile in pale blue the walls were panelled in a silvery wood and the ceiling was offwhite there was a desk with the usual writingmaterials and a telephone next to the big gramophone was a sideboard laden with drinks above the sideboard was what looked like an extremely good renoir the head and shoulders of a pretty darkhaired girl in a black and white striped blouse the impression of a luxurious livingroom in a town house was completed by a large bowl of white and blue hyacinths on the central table and by the tidy range of magazines to one side of the desk what did i tell you james bond shook his head admiringly this is certainly the way to treat the sea as if it damned well didnt exist he breathed in deeply what a relief to get a mouthful of fresh air id almost forgotten what it tastes like its the stuff outside thats fresh feller this is canned mr milton krest had come quietly into the room and was standing looking at them he was a tough leathery man in his early fifties he looked hard and fit and the faded blue jeans militarycut shirt and wide leather belt suggested that he made a fetish of doing so looking tough the pale brown eyes in the weatherbeaten face were slightly hooded and their gaze was sleepy and contemptuous the mouth had a downward twist that might be humorous or disdainful probably the latter and the words he had tossed into the room innocuous in themselves except for the patronizing feller had been tossed like small coin to a couple of coolies to bond the oddest thing about mr krest was his voice it was a soft most attractive lisping through the teeth it was exactly the voice of the late humphrey bogart bond ran his eyes down the man from the sparse closecropped black and grey hair like iron filings sprinkled over the bullet head to the tattooed eagle above a fouled anchor on the right forearm and then down to the naked leathery feet that stood nautically square on the carpet he thought this man likes to be thought a hemingway hero im not going to get on with him mr krest came across the carpet and held out his hand you bond glad to have you aboard sir bond was expecting the bonecrushing grip and parried it with stiffened muscles freediving or aqualung free and i dont go deep its only a hobby whadya do the rest of the time civil servant mr krest gave a short barking laugh civility and servitude you english make the best goddam butlers and valets in the world civil servant you say i reckon were likely to get along fine civil servants are just what i like to have around me the click of the deck hatch sliding back saved bonds temper mr krest was swept from his mind as a naked sunburned girl came down the steps into the saloon no she wasnt quite naked after all but the pale brown satin scraps of bikini were designed to make one think she was lo treasure where have you been hiding long time no see meet mr barbey and mr bond the fellers who are coming along mr krest raised a hand in the direction of the girl fellers this is mrs krest the fifth mrs krest and just in case anybody should get any ideas she loves mr krest dont you treasure oh dont be silly milt you know i do mrs krest smiled prettily how do you do mr barbey and mr bond its nice to have you with us what about a drink now just a minute treas suppose you let me fix things aboard my own ship hein mr krests voice was soft and pleasant the woman blushed oh yes milt of course okay then just so we know whos skipper aboard the good ship wawekrest the amused smile embraced them all now then mr barbey whats your first name by the way fidele eh thats quite a name old faithful mr krest chuckled bonhomously well now fido hows about you and me go upon the bridge and get this little old skiff moving hein mebbe you better take her out into the open sea and then you can set a course and hand over to fritz im the captain hes the mate and there are two for the engineroom and pantry all three germans only darned sailors left in europe and mr bond first name james eh well jim what say you practise a bit of that civility and servitude on mrs krest call her liz by the way help her fix the canaps and so on for drinks before lunch she was once a limey too you can swap yarns about piccadilly circus and the dooks you both know okay move fido he sprang boyishly up the steps lets get the hell outa here when the hatch closed bond let out a deep breath mrs krest said apologetically please dont mind his jokes its just his sense of humour and hes a bit contrary he likes to see if he can rile people its very naughty of him but its really all in fun bond smiled reassuringly how often did she have to make this speech to people try and calm the tempers of the people mr krest had practised his sense of humour on he said i expect your husband needs a bit of knowing does he go on the same way back in america she said without bitterness only with me he loves americans its when hes abroad you see his father was a german a prussian really hes got that silly german thing of thinking europeans and so on are decadent that they arent any good any more its no use arguing with him its just a thing hes got so that was it the old hun again always at your feet or at your throat sense of humour indeed and what must this woman have to put up with this beautiful girl he had got hold of to be his slave his english slave bond said how long have you been married two years i was working as a receptionist in one of his hotels he owns the krest group you know it was wonderful like a fairy story i still have to pinch my self sometimes to make sure im not dreaming this for instance she waved a hand at the luxurious room and hes terribly good to me always giving me presents hes a very important man in america you know its fun being treated like royalty wherever you go it must be he likes that sort of thing i suppose oh yes there was resignation in the laugh theres a lot of the sultan in him he gets quite impatient if he doesnt get proper service he says that when ones worked very hard to get to the top of the tree one has a right to the best fruit that grows there mrs krest found she was talking too freely she said quickly but really what am i saying anyone would think we had known each other for years she smiled shyly i suppose its meeting someone from england but i really must go and get some more clothes on i was sunbathing on deck there came a deep rumble from belowdeck amidships there were off why dont you watch us leave harbour from the afterdeck and ill come and join you in a minute theres so much i want to hear about london this way she moved past him and slid open a door as a matter of fact if youre sensible youll stake a claim to this for the nights there are plenty of cushions and the cabins are apt to get a bit stuffy in spite of the airconditioning bond thanked her and walked out and shut the door behind him it was a big welldeck with hemp flooring and a creamcoloured semicircular foam rubber settee in the stern rattan chairs were scattered about and there was a servingbar in one corner it crossed bonds mind that mr krest might be a heavy drinker was it his imagination or was mrs krest terrified of him there was something painfully slavish in her attitude towards him no doubt she had to pay heavily for her fairy story bond watched the green flanks of mahe slowly slip away astern he guessed that their speed was about ten knots they would soon be at north point and heading for the open sea bond listened to the glutinous bubble of the exhaust and idly thought about the beautiful mrs elizabeth krest she could have been a model probably had been before she became a hotel receptionist that respectable female calling that yet has a whiff of the high demimonde about it and she still moved her beautiful body with the unselfconsciousness of someone who is used to going about with nothing or practically nothing on but there was none of the chill of the model about her it was a warm body and a friendly confiding face she might be thirty certainly not more and her prettiness for it was not more than that was still immature her best feature was the ashblonde hair that hung heavily to the base of her neck but she seemed pleasantly lacking in vanity about it she didnt toss it about or fiddle with it and it occurred to bond that she didnt in fact show any signs of coquetry she had stood quietly almost docilely with her large dear blue eyes fixed almost the whole time on her husband there was no lipstick on her mouth and no lacquer on her fingernails or toenails and her eyebrows were natural did mr krest perhaps order that it should be so that she should be a germanic child of nature probably bond shrugged his shoulders they were certainly a curiously assorted couple the middleaged hemingway with the bogart voice and the pretty artless girl and there was tension in the air in the way she had cringed as he brought her to heel when she had offered them drinks in the forced maleness of the man bond toyed idly with the notion that the man was impotent and that all the tough rude act was nothing more than exaggerated virilityplay it certainly wasnt going to be easy to live with for four or five days bond watched the beautiful silhouette island slip away to starboard and made a vow not to lose his temper what was that american expression eating crow it would be an interesting mental exercise for him he would eat crow for five days and not let this damnable man interfere with what should be a good trip well feller taking it easy mr krest was standing on the boatdeck looking down into the well what have you done with that woman i live with left her to do all the work i guess well and why not thats what theyre for aint it care to look over the ship fidos doin a spell at the wheel and ive got time on my hands without waiting for an answer mr krest bent and lowered himself down into the welldeck dropping the last four feet mrs krests putting on some clothes yes id like to see over the ship mr krest fixed bond with his hard disdainful stare kay well now facts first its built by the bronson shipbuilding corporation i happen to own ninety per cent of the stock so i got what i wanted designed by rosenblatts the top naval architects hundred feet long twentyone broad and draws six two fivehundredhorsepower superior diesels top speed fourteen knots cruises two thousand five hundred miles at eight airconditioned throughout carrier corporation designed two special fiveton units carries enough frozen food and liquor for a month all we need is fresh water for the baths and showers right now lets go up front and you can see the crews quarters and well work back and one thing jim mr krest stamped on the deck this is the floor see and the heads the can and if i want someone to stop doing whatever theyre doing i dont shout belay i shout hold it get me jim bond nodded amiably ive got no objection shes your ship its my ship corrected mr krest thats another bit of damned nonsense making a hunk of steel and wood a female anyway lets go you dont need to mind your head everythings a sixfoottwo clearance bond followed mr krest down the narrow passage that ran the length of the ship and for half an hour made appropriate comments on what was certainly the finest and most luxuriously designed yacht he had ever seen in every detail the margin was for extra comfort even the crews bath and shower was full size and the stainless steel galley or kitchen as mr krest called it was as big as the krest stateroom mr krest opened the door of the latter without knocking liz krest was at the dressingtable why treasure said mr krest in his soft voice i reckoned youd be out there fixing the drink tray youve sure been one heck of a time dressing up puttin on a little extra ritz for jim eh im sorry milt i was just coming a zip got stuck the girl hurriedly picked up a compact and made for the door she gave them both a nervous halfsmile and went out vermont birch panelling corning glass lamps mexican tuft rugs that sailingship pictures a genuine montague dawson by the way mr krests catalogue ran smoothly on but bond was looking at some thing that hung down almost out of sight by the bedside table on what was obviously mr krests side of the huge double bed it was a thin whip about three feet long with a leatherthonged handle it was the tail of a stingray casually bond walked over to the side of the bed and picked it up he ran a finger down its spiny gristle it hurt his finger even to do that he said where did you pick that up i was hunting one of these animals this morning bahrein the arabs use them on their wives mr krest chuckled easily havent had to use more than one stroke at a time on liz so far wonderful results we call it my corrector bond put the thing back he looked hard at mr krest and said is that so in the seychelles where the creoles are pretty tough its illegal even to own one of those let alone use it mr krest moved towards the door he said indifferently feller this ship happens to be united states territory lets go get ourselves something to drink mr krest drank three double bullshots vodka in iced consomm before luncheon and beer with the meal the pale eyes darkened a little and acquired a watery glitter but the sibilant voice remained soft and unemphatic as with a complete monopoly of the conversation he explained the object of the voyage ya see fellers its like this in the states we have this foundation system for the lucky guys that got plenty dough and dont happen to want to pay it into uncle sams treasury you make a foundation like this one the krest foundation for charitable purposes charitable to anyone to kids sick folk the cause of science you just give the money away to anyone or anything except yourself or your dependants and you escape tax on it so i put a matter of ten million dollars into the krest foundation and since i happen to like yachting and seeing the world i built this yacht with two million of the money and told the smithsonian thats our big natural history institution that i would go to any part of the world and collect specimens for them so that makes me a scientific expedition see for three months of every year i have a fine holiday that costs me just sweet fatty arbuckle mr krest looked to his guests for applause get me fidele barbey shook his head doubtfully that sounds fine mr krest but these rare specimens they are easy to find the smithsonian it wants a giant panda a seashell you can get hold of these things where they have failed mr krest slowly shook his head he said sorrowfully feller you sure were born yesterday money thats all it takes you want a panda you buy it from some goddam zoo that cant afford central heating for its reptile house or wants to build a new block for its tigers or something the seashell you find a man thats got one and you offer him so much goddam money that even if he cries for a week he sells it to you sometimes you have a little trouble with governments some goddam animal is protected or something all right give you an example i arrive at your island yesterday i want a black parrot from praslin island i want a giant tortoise from aldabra i want the complete range of your local cowries and i want this fish were after the first two are protected by law last evening i pay a call on your governor after making certain inquiries in the town excellency i says i understand you want to build a public swimmingpool to teach the local kids to swim okay the krest foundation will put up money how much five thousand ten thousand okay so its ten thousand heres my cheque and i write it out there and then just one little thing excellency i says holding on to the cheque it happens i want a specimen of this black parrot you have here and one of these aldabra tortoises i understand theyre protected by law mind if i take one of each back to america for the smithsonian well there s a bit of a palaver but seeing its the smithsonian and seeing ive still got hold of the cheque in the end we shake hands on the deal and everyones happy right well on the way back i stop in the town to arrange with your nice mr abendana the merchant feller to have the parrot and tortoise collected and held for me and i get talking about the cowries well it so happens that this mr abendana has been collecting the dam things since he was a child he shows them to me beautifully kept each one in its bit of cotton wool fine condition and several of those isabella and mappa ones i was asked particularly to watch out for sorry he couldnt think of selling they meant so much to him and so on crap i just look at mr abendana and i say how much no no he couldnt think of it crap again i take out my chequebook and write a cheque for five thousand dollars and push it under his nose he looks at it five thousand dollars he cant stand it he folds the cheque and puts it in his pocket and then the dam sissy breaks down and weeps would you believe it mr krest opened his palms in disbelief over a few goddam seashells so i just tell him to take it easy and i pick up the trays of seashells and get the hell out of there before the crazy soandso shoots himself from remorse mr krest sat back well pleased with himself well whatd you say to that fellers twentyfour hours in the island and ive already knocked off threequarters of my list pretty smart eh jim bond said youll probably get a medal when you get home what about this fish mr krest got up from the table and rummaged in a drawer of his desk he brought back a typewritten sheet here you are he read out hildebrand rarity caught by professor hildebrand of the university of the witwatersrand in a net off chagrin island in the seychelles group april mr krest looked up and then theres a lot of scientific crap i got them to put it into plain english and heres the translation he turned back to the paper this appears to be a unique member of the squirrelfish family the only specimen known named the hildebrand rarity after its discoverer is six inches long the colour is a bright pink with black transverse stripes the anal ventral and dorsal fins are pink the tail fin is black eyes large and dark blue if found care should be taken in handling this fish because all fins are even more sharply spiked than is usual with the rest of this family professor hildebrand records that he found the specimen in three feet of water on the edge of the southwestern reef mr krest threw the paper down on the table well there you are fellers were travelling about a thousand miles at a cost of several thousand dollars to try and find a goddam sixinch fish and two years ago the revenue people had the gall to suggest that my foundation was a phoney liz krest broke in eagerly but thats just it milt isnt it its really rather important to bring back plenty of specimens and things this time werent those horrible tax people talking about disallowing the yacht and the expenses and so on for the last five years if we didnt show an outstanding scientific achievement wasnt that the way they put it treasure mr krests voice was soft as velvet just supposin you keep that flippin trap shut about my personal affairs yes the voice was amiable nonchalant you know what you just done treas you just earned yourself a little meeting with the corrector this evening thats what youve gone and done the girls hand flew to her mouth her eyes were wide she said in a whisper oh no milt oh no please on the second day out at dawn they came up with chagrin island it was first picked up by the radar a small bump in the dead level line on the scanner and then a minute blur on the great curved horizon grew with infinite slowness into half a mile of green fringed with white it was extraordinary to come upon land after two days in which the yacht had seemed to be the only moving the only living thing in an empty world bond had never seen or even clearly imagined the doldrums before now he realized what a terrible hazard they must have been in the days of sail the sea of glass under a brazen sun the foul heavy air the trail of small clouds along the rim of the world that never came closer never brought wind or blessed rain how must centuries of mariners have blessed this tiny dot in the indian ocean as they bent to the oars that moved the heavy ship perhaps a mile a day bond stood in the bows and watched the flyingfish squirt from beneath the hull as the blueblack of the sea slowly mottled into the brown and white and green of deep shoal how wonderful that he would soon be walking and swimming again instead of just sitting and lying down how wonderful to have a few hours solitude a few hours away from mr milton krest they anchored outside the reef in ten fathoms and fidele barbey took them through the opening in the speedboat in every detail chagrin was the prototype coral island it was about twenty acres of sand and dead coral and low scrub surrounded after fifty yards of shallow lagoon by a necklace of reef on which the quiet long swell broke with a soft hiss clouds of birds rose when they landed terns boobies menofwar frigates but quickly settled again there was a strong ammoniac smell of guano and the scrub was white with it the only other living things were the land crabs that scuttled and scraped among the liane sans fin and the fiddlercrabs that lived in the sand the glare from the white sand was dazzling and there was no shade mr krest ordered a tent to be erected and sat in it smoking a cigar while gear of various kinds was ferried ashore mrs krest swam and picked up sea shells while bond and fidele barbey put on masks and swimming in opposite directions began systematically to comb the reef all the way round the island when you are looking for one particular species underwater shell or fish or seaweed or coral formation you have to keep your brain and your eyes focused for that one individual pattern the riot of colour and movement and the endless variety of light and shadow fight your concentration all the time bond trudged slowly along through the wonderland with only one picture in his mind a sixinch pink fish with black stripes and big eyes the second such fish man had ever seen if you see it mr krest had enjoined just you let out a yell and stay with it ill do the rest i got a little something in the tent thats just the dandiest thing for catching fish you ever saw bond paused to rest his eyes the water was so buoyant that he could lie face downwards on the surface without moving idly he broke up a seaegg with the tip of his spear and watched the horde of glittering reeffish darting for the shreds of yellow flesh among the needlesharp black spine how infernal that if he did find the rarity it would benefit only mr krest should he say nothing if be found it rather childish and anyway he was under contract so to speak bond moved slowly on his eyes automatically taking up the search again while his mind turned to considering the girl she had spent the previous day in bed mr krest had said it was a headache would she one day turn on him would she get herself a knife or a gun and one night when he reached for that damnable whip would she kill him no she was too soft too malleable mr krest had chosen well she was the stuff of slaves and the trappings of her fairytale were too precious didnt she realize that a jury would certainly acquit her if the stingray whip was produced in court she could have the trappings without this dreadful damnable man should bond tell her that dont be ridiculous how could he put it oh liz if you want to murder your husband itll be quite all right bond smiled inside his mask to hell with it dont interfere with other peoples lives she probably likes it masochist but bond knew that that was too easy an answer this was a girl who lived in fear perhaps she also lived in loathing one couldnt read much in those soft blue eyes but the windows had opened once or twice and a flash of something like a childish hate had shown through had it been hate it had probably been indigestion bond put the krests out of his mind and looked up to see how far round the island he had got fidele barbeys schnorkel was only a hundred yards away they had nearly completed the circuit they came up with each other and swam to the shore and lay on the hot sand fidele barbey said nothing on my side of the property except every fish in the world bar one but ive had a stroke of luck ran into a big colony of green snail thats the pearl shell as big is a small football worth quite a lot of money ill send one of my boats after them one of these days saw a blue parrotfish that must have been a good thirty pounds tame as a dog like all the fish round here hadnt got the heart to kill it and if i had there might have been trouble saw two or three leopard sharks cruising around over the reef blood in the water might have brought them through now im ready for a drink and something to eat after that we can swap sides and have another go they got up and walked along the beach to the tent mr krest heard their voices and came out to meet them no dice eh he scratched angrily at an arm pit goddam sandfly bit me this is one hell of a godawful island liz couldnt stand the smell gone back to the ship guess wed better give it one more goingover and then get the hell out of here help yourselves to some chow and youll find cold beer in the icepack here gimme one of those masks how do you use the dam things i guess i might as well take a peek at the seas bottom while im about it they sat in the hot tent and ate the chicken salad and drank beer and moodily watched mr krest poking and peering about in the shallows fidele barbey said hes right of course these little islands are bloody awful places nothing but crabs and bird dung surrounded by too dam much sea its only the poor bloody frozen europeans that dream of coral islands east of suez you wont find any sane man who gives a damn for them my family owns about ten of them decentsized ones too with small villages on them and a good income from copra and turtle well you can have the whole bloody lot in exchange for a flat in paris or london bond laughed he began put an advertisement in the times and youd get sackloads when fifty yards away mr krest began to make frantic signals bond said either the bastards found it or hes trodden on a guitarfish and picked up his mask and ran down to the sea mr krest was standing up to his waist among the shallow beginnings of the reef he jabbed his finger excitedly at the surface bond swam softly forward a carpet of seagrass ended in broken coral and an occasional niggerhead a dozen varieties of butterfly and other reeffish flirted among the rocks and a small langouste quested towards bond with its feelers the head of a large green moray protruded from a hole its halfopen jaws showing the rows of needle teeth its golden eyes watched bond carefully bond was amused to note that mr krests hairy legs magnified into pale treetrunks by the glass were not more than a foot away from the morays jaws he gave an encouraging poke at the moray with his spear but the eel only snapped at the metal points and slid back out of sight bond stopped and floated his eyes scanning the brilliant jungle a red blur materialized through the far mist and came towards him it circled closely beneath him as if showing itself off the dark blue eyes examined him without fear the small fish busied itself rather selfconsciously with some algae on the underside of a niggerhead made a dart at a speck of something suspended in the water and then as if leaving the stage after showing its paces swam languidly off back into the mist bond backed away from the morays hole and put his feet to the ground he took off his mask he said to mr krest who was standing gazing impatiently at him through his goggles yes thats it all right better move quietly away from here he wont go away unless hes frightened these reeffish stick pretty well to the same pastures mr krest pulled off his mask goddam i found it he said reverently well goddam i did he slowly followed bond to the shore fidele barbey was waiting for them mr krest said boisterously fido i found that goddam fish me milton krest whadya know about that after you two goddam experts had been at it all morning i just took that mask of yours first time i ever put one on mark you and i walked out and found the goddam fish in fifteen minutes flat whadya say to that eh fido thats good mr krest thats fine now how do we catch it aha mr krest winked slowly i got just the ticket for that got it from a chemist friend of mine stuff called rotenone made from derris root what the natives fish with in brazil just pour it in the water where itll float over what youre after and itll get him as sure as eggs is eggs sort of poison constricts the blood vessels in their gills suffocates them no effect on humans because no gills see mr krest turned to bond here jim you go on out and keep watch see the darned fish dont vamoose fido and ill bring the stuff out there he pointed upcurrent from the vital area ill let go the rotenone when you say the word itll drift down towards you right but for lands sakes get the timing right ive only got a fivegallon tin of this stuff kay bond said all right and walked slowly down and into the water he swam lazily out to where he had stood before yes everyone was still there going about his business the morays pointed head was back again at the edge of its hole the langouste again queried him in a minute as if it had a rendezvous with bond the hildebrand rarity appeared this time it swam up quite close to his face it looked through the glass at his eyes and then as if disturbed by what it had seen there darted out of range it played around among the rocks for a while and then went off into a mist slowly the little underwater world within bonds vision began to take him for granted a small octopus that had been camouflaged as a piece of coral revealed its presence and groped carefully down towards the sand the blue and yellow langouste came a few steps out from under the rock wondering about him some very small fish like minnows nibbled at his legs and toes tickling bond broke a seaegg for them and they darted to the better meal bond lifted his head mr krest holding the flat can was twenty yards away to bonds right he would soon begin pouring when bond gave the sign so that the liquid would get a good wide spread over the surface okay called mr krest bond shook his head ill raise my thumb when hes back here then youll have to pour fast okay jim youre at the bombsight bond put his head down there was the little community everyone busied with his affairs soon to get one fish that someone vaguely wanted in a museum five thousand miles away a hundred perhaps a thousand small people were going to die when bond gave the signal the shadow of death would come down on the stream how long would the poison last how far would it travel on down the reef perhaps it would not be thousands but tens of thousands that would die a small trunkfish appeared its tiny fins whirring like propellers a rock beauty gorgeous in gold and red and black pecked at the sand and a pair of the inevitable black and yellow striped sergeantmajors materialized from nowhere attracted by the scent of the broken seaegg inside the reef who was the predator in the world of small fishes who did they fear small barracuda an occasional billfish now a big a fully grown predator a man called krest was standing in the wings waiting and this one wasnt even hungry he was just going to kill almost for fun two brown legs appeared in bonds vision he looked up it was fidele barbey with a big creel strapped to his chest and longhandled landingnet bond lifted his mask i feel like the bombaimer at nagasaki fish are coldblooded they dont feel anything how do you know ive heard them scream when theyre hurt barbey said indifferently they wont be able to scream with this stuff it strangles them whats eating you theyre only fish i know i know fidele barbey had spent his life killing animals and fish while he bond had some times not hesitated to kill men what was he fussing about he hadnt minded killing the stingray yes but that was an enemy fish these down here were friendly people people the pathetic fallacy hey came the voice of mr krest whats goin on over there this aint no time for chewing the fat get that head down jim bond pulled down his mask and lay again on the surface at once he saw the beautiful red shadow coming out of the far mists the fish swam fast up to him as if it now took him for granted it lay below him looking up bond said into his mask get away from here damn you he gave a sharp jab at the fish with his harpoon the fish fled back into the mist bond lifted his head and angrily raised his thumb it was a ridiculous and petty act of sabotage of which he was already ashamed the dark brown oily liquid was pouring out on to the surface of the lagoon there was time to stop mr krest before it was all gone time to give him another chance at the hildebrand rarity bond stood and watched until the last drop was tilted out to hell with mr krest now the stuff was creeping slowly down on the current a shiny spreading stain which reflected the blue sky with a metallic glint mr krest the giant reaper was wading down with it get set fellers he called cheerfully its right up with you now bond put his head back under the surface every thing was as before in the little community and then with stupefying suddenness everyone went mad it was as if they had all been seized with st vituss dance several fish looped the loop crazily and then fell like heavy leaves to the sand the moray eel came slowly out of the hole in the coral its jaws wide it stood carefully upright on its tail and gently toppled side ways the small langouste gave three kicks of its tail and turned over on its back and the octopus let go its hold of the coral and drifted to the bottom upside down and then into the arena drifted the corpses from upstream whitebellied fish shrimps worms hermit crabs spotted and green morays langoustes of all sizes as if blown by some light breeze of death the clumsy bodies their colours already fading swept slowly past a fivepound billfish struggled by with snapping beak fighting death downreef there were splashes on the surface as still bigger fish tried to make for safety one by one before bonds eyes the seaurchins dropped off the rocks to make black inkblots on the sand bond felt a touch on his shoulder mr krests eyes were bloodshot with the sun and glare he had put white sunburn paste on his lips he shouted impatiently at bonds mask where in hells our goddam fish bond lifted his mask looks as if it managed to get away just before the stuff came down im still watching for it he didnt wait to hear mr krests reply but got his head quickly under water again still more carnage still more dead bodies but surely the stuff had passed by now surely the area was safe just in case the fish his fish because he had saved it came back again he stiffened in the far mists there was a pink flash it had gone now it was back again idly the hildebrand rarity swam towards him through the maze of channels between the broken outposts of the reef not caring about mr krest bond raised his free hand out of the water and brought it down with a sharp slap still the fish came bond shifted the safe on his harpoongun and fired it in the direction of the fish no effect bond put his feet down and began to walk towards the fish through the scattering of corpses the beautiful red and black fish seemed to pause and quiver then it shot straight through the water towards bond and dived down to the sand at his feet and lay still bond only had to bend to pick it up there was not even a last flap from the tail it just filled bonds hand lightly pricking the palm with the spiny black dorsal fin bond carried it back underwater so as to preserve its colours when he got to mr krest he said here and handed him the small fish then he swam away towards the shore that evening with the wawekrest heading for home down the path of a huge yellow moon mr krest gave orders for what he called a wingding gotta celebrate liz this is terrific a terrific day cleaned up the last target and we can get the hell out of these goddam seychelles and get on back to civilization what say we make it to mombasa when weve taken on board the tortoise and that goddam parrot fly to nairobi and pick up a big plane for rome venice paris anywheres you care for what say treasure he squeezed her chin and cheeks in his big hand and made the pale lips pout he kissed them drily bond watched the girls eyes they had shut tight mr krest let go the girl massaged her face it was still white with his fingermarks gee milt she said half laughing you nearly squashed me you dont know your strength but do lets celebrate i think that would be lots of fun and that paris idea sounds grand lets do that shall we what shall i order for dinner hell caviar of course mr krest held his hands apart one of those twopound tins from hammacher schlemmer the grade ten shot size and all the trimmings and that pink champagne he turned to bond that suit you feller sounds like a square meal bond changed the subject what have you done with the prize formalin up on the boatdeck with some other jars of stuff weve picked up here and there fish shells all safe in our home morgue thats how we were told to keep the specimens well airmail that damned fish when we get back to civilization give a press conference first should make a big play in the papers back home ive already radioed the smithsonian and the news agencies my accountantsll sure be glad of some press cuttings to show those darned revenue boys mr krest got very drunk that night it did not show greatly the soft bogart voice became softer and slower the round hard head turned more deliberately on the shoulders the lighters flame took increasingly long to relight the cigar and one glass was swept off the table but it showed in the things mr krest said there was a violent cruelty a pathological desire to wound quite near the surface in the man that night after dinner the first target was james bond he was treated to a softspoken explanation as to why europe with england and france in the van was a rapidly diminishing asset to the world nowadays said mr krest there were only three powers america russia and china that was the big poker game and no other country had either the chips or the cards to come into it occasionally some pleasant little country and he admitted theyd been pretty big league in the past like england would be lent some money so that they could take a hand with the grownups but that was just being polite like one sometimes had to be to a chum in ones club whod gone broke no england nice people mind you good sports was a place to see the old buildings and the queen and so on france they only counted for good food and easy women italy sunshine and spaghetti sanatorium sort of germany well they still had some spunk but two lost wars had knocked the heart out of them mr krest dismissed the rest of the world with a few similar tags and then asked bond for his comments bond was thoroughly tired of mr krest he said he found mr krests point of view oversimplified he might even say naive he said your argument reminds me of a rather sharp aphorism i once heard about america care to hear it sure sure its to the effect that america has progressed from infancy to senility without having passed through a period of maturity mr krest looked thoughtfully at bond finally he said why say jim thats pretty neat his eyes hooded slightly as they turned towards his wife guess youd kinda go along with that remark of jims eh treasure i recall you saying once you reckoned there was something pretty childish about the americans remember oh milt liz krests eyes were anxious she had read the signs how can you bring that up you know it was only something casual i said about the comic sections of the papers of course i dont agree with what james says anyway it was only a joke wasnt it james thats right said bond like when mr krest said england had nothing but ruins and a queen mr krests eyes were still on the girl he said softly shucks treasure why are you looking so nervous course it was a joke he paused and one ill remember treasure one ill sure remember bond estimated that by now mr krest had just about one whole bottle of various alcohols mostly whisky inside him it looked to bond as if unless mr krest passed out the time was not far off when bond would have to hit mr krest just once very hard on the jaw fidele barbey was now being given the treatment these islands of yours fido when i first looked them up on the map i thought it was just some specks of flydirt on the page mr krest chuckled even tried to brush them off with the back of my hand then i read a bit about them and it seemed to me my first thoughts had just about hit the nail on the head not much good for anything are they fido i wonder an intelligent guy like you doesnt get the hell out of there beachcombing aint any kind of a life though i did hear one of your family had logged over a hundred illegitimate children mebbe thats the attraction eh feller mr krest grinned knowingly fidele barbey said equably thats my uncle gaston the rest of the family doesnt approve its made quite a hole in the family fortune family fortune eh mr krest winked at bond whats it in cowrieshells not exactly fidele barbey was not used to mr krests brand of rudeness he looked mildly embarrassed though we made quite a lot out of tortoiseshell and motherofpearl about a hundred years ago when there was a rage for these things copras always been our main business using the family bastards as labour i guess good idea wish i could fix something like that in my home circle he looked across at his wife the rubber lips turned still further down before the next gibe could be uttered bond had pushed his chair back and had gone out into the welldeck and pulled the door shut behind him ten minutes later bond heard feet coming softly down the ladder from the boatdeck he turned it was liz krest she came over to where he was standing in the stern she said in a strained voice i said id go to bed but then i thought id come back here and see if youd got everything you want im not a very good hostess im afraid are you sure you dont mind sleeping out here i like it i like this kind of air better than the canned stuff inside and its rather wonderful to have all those stars to look at ive never seen so many before she said eagerly grasping at a friendly topic i like orions belt and the southern cross the best you know when i was young i used to think the stars were really holes in the sky i thought the world was surrounded by a great big black sort of envelope and that outside it the universe was full of bright light the stars were just holes in the envelope that let little sparks of light through one gets terribly silly ideas when ones young she looked up at him wanting him not to snub her bond said youre probably quite right one shouldnt believe all the scientists say they want to make everything dull where did you live then at ringwood in the new forest it was a good place to be brought up a good place for children id like to go there again one day bond said youve certainly come a long way since then youd probably find it pretty dull she reached out and touched his sleeve please dont say that you dont understand there was an edge of desperation in the soft voice i cant bear to go on missing what other people have ordinary people i mean she laughed nervously you wont believe me but just to talk like this for a few minutes to have someone like you to talk to is something id almost forgotten she suddenly reached for his hand and held it hard im sorry i just wanted to do that now ill go to bed the soft voice came from behind them the speech had slurred but each word was carefully separated from the next well well whadya know necking with the underwater help mr krest stood framed in the hatch to the saloon he stood with his legs apart and his arms upstretched to the lintel above his head with the light behind him he had the silhouette of a baboon the cold imprisoned breath of the saloon rushed out past him and for a moment chilled the warm night air in the welldeck mr krest stepped out and softly pulled the door to behind him bond took a step towards him his hands held loosely at his sides he measured the distance to mr krests solar plexus he said dont jump to conclusions mr krest and watch your tongue youre lucky not to have got hurt so far tonight dont press your luck youre drunk go to bed oho listen to the cheeky feller mr krests moonburned face turned slowly from bond to his wife he made a contemptuous hapsburglip grimace he took a silver whistle out of his pocket and whirled it round on its string he sure dont get the picture does he treasure you aint told him that those heinies up front aint just for ornament he turned back to bond feller you move any closer and i blow this just once and you know what itll be the old heaveho for mr goddam bond he made a gesture towards the sea over the side man overboard too bad we back up to make a search and you know what feller just by chance we back up into you with those twin screws would you believe it what lousy bad luck for that nice feller jim we were all getting so fond of mr krest swayed on his feet dya get the photo jim okay so lets all be friends again and get some shut eye he reached for the lintel of the hatch and turned to his wife he lifted his free hand and slowly crooked a finger move treasure time for bed yes milt the wide frightened eyes turned side ways goodnight james without waiting for an answer she ducked under mr krests arm and almost ran through the saloon mr krest lifted a hand take it easy feller no hard feelings eh bond said nothing he went on looking hard at mr krest mr krest laughed uncertainly he said okay then he stepped into the saloon and slid the door shut through the window bond watched him walk unsteadily across the saloon and turn out the lights he went into the corridor and there was a momentary gleam from the stateroom door and then that too went dark bond shrugged his shoulders god what a man he leant against the stern rail and watched the stars and the flashes of phosphorescence in the creaming wake and set about washing his mind clear and relaxing the coiled tensions in his body half an hour later after taking a shower in the crews bathroom forrard bond was making a bed for himself among the piled dunlopillo cushions when he heard a single heartrending scream it tore briefly into the night and was smothered it was the girl bond ran through the saloon and down the passage with his hand on the stateroom door he stopped he could hear her sobs and above them the soft even drone of mr krests voice he took his hand away from the latch hell what was it to do with him they were man and wife if she was prepared to stand this sort of thing and not kill her husband or leave him it was no good bond playing sir galahad bond walked slowly back down the passage as he was crossing the saloon the scream this time less piercing rang out again bond cursed fluently and went out and lay down on his bed and tried to focus his mind on the soft thud of the diesels how could a girl have so little guts or was it that women could take almost anything from a man anything except indifference bonds mind refused to unwind sleep got further and further away an hour later bond had reached the edge of unconsciousness when up above him on the boatdeck mr krest began to snore on the second night out from port victoria mr krest had left his cabin in the middle of the night and had gone up to the hammock that was kept slung for him between the speedboat and the dinghy but that night he had not snored now he was snoring with those deep rattling utterly lost snores that come from big blue sleepingpills on top of too much alcohol this was too damned much bond looked at his watch onethirty if the snoring didnt stop in ten minutes bond would go down to fidele barbeys cabin and sleep on the floor even if he did wake up stiff and frozen in the morning bond watched the gleaming minutehand slowly creep round the dial now he had got to his feet and was gathering up his shirt and shorts when from up on the boatdeck there came a heavy crash the crash was immediately followed by scrabbling sounds and a dreadful choking and gurgling had mr krest fallen out of his hammock reluctantly bond dropped his things back on the deck and walked over and climbed the ladder as his eyes came level with the boatdeck the choking stopped instead there was another a more dreadful sound the quick drumming of heels bond knew that sound he leapt up the last steps and ran towards the figure lying spreadeagled on its back in the bright moonlight he stopped and knelt slowly down aghast the horror of the strangled face was bad enough but it was not mr krests tongue that protruded from his gaping mouth it was the tail of a fish the colours were pink and black it was the hildebrand rarity the man was dead horribly dead when the fish had been crammed into his mouth he must have reached up and desperately tried to tug it out but the spines of the dorsal and anal fins had caught inside the cheeks and some of the spiny tips now protruded through the bloodflecked skin round the obscene mouth bond shuddered death must have come inside a minute but what a minute bond slowly got to his feet he walked over to the racks of glass specimen jars and peered under the protective awning the plastic cover of the end jar lay on the deck beside it bond wiped it carefully on the tarpaulin and then holding it by the tips of his fingernails laid it loosely back over the mouth of the jar he went back and stood over the corpse which of the two had done this there was a touch of fiendish spite in using the treasured prize as a weapon that suggested the woman she certainly had her reasons but fidele barbey with his creole blood would have had the cruelty and at the same time the macabre humour je lui ai foutu son sacr poisson dans la geule bond could hear him say the words if after bond had left the saloon mr krest had needled the seychellois just a little bit further particularly about his family or his beloved islands fidele barbey would not have hit him then and there or used a knife he would have waited and plotted bond looked round the deck the snoring of the man could have been a signal for either of them there were ladders to the boatdeck from both sides of the cabindeck amidships the man at the wheel in the pilothouse forrard would have heard nothing above the noise from the engineroom to pick the small fish out of its formalin bath and slip it into mr krests gaping mouth would have only needed seconds bond shrugged whichever had done it had not thought of the consequences of the inevitable inquest perhaps of a trial in which he bond would be an additional suspect they were certainly all going to be in one hell of a mess unless he could tidy things up bond glanced over the edge of the boatdeck below was the threefootwide strip of deck that ran the length of the ship between this and the sea there was a twofoothigh rail supposing the hammock had broken and mr krest had fallen and rolled under the speedboat and over the edge of the upper deck could he have reached the sea hardly in this dead calm but that was what he was going to have done bond got moving with a tableknife from the saloon he carefully frayed and then broke one of the main cords of the hammock so that the hammock trailed realistically on the deck next with a damp cloth he cleaned up the specks of blood on the woodwork and the drops of formalin that led from the specimen jar then came the hardest part handling the corpse carefully bond pulled it to the very edge of the deck and himself went down the ladder and bracing himself reached up the corpse came down on top of him in a heavy drunken embrace bond staggered under it to the low rail and eased it over there was a last hideous glimpse of the obscenely bulging face a sickening fume of stale whisky a heavy splash and it was gone and rolling sluggishly away in the small waves of the wake bond flattened himself back against the saloon hatchway ready to slip through if the helmsman came aft to investigate but there was no movement forrard and the iron tramp of the diesels held steady bond sighed deeply it would be a very troublesome coroner who brought in anything but misadventure he went back to the boatdeck gave it a final look over disposed of the knife and the wet cloth and went down the ladder to his bed in the well it was twofifteen bond was asleep inside ten minutes by pushing the speed up to twelve knots they made north point by six oclock that evening behind them the sky was ablaze with red and gold streaked across aquamarine the two men with the woman between them stood at the rail of the welldeck and watched the brilliant shore slip by across the motherofpearl mirror of the sea liz krest was wearing a white linen frock with a black belt and a black and white handkerchief round her neck the mourning colours went well with the golden skin the three people stood stiffly and rather selfconsciously each one nursing his own piece of secret knowledge each one anxious to convey to the other two that their particular secrets were safe with him that morning there had seemed to be a conspiracy among the three to sleep late even bond had not been awakened by the sun until ten oclock he showered in the crews quarters and chatted with the helmsman before going below to see what had happened to fidele barbey he was still in bed he said he had a hangover had he been very rude to mr krest he couldnt remember much about it except that he seemed to recall mr krest being very rude to him you remember what i said about him from the beginning james a grand slam redoubled in bastards now do you agree with me one of these days someones going to shut that soft ugly mouth of his for ever inconclusive bond had fixed himself some breakfast in the galley and was eating it there when liz krest had come in to do the same she was dressed in a pale blue shantung kimono to her knees there were dark rings under her eyes and she ate her breakfast standing but she seemed perfectly calm and at ease she whispered conspiratorially i do apologize about last night i suppose id had a bit too much to drink too but do forgive milt hes really awfully nice its only when hes had a bit too much that he gets sort of difficult hes always sorry the next morning youll see when eleven oclock came and neither of the other two showed any signs of so to speak blowing the gaff bond decided to force the pace he looked very hard at liz krest who was lying on her stomach in the welldeck reading a magazine he said by the way wheres your husband still sleeping it off she frowned i suppose so he went up to his hammock on the boatdeck ive no idea what time i took a sleepingpill and went straight off fidele barbey had a line out for amberjack without looking round he said hes probably in the pilothouse bond said if hes still asleep on the boatdeck hell be getting the hell of a sunburn liz krest said oh poor milt i hadnt thought of that ill go and see she climbed the ladder when her head was above the level of the boatdeck she stopped she called down anxiously jim hes not here and the hammocks broken bond said fideles probably right ill have a look forrard he went to the pilothouse fritz the mate and the engineer were there bond said anyone seen mr krest fritz looked puzzled no sir why is anything wrong bond flooded his face with anxiety hes not aft here come on look round everywhere he was sleeping on the boatdeck hes not there and his hammocks broken he was rather the worse for wear last night come on get cracking when the inevitable conclusion had been reached liz krest had a short but credible fit of hysteria bond took her to her cabin and left her there in tears its all right liz he said you stay out of this ill look after everything well have to radio port victoria and so on ill tell fritz to put on speed im afraid its hopeless turning back to look thereve been six hours of daylight when he couldnt have fallen overboard without being heard or seen it must have been in the night im afraid anything like six hours in these seas is just not on she stared at him her eyes wide you mean you mean sharks and things bond nodded oh milt poor darling milt oh why did this have to happen bond went out and softly shut the door the yacht rounded cannon point and reduced speed keeping well away from the broken reef it slid quietly across the broad bay now lemon and gunmetal in the last light towards the anchorage the small township beneath the mountains was already dark with indigo shadow in which a sprinkling of yellow lights showed bond saw the customs and immigration launch move off from long pier to meet them the little community would already be buzzing with the news that would have quickly leaked from the radio station to the seychelles club and then through the members chauffeurs and staffs into the town liz krest turned to him im beginning to get nervous will you help me through the rest of this these awful formalities and things of course fidele barbey said dont worry too much all these people are my friends and the chief justice is my uncle we shall all have to make a statement theyll probably have the inquest tomorrow youll be able to leave the day after you really think so a dew of sweat had sprung below her eyes the trouble is i dont really know where to leave for or what to do next i suppose she hesitated not looking at bond i suppose james you wouldnt like to come on to mombasa i mean youre going there anyway and id be able to get you there a day earlier than this ship of yours this camp something kampala bond lit a cigarette to cover his hesitation four days in a beautiful yacht with this girl but the tail of that fish sticking out of the mouth had she done it or had fidele who would know that his uncles and cousins on mahe would somehow see that he came to no harm if only one of them would make a slip bond said easily thats terribly nice of you liz of course id love to come fidele barbey chuckled bravo my friend and i would love to be in your shoes but for one thing that damned fish it is a great responsibility i like to think of you both being deluged with cables from the smithsonian about it dont forget that you are now both trustees of a scientific kohinoor and you know what these americans are theyll worry the life out of you until theyve got their hands on it bonds eyes were hard as flint as he watched the girl surely that put the finger on her now he would make some excuse get out of the trip there had been some thing about that particular way of killing a man but the beautiful candid eyes did not flicker she looked up into fidele barbeys face and said easily charmingly that wont be a problem ive decided to give it to the british museum james bond noticed that the sweat dew had now gathered at her temples but after all it was a desperately hot evening the thud of the engines stopped and the anchor chain roared down into the quiet bay
