 the glittering gate by lord dunsany persons scene a lonely place time the present the lonely place is strewn with large black rocks and uncorked beerbottles the latter in great profusion at back is a wall of granite built of great slabs and in it the gate of heaven the door is of gold below the lonely place is an abyss hung with stars the rising curtain reveals jim wearily uncorking a beerbottle then he tilts it slowly and with infinite care it proves to be empty faint and unpleasant laughter is heard off this action and accompanying far laughter are repeated continually throughout the play corked bottles are discovered lying behind rocks and more descend constantly through the air within reach of jim all prove to be empty jim uncorks a few bottles jim thats a full one bill enters from left with a bullethole over his eye singing rule britannia britannia rule the waves why ullo eres a bottle of beer im getting a bit tired of those blooming great stars down there and this rocky ledge

who dwelt in our midst and of an evening sitting over the fire i used to say i am as clever as jim but i was nt jim i could nt climb like you and i could nt walk like you on a creaky stair when

revolver in one hand and a candle in the other and you almost going round with him jim what is putney bill oh jim cant you remember cant you remember the day you taught me a livelihood i was nt more than twelve and it was spring and all the may was in blossom outside the town and we cleared out no in the new street and the next day we saw the mans fat silly face it was thirty years ago jim what

you ought to cheer up jim jim all the beer youre ever likely to see again theyre empty bill half rising from the rock on which he has seated himself and pointing his finger at jim as he rises very cheerfully why youre the chap that said there was no hope here and youre hoping to find beer in every bottle you open jim yes i hope to see a drop of beer in one some day but i know i wont their trick might not work just once bill how many have you tried jim jim oh i dont know ive always been at it working as fast as i can ever since ever since feels his neck meditatively and up toward his ear why ever since bill bill why dont you stop it jim im too thirsty bill bill what do you think ive got jim jim i dont know nothings any use bill whos that laughing jim jim astonished at such a question

dont know but jim what do you think ive got jim it isnt any use to you whatever it is not even if its a tenpound note bill its better than a tenpound note jim jim try and remember jim dont you remember the way we used to go for these iron safes do you remember anything jim jim yes i am beginning to remember now there used to be sunsets and then there were great yellow lights and one went in behind them through a swinging door bill yes yes jim that was the blue bear down at wimbledon jim yes and the room was all full of golden light and there was beer with light in it and some would be spilt on the counter and there was light in that too and there was a girl standing there with yellow hair shed be the other side of that door now with lamplight in her hair among the angels and the old smile on her lips if one of them chaffed her and her pretty teeth ashining she would be very near the throne there was never any harm in jane bill no there was never any arm in jane jim jim oh i dont want to see the angels bill but if i could see jane again he might laugh as much as he cared to whenever i wanted to cry you cant cry here you know bill bill you shall see her again jim jim takes no interest in this remark he lowers his eyes and goes on with his work bill jim you shall see her again you want to get into heaven dont you jim want bill jim do you know what ive got jim bill you remember those iron safes jim how we used to knock them open like walnuts with old nutcracker jim empty again bill well ive got old nutcracker i had him in my hand at the time and they let me keep him they thought it would be a nice proof against me jim nothing is any good here bill ill get in to heaven jim and you shall come with me because you taught me a livelihood i could nt be happy there like those angels if i knew of anyone being outside im not like that bill jim jim youll see jane there jim youll never get through those gates bill youll never do it bill theyre only gold jim golds soft like lead old nutcracker would do it if they were steel jim youll never do it bill bill puts a rock against the gates stands on it to reach the lock and gets to work on the lock a good instrument to use is an eggwhipper jim goes on wearily with his work as bill works away fragments and golden screws begin to fall on the floor bill jim old nutcracker thinks nothing of it its just like cheese to old nutcracker jim they wont let you do it bill bill they dont know what ive got im getting through it like cheese jim jim suppose its a mile thick suppose its a million miles thick suppose its a hundred million miles thick bill cant be jim those doors are meant to open outward they could nt do that if they were more than four inches thick at the most not for an archbishop theyd stick jim you remember that great safe we broke open once what had coal in it bill this is nt a safe jim this is heaven therell be the old saints with their halos shining and flickering like windows o wintry nights and angels thick as swallows along a cottage roof the day before they go and orchards full of apples as far as you can see and the rivers tigris and euphrates so the bible says and a city of gold for those that care for cities all full of precious stones but im a bit tired of cities and precious stones ill go out into the fields where the orchards are by the tigris and euphrates i should nt be surprised if my old mother was there she never cared much for the way i earned my livelihood but she was a good mother to me i dont know if they want a good mother in there who would be kind to the angels and sit and smile at them when they sang and soothe them if they were cross if they let all the good ones in shell be there all right jim they wont have brought me up against her will they thats not fair evidence jim jim it would be just like them to very like them bill if theres a glass of beer to be got in heaven or a dish of tripe and onions or a pipe of bacca shell have them for me when i come to her she used to know my ways wonderful and what i liked and she used to know when to expect me almost anywhere i used to climb in through the window at any hour and she always knew it was me shell know its me at the door now jim it will be all a blaze of light and ill hardly know its her till i get used to it but ill know her among a million angels there were nt none like her on earth and there wont be none like her in heaven jim im through jim one more turn and old nutcrackers done it its giving its giving i know the feel of it jim at last there is a noise of falling bolts the gates swing out an inch and are stopped by the rock bill jim jim ive opened it jim ive opened the gate of heaven come and help me jim looks up for a moment with open mouth then he mournfully shakes his head and goes on drawing a cork another one empty bill looks down once into the abyss that lies below the lonely place stars blooming great stars then he moves away the rock on which he stood the gates move slowly jim leaps up and runs to help they each take a gate and move backward with their faces against it bill hullo mother you there hullo you there its bill mother the gates swing heavily open revealing empty night and stars bill staggering and gazing into the revealed nothing in which far stars go wandering stars blooming great stars there aint no heaven jim ever since the revelation a cruel and violent laugh has arisen off it increases in volume and grows louder and louder jim thats like them thats very like them yes theyd do that
