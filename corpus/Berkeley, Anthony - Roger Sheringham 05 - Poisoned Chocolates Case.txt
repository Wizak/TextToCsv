the poisoned chocolates case anthony berkeley chapter i roger sheringham took a sip of the old brandy in front of him and leaned back in his chair at the head of the table through the haze of cigarette smoke eager voices reached his ears from all directions prattling joy fully upon this and that connected with murder poisons and sudden death for this was his own his very own crimes circle founded organised collected and now run by himself alone and when at the first meeting five months ago he had been unanimously elected its president he had been as full of proud delight as on that never to be forgotten day in the dim past when a cherub disguised as a publisher had accepted his first novel he turned to chief inspector moresby of scotland yard who as the guest of the evening was sitting on his right engaged a little uneasily with a positively enormous cigar honestly moresby without any disrespect to your own institution i do believe that theres more solid criminological genius in this room than anywhere in the world outside the surete in paris do you mr sheringham said chief inspector moresby tolerantly moresby was always kind to the strange opinions of others well well and he applied himself again to the lighted end of his cigar which was so very far from the other that moresby could never tell by mere suction at the latter whether the former were still alight or not roger had some grounds for his assertion beyond mere parental pride entry into the charmed crimes circles dinners was not to be gained by all and hungry it was not enough for a would be member to profess an adoration for murder and let it go at that he or she had got to prove that they were capable of worthily wearing their criminological spurs not only must the interest be intense in all branches of the science in the detection side for instance just as much as the side of criminal psychology with the history of all cases of the least importance at the applicants finger tips but there must be constructive ability too the candidate must have a brain and be able to use it to this end a paper had to be written from a choice of subjects suggested by members and submitted to the president who passed on such as he considered worthy to the members in conclave who thereupon voted for or against the suppliants election and a single adverse vote meant rejection it was the intention of the club to acquire eventually thirteen members but so far only six had succeeded in passing their tests and these were all present on the evening when this chronicle opens there was a famous lawyer a scarcely less famous woman dramatist a brilliant novelist who ought to have been more famous than she was the most intelligent of living detective story writers roger sheringham himself and mr ambrose chitterwick who was not famous at all a mild little man of no particular appearance who had been even more surprised at being admitted to this company of personages than they had been at finding him amongst them with the exception of mr chitterwick then it was an assembly of which any organiser might have been proud roger this evening was not only proud but excited too because he was going to startle them and it is always exciting to startle personages he rose to do so ladies and gentlemen he proclaimed after the welcome of glasses and cigarette cases drummed on the table had died away ladies and gentlemen in virtue of the powers conferred by you the president of our circle is permitted to alter at his discretion the arrangements made for any meeting you all know what arrangements were made for this evening chief inspector moresby whom we are so glad to welcome as the first representative of scotland yard to visit us more drumming on the table chief inspector moresby was to be lulled by rich food and sound wine into being so indiscreet as to tell us about such of his experiences as could hardly be given to a body of pressmen more and longer drumming roger refreshed himself with a sip of brandy and continued now i think i know chief inspector moresby pretty well ladies and gentlemen and the occasions are not a few on which i too have tried and tried very hard to lure him similarly into the paths of indiscretion but never once have i succeeded i have therefore little hope that this circle lure it never so cooingly will succeed in getting from the chief inspector any more interesting stories than he would mind being published in the daily courier tomorrow chief inspector moresby i am afraid ladies and gentlemen is unlurable i have therefore taken upon myself the responsibility of altering our entertainment for this evening and the idea that has occurred to me in this connection will i both hope and believe appeal to you very considerably i venture to think that it is both novel and enthralling roger paused and beamed on the interested faces around him chief inspector moresby a little puce below the ears was still at grips with his cigar my idea roger said is connected with mr graham bendix there was a little stir of interest or rather he amended more slowly with mrs graham bendix the stir subsided into a still more interested hush roger paused as if choosing his words with more care mr bendix himself is personally known to one or two of us here indeed his name has actually been mentioned as that of a man who might possibly be interested if approached to become a member of this circle by sir charles wildman if i remember rightly the barrister inclined his rather massive head with dignity yes i suggested him once i think the suggestion was never followed up roger continued i dont quite remember why not i think somebody else was rather sure that he would never be able to pass all our tests but in any case the fact that his name was ever mentioned at all shows that mr bendix is to some extent at least a criminologist which means that our sympathy with him in the terrible tragedy that has befallen him is tinged with something of a personal interest even in the case of those who like myself are not actually acquainted with him hear hear said a tall good looking woman on the right of the table in the clear tones of one very well accustomed to saying hear hear weightily at appropriate moments during speeches in case no one else did this was alicia dammers the novelist who ran womens institutes for a hobby listened to other peoples speeches with genuine and altruistic enjoyment and in practice the most staunch of conservatives supported with enthusiasm the theories of the socialist party my suggestion is roger said simply that we turn that sympathy to practical uses there was no doubt that the eager attention of his audience was caught sir charles wildman lifted his bushy gray brows from under which he was wont to frown with menacing disgust at the prosecutions witnesses who had the bad taste to believe in the guilt of his own client and swung his gold rimmed eye glasses on their broad black ribbon on the other side of the table mrs fielder flemming a short round homely looking woman who wrote surprisingly improper and most successful plays and looked exactly like a rather superior cook on her sunday out nudged the elbow of miss dammers and whispered something behind her hand mr ambrose chitterwick blinked his mild blue eyes and assumed the appearance of an intelligent nanny goat the writer of detective stories alone sat apparently unmoved and impassive but in times of crisis he was wont to model his behaviour on that of his own favourite detective who was invariably impassive at the most exciting moments i took the idea to scotland yard this morning roger went on and though they never encourage that sort of idea there they were really unable to discover any positive harm in it with the result that i came away with a reluctant but nevertheless official permission to try it out and i may as well say at once that it was the same cue that prompted this permission as originally put the whole thing into my head roger paused impressively and glanced round the fact that the police have practically given up all hope of tracing mrs bendixs murderer ejaculations sounded on all sides some of dismay some of disgust and some of astonishment all eyes turned upon moresby that gentleman apparently unconscious of the collective gaze fastened upon him raised his cigar to his ear and listened to it intently as if hoping to receive some intimate message from its depths roger came to his rescue that information is quite confidential by the way and i know none of you will let it escape beyond this room but it is a fact active inquiries having resulted in exactly nothing are to be stopped there is always hope of course that some fresh fact may turn up but without it the authorities have come to the conclusion that they can get no farther my proposal is therefore that this club should take up the case where the authorities have left it and he looked expectantly round the circle of upturned faces every face asked a question at once roger forgot his periods in his enthusiasm and became colloquial why you see were all keen were not fools and were not tied to any hard and fast method of investigation is it too much to hope that with all six of us on our mettle and working quite independently of each other one of us might achieve some result where the police have to put it bluntly failed i dont think its outside the possibilities what do you say sir charles the famous counsel uttered a deep laugh pon my word sheringham its an interesting idea but i must reserve judgment till youve outlined your proposal in a little more detail i think its a wonderful idea mr sheringham cried mrs fielder flemming who was not troubled with a legal mind id like to begin this very evening her plump cheeks positively quivered with excitement wouldnt you alicia it has possibilities smiled that lady as a matter of fact said the writer of detective stories with an air of detachment id formed a theory of my own about this case already his name was percy robinson but he wrote under the pseudonym of morton harrogate bradley which had so impressed the more simple citizens of the united states of america that they had bought three editions of his first book on the strength of that alone for some obscure psychological reason americans are always impressed by the use of surnames for christian and particularly when one of them happens to be the name of an english watering place mr ambrose chitterwick beamed in a mild way but said nothing well roger took up his tale the details are open to discussion of course but i thought that if we all decide to make the trial it would be more amusing if we worked independently moresby here can give us the plain facts as theyre known to the police he hasnt been in charge of the case himself but hes had one or two jobs in connection with it and is pretty well up in the facts moreover he has very kindly spent most of the afternoon examining the dossier at scotland yard so as to be sure of omitting nothing this evening when weve heard him some of us may be able to form a theory at once possible lines of investigation may occur to others which they will wish to follow up before they commit themselves in any case i suggest that we allow ourselves a week in which to form our theories verify our hypotheses and set our individual interpretations on the facts that scotland yard has collected during which time no member shall discuss the case with any other member we may achieve nothing but in any case it will be a most interesting criminological exercise for some of us practical for others academical just as we prefer and what i think should be most interesting will be to see if we all arrive at the same result or not ladies and gentlemen the meeting is open for discussion or whatever is the right way of putting it in other words what about it and roger dropped back not reluctantly into his seat almost before his trousers had touched it the first question reached him do you mean that were to go out and act as our own detectives mr sheringham or just write a thesis on the facts that the chief inspector is going to give us asked alicia dammers whichever each one of us preferred i thought roger answered thats what i meant when i said that the exercise would be practical for some of us and academic for others but youve got so much more experience than us on the practical side mr sheringham pouted mrs fielder flemming and the police have so much more than me roger countered it will depend whether we use deductive or inductive methods no doubt observed mr morton harrogate bradley those who prefer the former will work from the police facts and wont need to make any investigations of their own except perhaps to verify a conclusion or two but the inductive method demands a good deal of inquiry exactly said roger police facts and the deductive method have solved plenty of serious mysteries in this country pronounced sir charles wildman i shall rely on them for this one theres one particular feature of this case murmured mr bradley to nobody that ought to lead one straight to the criminal ive thought so at the time i shall concentrate on that im sure i havent the remotest idea how one sets about investigating a point if it becomes desirable observed mr chitterwick uneasily but nobody heard him so it did not matter the only thing that struck me about this case said alicia dammers very distinctly regarded i mean as a pure case was its complete absence of any psychological interest whatever and without actually saying so miss dammers conveyed the impression that if that were so she personally had no further use for it i dont think youll say that when youve heard what moresbys got to tell us roger said gently were going to hear a great deal more than has appeared in the newspapers you know then lets hear it suggested sir charles bluntly were all agreed then said roger looking round as happily as a child who has been given a new toy everybody is willing to try it out amid the ensuing chorus of enthusiasm one voice alone was silent mr ambrose chitterwick was still wondering quite unhappily how if it ever became necessary to go a detecting one went he had studied the reminiscences of a hundred ex detectives the real ones with large black boots and bowler hats but all he could remember at that moment out of all those scores of fat books was that a real real detective if he means to attain results never puts on a false moustache but simply shaves his eyebrows as a mystery solving formula this seemed to mr chitterwick inadequate fortunately in the buzz of chatter that preceded the very reluctant rising of chief inspector moresby mr chitterwicks poltroonery went unnoticed chapter ii chief inspector moresby having stood up and blushingly received his tribute of hand claps was invited to address the gathering from his chair and thankfully retired into that shelter consulting the sheaf of notes in his hand he began to enlighten his very attentive audience as to the strange circumstances connected with mrs bendixs untimely death without reproducing his own words and all the numerous supplementary questions which punctuated his story the gist of what he had to tell was as follows on friday morning the fifteenth of november graham bendix strolled into his club the rainbow in piccadilly at about ten thirty and asked if there were any letters for him the porter handed him a letter and a couple of circulars and he walked over to the fireplace in the hall to read them while he was doing so another member entered the club this was a middle aged baronet sir eustace pennefather who had rooms just round the corner in berkeley street but spent most of his time at the rainbow the porter glanced up at the clock as he did every morning when sir eustace came in and as always it was exactly half past ten the time was thus definitely fixed by the porter beyond any doubt there were three letters and a small parcel for sir eustace and he too took them over to the fireplace to open nodding to bendix as he joined him there the two men knew each other only very slightly and had probably never exchanged more than half a dozen words in all there were no other members in the hall just then having glanced through his letters sir eustace opened the parcel and snorted with disgust bendix looked at him enquiringly and with a grunt sir eustace thrust out the letter which had been enclosed in the parcel adding an uncomplimentary remark upon modern trade methods concealing a smile bendix read the letter it was from the firm of mason sons the big chocolate manufacturers and was to the effect that they had just put on the market a new brand of liqueur chocolates designed especially to appeal to the cultivated palates of men of taste sir eustace being presumably a man of taste would he be good enough to honour mr mason and his sons by accepting the enclosed one pound box and any criticisms or appreciation that he might have to make concerning them would be esteemed almost more than a favour do they think im a blasted chorus girl fumed sir eustace a choleric man to write em testimonials about their blasted chocolates blast em ill complain to the blasted committee that sort of blasted thing cant blasted well be allowed here for the rainbow club as every one knows is a very proud and exclusive club indeed with an unbroken descent from the rainbow coffee house founded in not even a family founded by a kings bastard can be quite so exclusive today as a club founded on a coffee house well its an ill wind so far as im concerned bendix soothed him its reminded me of something ive got to get some chocolates myself to pay an honourable debt my wife and i had a box at the imperial last night and i bet her a box of chocolates to a hundred cigarettes that she wouldnt spot the villain by the end of the second act she won i must remember to get them its not a bad show the creaking skull have you seen it not blasted likely replied the other unsoothed got something better to do than sit and watch a lot of blasted fools messing about with phosphorescent paint and pooping off blasted pop guns at each other want a box of chocolates did you say well take this blasted one the money saved by this offer had no weight with bendix he was a very wealthy man and probably had enough on him in actual cash to buy a hundred such boxes but trouble is always worth saving sure you dont want them he demurred politely in sir eustaces reply only one word several times repeated was clearly recognisable but his meaning was plain bendix thanked him and most unfortunately for himself accepted the gift by an extraordinarily lucky chance the wrapper of the box was not thrown into the fire either by sir eustace in his indignation or by bendix himself when the whole collection box covering letter wrapper and string was shovelled into his hands by the almost apoplectic baronet this was the more fortunate as both men had already tossed the envelopes of their letters into the flames bendix however merely walked over to the porters desk and deposited everything there asking the man to keep the box for him the porter put the box aside and threw the wrapper into the waste paper basket the covering letter had fallen unnoticed from bendixs hand as he walked across the floor this the porter tidily picked up a few minutes later and put in the waste paper basket too whence with the wrapper it was retrieved later by the police these two articles it may be said at once constituted two of the only three tangible clues to the murder the third of course being the chocolates themselves of the three unconscious protagonists in the impending tragedy sir eustace was by far the most remarkable still a year or two under fifty he looked with his flaming red face and thickset figure a typical country squire of the old school and both his manners and his language were in accordance with tradition there were other resemblances too but they were equally on the surface the voices of the country squires of the old school were often slightly husky towards late middle age but it was not with whisky they hunted and so did sir eustace with avidity but the country squires confined their hunting to foxes and sir eustace was far more catholic in his predatory tastes sir eustace in short without doubt was a thoroughly bad baronet but his vices were all on the large scale with the usual result that most other men good or bad liked him well enough and women openly hung on his husky words in comparison with him bendix was rather an ordinary man a tall dark not unhandsome fellow of eight and twenty quiet and somewhat reserved popular in a way but neither inviting nor apparently reciprocating anything beyond a somewhat grave friendliness he had been left a rich man on the death five years ago of his father who had made a fortune out of land sites which he had bought up in undeveloped areas with an uncanny foresight to sell later at never less than ten times what he had given for them when surrounded by houses and factories erected with other peoples money just sit tight and let other people make you rich had been his motto and a very sound one it proved his son though left with an income that precluded any necessity to work had evidently inherited his fathers tendencies for he had a finger in a good many business pies just out of sheer love of the most exciting game in the world money attracts money graham bendix had inherited it he made it and inevitably he married it too the orphaned daughter of a liverpool shipowner she was with not far off half a million in her own right to bring to bendix who needed it not at all but the money was incidental for he needed her if not her fortune and would have married her just as inevitably if she had had not a farthing she was so exactly his type a tall rather serious minded highly cultured girl not so young that her character had not had time to form she was the ideal wife for him a bit of a puritan perhaps in some ways but bendix himself was ready enough to be a puritan by then if joan cullompton was for in spite of the way he developed later bendix had sown as a youth a few wild oats in the normal way stage doors that is to say had not been entirely strange to him his name had been mentioned in connection with that of more than one frail and fluffy lady he had managed in short to amuse himself discreetly but by no means clandestinely in the usual manner of young men with too much money and too few years but all that again in the ordinary way had stopped with his marriage he was openly devoted to his wife and did not care who knew it while she too if a trifle less obviously was equally said to wear her heart on her sleeve to make no bones about it the bendixes had apparently succeeded in achieving that eighth wonder of the modern world a happy marriage and into the middle of it there dropped like a clap of thunder the box of chocolates after depositing the box of chocolates with the porter moresby continued shuffling his papers to find the right one mr bendix followed sir eustace into the lounge where he was reading the morning post roger nodded approval there was no other paper that sir eustace could possibly have been reading but the morning post bendix himself proceeded to study the daily telegraph he was rather at a loose end that morning there were no board meetings for him and none of the businesses in which he was interested called him out into the rain of a typical november day he spent the rest of the morning in an aimless way read the daily papers glanced through the weeklies and played a hundred up at billiards with another member equally idle at about half past twelve he went back to lunch to his house in eaton square taking the chocolates with him mrs bendix had given orders that she would not be in to lunch that day but her appointment had been cancelled and she too was lunching at home bendix gave her the box of chocolates after the meal as they were sitting over their coffee in the drawing room explaining how they had come into his possession mrs bendix laughingly teased him about his meanness in not buying her a box but approved the make and was interested to try the firms new variety joan bendix was not so serious minded as not to have a healthy feminine interest in good chocolates their appearance however did not seem to impress her very much kummel kirsch maraschino she said delving with her fingers among the silver wrapped sweets each bearing the name of its filling in neat blue lettering nothing else apparently i dont see anything new here graham theyve just taken those three kinds out of their ordinary liqueur chocolates oh said bendix who was not particularly interested in chocolates well i dont suppose it matters much all liqueur chocolates taste the same to me yes and theyve even packed them in their usual liqueur chocolate box complained his wife examining the lid theyre only a sample bendix pointed out they may not have got the right boxes ready yet i dont believe theres the slightest difference mrs bendix pronounced unwrapping a kummel she held the box out to her husband have one he shook his head no thank you dear you know i never eat the things well youve got to have one of these as a penance for not buying me a proper box catch she threw him one as he caught it she made a wry face oh i was wrong these are different theyre twenty times as strong well they can bear at least that bendix smiled thinking of the usual anaemic sweetmeat sold under the name of chocolate liqueur he put the one she had given him in his mouth and bit it up a burning taste not intolerable but far too pronounced to be pleasant followed the release of the liquid by jove he exclaimed i should think they are strong i believe theyve filled them with neat alcohol oh they wouldnt do that surely said his wife unwrapping another but they are very strong it must be the new mixture really they almost burn im not sure whether i like them or not and that kirsch one tasted far too strongly of almonds this may be better you try a maraschino too to humour her he swallowed another and disliked it still more funny he remarked touching the roof of his mouth with the tip of his tongue my tongue feels quite numb so did mine at first she agreed now its tingling rather well i dont notice any difference between the kirsch and the maraschino and they do burn i cant make up my mind whether i like them or not i dont bendix said with decision i think theres something wrong with them i shouldnt eat any more if i were you well theyre only an experiment i suppose said his wife a few minutes later bendix went out to keep an appointment in the city he left his wife still trying to make up her mind whether she liked the chocolates or not and still eating them to decide her last words to him were that they were making her mouth burn again so much that she was afraid she would not be able to manage any more mr bendix remembers that conversation very clearly said moresby looking round at the intent faces because it was the last time he saw his wife alive the conversation in the drawing room had taken place approximately between a quarter past and half past two bendix kept his appointment in the city at three where he stayed for about half an hour and then took a taxi back to his club for tea he had been feeling extremely ill during his business talk and in the taxi he very nearly collapsed the driver had to summon the porter to help get him out and into the club they both describe him as pale to the point of ghastliness with staring eyes and livid lips and his skin damp and clammy his mind seemed unaffected however and once they had got him up the steps he was able to walk with the help of the porters arm into the lounge the porter alarmed by his appearance wanted to send for a doctor at once but bendix who was the last man to make a fuss absolutely refused to let him saying that it could only be a bad attack of indigestion and that he would be all right in a few minutes he must have eaten something that disagreed with him the porter was doubtful but left him bendix repeated this diagnosis of his own condition a few minutes later to sir eustace pennefather who was in the lounge at the time not having left the club at all but this time bendix added and i believe it was those infernal chocolates you gave me now i come to think of it i thought there was something funny about them at the time id better go and ring up my wife and find out if shes been taken like this too sir eustace a kind hearted man who was no less shocked than the porter at bendixs appearance was perturbed by the suggestion that he might in any way be responsible for it and offered to go and ring up mrs bendix himself as the other was in no fit condition to move bendix was about to reply when a strange change came over him his body which had been leaning limply back in his chair suddenly heaved rigidly upright his jaws locked together the livid lips drawn back in a hideous grin and his hands clenched on the arms of the chair at the same time sir eustace became aware of an unmistakable smell of bitter almonds thoroughly alarmed now believing indeed that bendix was dying under his eyes he raised a shout for the porter and a doctor there were two or three other men at the further end of the big room and these hurried up at once sir eustace sent one off to tell the porter to get hold of the nearest doctor without a seconds delay and enlisted the others to try to make the convulsed body a little more comfortable there was no doubt among them that bendix had taken poison they spoke to him asking how he felt and what they could do for him but he either would or could not answer as a matter of fact he was completely unconscious before the doctor had arrived a telephone message was received from an agitated butler asking if mr bendix was there and if so would he come home at once as mrs bendix had been taken seriously ill at the house in eaton square matters had been taking much the same course with mrs bendix as with her husband though a little more rapidly she remained for half an hour or so in the drawing room after the latters departure during which time she must have eaten about three more of the chocolates she then went up to her bedroom and rang for her maid to whom she said that she felt very ill and was going to lie down for a time like her husband she ascribed her condition to a violent attack of indigestion the maid mixed her a draught from a bottle of indigestion powder which consisted mainly of bicarbonate of soda and bismuth and brought her a hot water bottle leaving her lying on the bed her description of her mistresss appearance tallied exactly with the porters and taxi mans description of bendix but unlike them she did not seem to have been alarmed by it she admitted later to the opinion that mrs bendix though anything but a greedy woman must have overeaten herself at lunch at a quarter past three there was a violent ring from the bell in mrs bendixs room the girl hurried upstairs and found her mistress apparently in a cataleptic fit unconscious and rigid thoroughly frightened now she wasted some precious minutes in ineffectual attempts to bring her round and then hurried downstairs to telephone for the doctor the practitioner who regularly attended the house was not at home and it was some time before the butler who had found the half hysterical girl at the telephone and taken matters into his own hands could get into communication with another by the time the latter did get there nearly half an hour after mrs bendixs bell had rung she was past help coma had set in and in spite of everything the doctor could do she died in less than ten minutes after his arrival she was in fact already dead when the butler telephoned to the rainbow club chapter iii having reached this stage in his narrative moresby paused for effect breath and refreshment so far in spite of the eager interest with which the story had been followed no fact had been brought out of which his listeners were unaware it was the police investigations that they wanted to hear for not only had no details of these been published but not so much as a hint had been given even as to the theory that was officially held perhaps moresby had gathered something of this sentiment for after a moments rest he resumed with a slight smile well ladies and gentlemen i shant keep you much longer with these preliminaries but its just as well to run through everything while were on it if we want to get a view of the case as a whole as you know then mr bendix himself did not die luckily for himself he had eaten only two of the chocolates as against his wifes seven but still more luckily he had fallen into the hands of a clever doctor by the time her doctor saw mrs bendix it was too late for him to do anything but the smaller amount of poison that mr bendix had swallowed meant that its progress was not so rapid and the doctor had time to save him not that the doctor knew then what the poison was he treated him chiefly for prussic acid poisoning thinking from the symptoms and the smell that mr bendix must have taken oil of bitter almonds but he wasnt sure and threw in one or two other things as well anyhow it turned out in the end that he couldnt have had a fatal dose and he was conscious again by about eight oclock that night theyd put him into one of the club bedrooms and by the next day he was convalescent at first moresby went on to explain it was thought at scotland yard that mrs bendixs death and her husbands narrow escape were due to a terrible accident the police had of course taken the matter in hand as soon as the womans death was reported to them and the fact of poison established in due course a district detective inspector arrived at the rainbow club and as soon as the doctor would permit after bendixs recovery of consciousness held an interview with the still very sick man the fact of his wifes death was kept from him in his doubtful condition and he was questioned solely upon his own experience for it was already clear that the two cases were bound up together and light on one would equally clarify the other the inspector told bendix bluntly that he had been poisoned and pressed him as to how the stuff could have been taken could he account for it in any way it was not long before the chocolates came into bendixs mind he mentioned their burning taste and he mentioned having already spoken to sir eustace about them as the possible cause of his illness this the inspector already knew he had spent the time before bendix came round in interviewing such people as had come into contact with him since his return to the club that afternoon he had heard the porters story and he had taken steps to trace the taxi man he had spoken with the members who had gathered round bendix in the lounge and sir eustace had reported to him the remark of bendix about the chocolates the inspector had not attached very much importance to this at the moment but simply as a matter of routine had questioned sir eustace closely as to the whole episode and again as a matter of routine had afterwards rummaged through the waste paper basket and extricated the wrapper and the covering letter still as a matter of routine and still not particularly impressed he now proceeded to question bendix on the same topic and then at last began to realise its significance as he heard how the two had shared the chocolates after lunch and how even before bendix had left home the wife had eaten more than the husband the doctor now intervened and the inspector had to leave the sick room his first action was to telephone to his colleague at the bendix home and tell him to take possession without delay of the box of chocolates which was probably still in the drawing room at the same time he asked for a rough idea of the number of chocolates that were missing the other told him nine or ten the inspector who on bendixs information had only accounted for six or seven rang off and telephoned what he had learnt to scotland yard interest was now centred on the chocolates they were taken to scotland yard that evening and sent off at once to be analysed well the doctor hadnt been far wrong said moresby the poison in those chocolates wasnt oil of bitter almonds as a matter of fact it was nitro benzene but i understand that isnt so very different if any of you ladies or gentlemen have a knowledge of chemicals youll know more about the stuff than i do but i believe its used occasionally in the cheaper sorts of confectionery to give an almond flavour as a substitute for oil of bitter almonds which i neednt tell you is a powerful poison too but the most usual way of employing nitrobenzene commercially is in the manufacture of aniline dyes when the analysts preliminary report came through scotland yards initial theory of accidental death was strengthened here definitely was a poison used in the manufacture of chocolates and other sweets a terrible mistake must have been made the firm had been employing the stuff as a cheap substitute for genuine liqueurs and too much of it had been used the fact that the only liqueurs named on the silver wrappings were maraschino kummel and kirsch all of which carry a greater or lesser flavour of almonds supported this conception but before the firm was approached by the police for an explanation other facts had come to light it was found that only the top layer of chocolates contained any poison those in the lower layer were completely free from anything harmful moreover in the lower layer the fillings inside the chocolate cases corresponded with the description on the wrappings whereas in the top layer besides the poison each sweet contained a blend of the three liqueurs mentioned and not for instance plain maraschino and poison it was further remarked that no maraschino kirsch or kummel was to be found in the two lower layers the interesting fact also emerged in the analysts detailed report that each chocolate in the top layer contained in addition to its blend of the three liqueurs exactly six minims of nitrobenzene no more and no less the cases were a fair size and there was plenty of room for quite a considerable quantity of the liqueur blend besides this fixed quantity of poison this was significant still more so was the further fact that in the bottom of each of the noxious chocolates there were distinct traces of a hole having been drilled in the case and subsequently plugged up with a piece of melted chocolate it was now plain to the police that foul play was in question a deliberate attempt had been made to murder sir eustace pennefather the would be murderer had acquired a box of masons chocolate liqueurs separated those in which a flavour of almonds would not come amiss drilled a small hole in each and drained it of its contents injected probably with a fountain pen filler the dose of poison filled the cavity up from the mixture of former fillings carefully stopped the hole and re wrapped it in its silver paper covering a meticulous business meticulously carried out the covering letter and wrapper which had arrived with the box of chocolates now became of paramount importance and the inspector who had had the foresight to rescue these from destruction had occasion to pat himself on the back together with the box itself and the remaining chocolates they formed the only material dues to this cold blooded murder taking them with him the chief inspector now in charge of the case called on the managing director of mason and sons and without informing him of the circumstances as to how it had come into his possession laid the letter before him and invited him to explain certain points in connection with it how many of these had been sent out who knew of this one and who could have had a chance of handling the box that was sent to sir eustace if the police had hoped to surprise mr mason the result was nothing compared with the way in which mr mason surprised the police well sir prompted the chief inspector when it seemed as if mr mason would go on examining the letter all day mr mason adjusted his glasses to the angle for examining chief inspectors instead of letters he was a small rather fierce elderly man who had begun life in a back street in huddersfield and did not intend any one to forget it where the devil did you get this he asked the papers it must be remembered had not yet got hold of the sensational aspect of mrs bendixs death i came replied the chief inspector with dignity to ask you about your sending it out sir not tell you about my getting hold of it then you can go to the devil replied mr mason with decision and take scotland yard with you he added by way of a comprehensive afterthought i must warn you sir said the chief inspector somewhat taken aback but concealing the fact beneath his weightiest manner i must warn you that it may be a serious matter for you to refuse to answer my questions mr mason it appeared was exasperated rather than intimidated by this covert threat get out o ma office he replied in his native tongue are ye druffen man or do ye just think youre funny ye know as well as i do that that letter was never sent out from ere it was then that the chief inspector became surprised not not sent out by your firm at all he hammered it was a possibility that had not occurred to him its forged then isnt that what im telling ye growled the old man regarding him fiercely from under bushy brows but the chief inspectors evident astonishment had mollified him somewhat sir said that official i must ask you to be good enough to answer my questions as fully as possible its a case of murder im investigating and he paused and thought cunningly and the murderer seems to have been making free use of your business to cloak his operations the cunning of the chief inspector prevailed the devil e as roared the old man damn the blackguard ask any question thou wants lad ill answer right enough communication thus being established the chief inspector proceeded to get to grips during the next five minutes his heart sank lower and lower in place of the simple case he had anticipated it became rapidly plain to him that the affair was going to be very difficult indeed hitherto he had thought that the case was going to prove one of sudden temptation somebody in the mason firm had a grudge against sir eustace into his hands had fallen the box and letter addressed to him the opportunity had been obvious the means in the shape of nitrobenzene in use in the factory ready to hand the result had followed such a culprit would be easy enough to trace but now it seemed this pleasant theory must be abandoned for in the first place no such letter as this had ever been sent out at all the firm had produced no new brand of chocolates if they had done so it was not their custom to dispense sample boxes among private individuals the letter was a forgery but the notepaper on the other hand was perfectly genuine so far as the old man could tell he could not say for certain but was almost sure that this was a piece of old stock which had been finished up about six months ago the heading might be forged but he did not think so six months ago queried the inspector unhappily about that said the other and plucked a piece of paper out of a stand in front of him this is what we use now the inspector examined it there was no doubt of the difference the new paper was thinner and more glossy but the heading looked exactly the same the inspector took a note of the firm who had printed both unfortunately no sample of the old paper was available mr mason had a search made on the spot but not a sheet was left as a matter of fact moresby now said it had been noticed that the piece of paper on which the letter was written was an old one it is distinctly yellow round the edges ill pass it round and you can see for yourselves please be careful of it the bit of paper once handled by a murderer passed slowly from each would be detective to his neighbour well to cut a long story shorter moresby went on we had it examined by the firm of printers websters in frith street and theyre prepared to swear that its their work that means the paper was genuine worse luck you mean of course put in sir charles wildman impressively that had the heading been a copy the task of discovering the printers who executed it should have been comparatively simple thats correct sir charles except if it had been done by somebody who owned a small press of their own but that would have been traceable too all weve actually got is that the murderer is someone who had access to masons notepaper up to six months ago and thats pretty wide do you think it was stolen with the actual intention of putting it to the purpose for which it was used asked alicia dammers it seems like it madam and something kept holding the murderer up as regards the wrapper mr mason had been unable to help at all this consisted simply of a piece of ordinary thin brown paper such as could be bought anywhere with sir eustaces name and address hand printed on it in neat capitals apparently there was nothing to be learnt from it at all the postmark showed that it had been despatched by the nine thirty pm post from the post office in southampton street strand there is a collection at and another at moresby explained so it must have been posted between those two times the packet was quite small enough to go into the opening for letters the stamps make up the right value the post office was shut by then so it could not have been handed in over the counter perhaps youd care to see it the piece of brown paper was handed gravely round have you brought the box too and the other chocolates asked mrs fielder flemming no madam it was one of masons ordinary boxes and the chocolates have all been used for analysis oh mrs fielder flemming was plainly disappointed i thought there might be finger prints on it she explained we have already looked for those replied moresby without a flicker there was a pause while the wrapper passed from hand to hand naturally weve made inquiries as to any one seen posting a packet in southampton street between half past eight and half past nine moresby continued but without result weve also carefully interrogated sir eustace pennefather to discover whether he could throw any light on the question why any one should wish to take his life or who sir eustace cant give us the faintest idea of course we followed up the usual line of inquiry as to who would benefit by his death but without any helpful results most of his possessions go to his wife who has a divorce suit pending against him and shes out of the country weve checked her movements and shes out of the question besides added moresby unprofessionally shes a very nice lady and as to fact all we know is that the murderer probably had some connection with mason and sons up to six months ago and was almost certainly in southampton street at some time between eight thirty and nine thirty on that particular evening im very much afraid were up against a brick wall moresby did not add that so were the amateur criminologists in front of him too but he very distinctly implied it there was a silence is that all asked roger thats all mr sheringham moresby agreed there was another silence surely the police have a theory mr morton harrogate bradley threw out in a detached manner moresby hesitated perceptibly come along moresby roger encouraged him its quite a simple theory i know it well said moresby thus stimulated were inclined to believe that the crime was the work of a lunatic or semi lunatic possibly quite unknown personally to sir eustace you see moresby looked a trifle embarrassed you see he went on bravely sir eustaces life was a bit well we might say hectic if youll excuse the word we think at the yard that some religious or social maniac took it on himself to rid the world of him so to speak some of his escapades had caused a bit of talk as you may know or it might just be a plain homicidal lunatic who likes killing people at a distance theres the horwood case you see some lunatic sent poisoned chocolates to the commissioner of police himself that caused a lot of attention we think this case may be an echo of it a case that creates a good deal of notice is quite often followed by another on exactly the same lines as i neednt remind you well thats our theory and if its the right one weve got about as much chance of laying our hands on the murderer as as chief inspector moresby cast about for something really scathing as we have suggested roger chapter iv the circle sat on for some time after moresby had gone there was a lot to discuss and everybody had views to put forward suggestions to make and theories to advance one thing emerged with singular unanimity the police had been working on the wrong lines their theory must be mistaken this was not a casual murder by a chance lunatic somebody very definite had gone methodically about the business of helping sir eustace out of the world and that somebody had behind him an equally definite motive like almost all murders in fact it was a matter of cherchez le motif on the exposition and discussion of theories roger kept a firmly quelling hand the whole object of the experiment as he pointed out more than once was that everybody should work independently without bias from any other brain form his or her own theory and set about proving it in his or her own way but oughtnt we to pool our facts sheringham boomed sir charles i should suggest that though we pursue our investigations independently any new facts we discover should be placed at once at the disposal of all the exercise should be a mental one not a competition in routine detection theres a lot to be said for that view sir charles roger agreed in fact ive thought it over very carefully but on the whole i think it will be better if we keep any new facts to ourselves after this evening you see were already in possession of all the facts that the police have discovered and anything else we may come across isnt likely to be so much a definite pointer to the murderer as some little thing quite insignificant in itself to support a particular theory sir charles grunted obviously unconvinced im quite willing to have it put to the vote roger said handsomely a vote was taken sir charles and mrs fielder flemming voted for all facts being disclosed mr bradley alicia dammers mr chitterwick and roger voted against we retain our own facts roger said and made a mental note of who had voted for each he was inclined to guess that the voting indicated pretty correctly who was going to be content with general theorising and who was ready to enter so far into the spirit of the game as to go out and work for it or it might simply show who already had a theory and who had not sir charles accepted the result with resignation we start equal as from now then he announced as from the moment we leave this room amended morton harrogate bradley rearranging the set of his tie but i agree so far with sir charless proposition as to think that any one who can at this moment add anything to the chief inspectors statement should do so but can any one asked mrs fielder flemming sir charles knows mr and mrs bendix alicia dammers pointed out impartially and sir eustace and i know sir eustace too of course roger smiled this statement was a characteristic meiosis on the part of miss dammers everybody knew that miss dammers had been the only woman who had ever turned the tables on sir eustace pennefather sir eustace had taken it into his head to add the scalp of an intellectual woman to those other rather unintellectual ones which already dangled at his belt alicia dammers with her good looks her tall slim figure and her irreproachable sartorial taste had satisfied his very fastidious requirements so far as feminine appearance was concerned he had laid himself out to fascinate the results had been watched by the large circle of miss dammerss friends with considerable joy miss dammers had apparently been only too ready to be fascinated it seemed that she was living entirely on the point of succumbing to sir eustaces blandishments they had dined visited lunched and made excursions together without respite sir eustace stimulated by the daily prospect of surrender on the following one had exercised his ardour with every art he knew miss dammers had then retired serenely and the next autumn published a book in which sir eustace pennefather dissected to the last ligament was given to the world in all the naked unpleasingness of his psychological anatomy miss dammers never talked about her art because she was a really brilliant writer and not just pretending to be one but she certainly held that everything had to be sacrificed to whatever god she worshipped privately in place of it mr and mrs bendix are quite incidental to the crime of course from the murderers point of view mr bradley now pointed out to her in the gentle tones of one instructing a child that the letter a is followed in the alphabet by the letter b so far as we know their only connection with sir eustace is that he and bendix both belonged to the rainbow i neednt give you my opinion of sir eustace remarked miss dammers those of you who have read flesh and the devil know how i saw him and i have no reason to suppose that he has changed since i was studying him but i claim no infallibility it would be interesting to hear whether sir charless opinion coincides with mine or not sir charles who had not read flesh and the devil looked a little embarrassed well i dont see that i can add much to the impression the chief inspector gave of him i dont know the man well and certainly have no wish to do so everybody looked extremely innocent it was common gossip that there had been the possibility of an engagement between sir eustace and sir charless only daughter and that sir charles had not viewed the prospect with any perceptible joy it was further known that the engagement had even been prematurely announced and promptly denied the next day sir charles tried to look as innocent as everybody else as the chief inspector hinted he is something of a bad lot some people might go so far as to call him a blackguard women explained sir charles bluntly and he drinks too much he added it was plain that sir charles wildman did not approve of sir eustace pennefather i can add one small point of purely psychological value amplified alicia dammers but it shows the dullness of his reactions even in the short time since the tragedy rumour has joined the name of sir eustace to that of a fresh woman i was somewhat surprised to hear that added miss dammers drily i should have been inclined to give him credit for being a little more upset by the terrible mistake and its fortunate consequences to himself even though mrs bendix was a total stranger to him yes by the way i should have corrected that impression earlier observed sir charles mrs bendix was not a total stranger to sir eustace though he may probably have forgotten ever meeting her but he did i was talking to mrs bendix one evening at a first night and sir eustace came up to me i introduced them mentioning something about bendix being a member of the rainbow id almost forgotten then im afraid i was completely wrong about him said miss dammers chagrined i was far too kind to be too kind in the dissecting room was evidently in miss dammerss opinion a far greater crime than being too unkind as for bendix said sir charles rather vaguely i dont know that i can add anything to your knowledge of him quite a decent steady fellow head not turned by his money in the least rich as he is his wife too charming woman a little serious perhaps sort of woman who likes sitting on committees not that thats anything against her though rather the reverse i should have said observed miss dammers who liked sitting on committees herself quite quite said sir charles hastily remembering miss dammerss curious predilections and she wasnt too serious to make a bet evidently although it was a trifling one she had another bet that she knew nothing about chanted in solemn tones mrs fielder flemming who was already pondering the dramatic possibilities of the situation not a trifling one a grim one it was with death and she lost it mrs fielder flemming was regrettably inclined to carry her dramatic sense into her ordinary life it did not go at all well with her culinary aspect she eyed alicia dammers covertly wondering whether she could get in with a play before that lady cut the ground away from under her with a book roger as chairman took steps to bring the discussion back to relevancies yes poor woman but after all we mustnt let ourselves confuse the issue its rather difficult to remember that the murdered person has no connection with the crime at all so to speak but there it is just by accident the wrong person died its on sir eustace that we have to concentrate now does anybody else here know sir eustace or anything about him or any other fact bearing on the crime nobody responded then were all on the same footing and now about our next meeting i suggest that we have a clear week for formulating our theories and carrying out any investigations we think necessary that we then meet on consecutive evenings beginning with next monday and that we now draw lots as to the order in which we are to read our several papers or give our conclusions or does any one think we should have more than one speaker each evening after a little talk it was decided to meet again on monday that day week and for purposes of fuller discussion allot one evening to each member lots were then drawn with the result that members were to speak in the following order sir charles wildman mrs fielder flemming mr morton harrogate bradley roger sheringham alicia dammers and mr ambrose chitterwick mr chitterwick brightened considerably when his name was announced as last on the list by that time he confided to morton harrogate somebody is quite sure to have discovered the right solution and i shall therefore not have to give my own conclusions if indeed he added dubiously i ever reach any tell me how does a detective really set to work mr bradley smiled kindly and promised to lend mr chitterwick one of his own books mr chitterwick who had read them all and possessed most of them thanked him very gratefully before the meeting finally broke up mrs fielder flemming could not resist one more opportunity of being mildly dramatic how strange life is she sighed across the table to sir charles i actually saw mrs bendix and her husband in their box at the imperial the night before she died i was in a stall almost directly under their box indeed life is certainly stranger than fiction if i could have guessed for one minute at the dreadful fate hanging over her i youd have had the sense to warn her to steer clear of chocolates i hope observed sir charles who did not hold very much with mrs fielder flemming the meeting then broke up roger returned to his rooms in the albany feeling exceedingly pleased with himself he had a suspicion that the various attempts at a solution were going to be almost as interesting to him as the problem itself nevertheless he was on his mettle he had not been very lucky in the draw and would have preferred the place of mr chitterwick which would have meant that he would have the advantage of already knowing the results achieved by his rivals before having to disclose his own not that he intended to rely on others brains in the least like mr morton harrogate bradley he already had a theory of his own but it would have been pleasant to be able to weigh up and criticise the efforts of sir charles mr bradley and particularly alicia dammers before irrevocably committing himself and more than any other crime in which he had been interested it seemed to him he wanted to find the right solution of this one to his surprise when he got back to his rooms he found moresby waiting in his sitting room ah mr sheringham said that cautious official thought you wouldnt mind me waiting here for a word with you not in a great hurry to go to bed are you not in the least said roger doing things with a decanter and syphon its early yet say when moresby looked discreetly the other way when they were settled in two huge leather armchairs before the fire moresby explained himself as a matter of fact mr sheringham the chiefs deputed me to keep a sort of unofficial eye on you and your friends over this business not that we dont trust you or think you wont be discreet or anything like that but its better for us to know just whats going on with a massed detective attack like this so that if any of us finds out something really important you can nip in first and make use of it roger smiled yes i quite see the official point so that we can take measures to prevent the bird from being scared moresby corrected reproachfully thats all mr sheringham is it said roger with unconcealed scepticism but you dont think it very likely that your protecting hand will be required eh moresby frankly sir i dont were not in the habit of giving up a case so long as we think theres the least chance of finding the criminal and detective inspector farrar whos been in charge of this one is a capable man and thats his theory that its the work of some criminal lunatic quite untraceable thats the opinion hes been led to form mr sheringham sir but theres no harm in your circle amusing themselves added moresby magnanimously if they want to and theyve got the time to waste well well said roger refusing to be drawn they smoked their pipes in silence for a few minutes come along moresby roger said gently the chief inspector looked at him with an expression that indicated nothing but bland surprise sir roger shook his head it wont wash moresby it wont wash come along now out with it out with what mr sheringham queried moresby the picture of innocent bewilderment your real reason for coming round here roger said nastily wanted to pump me for the benefit of that effete institution you represent i suppose well i warn you theres nothing doing this time i know you better than i did eighteen months ago at ludmouth remember well what can have put such an idea as that into your head mr sheringham sir positively gasped that much misunderstood man chief inspector moresby of scotland yard i came round because i thought you might like to ask me a few questions to give you a leg up in finding the murderer before any of your friends could thats all roger laughed moresby i like you youre a bright spot in a dull world i expect you try to persuade the very criminals you arrest that it hurts you more than it does them and i shouldnt be at all surprised if you dont somehow make them believe it very well if thats all you came round for ill ask you some questions and thank you very much tell me this then who do you think was trying to murder sir eustace pennefather moresby sipped delicately at his whisky and soda you know what i think mr sheringham sir indeed i dont roger retorted i only know what youve told me you think i havent been in charge of the case at all mr sheringham moresby hedged who do you really think was trying to murder sir eustace pennefather roger repeated patiently is it your own opinion that the official police theory is right or wrong driven into a corner moresby allowed himself the novelty of speaking his unofficial mind he smiled covertly as if at a secret thought well mr sheringham sir he said with deliberation our theory is a useful one isnt it i mean it gives us every excuse for not finding the murderer we can hardly be expected to be in touch with every half baked creature in the country who may have homicidal impulses our theory will be put forward at the conclusion of the adjourned inquest in about a fortnights time with reason and evidence to support it and any evidence to the contrary not mentioned and youll see that the coroner will agree with it and the jury will agree with it and the papers will agree with it and every one will say that really the police cant be blamed for not catching the murderer this time and everybody will be happy except mr bendix who doesnt get his wifes murder avenged added roger moresby youre being positively sarcastic and from all this i deduce that you personally will stand aside from this general and amicable agreement do you think the case has been badly handled by your people rogers last question followed so closely on the heels of his previous remarks that moresby had answered it almost before he had time to reflect on the possible indiscretion of doing so no mr sheringham i dont think that farrars a capable man and hed leave no stone unturned no stone i mean that he could turn moresby paused significantly ah said roger having committed himself to this lamb moresby seemed disposed to look about for a sheep he re settled himself in his chair and recklessly drank a gill from his tumbler roger scarcely daring to breathe too audibly for fear of scaring the sheep studiously examined the fire you see this is a very difficult case mr sheringham moresby pronounced farrar had an open mind of course when he took it up and he kept an open mind even after hed found out that sir eustace was even a bit more of a daisy than hed imagined at first that is to say he never lost sight of the fact that it might have been some outside lunatic who sent those chocolates to sir eustace just out of a general socialistic or religious feeling that hed be doing a favour to society or heaven by putting him out of the world a fanatic you might say murder from conviction roger murmured yes but naturally what farrar was concentrating on was sir eustaces private life and thats where we police officers are handicapped its not easy for us to make enquiries into the private life of a baronet nobody wants to be helpful everybody seems anxious to put a spoke in our wheel every line that looked hopeful to farrar led to a dead end sir eustace himself told him to go to the devil and made no bones about it naturally from his point of view roger said thoughtfully the last thing hed want would be a sheaf of his peccadilloes laid out for a harvest festival in court yes and mrs bendix lying in her grave on account of them retorted moresby with asperity no he was responsible for her death though indirectly enough ill admit and it was up to him to be as helpful as he could to the police officer investigating the case but there farrar was couldnt get any further he unearthed a scandal or two its true but they led to nothing so well he hasnt admitted this mr sheringham and youll realise i ought not to be telling you its to go no further than this room mind good heavens no roger said eagerly well then its my private opinion that farrar was driven to the other conclusion in self defence and the chief had to agree with it in self defence too but if you want to get to the bottom of the business mr sheringham my advice to you is to concentrate on sir eustaces private life youve a better chance than any of us there youre on his level youll know members of his club youll know his friends personally and the friends of his friends and that concluded moresby is the tip i really came round to give you thats very decent of you moresby roger said with warmth very decent indeed have another spot well thank you mr sheringham sir said chief inspector moresby i dont mind if i do roger was meditating as he mixed the drinks i believe youre right moresby he said slowly in fact ive been thinking along those lines ever since i read the first full account the truth lies in sir eustaces private life i feel sure and if i were superstitious which im not do you know what i should believe that the murderers aim misfired and sir eustace escaped death for an express purpose of providence so that he the destined victim should be the ironical instrument of bringing his own intended murderer to justice well mr sheringham would you really said the sarcastic chief inspector who was not superstitious either roger seemed rather taken with the idea chance the avenger make a good film title wouldnt it but theres a terrible lot of truth in it how often dont you people at the yard stumble on some vital piece of evidence out of pure chance how often isnt it that youre led to the right solution by what seems a series of mere coincidences im not belittling your detective work but just think how often a piece of brilliant detective work which has led you most of the way but not the last vital few inches meets with some remarkable stroke of sheer luck thoroughly well deserved luck no doubt but luck which just makes the case complete for you i can think of scores of instances the milsom and fowler murder for example dont you see what i mean is it chance every time or is it providence avenging the victim well mr sheringham said chief inspector moresby to tell you the truth i dont mind what it is so long as it lets me put my hands on the right man moresby laughed roger youre hopeless chapter v sir charles wildman as he has said cared more for honest facts than for psychological fiddle faddle facts were very dear to sir charles more they were meat and drink to him his income of roughly thirty thousand pounds a year was derived entirely from the masterful way in which he was able to handle facts there was no one at the bar who could so convincingly distort an honest but awkward fact into carrying an entirely different interpretation from that which any ordinary person would have put upon it he could take that fact look it boldly in the face twist it round read a message from the back of its neck turn it inside out and detect auguries in its entrails dance triumphantly on its corpse pulverise it completely re mould it if necessary into an utterly different shape and finally if the fact still had the temerity to retain any vestige of its primary aspect bellow at it in the most terrifying manner if that failed he was quite prepared to weep at it in open court no wonder that sir charles wildman kc was paid that amount of money every year to transform facts of menacing appearance to his clients into so many sucking doves each cooing those very clients tender innocence if the reader is interested in statistics it might be added that the number of murderers whom sir charles in the course of his career had saved from the gallows if placed one on top of the other would have reached to a very great height indeed sir charles wildman had rarely appeared for the prosecution it is not considered etiquette for prosecution counsel to bellow and there is scant need for their tears his bellowing and his public tears were sir charles wildmans long suit he was one of the old school one of its very last representatives and he found that the old school paid him handsomely when therefore he looked impressively round the crimes circle on its next meeting one week after roger had put forward his proposal and adjusted the gold rimmed pince nez on his somewhat massive nose the other members could feel no doubt as to the quality of the entertainment in store for them after all they were going to enjoy for nothing what amounted to a thousand guinea brief for the prosecution sir charles glanced at the note pad in his hand and cleared his throat no barrister could clear his throat quite so ominously as sir charles ladies and gentlemen he began in weighty tones it is not unnatural that i should have been more interested in this murder than perhaps any one else for personal reasons which will no doubt have occurred to you already sir eustace pennefathers name as you must know has been mentioned in connection with that of my daughter and though the report of their engagement was not merely premature but utterly without foundation it is inevitable that i should feel some personal connection however slight with this attempt to assassinate a man who has been mentioned as a possible son in law to myself i do not wish to stress this personal aspect of the case which otherwise i have tried to view as impersonally as any other with which i have been connected but i put it forward more as an excuse than anything for it has enabled me to approach the problem set us by our president with a more intimate knowledge of the person concerned than the rest of you could have and with too i fear information at my disposal which goes a long way towards indicating the truth of this mystery i know that i should have placed this information at the disposal of my fellow members last week and i apologise to them wholeheartedly for not having done so but the truth is that i did not realise then that this knowledge of mine was in any way germane to the solution or even remotely helpful and it is only since i began to ponder over the case with a view to clearing up the tragic tangle that the vital import of this information has impressed itself upon me sir charles paused and allowed his resounding periods to echo round the room now with its help he pronounced looking severely from face to face i am of opinion that i have read this riddle a twitter of excitement no less genuine because obviously awaited ran round the faithful circle sir charles whisked off his pince nez and swung them in a characteristic gesture on their broad ribbon yes i think in fact i am sure that i am about to elucidate this dark business to you and for this reason i regret that the lot has fallen upon me to speak first it would have been more interesting perhaps had we been permitted to examine some other theories first and demonstrate their falsity before we probed to the truth that is assuming that there are other theories to examine it would not surprise me however to learn that you had all leapt to the conclusion to which i have been driven not in the least i claim no extraordinary powers in allowing the facts to speak to me for themselves i pride myself on no super human insight in having been able to see further into this dark business than our official solvers of mysteries and readers of strange riddles the trained detective force very much the reverse i am only an ordinary human being endowed with no more powers than any of my fellow creatures it would not astonish me for an instant to be apprised that i am only following in the footsteps of others of you in fixing the guilt on the individual who did as i submit i am about to prove to you beyond any possibility of doubt commit this foul crime having thus provided for the improbable contingency of some other member of the circle having been so clever as himself sir charles cut some of the cackle and got down to business i set about this matter with one question in my mind and one only the question to which the right answer has proved a sure guide to the criminal in almost every murder that has ever been committed the question which hardly any criminal can avoid leaving behind him damning though he knows the answer must be the question cui bono sir charles allowed a pregnant moment of silence who he translated obligingly was the gainer who he paraphrased for the benefit of any possible half wits in his audience would to put it bluntly score by the death of sir eustace pennefather he darted looks of enquiry from under his tufted eyebrows but his hearers dutifully played the game nobody undertook to enlighten him prematurely sir charles was far too practised a rhetorician to enlighten them prematurely himself leaving the question as an immense query mark in their minds he veered off on another track now there were as i saw it only three definite clues in this crime he continued in almost conversational tones i refer of course to the forged letter the wrapper and the chocolates themselves of these the wrapper could only be helpful so far as its postmark the hand printed address i dismissed as useless it could have been done by any one at any time it led i felt nowhere and i could not see that the chocolates or the box that contained them were of the least use as evidence i may be wrong but i could not see it they were specimens of a well known brand on sale at hundreds of shops it would be fruitless to attempt to trace their purchaser moreover any possibilities in that direction would quite certainly have been explored already by the police i was left in short with only two pieces of material evidence the forged letter and the post mark on the wrapper on which the whole structure of proof must be erected sir charles paused again to let the magnitude of this task sink into the minds of the others apparently he had overlooked the fact that his problem must have been common to all roger who with difficulty had remained silent so long interposed a gentle question had you already made up your mind as to the criminal sir charles i had already answered to my own satisfaction the question i had posed to myself to which i made reference a few minutes ago replied sir charles with dignity but without explicitness i see you had made up your mind roger pinned him down it would be interesting to know so that we can follow better your way of approaching the proof you used inductive methods then possibly possibly said sir charles testily sir charles strongly disliked being pinned down he glowered for a moment in silence to recover from this indignity the task i saw at once he resumed in a sterner voice was not going to be an easy one the period at my disposal was extremely limited far reaching enquiries were obviously necessary my own time was far too closely engaged to permit me to make in person any investigations i might find advisable i thought the matter over and decided that the only possible way in which i could arrive at a conclusion was to consider the facts of the case for a sufficient length of time till i was enabled to formulate a theory which would stand every test i could apply to it out of such knowledge as was already at my disposal and then make a careful list of further points which were outside my own knowledge but which must be facts if my theory were correct these points could then be investigated by persons acting on my behalf and if they were substantiated my theory would be conclusively proved sir charles drew a breath in other words roger murmured with a smile to alicia dammers turning a hundred words into six i decided to employ inductive methods but he spoke so softly that nobody but miss dammers heard him she smiled back appreciatively the art of the written word is not that of the spoken one i formed my theory announced sir charles with surprising simplicity perhaps he was still a little short of breath i formed my theory of necessity much of it was guesswork let me give an example the possession by the criminal of a sheet of mason sons notepaper had puzzled me more than anything it was not an article which the individual i had in mind might be expected to possess still less to be able to acquire i could not conceive any method by which the plot already decided upon and the sheet of paper required for its accomplishment such a thing could be deliberately acquired by the individual in question without suspicion being raised afterwards i therefore formed the conclusion that it was the actual ability to obtain a piece of masons note paper in a totally unsuspicious way which was the reason of the notepaper of that particular firm being employed at all sir charles looked triumphantly round as if awaiting something roger supplied it no less readily for all that the point must have occurred to every one as being almost too obvious to need any comment thats a very interesting point indeed sir charles most ingenious sir charles nodded his agreement sheer guess work i admit nothing but guesswork but guesswork that was justified in the result sir charles was becoming so lost in admiration of his own perspicacity that he had forgotten all his love of long winding sentences and smooth rolling subordinate clauses his massive head positively jerked on his shoulders i considered how such a thing might come into ones possession and whether the possession could be verified afterwards it occurred to me at last that many firms insert a piece of notepaper with a receipted bill with the words with compliments or some such phrase typed on it that gave me three questions was this practice employed at masons had the individual in question an account at masons or more particularly to explain the yellowed edge of the paper had there been such an account in the past were there any indications on the paper of such a phrase having been carefully erased ladies and gentlemen boomed sir charles puce with excitement you will see that the odds against those three questions being answered in the affirmative were enormous overwhelming before i posed them i knew that should it prove to be the case no mere chance could be held responsible sir charles dropped his voice i knew he said slowly that if those three questions of mine were answered in the affirmative the individual i had in mind must be as guilty as if i had actually watched the poison being injected into those chocolates he paused and looked impressively round him riveting all eyes on his face ladies and gentlemen those three questions were answered in the affirmative oratory is a powerful art roger knew perfectly well that sir charles out of sheer force of habit was employing on them all the usual and hackneyed forensic tricks it was with difficulty roger felt that he refrained from adding of the jury to his ladies and gentlemen but really this was only what might have been expected sir charles had a good story to tell and a story in which he obviously sincerely believed and he was simply telling it in the way which after all these years of practice came most naturally to him that was not what was annoying roger what did annoy him was that he himself had been plodding on the scent of quite a different hare and convinced as he had been that his must be the right one had at first been only mildly amused as sir charles flirted round the skirts of his own quarry now he had allowed himself to be influenced by mere rhetoric cheap though he knew it to be into wondering but was it only rhetoric that had made him begin to doubt sir charles seemed to have some substantial facts to weave into the airy web of his oratory and pompous old fellow though he might be he was certainly no fool roger began to feel distinctly uneasy for his own hare he had to admit was a very elusive one as sir charles proceeded to develop his thesis rogers uneasiness began to turn into downright unhappiness there can be no doubt about it i ascertained through an agent that masons an old fashioned firm invariably paid such private customers as had an account with them the courtesy of including a statement of thanks just two or three words typed in the middle of a sheet of notepaper i ascertained that this individual had had an account with the firm which was apparently closed five months ago that is to say a cheque was sent then in settlement and no goods have been ordered since moreover i found time to pay a special visit myself to scotland yard in order to examine that letter again by looking at the back i could make out quite distinct though indecipherable traces of former typewritten words in the middle of the page these latter cut halfway down one of the lines of the letter and so prove that they could not have been an erasure from that they correspond in length to the statement i expected and they show signs of the most careful attempts by rubbing rolling and re roughening the smoothed paper to eradicate not only the typewriter ink but even the actual indentations caused by the metal letter arms this i held to be conclusive proof that my theory was correct and at once i set about clearing up such other doubtful points as had occurred to me time was short and i had recourse to no less than four firms of trustworthy inquiry agents among whom i divided the task of providing the data i was seeking this not only saved me considerable time but had the advantage of not putting the sum total of the information obtained into any hands but my own indeed i did my best so to split up my queries as to prevent any of the firms from even guessing what object i had in mind and in this i am of the opinion that i have been successful my next care was the post mark it was necessary for my case that i should prove that my suspect had actually been in the neighbourhood of the strand at the time in question you will say suggested sir charles searching the interested faces round him and apparently picking upon mr morton harrogate bradley as the raiser of this futile objection you will say said sir charles sternly to mr bradley that this was not necessary the parcel might have been posted quite innocently by an unwitting accomplice to whom it had been entrusted so that the actual criminal had an unshakable alibi for that period the more so as the individual to whom i refer was actually not in this country so that it would be all the easier to request a friend who might be travelling to england to undertake the task of posting the parcel in this country and so saving the cost of the foreign postage which on parcels is not inconsiderable i do not agree said sir charles to mr bradley still more severely i have considered that point and i do not think the individual i have in mind would undertake such a very grave risk for the friend would almost certainly remember the incident when she read of the affair in the papers as would be almost inevitable no concluded sir charles finally crushing mr bradley once and for all i am convinced that the individual i am thinking of would realise that nobody else must handle that parcel till it had passed into the keeping of the post office of course said mr bradley academically lady pennefather may have had not an innocent accomplice but a guilty one youve considered that of course mr bradley managed to convey that the matter was of no real interest but as sir charles had been addressing these remarks directly to him it was only courteous to comment on them sir charles purpled visibly he had been priding himself on the skilful way in which he had been withholding his suspects name to bring it out with a lovely plump right at the end after proving his case just like a real detective story and now this wretched scribbler of the things had spoilt it all sir he intoned in proper johnsonian manner i must call your attention to the fact that i have mentioned no names at all to do such a thing is most imprudent do i need to remind you that there is such a thing as a law of libel morton harrogate smiled his maddeningly superior smile really sir charles he mocked stroking his little sleek object he wore on his upper lip im not going to write a story about lady pennefather trying to murder her husband if thats what youre warning me against or could it possibly be that you were referring to the law of slander sir charles who had meant slander enveloped mr bradley in a crimson glare roger sped to the rescue the combatants reminded him of a bull and a gadfly and that is a contest which it is often good fun to watch but the crimes circle had been founded to investigate the crimes of others not to provide opportunities for new ones roger did not particularly like either the bull or the gadfly but both amused him in their different ways he certainly disliked neither mr bradley on the other hand disliked both roger and sir charles he disliked roger the more of the two because roger was a gentleman and pretended not to be whereas he himself was not a gentleman and pretended he was and that surely is cause enough to dislike any one im glad you raised that point sir charles roger now said smoothly its one we must consider personally i dont see how were to progress at all unless we come to some arrangement concerning the law of slander do you sir charles consented to be mollified it is a difficult point he agreed the lawyer in him immediately swamping the outraged human being a born lawyer will turn aside from any other minor pursuit even briefs for a really knotty legal point just as a born woman will put on her best set of underclothes and powder her nose before inserting the latter in the gas oven i think roger said carefully anxious not to wound legal susceptibilities that we should disregard that particular law i mean he added hastily observing the look of pain on sir charless brow at being asked to condone this violation of a lex intangenda mean we should come to some such arrangement as that anything said in this room should be without prejudice or among friends or or not in the spirit of the adverb he plunged desperately or whatever the legal wriggle is on the whole it was not a tactful speech but it is doubtful whether sir charles heard it a dreamy look had come into his eyes as of a lord of appeal crooning over a piece of red tape slander as we all know he murmured consists in the malicious speaking of such words as render the party who speaks them in the hearing of others liable to an action at the suit of the party to whom they apply in this case the imputation being of a crime or misdemeanour which is punishable corporeally pecuniary damage would not have to be proved and the imputation being defamatory its falsity would be presumed and the burden of proving its truth would be laid upon the defendant we should therefore have the interesting situation of the defendant in a slander action becoming in essence the plaintiff in a civil suit for murder and really said sir charles in much perplexity i dont know what would happen then er what about privilege suggested roger feebly of course sir charles disregarded him there would have to be stated in the declaration the actual words used not merely their meaning and general inference and failure to prove them as stated would result in the plaintiff being nonsuited so that unless notes were taken here and signed by a witness who had heard the defamation i do not quite see how an action could lie privilege murmured roger despairingly moreover i should be of the opinion said sir charles brightening that this might be regarded as one of those proper occasions upon which statements in themselves defamatory and even false may be made if from a perfectly proper motive and with an entire belief in their truth in that case the presumption would be reversed and the burden would be on the plaintiff to prove and that to the satisfaction of a jury that the defendant was actuated by express malice in that case i rather fancy that the court would be guided almost wholly by considerations of public expediency which would probably mean that privilege said roger loudly sir charles turned on him the dull eye of a red ink fiend but this time the word had penetrated i was coming to that he reproved now in our case i hardly think that a plea of public privilege would be accepted as to private privilege the limits are of course exceedingly difficult to define it would be doubtful if we could plead successfully that all statements made here are matters of purely private communication because it is a question whether this circle does constitute in actual fact a private or a public gathering one could said sir charles with much interest argue either way or even for the matter of that that it is a private body meeting in public or vice versa a public gathering held in private the point is a very debatable one sir charles swung his glasses for a moment to emphasise the extreme debatability of the point but i do feel inclined to venture the opinion he plunged at last that on the whole we might be justified in taking up our stand upon the submission that the occasion is privileged in so far as it is concerned entirely with communications which are made with no animus injuiandi but solely in performance of a duty not necessarily legal but moral or social and any statements so uttered are covered by a plea of veritas convicii being made within proper limits by persons in the bonafide prosecution of their own and the public interest i am bound to say however sir charles immediately proceeded to hedge as if horrified at having committed himself at last that this is not a matter of complete certainty and a wiser policy might be to avoid the direct mention of any name while holding ourselves free to indicate in some unmistakable manner such as by signs or possibly by some form of impersonation or acting the individual to whom we severally refer still pursued the president faint but persistent on the whole you do think that the occasion may be regarded as privileged and we may go ahead and mention any name we like sir charless glasses described a complete and symbolical circle i think said sir charles very weightily indeed i think said sir charles that we might take that risk right ho said the president with relief chapter vi i dare say resumed sir charles that many of you will have already reached the same conclusion as myself with regard to the identity of the murderer the case seems to me to afford so striking a parallel with one of the classical murders that the similarity can hardly have passed unnoticed i refer of course to the marie lafarge case oh said roger surprised so far as he was concerned the similarity had passed unnoticed he wriggled uncomfortably now one came to consider it of course the parallel was obvious there too we have a wife accused of sending a poisoned article to her husband whether the article was a cake or a box of chocolates is beside the point it will not do perhaps to but nobody in their sane senses still believes that marie lafarge was guilty alicia dammers interrupted with unusual warmth its been practically proved that the cake was sent by the foreman or whatever he was wasnt his name dennis his motive was much bigger than hers too sir charles regarded her severely i think i said accused of sending i was referring to a matter of fact not of opinion sorry nodded miss dammers unabashed in any case i just mention the coincidence for what it is worth let us now go back to resume our argument at the point we left it in that connection the question was raised just now said sir charles determinedly impersonal as to whether lady pennefather may have had not an innocent accomplice but a guilty one that doubt had already occurred to me i have satisfied myself that it is not the case she planned and carried through this affair alone he paused inviting the obvious question roger tactfully supplied it how could she sir charles we know that she was in the south of france the whole time the police investigated that very point she has a complete alibi sir charles positively beamed at him she had a complete alibi i have destroyed it this is what actually happened three days before the parcel was posted lady pennefather left mentone and went ostensibly for a week to avignon at the end of the week she returned to mentone her signature is in the hotel register at avignon she has the receipted bill everything is quite in order the only curious thing is that apparently she did not take her maid a very superior young woman of smart appearance and good manners to avignon with her for the hotel receipt is for one person only and yet the maid did not stay at mentone did the maid then vanish into thin air demanded sir charles indignantly oh nodded mr chitterwick who had been listening intently i see how ingenious highly ingenious agreed sir charles complacently taking the credit for the erring ladys ingenuity the maid took the mistresss place the mistress paid a secret visit to england and i have verified that beyond any doubt an agent acting on telegraphic instructions from me showed the hotel proprietor at avignon a photograph of lady pennefather and asked whether such a person had ever stayed in the hotel the man averred that he had never seen her in his life my agent showed him a snapshot which he had obtained of the maid the proprietor recognised her instantly as lady pennefather another guess of mine had proved only too accurate sir charles leaned back in his chair and swung his glasses in silent tribute to his own astuteness then lady pennefather did have an accomplice murmured mr bradley with the air of one discussing the three bears with a child of four an innocent accomplice retorted sir charles my agent questioned the maid tactfully and learned that her mistress had told her that she had to go over to england on urgent business but having already spent six months of the current year in that country would have to pay british income tax if she so much as set foot in england again that year a considerable sum was in question and lady pennefather suggested this plan as a means of getting round the difficulty with a handsome bribe to the girl not unnaturally the offer was accepted most ingenious most ingenious he paused again and beamed round inviting tributes how very clever of you sir charles murmured alicia dammers stepping into the breach i have no actual proof of her stay in this country regretted sir charles so that from the legal point of view the case against her is incomplete in that respect but that will be a matter for the police to discover in all other respects i submit my case is complete i regret i regret exceedingly having to say so but i have no alternative lady pennefather is mrs bendixs murderess there was a thoughtful silence when sir charles had finished speaking questions were in the air but nobody seemed to care to be the first to put one roger gazed into vacancy as if looking longingly after the spoor of his own hare there was no doubt that as matters stood at present sir charles seemed to have proved his case mr ambrose chitterwick plucked up courage to break the silence we must congratulate you sir charles your solution is as brilliant as it is surprising only one question occurs to me and that is the one of motive why should lady pennefather desire her husbands death when she is actually in process of divorcing him had she any reason to suspect that a decree would not be granted none at all replied sir charles blandly it was just because she was so certain that a decree would be granted that she desired his death i i dont quite understand stammered mr chitterwick sir charles allowed the general bewilderment to continue for a few more moments before he condescended to dispel it he had the orators feeling for atmosphere i referred at the beginning of my remarks to a piece of knowledge which had come into my possession and which had helped me materially towards my solution i am now prepared to disclose in strict confidence what that piece of knowledge was you already know that there was talk of an engagement between sir eustace and my daughter i do not think i shall be violating the secrets of the confessional if i tell you that not many weeks ago sir eustace came to me and formally asked me to sanction an engagement between them as soon as his wifes decree nisi had been pronounced i need not tell you all that transpired at that interview what is relevant is that sir eustace informed me categorically that his wife had been extremely unwilling to divorce him and he had only succeeded in the end by making a will entirely in her favour including his estate in worcestershire she had a small private income of her own and he was going to make her such allowance in addition as he was able but with the interest on the mortgage on his estate swallowing up nearly all the rent he was getting for it and his other expenses this could not be a large one his life however was heavily insured in accordance with lady pennefathers marriage settlements and the mortgage on the estate was in the nature of an endowment policy and lapsed with his death he had therefore as he candidly admitted very little to offer my daughter like myself said sir charles impressively you cannot fail to grasp the significance of this according to the will then in existence lady pennefather from being not even comfortably off would become a comparatively rich woman on her husbands death but rumours are reaching her ears of a possible marriage between that husband and another woman as soon as the divorce is complete what is more probable than that when such an engagement is actually concluded a new will will be made her character is already shown in a strong enough light by her willingness to accept the bribe of the will as an inducement to divorce she is obviously a grasping woman greedy for money murder is only another step for such a woman to take and murder is her only hope i do not think concluded sir charles that i need to labour the point any further his glasses swung deliberately its uncommonly convincing roger said with a little sigh are you going to hand this information over to the police sir charles i conceive that failure to do so would be a gross dereliction of my duty as a citizen sir charles replied with a pomposity that in no way concealed how pleased he was with himself humph observed mr bradley who evidently was not going to be so pleased with sir charles as sir charles was what about the chocolates is it part of your case that she prepared them over here or brought them with her sir charles waved an airy hand is that material i should say that it would be very material to connect her at any rate with the poison nitrobenzene one might as well try to connect her with the purchase of the chocolates she would have no difficulty in getting hold of that i regard her choice of poison in fact as on a par with the ingenuity she has displayed in all the other particulars i see mr bradley stroked his little moustache and eyed sir charles combatively come to think of it you know sir charles you havent really proved a case against lady pennefather at all all youve proved is motive and opportunity an unexpected ally ranged herself beside mr bradley exactly cried mrs fielder flemming thats just what i was about to point out myself if you hand over the information youve collected to the police sir charles i dont think theyll thank you for it as mr bradley says you havent proved that lady pennefathers guilty or anything like it im quite sure youre altogether mistaken sir charles was so taken aback that for a moment he could only stare mistaken he managed to ejaculate it was clear that such a possibility had never entered sir charless orbit well perhaps id better say wrong amended mrs fielder flemming quite drily but my dear madam for once words did not come to sir charles but why he fell back upon feebly because im sure of it retorted mrs fielder flemming most unsatisfactorily roger had been watching this exchange with a gradual change of feeling from being hypnotised by sir charless persuasiveness and self confidence into something like reluctant agreement he was swinging round now in reaction to the other extreme dash it all this fellow bradley had kept a clearer head after all and he was perfectly right there were gaps in sir charless case that sir charles himself as counsel for lady pennefathers defence could have driven a coach and six through of course he said thoughtfully the fact that before she went abroad lady pennefather may have had an account at masons isnt surprising in the least nor is the fact that masons send out a complimentary chit with their receipts as sir charles himself said very many old fashioned firms of good repute do and the fact that the sheet of paper on which the letter was written had been used previously for some such purpose is not only not surprising when one comes to consider its even obvious whoever the murderer the same problem of getting hold of the piece of notepaper would arise yes really that sir charless three initial questions should have happened to find affirmative answers does seem little more than a coincidence sir charles turned on this new antagonist like a wounded bull but the odds were enormous against it he roared if it was a coincidence it was the most incredible one in the whole course of my experience ah sir charles but youre prejudiced mr bradley told him gently and you exaggerate dreadfully you know you seem to be putting the odds at somewhere round about a million to one i should put them at six to one permutations and combinations you know damn your permutations sir riposted sir charles with vigour and your combinations too mr bradley turned to roger mr chairman is it within the rules of this club for one member to insult another members underwear besides sir charles he added to that fuming knight i dont wear the things never have done since i was an infant for the dignity of the chair roger could not join in the delighted titters that were escaping round the table in the interests of the circles preservation he had to pour oil on these very seething waters bradley youre losing sight of the point arent you i dont want to destroy your theory necessarily sir charles or detract in any way from the really brilliant manner in which youve defended it but if its to stand its ground it must be able to resist any arguments we can bring against it thats all and i honestly do think that youre inclined to attach a little too much importance to the answers to those three questions what do you say miss dammers i agree miss dammers said crisply the way sir charles emphasised their importance reminded me at the time of a favourite trick of detectivestory writers he said if i remember rightly that if those questions were answered in the affirmative he knew that his suspect was guilty just as much as if hed seen her with his own eyes putting the poison into the chocolates because the odds against a coincidental affirmative to all three of them were incalculable in other words he simply made a strong assertion unsupported by evidence or argument and that is what detective story writers do miss dammers queried mr bradley with a tolerant smile invariably mr bradley ive often noticed it in your own books you state a thing so emphatically that the reader does not think of questioning the assertion here says the detective is a bottle of red liquid and here is a bottle of blue if these two liquids turn out to be ink then we know that they were purchased to fill up the empty ink pots in the library as surely as if we had read the dead mans very thoughts whereas the red ink might have been bought by one of the maids to dye a jumper and the blue by the secretary for his fountain pen or a hundred other such explanations but any possibilities of that kind are silently ignored isnt that so perfectly agreed bradley unperturbed dont waste time on unessentials just tell the reader very loudly what hes to think and hell think it all right youve got the technique perfectly why dont you try your hand at it its quite a paying game you know i may one day and anyhow i will say for you mr bradley that your detectives do detect they dont just stand about and wait for somebody else to tell them who committed the murder as the so called detectives do in most of the so called detective stories i read thank you said mr bradley then you actually read detective stories miss dammers certainly said miss dammers crisply why not she dismissed mr bradley as abruptly as she had answered his challenge and the letter itself sir charles the typewriting you dont attach any importance to that as a detail of course it would have to be considered i was only sketching out the broad lines of the case sir charles was no longer bull like i take it that the police would ferret out pieces of conclusive evidence of that nature i think they might have some difficulty in connecting pauline pennefather with the machine that typed that letter observed mrs fielder flemming not without tartness the tide of feeling had obviously set in against sir charles but the motive he pleaded now pathetically on the defensive you must admit that the motive is overwhelming you dont know pauline sir charles lady pennefather miss dammers suggested i do not evidently commented miss dammers you dont agree with sir charless theory miss dammers ventured mr chitterwick i do not said miss dammers with emphasis might one enquire your reason ventured mr chitterwick further certainly you may its a conclusive one im afraid sir charles i was in paris at the time of the murder and just about the very hour when the parcel was being posted i was talking to pauline pennefather in the foyer of the opera what exclaimed the discomfited sir charles the remnants of his beautiful theory crashing about his ears i should apologise for not having given you this information before i suppose said miss dammers with the utmost calmness but i wanted to see what sort of a case you could put up against her and i really do congratulate you it was a remarkable piece of inductive reasoning if i hadnt happened to know that it was built up on a complete fallacy you would have quite convinced me but but why the secrecy and and the impersonation by the maid if her visit was an innocent one stammered sir charles his mind revolving wildly round private aeroplanes and the time they would take from the place de lopera to trafalgar square oh i didnt say it was an innocent one retorted miss dammers carelessly sir eustace isnt the only one who is waiting for the divorce to marry again and in the interim pauline quite rightly doesnt see why she should waste valuable time after all she isnt so young as she was and theres always a strange creature called the kings proctor isnt there shortly after that the chairman adjourned the meeting of the circle he did so because he did not wish one of the members to die of apoplexy on his hands chapter vii mrs fielder flemming was nervous actually nervous she shuffled the pages of her notebook aimlessly and seemed hardly able to sit through the few preliminaries which had to be settled before roger asked her to give the solution which she had already affirmed privately to alicia dammers to be indubitably the correct one of mrs bendixs murder with such a weighty piece of knowledge in her mind one would have thought that for once in her life mrs fielder flemming had a really heaven sent opportunity to be impressive but for once in her life she made no use of it if she had not been mrs fielder flemming one might have gone so far as to say that she dithered are you ready mrs fielder flemming roger asked gazing at this surprising manifestation mrs fielder flemming adjusted her very unbecoming hat rubbed her nose and shot a covert glance round the table roger continued to gaze in astonishment mrs fielder flemming was positively shrinking from the lime light for some occult reason she was approaching her task with real distaste and a distaste at that quite out of comparison with the tasks significance she cleared her throat nervously i have a very difficult duty to perform she began in a low voice last night i hardly slept anything more distasteful to a woman like myself it is impossible to imagine she paused moistening her lips oh come mrs fielder flemming roger felt himself impelled to encourage her its the same for all of us you know and ive heard you make a most excellent speech at one of your own first nights mrs fielder flemming looked at him not at all encouraged i was not referring to that aspect of it mr sheringham she retorted rather more tartly i was speaking of the burden which has been laid on me by the knowledge that has come into my possession the terrible duty i have to perform in consequence of it you mean youve solved the little problem enquired mr bradley without reverence mrs fielder flemming regarded him sombrely with infinite regret she said in low womanly tones i have mrs fielder flemming was recovering her poise she consulted her notes for a moment and then began to speak in a firmer voice criminology i have always regarded with something of a professional eye its main interest has always been for me its immense potentialities for drama the inevitability of murder the predestined victim struggling unconsciously and vainly against fate the predestined killer moving first unconsciously too and then with full and relentless realisation towards the accomplishment of his doom the hidden causes unknown perhaps to both victim and killer which are all the time urging on the fulfilment of destiny apart from the action and the horror of the deed itself i have always felt that there are more possibilities of real drama in the most ordinary or sordid of murders than in any other situation that can occur to man ibsenish in the inevitable working out of certain circumstances in juxtaposition that we call fate no less than edgar wallacish in the crises undergone by the emotions of the onlooker at their climax it was perhaps natural then that i should regard not only this particular case from something of the standpoint of my calling but the task of solving it too anyhow natural or not this is what i did and the result has terribly justified me i considered the case in the light of one of the oldest dramatic situations and very soon everything became only too clear i am referring to the situation which the gentlemen who pass among us in these days for dramatic critics invariably call the eternal triangle i had to begin of course with only one of the triangles three members sir eustace pennefather of the two unknown one must be a woman the other might be woman or man so i fell back on another very old and very sound maxim and proceeded to chercher la femme and said mrs fielder flemming very solemnly i found her so far it must be admitted her audience was not particularly impressed even the promising opening had not stirred them for it was only to be expected that mrs fielder flemming would feel it her duty to emphasise her feminine shrinkings from handing a criminal over to justice her somewhat laborious sentences too obviously learned off by heart for the occasion detracted if anything from the interest of what she had to convey but when she resumed having waited in vain for a tributary gasp at her last momentous piece of information the somewhat calculated tenseness of her style had given way to an unrehearsed earnestness which was very much more impressive i wasnt expecting the triangle to be the hackneyed one she said with a slight dig at the deflated remains of sir charles lady pennefather i hardly considered for a moment the subtlety of the crime i felt sure must be a reflection of an unusual situation and after all a triangle need not necessarily include a husband and wife among its members any three people if the circumstances arrange them so can form one it is the circumstances not the three protagonists that make the triangle sir charles has told us that this crime reminded him of the marie lafarge case and in some respects the mary ansell case too it reminded me of a case as well but it was neither of these the molineux case in new york it seems to me provides a much closer parallel than either you all remember the details of course mr cornish a director of the important knickerbocker athletic club received in his christmas mail a small silver cup and a phial of bromo seltzer addressed to him at the club he thought they had been sent by way of a joke and kept the wrapper in order to identify the humorist a few days later a woman who lived in the same boarding house as cornish complained of a headache and cornish gave her some of the bromo seltzer in a very short time she was dead and cornish who had taken just a sip because she complained of it being bitter was violently ill but recovered later in the end a man named molineux another member of the same club was arrested and put on trial there was quite a lot of evidence against him and it was known that he hated cornish bitterly so much so that he had already assaulted him once moreover another member of the club a man named barnet had been killed earlier in the year through taking what purported to be a sample of a well known headache powder which had also been sent to him at the club and shortly before the cornish episode molineux married a girl who had actually been engaged to barnet at the time of his death he had always wanted her but she had preferred barnet molineux as you remember was convicted at his first trial and acquitted at his second he afterwards became insane now this parallel seems to me complete our case is to all purposes a composite cornish cum barnet case the resemblances are extraordinary there is the poisoned article addressed to the mans club there is in the case of cornish the death of the wrong victim there is the preservation of the wrapper there is in barnets case the triangle element its quite startling it is in fact more than startling its significant things dont happen like that quite by chance mrs fielder flemming paused and blew her nose delicately but with emotion she was getting nicely worked up now and so in consequence was her audience if there were no gasps there was at any rate the tribute of complete silence till she was ready to go on i said that this similarity was more than startling that it was significant i will explain its particular significance later at present it is enough to say that i found it very helpful also the realisation of the extreme closeness of the parallel came as quite a shock to me but once i had grasped it i felt strangely convinced that it was in this very similarity that the clue to the solution of mrs bendixs murder was to be found i felt this so strongly that i somehow actually knew it these intuitions do come to me sometimes and i have never yet known them fail me this one did not do so either i began to examine this case in the light of the molineux one would the latter help me to find the woman i was looking for in the former what were the indications so far as barnet was concerned barnet received his fatal package because he was purposing to marry a girl whom the murderer was resolved he should not marry with so many parallels between the two cases already was there mrs fielder flemming pushed back her unwieldy hat to a still more unbecoming angle and looked deliberately round the table with the air of an early christian trying the power of the human eye on a doubtfully intimidated covey of lions was there another here this time mrs fielder flemming was rewarded with several real and audible gasps that of sir charles was quite the most audible an outraged indignant gasp that came perilously near to a snort mr chitterwick gasped apprehensively as if fearing something like a physical sequel to the sharp exchange of glances between sir charles and mrs fielder flemming those of the former positively menacing in their warning those of the lady almost vocal with her defiance of it the chairman gasped too wondering what a chairman should do if two members of his circle and of opposite sexes at that should proceed to blows under his very nose mr bradley forgot himself so far as to gasp as well in sheer blissful ecstasy mrs fielder flemming looked as if she were to prove a better hand at bull baiting than himself but mr bradley did not grudge her the honour so long as he was to be allowed to sit and hug himself in the audience not in his most daring toreador like antics would mr bradley have ever dared to postulate the very daughter of his victim as the cause of the murder itself could this magnificent woman really bring forward a case to support so puncturing an idea and what if it should actually turn out to be true after all such a thing was conceivable enough murders have been committed for the sake of lovely ladies often enough before so why not for the lovely daughter of a pompous old silk oh god oh montreal finally mrs fielder flemming gasped too at herself alone without a gasp sat alicia dammers her face alight with nothing but an intellectual interest in the development of her fellow members argument determinedly impersonal one was to gather that to miss dammers it was immaterial whether her own mother had been mixed up in the murder so long as her part in it had provided opportunities for the sharpening of wits and the stimulation of intelligence without ever acknowledging her recognition that a personal element was being introduced into the circles investigations she yet managed to radiate the idea that sir charles ought if anything to be detachedly delighted at the possibility of such enterprise on the part of his daughter sir charles however was far from delighted from the red swelling of the veins on his forehead it was obvious that something was going to burst out of him in a very few seconds mrs fielder flemming leapt like an agitated but determined hen for the gap we have agreed to waive the law of slander here she almost squawked personalities dont exist for us if the name crops up of any one personally known to us we utter it as unflinchingly in whatever connection as if it were a complete strangers that is the definite arrangement we came to last night mr president isnt it we are to do what we conceive to be our duty to society quite irrespective of any personal considerations for a moment roger indulged his tremors he did not want his beautiful circle to explode in a cloud of dust never again to be re united and though he could not but admire the flurried but undaunted courage of mrs fielder flemming he had to be content to envy it so far as sir charles was concerned for he certainly did not possess anything like it himself on the other hand there was no doubt that the lady had right on her side and what can any president do but administer justice perfectly correct mrs fielder flemming he had to admit hoping his voice sounded as firm as he would have wished for a moment a blue glare emanating from sir charles enveloped him luridly then as mrs fielder flemming evidently heartened by this official support took up her bomb again the rays of the glare were switched again on to her roger nervously watching the two of them could not help reflecting that blue rays are things which should never be directed on to bombs mrs fielder flemming juggled neatly with her bomb often though it seemed about to slip through her fingers it never quite reached the ground or detonated very well then i will go on my triangle now had the second of its members on the analogy of the barnet murder where was the third to be found obviously with molineux as the prototype in some person who was anxious to prevent the first member from marrying the second so far you will see i am not out of harmony with the conclusions sir charles gave us last night though my method of arriving at them was perhaps somewhat different he gave us a triangle also without expressly defining it as such and the first two members of his triangle are precisely the same as the first two of mine here mrs fielder flemming made a notable effort to return something of sir charless glare in defiant challenge to contradiction as she had simply stated a plain fact however which sir charles was quite unable to refute without explaining that he had not meant what he had meant the evening before the challenge passed unanswered also the glare visibly diminished but for all that a triangle by any other name does not smell so unsavoury it is when we come to the third member pursued mrs fielder flemming with renewed poise that we are at variance sir charles suggested to us lady pennefather i have not the pleasure of lady pennefathers acquaintance but miss dammers who knows her well tells me that in almost every particular the estimate given us by sir charles of her character was wrong she is neither mean grasping greedy nor in any imaginable way capable of the awful deed with which sir charles perhaps a little rashly was ready to credit her lady pennefather i understand is a particularly sweet and kindly woman somewhat broad minded no doubt but none the worse for that indeed as some of us would think a good deal the better mrs fielder flemming encouraged the belief that she was not merely tolerant of a little harmless immorality but actually ready to act as godmother to any particular instance of it indeed she went sometimes quite a long detour out of her way in order to propagate this belief among her friends but unfortunately her friends would persist in remembering that she had refused to have anything more to do with one of her own nieces since the latter on learning that her middle aged husband kept for purposes of convenience a different mistress in each of the four quarters of england and just to be on the safe side one in scotland too had run away with a young man of her own with whom she happened to be very devotedly in love just as i differ from sir charles over the identity of the third person in the triangle went on mrs fielder flemming happily ignorant of her friends memories so i differ from him in the means by which that identity is to be established we are at complete variance in our ideas regarding the very heart of the problem the motive sir charles would have us think that this was a murder committed for gain i am convinced that the incentive was at any rate a less ignoble one than that murder we are taught can never be really justifiable but there are occasions when it comes dangerously near it this in my opinion was one of them it is in the character of sir eustace himself that i see the clue to the identity of the third person let us consider it for a moment we are not restricted by any considerations of slander and we can say at once that from certain points of view sir eustace is a quite undesirable member of the community from the point of view of a young man for the sake of example who is in love with a girl sir eustace must be one of the very last persons with whom the young man would wish that girl to come into contact he is not merely immoral he is without excuse for his immorality a far more serious thing he is a rake a spendthrift without honour or scruples where women are concerned and a man moreover who has already made a mess of marriage with a very charming woman and one by no means too narrow to overlook even a more than liberal allowance of the usual male peccadilloes and lapses as a prospective husband for any young girl sir eustace pennefather is a tragedy and as a prospective husband for a young girl whom a man loves with all his heart intoned mrs fielder flemming very solemnly it is easy to conceive that in that particular mans regard sir eustace pennefather becomes nothing short of an impossibility and a man who is a man added mrs fielder flemming quite mauve with intensity does not admit impossibilities she paused pregnantly curtain act i confided mr bradley behind his hand to mr ambrose chitterwick mr chitterwick smiled nervously chapter viii sir charles took the usual advantage of the first interval to rise from his seat like so many of us in these days by the time of the first interval he felt almost physically unable to contain himself longer mr president he boomed let us get this clear is mrs fielder flemming making the preposterous accusation that some friend of my daughters is responsible for this crime or is she not the president looked somewhat helplessly up at the bulk towering wrathfully above him and wished he were anything but the president i really dont know sir charles he professed which was not only feeble but untrue mrs fielder flemming however was by now quite able to speak up for herself i have not yet specifically accused any one of the crime sir charles she said with a cold dignity that was only marred by the fact that her hat which had apparently been sharing its mistresss emotions was now perched rakishly over her left ear so far i have been simply developing a thesis to mr bradley sir charles would have replied with johnsonian scorn of evasion sir damn your thesis hampered now by the puerilities of civilised convention regarding polite intercourse between the sexes he could only summon up once more the blue glare with the unfairness of her sex mrs fielder flemming promptly took advantage of his handicap and she added pointedly i have not yet finished doing so sir charles sat down the perfect allegory but he grunted very naughtily to himself as he did so mr bradley restrained an impulse to clap mr chitterwick on the back and then chuck him under the chin her serenity so natural as to be patently artificial mrs fielder flemming proceeded to call the interval closed and ring up the curtain on her second act having given you my processes towards arriving at the identity of the third member of the triangle i postulated in other words towards that of the murderer i will go on to the actual evidence and show how that supports my conclusions did i say supports i meant confirms them beyond all doubt but what are your conclusions mrs fielder flemming bradley asked with an air of bland interest you havent defined them yet you only hinted that the murderer was a rival of sir eustaces for the hand of miss wildman exactly agreed alicia dammers even if you dont want to tell us the mans name yet mabel cant you narrow it down a little more for us miss dammers disliked vagueness it savoured to her of the slipshod which above all things in this world she detested moreover she really was extremely interested to know upon whom mrs fielder flemmings choice had alighted mabel she knew might look like one sort of fool talk like another sort and behave like a third and yet really she was not a fool at all but mabel was determined to be coy not yet im afraid for certain reasons i want to prove my case first youll understand later i think very well sighed miss dammers but do lets keep away from the detective story atmosphere all we want to do is to solve this difficult case not mystify each other i have my reasons alicia frowned mrs fielder flemming and rather obviously proceeded to collect her thoughts where was i oh yes the evidence now this is very interesting i have succeeded in obtaining two pieces of quite vital evidence which i have never heard brought forward before the first is that sir eustace was not in love with mrs fielder flemming hesitated then as the plunge had already been taken for her followed the intrepid mr bradley into the deeps of complete candour with miss wildman at all he intended to marry her simply for her money or rather for what he hoped to get of her fathers money i hope sir charles added mrs fielder flemming frostily that you will not consider me slanderous if i allude to the fact that you are an exceedingly rich man it has a most important bearing on my case sir charles inclined his massive handsome head it is hardly a matter of slander madam simply one of taste which is outside my professional orbit i fear it would be a waste of time for me to attempt to advise you on it that is very interesting mrs fielder flemming roger hastily interposed on this exchange of pleasantries how did you discover it from sir eustaces man mr sheringham replied mrs fielder flemming not without pride i interrogated him sir eustace had made no secret of it he seems to confide most freely in his man he expected apparently to be able to pay off his debts buy a racehorse or two provide for the present lady pennefather and generally make a fresh and no doubt discreditable start he had actually promised barker a present of a hundred pounds on the day he led the little filly to the altar as he phrased it i am sorry to hurt your feelings sir charles but i have to deal with facts and feelings must go down before them a present of ten pounds bought me all the information i wanted quite remarkable information as it turned out she looked round triumphantly you dont think perhaps ventured mr chitterwick with an apologetic smile that information from such a tainted source might not be entirely reliable the source seems so very tainted why i dont think my own man would sell me for a ten pound note like master like man returned mrs fielder flemming shortly his information was perfectly reliable i was able to check nearly everything he told me so that i think i am entitled to accept the small residue as correct too i should like to quote another of sir eustaces confidences it is not pretty but it is very very illuminating he had made an attempt to seduce miss wildman in a private room at the pug dog restaurant apparently with the object of ensuring the certainty of the marriage he desired i had better say at once that the attempt was unsuccessful that night sir eustace remarked you can take a filly to the altar but you cant make her drunk that i think will show you better than any words of mine just what manner of man sir eustace pennefather is and it will also show you how overwhelmingly strong was the incentive of the man who really loved her to put her for ever out of the reach of such a brute and that brings me to the second piece of my evidence this is really the foundation stone of the whole structure the basis on which the necessity for murder rested and the basis at the same time of my own reconstruction of the crime miss wildman was hopelessly unreasonably irrevocably infatuated with sir eustace pennefather as an artist in dramatic effect mrs fielder flemming was silent for a moment to allow the significance of this information to sink into the minds of her audience but sir charles was far too personally preoccupied to be interested in significances and may one ask how you found that out madam he demanded swelling with sarcasm from my daughters maid from your daughters maid responded mrs fielder flemming sweetly detecting i discover is an expensive hobby but one mustnt regret money spent in a good cause roger sighed it was plain that once this ill fortuned child of his invention had died a painful death the circle would be found to be without either mrs fielder flemming or sir charles wildman and he knew which of the two it would be it was a pity sir charles besides being such an asset from the professional point of view was the only leavening apart from mr ambrose chitterwick of the literary element and roger who had attended a few literary parties in his earlier days was quite sure he would not be able to face a gathering that consisted of nothing but people who made their livings by their typewriters besides mrs fielder flemming really was being a little hard on the old man after all it was his daughter who was in question i have now said mrs fielder flemming established an overwhelming motive for the man who is in my mind to eliminate sir eustace in fact it must have seemed to him the only possible way out of an intolerable situation let me now go on to connect him with the few facts allowed us by the anonymous murderer when the chief inspector the other evening permitted us to examine the forged letter from mason and sons i examined it closely because i know something about typewriters that letter was typed on a hamilton machine the man i have in mind has a hamilton typewriter at his place of business you may say that might be only a coincidence the hamilton being so generally used so it might but if you get enough coincidences lumped together they cease to become coincidences at all and become certainties in the same way we have the further coincidence of masons notepaper this man has a definite connection with masons three years ago as you may remember masons were involved in a big lawsuit i forget the details but i think they brought an action against one of their rivals you may remember sir charles sir charles nodded reluctantly as if unwilling to help his antagonist even with this unimportant information i ought to he said shortly it was against the fearnley chocolate company for infringement of copyright in an advertisement figure i led for masons thank you yes i thought it was something like that very well then this man was connected with that very case he was helping masons on the legal side he must have been in and out of their office his opportunities for possessing himself of a piece of their notepaper would have been legion the chances by which he might have found himself three years later in possession of a piece would be innumerable the paper had yellowed edges it must have been quite three years old it had an erasure that erasure i suggest is the remains of a brief note on the case jotted down one day in masons office the thing is obvious everything fits then there is the matter of the post mark i agree with sir charles that we may take it for granted that the murderer cunning though he is and anxious though he might be to establish an alibi would not entrust the posting of the fatal parcel to any one else apart from a confederate which i am sure we may rule out of the question it would be far too dangerous the name of sir eustace pennefather could hardly escape being seen and the connection later established the murderer secure in his conviction that suspicion will never fall on himself of all people gambles a possible alibi against a certain risk and posts the thing himself it is therefore advisable just to clinch the case against him to connect the man with the neighbourhood of the strand between the hours of eight thirty and nine thirty on that particular evening surprisingly enough i found this task which i had expected to be the most difficult the easiest of all the man of whom i am thinking actually attended a public dinner that night at the hotel cecil a re union dinner to be exact of his old school the hotel cecil i need not remind you is almost opposite southampton street the southampton street post office is the nearest one to the hotel what could be easier for him than to slip out of his seat for the five minutes which is all that would be required and be back again almost before his neighbours had noticed his action what indeed murmured the rapt mr bradley i have two final points to make you remember that in pointing out the resemblance of this case to the molineux affair i remarked that this similarity was more than surprising it was significant i will explain what i meant by that what i meant was that the parallel was far too close for it to be just a coincidence this case is a deliberate copy of that one and if it is there is only one inference this murder is the work of a man steeped in criminal history of a criminologist and the man i have in mind is a criminologist my last point concerns the denial in the newspaper of the rumoured engagement between sir eustace pennefather and miss wildman i learnt from his valet that sir eustace did not send that denial himself nor did miss wildman sir eustace was furiously angry about it it was sent on his own initiative without consulting either of them by the man whom i am accusing of having committed this crime mr bradley stopped hugging himself for a moment and the nitrobenzene were you able to connect him with that too that is one of the very few points on which i agree with sir charles i dont think it in the least necessary or possible to connect him with such a common commodity which can be bought anywhere without the slightest difficulty or remark mrs fielder flemming was holding herself in with a visible effort her words so calm and judicial to read had hitherto been spoken too with a strenuous attempt towards calm and judicial delivery but with each sentence the attempt was obviously becoming more difficult mrs fielder flemming was clearly getting so excited that a few more such sentences seemed likely to choke her though to the others such intensity of feeling seemed a little unnecessary she was approaching her climax of course but even that seemed hardly an excuse for such a very purple face and a hat that had now managed somehow to ride to the very back of her head where it trembled agitatedly in sympathy with its mistress that is all she concluded jerkily i submit that i have proved my case this man is the murderer there was complete silence well said alicia dammers impatiently who is he then sir charles who had been regarding the orator with a frown that grew more and more lowering every minute thumped quite menacingly on the table in front of him precisely he growled let us get out in the open against whom are these ridiculous insinuations of yours directed madam one gathered that sir charles did not find himself in agreement with the ladys conclusions even before knowing what they were accusations sir charles mrs fielder flemming squeaked correction you you pretend you dont know really madam retorted sir charles with massive dignity im afraid i have no idea and then mrs fielder flemming became regrettably dramatic rising slowly to her feet like a tragedy queen heedless of the chair overturning behind her with a dull doom like thud her quivering finger pointing across the table she confronted sir charles with every inch of her five foot nothing thou shrilled mrs fielder flemming thou art the man her outstretched finger shook like a ribbon on an electric fan the brand of cain is on your forehead murderer in the silence of ecstatic horror that followed mr bradley clung deliriously to the arm of mr chitterwick sir charles succeeded in finding his voice temporarily mislaid the womans mad he gasped finding that she had not been shot on the spot or even blasted by blue lightning from sir charless eyes either of which possibilities it seemed that she had been dreading mrs fielder flemming proceeded rather less hysterically to amplify her charge no i am not mad sir charles i am very very sane you loved your daughter and with the twofold love that a man who has lost his wife feels for the only feminine thing left to him you considered that any lengths were justified to prevent her from tailing into the hands of sir eustace pennefather from having her youth her innocence her trust exploited by such a scoundrel out of your own mouth i convict you already youve told us that it was not necessary to mention everything that took place at your interview with sir eustace no for then you would have had to give away the fact that you informed him you would rather kill him with your own hands than see your daughter married to him and when matters reached such a pass what with the poor girls infatuation and obstinacy and sir eustaces determination to take advantage of them that no means short of that very thing was left to you to prevent the catastrophe you did not shrink from employing them sir charles wildman may god be your judge for i cannot breathing heavily mrs fielder flemming retrieved her inverted chair and sat down on it well sir charles remarked mr bradley whose swelling bosom was threatening to burst his waistcoat well i wouldnt have thought it of you murder indeed very naughty very very naughty for once sir charles took no notice of his faithful gadfly it is doubtful whether he even heard him now that it had penetrated into his consciousness that mrs fielder flemming really intended her accusation in all seriousness and was not the victim of a temporary attack of insanity his bosom was swelling just as tumultuously as mr bradleys his face adopting the purple tinge that mrs fielder flemmings was relinquishing took on the aspect of the frog in the fable who failed to realise his own bursting point roger whose emotions on hearing mrs fielder flemmings outburst had been so mixed to be almost scrambled began to feel quite alarmed for him but sir charles found the safety valve of speech just in time mr president he exploded through it if i am not right in assuming this to be a jest on this ladys part even though a jest in the worst possible taste am i to be expected to take this preposterous nonsense seriously roger glanced at mrs fielder flemmings face now set in flinty masses and gulped however preposterous though sir charles might term it his antagonist had certainly made out a case and not a flimsy unsupported case either i think he said as carefully as he could that if it had been any one but yourself in question sir charles you would agree that a charge of this kind when there is real evidence to support it does at least require to be taken seriously so far as to need refuting sir charles snorted and mrs fielder flemming nodded her head several times with vehemence if refuting is possible observed mr bradley but i must admit that personally i am impressed mrs fielder flemming seems to me to have made out her case would you like me to go and telephone for the police mr president he spoke with an air of earnest endeavour to do his duty as a citizen however distasteful it might be sir charles glared but once more seemed bereft of words not yet i think roger said gently we havent heard yet what sir charles has to answer well i suppose we may as well hear him conceded mr bradley five pairs of eyes glued themselves on sir charles five pairs of ears were strained but sir charles struggling mightily with himself was silent as i expected murmured mr bradley there is no defence even sir charles who has snatched so many murderers from the rope can find nothing to say in such a glaring case its very sad from the look he flashed at his tormentor it was to be deduced that sir charles might have found plenty to say had the two of them been alone together as it was he could only rumble mr president said alicia dammers with her usual brisk efficiency i have a proposal to make sir charles appears to be admitting his guilt by default and mr bradley as a good citizen wishes to hand him over to the police hear hear observed the good citizen personally i should be sorry to do that i think there is a good deal to be said for sir charles murder we are taught is invariably anti social but is it i am of the opinion that sir charless intention that of ridding the world of sir eustace pennefather was quite in the worlds best interests that his intention miscarried and an innocent victim was killed is quite beside the point even mrs fielder flemming seemed to be doubtful whether sir charles ought to be condemned as a jury would certainly condemn him though she added in conclusion that she did not feel competent to judge him i differ from her being a person of i hope reasonable intelligence i feel perfectly competent to judge him and i consider further that all five of us are competent to judge him i therefore suggest that we do in fact judge him ourselves mrs fielder flemming could act as prosecutor somebody could defend him and all five of us constitute a jury the finding to be by majority in favour or against we would bind ourselves to abide by the result and if it is against him we send for the police if it is in his favour we agree never to breathe a word of his guilt outside this room may this be put to the meeting roger smiled at her reprovingly he knew quite well that miss dammers no more believed in sir charless guilt than he roger did himself and he knew that she was only pulling that eminent counsels leg a little cruelly but no doubt she thought it was good for him miss dammers professed herself a strong believer in seeing the other side and held that it would be a very good thing for the cat occasionally to find itself chased by the mouse certainly therefore it was most salutary for a man who had prosecuted other men for their lives to find himself for once in the dock on just such a terrifying charge mr bradley on the other hand though he too obviously did not believe that sir charles was the murderer mocked not out of conviction but because only so could he get a little of his own back against sir charles for having made more of a success of his life than mr bradley was likely to do nor roger thought had mr chitterwick any serious doubts as to the possibility of sir charles being guilty though he was still looking so alarmed at mrs fielder flemmings temerity in suggesting such a thing that it was not altogether possible to say what he did think indeed roger was quite sure that nobody entertained the least suspicion of sir charless innocence except mrs fielder flemming and perhaps from the look of him sir charles himself as that outraged gentleman had pointed out such an idea looked at in sober reflection was plainly the most preposterous nonsense sir charles could not be guilty because well because he was sir charles and because such things dont happen and because he obviously couldnt be on the other hand mrs fielder flemming had very neatly proved that he was and sir charles had not even attempted yet to prove that he wasnt not for the first time roger wished very sincerely that anybody were sitting in the presidential chair but himself i think he now repeated that before we take any steps at all we ought to hear what sir charles has to say i am sure added the president kindly remembering the right phrase that he will have a complete answer to all charges he looked expectantly towards the criminal sir charles appeared to jerk himself out of the haze of his wrath i am really expected to defend myself against this this hysteria he barked very well i admit i am a criminologist which mrs fielder flemming appears to think so damning i admit that i attended a dinner at the hotel cecil on that night which it seems is enough to put the rope round my neck i admit since it appears that my private affairs are to be dragged into public regardless of taste or decency that i would rather have strangled sir eustace with my own hands than see him married to my daughter he paused and passed his hand rather wearily over his high forehead he was no longer formidable but only a rather bewildered old man roger felt intensely sorry for him but mrs fielder flemming had stated her case too well for it to be possible to spare him i admit all this but none of it is evidence that would have very much weight in a court of law if you want me to prove that i did not actually send those chocolates what am i to say i could bring my two neighbours at the dinner who would swear that i never left my seat till well it must have been after ten oclock i can prove by means of other witnesses that my daughter finally consented on my representations to give up the idea of marriage with sir eustace and has gone voluntarily to stay with relations of ours in devonshire for a considerable time but there again i have to admit that this has happened since the date of posting the chocolates in short mrs fielder flemming has managed with considerable skill to put together a prima facie case against me though it was based on a mistaken assumption and i am quite ready if this meeting thinks it advisable for the matter to be investigated officially more i welcome such investigation in view of the slur that has been cast upon my name mr president i ask you as representing the members as a whole to take such action as you think fit roger steered a wary course speaking for myself sir charles i am quite sure that mrs fielder flemmings reasoning exceedingly clever though it was has been based as you say upon an error and really as a matter of mere probability i cannot see a father sending poisoned chocolates to the would be fiance of his own daughter a moments thought would show him the practical inevitability of the chocolates reaching eventually the daughter herself i have my own opinion about this crime but even apart from that i feel quite certain in my own mind that the case against sir charles has not really been proved mr president cut in mrs fielder flemming not without heat you may say what you like but in the interests of i agree mr president miss dammers interrupted incisively it is unthinkable that sir charles could have sent those chocolates humph said mr bradley unwilling to have his sport spoiled quite so soon hear hear mr chitterwick with surprising decision on the other hand roger pursued i quite see that mrs fielder flemming is entitled to the official investigation which sir charles asks for no less than is sir charles himself on behalf of his good name and i agree with sir charles that she has certainly made out a prima facie case for investigation but what i should like to stress is that so far only two members out of six have spoken and it is not outside possibility that such startling developments may have been traced out by the time we have all had our turn that the one we are discussing now may have faded into insignificance oho murmured mr bradley what has our worthy president got up his sleeve i therefore propose as a formal motion roger concluded disregarding the somewhat sour looks cast on him by mrs fielder flemming that we shelve the question regarding sir charles entirely for discussion or report either inside or outside this room for one week from today when any member who wishes may bring it up again for decision failing which it passes into oblivion for good and all shall we vote on that those in favour the motion was carried unanimously mrs fielder flemming would have liked to vote against it but she had never yet belonged to any committee where all motions were not carried unanimously and habit was too strong for her the meeting then adjourned rather oppressed chapter ix roger sat on the table in moresbys room at scotland yard and swung his legs moodily moresby was being no help at all ive told you mr sheringham said the chief inspector with a patient air its not a bit of good you trying to pump me ive told you all we know here id help you if i could as you know roger snorted incredulously but were simply at a dead end so am i roger grunted and i dont like it youll soon get used to it mr sheringham consoled moresby if you take on this sort of job often i simply cant get any further roger lamented in fact i dont think i want to im practically sure ive been working on the wrong tack altogether if the clue really does lie in sir eustaces private life hes shielding it like the very devil but i dont think it does humph said moresby who did ive cross examined his friends till theyre tired of the sight of me ive cadged introductions to the friends of his friends and the friends of his friends of his friends and cross examined them too ive haunted his club and what have i discovered that sir eustace was not only a daisy as youd told me already but a perfectly indiscreet daisy at that the quite unpleasant type fortunately very much rarer than women suppose that talks of his feminine successes with names though i think that in sir eustaces case this was simply through lack of imagination and not any natural caddishness but you see what i mean ive collected the names of scores of women and they all lead nowhere if there is a woman at the bottom of it i should have been sure to have heard of her by this time and i havent and what about that american case which we thought such an extraordinary parallel mr sheringham that was cited last night by one of our members said roger gloomily and a very pretty little deduction she drew from it ah yes nodded the chief inspector that would be mrs fielder flemming i suppose she thinks sir charles wildman is the guilty party doesnt she roger stared at him how the devil did you know that oh the unscrupulous old hag she passed you the wink did she certainly not sir retorted moresby with a virtuous air as if half the difficult cases scotland yard solves are not edged in the first place along the right path by means of information received she hasnt said a word to us though im not saying it wouldnt have been her duty to do so but there isnt much that your members are doing which we dont know about and thinking too for that matter were being shadowed said roger pleased yes you told me at the beginning that we were to have an eye kept on us well well so in that case are you going to arrest sir charles not yet i think mr sheringham moresby returned gravely what do you think of the theory then she made out a very striking case for it i should be very surprised said moresby with care to be convinced that sir charles wildman had taken to murdering people himself instead of preventing us from hanging other murderers less paying certainly roger agreed yes of course there cant be anything in it really but its a nice idea and what theory are you going to put forward mr sheringham moresby i havent the faintest idea and ive got to speak tomorrow night too i suppose i can fake up something to pass muster but its a disappointment roger reflected for a moment i think the real trouble is that my interest in this case is simply academic in all the others it has been personal and that not only gives one such a much bigger incentive to get to the bottom of a case but somehow actually helps one to do so bigger gleanings in the way of information i suppose and more intimate sidelights on the people concerned well mr sheringham remarked moresby a little maliciously perhaps youll admit now that we people here whose interest is never personal have a bit of an excuse when we do come to grief over a case which by the way moresby added with professional pride is precious seldom i certainly do roger agreed feelingly well moresby ive got to go through the distressing business of buying a new hat before lunch do you feel like shadowing me to bond street i might afterwards walk into a neighbouring hostelry and it would be nice for you to be able to shadow me in there too sorry mr sheringham said chief inspector moresby pointedly but i have some work to do roger removed himself he was feeling so depressed that he took a taxi to bond street instead of a bus to cheer himself up roger having been in london occasionally during the war years and remembering the interesting habits cultivated by taxi drivers during that period had never taken one since when a bus would do as well the public memory is notoriously short but the public prejudices are equally notoriously long roger had reason for his depression he was as he had told moresby not only at a dead end but the conviction was beginning to grow in him that he had actually been working completely on the wrong lines and the possibility that all the labour he had put into the case had simply been time wasted was a sad one his initial interest in the affair though great had been as he had just realised only an academic one such as he would feel in any cleverly planned murder and in spite of the contacts established with persons who were acquainted with various of the protagonists he still felt himself awkwardly outside the case there was no personal connection somehow to enable him really to get to grips with it he was beginning to suspect that it was the sort of case necessitating endless inquiries such as a private individual has neither the skill the patience nor the time to prosecute which can really only be handled by the official police it was hazard two chance encounters that same day and almost within an hour which put an entirely different complexion on the case to rogers eyes and translated at last his interest in it from the academic into the personal the first was in bond street emerging from his hat shop the new hat at just the right angle on his head he saw bearing down on him mrs verreker le mesurer mrs verreker le mesurer was small exquisite rich comparatively young and a widow and she coveted roger why even roger who had his share of proper conceit could not understand but whenever he gave her the opportunity she would sit at his feet and gaze up at him with her big brown eyes melting in earnest uplift but she talked she talked in short and talked and talked and roger who rather liked talking himself could not bear it he tried to dart across the road but there was no opening in the traffic stream he was cornered with a gay smile that masked a vituperative mind he spoilt the angle of his beautiful new hat mrs verreker le mesurer fastened on him gladly oh mr sheringham just the very person i wanted to see mr sheringham do tell me in the strictest confidence of course are you taking up this dreadful business of poor joan bendixs death oh dont dont tell me youre not roger tried to tell her that he had hoped to do so but she gave him no chance oh arent you really but its too dreadful you ought you know you really ought to try and find out who sent those chocolates to sir eustace pennefather i do think its naughty of you not to roger the frozen grin of civilised intercourse on his face again tried to edge a word in without result i was horrified when i heard of it simply horrified mrs verreker le mesurer registered horror you see joan and i were such very close friends quite intimate in fact we were at school together did you say anything mr sheringham roger who had allowed a faintly incredulous groan to escape him hastily shook his head and the awful thing the truly terrible thing is that joan brought the whole thing on herself isnt that appalling mr sheringham roger no longer wanted to escape what did you say he managed to insert again incredulously i suppose its what they call tragic irony mrs verreker le mesurer chattered happily certainly it was tragic enough and ive never heard of anything so terribly ironical you know about that bet she made with her husband of course so that he had to get her a box of chocolates and if he hadnt sir eustace would never have given him the poisoned ones but would have eaten them and died himself and from all i hear about him good riddance well mr sheringham mrs verreker le mesurer lowered her voice to a conspirator like whisper and glanced about her in the approved manner ive never told any one else this but im telling you because i know youll appreciate it you are interested in irony arent you i adore it roger said mechanically yes well joan wasnt playing fair how do you mean roger asked bewildered mrs verreker le mesurer was artlessly pleased with her sensation why she ought not to have made that bet at all it was a judgment on her a terrible judgment of course but the appalling thing is that she did bring it on herself in a way im so terribly distressed about it really mr sheringham i can hardly bear to turn the light out when i go to bed i see joans face simply looking at me in the dark its awful and for a fleeting instant mrs verreker le mesurers face did for once really mirror the emotion she professed it looked quite haggard why oughtnt mrs bendix to have made the bet roger asked patiently oh why because shed seen the play before we went together the very first week it was on she knew who the villain was all the time by jove roger was as impressed as mrs verreker le mesurer could have wished the avenging chance again eh were none of us immune from it poetic justice you mean twittered mrs verreker le mesurer to whom these remarks had been a trifle obscure yes it was in a way wasnt it though really the punishment was out of all proportion to the crime good gracious if every woman who cheats over a bet is to be killed for it where would any of us be demanded mrs verreker le mesurer with unconscious frankness umph said roger tactfully mrs verreker le mesurer glanced rapidly up and down the pavement and moistened her lips roger had an odd impression that she was talking not as usual just for the sake of talking but in some recondite way to escape from not talking it was as if she was more distressed over her friends death than she cared to show and found some relief in babbling it interested roger also to notice that fond though she had probably been of the dead woman she now found herself driven as if against her will to hint at blame even while praising her it was as though she was able thus to extract some subtle consolation for the actual death but joan bendix of all people thats what i cant get over mr sheringham i should never have thought joan would do a thing like that joan was such a nice girl a little close with money perhaps considering how well off she was but that isnt anything of course i know it was only fun and pulling her husbands leg but i always used to think joan was such a serious girl if you know what i mean quite said roger who could understand plain english as well as most people i mean ordinary people dont talk about honour and truth and playing the game and all those things one takes for granted but joan did she was always saying that this wasnt honourable or that wouldnt be playing the game well she paid herself for not playing the game poor girl didnt she still i suppose it all goes to prove the truth of the old saying what old saying asked roger almost hypnotised by this flow why that still waters run deep joan must have been deep after all im afraid mrs verreker le mesurer sighed it was evidently a grave social error to be deep not that i want to say anything against her now shes dead poor darling but well what i mean is i do think psychology is so very interesting dont you mr sheringham quite fascinating roger agreed gravely well im afraid i must be and what does that man sir eustace pennefather think about it all demanded mrs verreker le mesurer with an expression of positive vindictiveness after all hes as responsible for joans death as anybody oh really roger had not conceived any particular love for sir eustace but he felt constrained to defend him against this charge really i dont think you can say that mrs verreker le mesurer i can and i do affirmed that lady have you ever met him mr sheringham i hear hes a horrible creature always running after some woman or other and when hes tired of her just drops her biff like that is it true im afraid i cant tell you roger said coldly i dont know him at all well its common talk who hes taken up with now retorted mrs verreker le mesurer perhaps a trifle more pink than the delicate aids to nature on her cheeks would have warranted half a dozen people have told me that bryce woman of all people you know the wife of the oil man or petrol or whatever he made his money in ive never heard of her roger said quite untruthfully it began about a week ago they say rattled on this red hot gossiper to console himself for not getting dora wildman i suppose well thank goodness sir charles had the sense to put his foot down there he did didnt he i heard so the other day horrible man youd have thought that such a dreadful thing as being practically responsible for poor joans death would have sobered him up a little wouldnt you but not a bit of it as a matter of fact i believe he have you seen any shows lately roger asked in a loud voice mrs verreker le mesurer stared at him for a moment nonplussed shows yes ive seen almost everything i think why mr sheringham i just wondered the new revue at the pavilions quite good isnt it well im afraid i must oh dont mrs verreker le mesurer shuddered delicately i was there the night before joans death lady cavelstoke had a box and asked me to join her party yes roger was wondering if it would be considered rude if he simply handed the lady off as at rugger and dived for the nearest opening in the traffic quite a good show he said at random edging restlessly towards the curb i liked that sketch the sempiternal triangle particularly the sempiternal triangle repeated mrs verreker le mesurer vaguely yes quite near the beginning oh then i may not have seen it i got there few minutes late im afraid but then said mrs verreker le mesurer with pathos i always do seem to be late for everything roger noted mentally that the few minutes was by way of a euphemism as were most of mrs verreker le mesurers statements regarding herself the sempiternal triangle had certainly not been in the first half hour of the performance ah roger looked fixedly at an oncoming bus im afraid youll have to excuse me mrs verreker le mesurer theres a man on that bus who wants to speak to me scotland yard he hissed in an impressive whisper oh then then does that mean you are looking into poor joans death mr sheringham do tell me i wont breathe it to a soul roger looked round him with a mysterious air and frowned in the approved manner yes he nodded his finger to his lips but not a word mrs verreker le mesurer of course not i promise but roger was disappointed to notice that the lady did not seem quite so impressed as he had hoped from her expression he was almost ready to believe that she suspected how unavailing his efforts had been and was a little sorry that he had taken on more than he could manage but the bus had now reached them and with a hasty good bye roger swung himself onto the step as it lumbered past with awful stealth feeling those big brown eyes fixed in awe on his back he climbed the steps and took his seat after an exaggerated scrutiny of the other passengers beside a perfectly inoffensive little man in a bowler hat the little man who happened to be a clerk in the employment of a monumental mason at tooting looking at him resentfully there were plenty of quite empty seats all round them the bus swung into piccadilly and roger got off at the rainbow club he was lunching once again with a member roger had spent most of the last ten days asking such members of the rainbow club as he knew however remotely out to lunch in order to be asked to the club in return so far nothing helpful had arisen out of all this wasted labour and he anticipated nothing more today not that the member was at all reluctant to talk about the tragedy he had been at school with bendix it appeared and was as ready to adopt responsibility for him on the strength of this tie as mrs verreker le mesurer had been for mrs bendix he plumed himself more than a little therefore on having a more intimate connection with the business than his fellow members indeed one gathered that the connection was even a trifle closer than that of sir eustace himself rogers host was that kind of man as they were talking a man entered the dining room and walked past their table rogers host became abruptly silent the newcomer threw him an abrupt nod and passed on rogers host leant forward across the table and spoke in the hushed tones of one to whom a revelation has been vouchsafed talk of the devil that was bendix himself first time ive seen him in here since it happened poor devil it knocked him all to pieces you know ive never seen a man so devoted to his wife it was a byword did you see how ghastly he looked all this in a tactful whisper that must have been far more obvious to the subject of it had he happened to be looking their way than the loudest bellowing roger nodded shortly he had caught a glimpse of bendixs face and been shocked by it even before he learned his identity it was haggard and pale and seamed with lines of bitterness prematurely old hang it all he now thought much moved somebody really must make an effort if the murderer isnt found soon it will kill that chap too aloud he said somewhat at random and certainly without tact he didnt exactly fall on your neck i thought you two were such bosom friends his host looked uncomfortable oh well you must make allowances just at present he judged besides we werent bosom friends exactly as a matter of fact he was a year or two senior to me or it might have been three even we were in different houses too and he was on the modern side of course while i was a classical bird i see said roger quite gravely realising that his hosts actual contact with bendix at school had been limited at most to that of the latters toe with the formers hinder parts he left it at that for the rest of lunch he was a little inattentive something was nagging at his brain and he could not identify it somewhere somehow during the last hour he felt a vital piece of information had been conveyed to him and he had never grasped its importance it was not until he was putting on his coat half an hour later and for the moment had given up trying to worry his mind into giving up its booty that the realisation suddenly came to him unbidden in accordance with its usual and maddening way he stopped dead one arm in his coat sleeve the other in act to fumble by jove he said softly anything the matter old man asked his host now mellowed by much port no thanks nothing said roger hastily coming to earth again outside the club he hailed a taxi for probably the first time in her life mrs verreker le mesurer had given somebody a constructive idea for the rest of the day roger was very busy indeed chapter x the president called on mr bradley to hold forth mr bradley stroked his moustache and mentally shot his cuffs he had begun his career as a motor salesman and had discovered that there is more money in manufacturing now he manufactured detective stories and found his former experience of the publics gullibility not unhelpful he was still his own salesman but occasionally had difficulty in remembering that he was no longer mounted on a stand at olympia everything and everybody in this world including morton harrogate bradley he heartily despised except only percy robinson he sold in tens of thousands this is rather unfortunate for me he began in the correct gentlemanly drawl as if addressing an audience of morons i had rather been under the impression that i should be expected to produce as a murderer the most unlikely person in the usual tradition and mrs fielder flemming has cut the ground away from under my feet i dont see how i can possibly find you a more unlikely murderer than sir charles here all of us who have the misfortune to speak after mrs fielder flemming will have to be content to pile up so many anticlimaxes not that i havent done my best i studied the case according to my own lights and it led me to a conclusion which certainly surprised myself quite a lot but as i said after the last speaker it will probably seem to everybody else a dismal anti climax let me see now where did i begin oh yes with the poison now the use of nitrobenzene as the poisoning agent interested me quite a lot i find it extremely significant nitrobenzene is the last thing one would expect inside those chocolates ive made something of a study of poisons in connection with my work and ive never heard of nitrobenzene being employed in a criminal case before there are cases on record of its use in suicide and in accidental poisoning but not more than three or four all told im surprised that this point doesnt seem to have struck either of my predecessors the really interesting thing is that so few people know nitrobenzene as a poison at all even the experts dont i was speaking to a man who got a science scholarship at cambridge and specialised in chemistry and he had actually never heard of it as a poison as a matter of fact i found i knew a good deal more about it than he did a commercial chemist would certainly never think of it as among the ordinary poisons it isnt even listed as such and the list is comprehensive enough well all this seems most significant to me then there are other points about it its used most extensively in commerce in fact its the kind of thing that might be used in almost any manufacture its a solvent of quite a universal kind weve been told that its chief use is in making aniline dyes that may be the most important one but it certainly isnt the most extensive its used a lot in confectionery as we were also told and in perfumery as well but really i cant attempt to give you a list of its uses they range from chocolates to motor car tyres the important thing is that its perfectly easy to get hold of for that matter its perfectly easy to make too any schoolboy knows how to treat benzol with nitric acid to get nitrobenzene ive done it myself a hundred times the veriest smattering of chemical knowledge is all thats wanted and nothing in the way of expensive apparatus or so far as that goes it could be done equally by somebody without any chemical knowledge at all that is the actual process of making it oh and it could be made quite secretly by the way nobody need even guess but i think just a little chemical knowledge at any rate would be wanted ever to set one about making it at all at least for this particular purpose well so far as the case as a whole was concerned this use of nitrobenzene seemed to me not only the sole original feature but by far the most important piece of evidence not in the way that prussic acid is valuable evidence for the reason that prussic acid is so hard to obtain because once its use was determined anybody could get hold of or make nitrobenzene and that of course is a tremendous point in favour of it from the would be murderers point of view no what i mean is that the sort of person who would ever think of employing the stuff at all ought to be definable within surprisingly narrow limits mr bradley stopped a moment to light a cigarette and if he was secretly pleased that his fellow members showed the extent to which he had engaged their interest by not uttering a word until he was ready to go on he did not divulge the fact surveying them for a moment as if inspecting a class composed entirely of half wits he took up his argument again first of all then we can credit this user of nitrobenzene with a minimum at any rate of chemical knowledge or perhaps i ought to qualify that either chemical knowledge or specialised knowledge a chemists assistant for instance who was interested enough in his job to read it up after shop hours would fit the bill for the first case and a woman employed in a factory where nitrobenzene was used and where the employees had been warned against its poisonous properties would do for an example of the second there are two kinds of person it seems to me who might think of using the stuff as a poison at all and the first kind is subdivided into the two classes ive mentioned but its the second kind that i think we are much more probably dealing with in this crime this is a more intelligent sort of person altogether in this category the chemists assistant becomes an amateur dabbler in chemistry the girl in the factory a woman doctor let us say with an interest in toxicology or to get away from the specialist a highly intelligent lady with a strong interest in criminology particularly on its toxicological side just in fact like mrs fielder flemming here mrs fielder flemming gasped indignantly and sir charles though momentarily startled at the unexpected quarter from which was dealt his tit for the tats he had lately suffered at the gasping ladys hands emitted the next instant a sound which from anybody else could only have been described as a guffaw all of them you understand continued mr bradley with complete serenity the kind of people who might be expected not only to keep a taylors medical jurisprudence on their shelves but to consult it frequently i agree with you you see mrs fielder flemming that the method of this crime does show traces of criminological knowledge you cited one case which was certainly a remarkable parallel sir charles cited another and i am going to cite yet a third it is a regular jumble of old cases and i am quite sure as you are that this is something more than a mere coincidence id arrived at this conclusion myself of criminological knowledge before you mentioned it at all and i was helped to it as well by the strong feeling that whoever sent those chocolates to sir eustace possesses a taylor that is a pure guess i admit but in my copy of taylor the article on nitrobenzene occurs on the very next page after cyanide of potassium and there seems to me food for thought there the speaker paused a moment mr chitterwick nodded i think i see you mean anybody deliberately searching the pages for a poison that would fulfil certain requirements exactly mr bradley concurred you lay great stress on this matter of the poison sir charles remarked almost genial do you tell us that you think youve identified the murderer by deductions drawn from this one point alone no sir charles i dont think i can go quite so far as that i lay so much stress on it because as i said its the only really original feature of the crime by itself it wont solve the problem but considered in conjunction with other features i do think it should go a long way towards doing so or at any rate provide such a check on a person suspected for other reasons as to turn suspicion into certainty lets look at it for instance in the light of the crime as a whole i think the first thing one realises is that this crime is the work not only of an intelligent person but of a well educated one too well you see that rules out at once the first division of people who might be expected to think of using nitrobenzene as the poisoning agent gone are our chemists assistant and our factory girl we can concentrate on our intelligent well educated person with an interest in criminology some knowledge of toxicology and if im not very much mistaken a copy of taylor or some similar book on his or her shelves that my dear watsons is what the criminals singular choice of nitrobenzene has to tell me and mr bradley stroked the growth on his upper lip with an offensive complacency that was not wholly assumed mr bradley took some pains to impress on the world how pleased he was with himself but the pose was not without its foundation in fact most ingenious certainly murmured mr chitterwick duly impressed so now lets get on with it observed miss dammers not at all impressed whats your theory that is if youve really got one oh ive got one all right mr bradley smiled in a superior manner this was the first time he had succeeded in provoking miss dammers to snap at him and he was rather pleased but lets take things in their proper order i want to show you how inevitably i was led to my conclusion and i can only do that by tracing out my own footsteps so to speak having made my deductions from the poison itself then i set about examining the other clues to see if they would lead me to a result that i could check by the other first of all i concentrated on the notepaper of the forged letter the only really valuable clue apart from the poison now this piece of notepaper puzzled me for some reason which i couldnt identify the name of masons seemed to strike a reminiscent note to me i felt sure that id heard of masons in some other connection than just through their excellent chocolates at last i remembered im afraid i must touch here on the personal and i apologise in advance sir charles for the lapse of taste my sister before she married was a shorthand typist mr bradleys extreme languor all of a sudden indicated that he felt this connection needed some defence and was determined not to give it the next instant he gave it that is to say her education put her on rather a different level from the usual shorthand typist and she was in point of fact a trained secretary she had joined an establishment run by a lady who supplied secretaries to business firms to take the places temporarily of girls in responsible positions who were ill or away on holiday or anything like that including my sister there were only two or three girls at the place and the posts they went to only lasted as a rule for two or three weeks each girl would therefore have a good many such posts in the course of a year however i did remember distinctly that one of the firms to which my sister went while she was there was masons as temporary secretary to one of the directors this seemed to me possibly useful it wouldnt be likely that she could throw a sidelight on the murder but at any rate she might be able to give me introductions to one or two members of masons staff if necessary so i went down to see her about it she remembered quite well it was between three and four years ago and she liked being there so much that she had thought quite seriously of putting in for a permanent secretaryship with the firm should one be available naturally she hadnt got to know any of the staff really well but quite enough to give me the introductions if i wanted them by the way i happened to say to her casually i saw the letter that was sent to sir eustace with the chocolates and not only masons name but the actual paper itself struck me as familiar i suppose you wrote to me on it while you were there i dont know that i ever did that she said but of course the paper was familiar to you youve played paper games here often enough havent you you know we always use it its such a convenient size paper games i should explain have always been a favourite thing in our family its funny how a connection will stick in the mind but not the actual circumstances of it of course i remembered then at once there was quite a pile of the paper in one of the drawers of my sisters writing table id often torn it into strips for our paper games myself but how did you get hold of it i asked her it seemed to me that she answered rather evasively just saying that shed got it from the office when she was working there i pressed her and at last she told me that one evening she was just on the point of leaving the office when she remembered that some friends were coming in after dinner at home we should almost certainly play a paper game of some kind and we had run out of suitable paper she hurried up the stairs again back to the office dumped her attache case on the table and opened it hastily snatched up some paper from the pile beside her typewriter and threw it into the case in her hurry she didnt realise how much shed taken and that supply which was supposed to tide us over one evening had actually lasted for nearly four years she must have taken something like half a ream well i went away from my sisters house rather startled before i left i examined the remaining sheets and so far as i could see they were exactly like the one on which the letter was typed even the edges were a little discoloured too i was more than startled i was alarmed because i ought to tell you that it had already occurred to me that of all the ways of going about the search for the person who had sent that letter to sir eustace the one that seemed most hopeful was to look for its writer among the actual employees or ex employees of the firm itself as a matter of fact this discovery of mine had a more disconcerting side still on thinking over the case the idea had struck me that in the two matters of the notepaper and the method itself of the crime it was quite possible that the police and every one else had been putting the cart before the horse it had been taken for granted apparently that the murderer had first of all decided on the method and then set about getting hold of the notepaper to carry it out but isnt it far more feasible that the notepaper should have been already there in the criminals ownership and that it was the chance possession of it which actually suggested the method of the crime in that case of course the likelihood of the notepaper being traced to the murderer would be very small indeed whereas in the other case there is always that possibility had that occurred to you for instance mr president i must admit that it hadnt roger confessed and yet like holmess tricks the possibilitys evident enough now its brought forward i must say it strikes me as being a very sound point bradley psychologically of course agreed miss dammers its perfect thank you murmured mr bradley then youll be able to understand just how disconcerting that discovery of mine was because if there was anything in that point at all anybody who had in his or her possession some old notepaper of masons with slightly discoloured edges immediately became suspect hr r r r mph sir charles cleared his throat forcibly by way of comment the implication was obvious gentlemen dont suspect their own sisters dear dear clucked mr chitterwick more humanly mr bradley went on to pile up the agony and there was another thing which i could not overlook my sister before she went in for her training as a secretary had played with the idea of becoming a hospital nurse she went through a short course in nursing as a young girl and was always thoroughly interested in it she would read not only books on nursing itself but medical books too several times said mr bradley solemnly ive seen her studying my own copy of taylor apparently quite absorbed in it he paused again but this time nobody commented the general feeling was that this was getting really too much of a good thing well i went home and thought it over of course it seemed absurd to put my own sister on the list of suspects and at the very head of it too one doesnt connect ones own circle with the idea of murder the two things dont mix at all yet i couldnt fail to realise that if it had been anybody else in question but my sister i should be feeling quite jubilant over the prospect of solving the case but as things were what was i to do in the end said mr bradley smugly i did what i thought my duty and faced the situation i went back to my sisters house the next day and asked her squarely whether she had ever had any kind of relations with sir eustace pennefather and if so what she looked at me blankly and said that up till the time of the murder she had never heard of the man i believed her i asked her if she could remember what she had been doing on the evening before the murder she looked at me still more blankly and said that she had been in manchester with her husband at that time they had stayed at the peacock hotel and in the evening had been to a cinema where they had seen a film called so far as she could recall fires of fate again i believed her as a matter of routine precaution however i checked her statements later and found them perfectly correct for the time of the posting of the parcel she had an unshakable alibi i felt more relieved than i can say mr bradley spoke in a low voice with pathos and restraint but roger caught his eye as he looked up and there was a mocking glint in it which made the president feel vaguely uneasy the trouble with mr bradley was that one never quite knew with him having drawn a blank with my first ticket then i tabulated the conclusions id formed to date and set about considering the other points in the case it then struck me that the chief inspector from scotland yard had been somewhat reticent about the evidence that night he addressed us so i rang him up and asked him a few questions that had occurred to me from him i learnt that the typewriter was a hamilton no that is the ordinary hamilton model that the hand printed address on the cover was written with a fountain pen almost certainly an onyx fitted with a medium broad nib that the ink was halfields fountain pen ink and that there was nothing to be learned from the wrapping paper or the string that there were no finger prints anywhere we had been told well i suppose i ought not to admit it considering how i earn my living but upon my soul i havent the faintest idea how a professional detective goes about a job of work said mr bradley with candour its easy enough in a book of course because there are a certain number of things which the author wants found out and these he lets his detective discover and no others in real life no doubt it doesnt pan out quite like that anyhow what i did was to copy my own detectives methods and set about the business in as systematic a way as i could that is to say i made a careful list of all the available evidence both as to fact and to character and drew as many deductions as i could from each piece at the same time trying to keep a perfectly open mind as to the identity of the person who was to hatch out from my nest of completed conclusions in other words said mr bradley not without severity i did not decide that lady a or sir somebody b had such a good motive for the crime that she or he must undoubtedly have done it and then twist my evidence to fit this convenient theory hear hear roger felt constrained to approve hear hear echoed in turn both alicia dammers and mr ambrose chitterwick sir charles and mrs fielder flemming glanced at each other and then hastily away again for all the world like two children in a sunday school who have been caught doing quite the wrong thing together dear me murmured mr bradley this is all very exhausting may i have five minutes rest mr president and half a cigarette the president kindly gave mr bradley an interval in which to restore himself chapter xi l have always thought resumed mr bradley restored i have always thought that murders may be divided into two classes closed or open by a closed murder i mean one committed in a certain closed circle of persons such as a house party in which it is known that the murder is limited to membership of that actual group this is by far the commoner form in fiction an open murder i call one in which the criminal is not limited to any particular group but might be almost any one in the whole world this of course is almost invariably what happens in real life the case with which were dealing has this peculiarity that one cant place it quite definitely in either category the police say that its an open murder both our previous speakers here seem to regard it as a closed one its a question of the motive if one agrees with the police that it is the work of some fanatic or criminal lunatic then it certainly is an open murder anybody without an alibi in london that night might have posted the parcel if ones of the opinion that the motive was a personal one connected with sir eustace himself then the murderer is confined to the closed circle of people who have had relations of one sort or another with sir eustace and talking of posting that parcel i must just make a diversion to tell you something really interesting for all i know to the contrary i might have seen the murderer with my own eyes in the very act of posting it as it happened i was passing through southampton street that evening at just about a quarter to nine little did i guess as mr edgar wallace would say that the first act of this tragic drama was possibly being unfolded at that very minute under my unsuspecting nose not even a premonition of disaster caused me to falter in my stride providence was evidently being somewhat close with premonitions that night but if only my sluggish instincts had warned me how much trouble i might have saved us all alas said mr bradley sadly such is life however thats neither here nor there we were discussing closed and open murders i was determined to form no definite opinions either way so to be on the safe side i treated this as an open murder i then had the position that every one in the whole wide world was under suspicion to narrow down the field a little i set to work to build up the one individual who really did it out of the very meagre indications he or she had given us i had the conclusions drawn already from the choice of nitrobenzene which ive explained to you but as a corollary to the good education i added the very significant postscript but not public school or university dont you agree sir charles it simply wouldnt be done public school men have been known to commit murders before now pointed out sir charles somewhat at sea oh granted but not in such an underhand way as this the public school code does stand for something surely even in murder so i am sure any public school man would tell me this isnt a gentlemanly murder at all a public school man if he could ever bring himself to anything so unconventional as murder would use an axe or a revolver or something which would bring him and his victim face to face he would never murder a man behind his back so to speak im quite sure of that then another obvious conclusion is that hes exceptionally neat with his fingers to unwrap those chocolates drain them re fill them plug up the holes with melted chocolate and wrap them up in their silver paper again to look as if theyve never been tampered with i can tell you thats no easy job and all in gloves too remember i thought at first that the beautiful way it was done pointed strongly to a woman however i carried out an experiment and got a dozen or so of my friends to try their hands at it men and women and out of the whole lot i was the only one who made a really good job of it so it wasnt necessarily a woman but manual dexteritys a good point to establish then there was the matter of the exact six minim dose in each chocolate thats very illuminating i think it argues a methodical turn of mind amounting to a real passion for symmetry there are such people they cant bear that the pictures on a wall dont balance each other exactly i know because im rather that way myself symmetry is synonymous with order to my mind i can quite see how the murderer came to fill the chocolates in that way i should probably have done so myself unconsciously then i think we can credit him or her with a creative mind a crime like this isnt done on the spur of the moment its deliberately created bit by bit scene by scene built up exactly as a play is built up dont you agree mrs fielder flemming it wouldnt have occurred to me but it may be true oh yes a lot of thought must have gone to the carrying of it through i dont think we need worry about the plagiarism from other crimes the greatest creative minds arent above adapting the ideas of other people to their own uses i do myself so do you i expect sheringham so do you no doubt miss dammers so do you at times i should imagine mrs fielder flemming be honest now all of you a subdued murmur of honesty acknowledged occasional lapses in this direction of course look how sullivan used to adapt old church music and turn a gregorian chant into a pair of sparkling eyes or something equally unchantlike its permissible well theres all that to help with the portrait of our unknown and lastly there must be present in his or her mental make up the particular cold relentless inhumanity of the poisoner thats all i think but its something isnt it one ought to be able to go a fair way towards recognising our criminal if one ever ran across a person with these varied characteristics oh and theres one other point i mustnt forget the parallel crime im surprised nobodys mentioned this to my mind its a closer parallel than any weve had yet it isnt a well known case but youve all probably heard of it the murder of dr wilson at philadelphia just twenty years ago ill run through it briefly this man wilson received one morning what purported to be a sample bottle of ale sent to him by a well known brewery there was a letter with it written apparently on their official notepaper and the address label had the firms name printed on it wilson drank the beer at lunch and died immediately the stuff was saturated with cyanide of potassium it was soon established that the beer hadnt come from the brewery at all which had sent out no samples it had been delivered through the local express company but all they could say was that it had been sent to them for delivery by a man the printed label and the letter paper had been forged printed specially for the occasion the mystery was never solved the printing press used to print the letter heading and label couldnt be traced though the police visited every printing works in the whole of america the very motive for the murder was never even satisfactorily ascertained a typical open murder the bottle arrived out of the blue and the murderer remained in it you see the close resemblance to this case particularly in the supposed sample as mrs fielder flemming has pointed out its almost too good to be a coincidence our murderer must have had that case in mind with its most successful outcome as a matter of fact there was a possible motive wilson was a notorious abortionist and somebody may have wanted to stop his activities conscience i suppose there are people who have such a thing thats another parallel with this affair you see sir eustace is a notorious evil liver and that goes to support the police view of an anonymous fanatic theres a good deal to be said for that view i think but i must get on with my own exposition well having reached this stage i tabulated my conclusions and drew up a list of conditions which this criminal of ours must fulfil now i should like to point out that these conditions of mine were so many and so varied that if anybody could be found to fit them the chances sir charles would not be a mere million to one but several million to one that he or she must be the guilty person this isnt just haphazard statement its cold mathematical fact i have twelve conditions and the mathematical odds against their all being fulfilled in one person are actually four hundred and seventy nine million one thousand and six hundred to one and that mark you is if all the chances were even ones but theyre not that he should have some knowledge of criminology is at least a ten to one chance that he should be able to get hold of masons notepaper must be more than a hundred to one against well taking it all in all opined mr bradley i should think the real odds must be somewhere about four billion seven hundred and ninety thousand million five hundred and sixteen thousand four hundred and fifty eight to one in other words its a snip does every one agree every one was far too stunned to disagree right then were all of one mind said mr bradley cheerfully so ill read you my list he shuffled the pages of a little pocket book and began to read conditions to be filled by the criminal must have at least an elementary amount of chemical knowledge must have at least an elementary knowledge of criminology must have had a reasonably good education but not public school or university must have possession of or access to masons notepaper must have possession of or access to a hamilton no typewriter must have been in the neighbourhood of southampton street strand during the critical hour on the evening before the murder must be in possession of or had access to an onyx fountain pen fitted with a medium broad nib must be in possession of or had access to harfields fountain pen ink must have something of a creative mind but not above adapting the creations of others must be more than ordinarily neat with the fingers must be a person of methodical habits probably with a strong feeling for symmetry must have the cold inhumanity of the poisoner by the way said mr bradley stowing away his pocket book again you see that ive agreed with you too sir charles that the murderer would never have entrusted the posting of the parcel to another person oh and one other point for purposes of reference if anybody wants to see an onyx pen and fitted with a medium broad nib as well take a look at mine and curiously enough its filled with harfields fountain pen ink too the pen circulated slowly round the table while mr bradley leaning back in his chair surveyed its progress with a fatherly smile and that said mr bradley when the pen had been restored to him is that roger thought he saw the explanation of the glint that had appeared from time to time in mr bradleys eye you mean the problems still to solve the four billion chances were too much for you you couldnt find any one to fit your own conditions well said mr bradley apparently most reluctant all of a sudden if you must know i have found some one who does you have good man who hang it all you know said the coy mr bradley i hardly like to tell you its really too ridiculous a chorus of expostulation cajolement and encouragement was immediately directed at him never had mr bradley found himself so popular youll laugh at me if i do tell you it appeared that everybody would rather suffer the tortures of the inquisition than laugh at mr bradley never can five people less disposed to mirth at mr bradleys expense have been gathered together mr bradley seemed to take heart well its very awkward upon my soul i dont know what to do about it if i can show you that the person i have in mind not only fulfils each of my conditions exactly but also had a certain interest in sending those chocolates to sir eustace have i your assurance mr president that the meeting will give me its serious advice as to what my duty is in the matter good gracious yes at once agreed roger much excited roger had thought that he might be on the verge of solving the problem himself but he was quite sure that he and bradley had not hit upon the same solution and if the fellow really had got some one good lord yes said roger mr bradley looked round the table in a worried way well cant you see who i mean dear me i thought id told you in almost every other sentence nobody had seen whom he meant the only possible person so far as i can see who could ever be expected to fulfil all those twelve conditions said this harassed version of mr bradley dishevelling his carefully flattened hair why dash it not my sister at all but but but me of course there was a stupefied silence d did you say you finally ventured mr chitterwick mr bradley turned gloomy eyes on him obviously im afraid i have more than an elementary knowledge of chemistry i can make nitrobenzene and often have im a criminologist ive had a reasonably good education but not public school or university i had access to masons notepaper i possess a hamilton no typewriter i was in southampton street itself during the critical hour i possess an onyx pen fitted with a medium broad nib and filled with harfields ink i have something of a creative mind but im not above adapting the ideas of other people im far more than ordinarily neat with my fingers im a person of methodical habits with a strong feeling for symmetry and apparently i have the cold inhumanity of the poisoner yes sighed mr bradley theres simply no getting away from it i sent those chocolates to sir eustace i must have done ive proved it conclusively and the extraordinary thing is that i dont remember a single jot about it i suppose i did it when i was thinking about something else ive noticed im getting a little absent minded at times roger was struggling with an inordinate wish to laugh however he managed to ask gravely enough and what do you imagine was your motive bradley mr bradley brightened a little yes that was a difficulty for quite a time i couldnt establish my motive at all i couldnt even connect myself with sir eustace pennefather id heard of him of course as anybody whos ever been to the rainbow must and id gathered he was somewhat savoury but id no grudge against the man he could be as savoury as he liked so far as i cared i dont think id ever even seen him yes the motive was a real stumbling block because of course there must be one what should i have tried to kill him for otherwise and youve found it i think ive managed to ferret out what must be the real cause said mr bradley not without pride after puzzling for a long time i remembered that i had heard myself once say to a friend in a discussion on detective work that the ambition of my life was to commit a murder because i was perfectly certain that i could do so without ever being found out and the excitement i pointed out must be stupendous no gambling game ever invented can come anywhere near it a murderer is really making a magnificent bet with the police i demonstrated with the lives of himself and his victim as the stakes if he gets away with it he wins both if hes caught he loses both for a man like myself who has the misfortune to be extremely bored by the usual type of popular recreation murder should be the hobby par excellence ah roger nodded portentously this conversation when i recalled it pursued mr bradley very seriously seemed to me significant in the extreme i at once went to see my friend and asked him if he remembered it and was prepared to swear that it took place at all he was in fact he was able to add further details more damning still i was so impressed that i took a statement from him amplifying my notion i had gone on to consider how it could best be carried out the obvious thing i had decided was to select some figure of whom the world would be well rid not necessarily a politician and simply murder him at a distance to play the game one should leave a clue or two more or less obscure apparently i left rather more than i intended my friend concluded by saying that i went away from him that evening expressing the firmest intention of carrying out my first murder at the earliest opportunity not only would the practice make such an admirable hobby i told him but the experience would be invaluable to a writer of detective stories such as myself that i think said mr bradley with dignity establishes my motive only too certainly murder for experiment remarked roger a new category most interesting murder for jaded pleasure seekers mr bradley corrected him there is a precedent you know loeb and leopold well there you have it have i proved my case mr president completely so far as i can see i cant detect a flaw in your argument ive been at some pains to make it a good deal more water tight than i ever bother to do in my books you could argue a very nasty case against me in court on those lines couldnt you sir charles well i should want to go into it a little more closely but at first sight bradley i admit that so far as circumstantial evidence is worth i cant see room for very much doubt that you sent those chocolates to sir eustace and if i said here and now that in sober truth i did send them persisted mr bradley i couldnt disbelieve you and yet i didnt but given time im quite prepared to prove to you just as convincingly that the person who really sent them was the archbishop of canterbury or sybil thorndike or mrs robinson smythe of the laurels acacia road upper tooting or the president of the united states or anybody else in this world you like to name so much for proof i built that whole case up against myself out of the one coincidence of my sister having a few sheets of masons notepaper i told you nothing but the truth but i didnt tell you the whole truth artistic proof is like artistic anything else simply a matter of selection if you know what to put in and what to leave out you can prove anything you like quite conclusively i do it in every book i write and no reviewer has ever hauled me over the coals for slipshod argument yet but then said mr bradley modestly i dont suppose any reviewer has ever read one of my books well it was a very ingenious piece of work miss dammers summed up and most instructive thank you murmured mr bradley with gratitude and what it all amounts to mrs fielder flemming delivered a somewhat tart verdict is that you havent the faintest idea who is the real criminal oh i know that of course said mr bradley languidly but i cant prove it so its not much good telling you everybody sat up youve found some one else in spite of the odds to fit those conditions of yours demanded sir charles i suppose she must admitted mr bradley as she did it but unfortunately i havent been able to check them all she mr chitterwick caught him up oh yes it was a woman that was the most obvious thing about the whole case and incidentally one of the things i was careful to leave out just now really i wonder thats never been mentioned before surely if theres anything evident about this affair at all it is that its a womans crime it would never occur to a man to send poisoned chocolates to another man hed send a poisoned sample razor blade or whisky or beer like the unfortunate dr wilsons friend quite obviously its a womans crime i wonder roger said softly mr bradley threw him a sharp glance you dont agree sheringham i only wondered said roger but its a very defendable point impregnable i should have said drawled mr bradley well said miss dammers impatient of these minor matters arent you going to tell us who did it mr bradley mr bradley looked at her quizzically but i said that it wasnt any good as i cant prove it besides theres a small matter of the ladys honour involved are you resuscitating the law of slander to get you out of a difficulty oh dear me no i wouldnt in the least mind giving her away as a murderess its a much more important thing than that she happens to have been sir eustaces mistress at one time you see and theres a code governing that sort of thing ah said mr chitterwick mr bradley turned to him politely you were going to say something no no i was just wondering whether youd been thinking on the same lines as i have thats all you mean the discarded mistress theory well said mr chitterwick uncomfortably yes of course youd hit on that line of research too mr bradleys tone was that of a benevolent headmaster patting a promising pupil on the head its the right one obviously viewing the crime as a whole and in the light of sir eustaces character a discarded mistress radiating jealousy stands out like a beacon in the middle of it thats one of the things i conveniently omitted too from my list of conditions no the criminal must be a woman and touching on artistic proof again both sir charles and mrs fielder flemming practised it didnt they both of them omitted to establish any connection of nitrobenzene with their respective criminals though such a connection is vital to both their cases then you really think jealousy is the motive mr chitterwick suggested im absolutely convinced of it mr bradley assured him but ill tell you something else of which im not by any means convinced and that is that the intended victim really was sir eustace pennefather not the intended victim queried roger very uneasily how do you make that out why ive discovered said mr bradley dissembling his pride that sir eustace had had an engagement for lunch on the day of the murder he seems to have been very secretive about it and it was certainly with a woman and not only with a woman but with a woman in whom sir eustace was more than a little interested i think probably not miss wildman but somebody of whom he was anxious that miss wildman shouldnt know but in my opinion the woman who sent the chocolates knew the appointment was cancelled but the other woman might not have known that my suggestion is that those chocolates were intended not for sir eustace at all but for the senders rival ah breathed mrs fielder flemming this is quite a new idea complained sir charles roger had been hastily conning over the names of sir eustaces various ladies he had been unable to fit one before into the crime and he was unable now yet he did not think that any had escaped him if the woman youre thinking of bradley the sender he said tentatively really was a mistress of sir eustace i dont think you need worry about being too punctilious her name is almost certainly on the lips of the whole rainbow club in that connection if not of every club in london sir eustace is not a reticent man i can assure mr bradley said miss dammers with irony that sir eustaces standard of honour falls a good deal short of his own in this case mr bradley told them unmoved i think not how is that because im quite sure that apart from my unconscious informant and sir eustace and myself there is nobody who knows of the connection at all except the lady of course added mr bradley punctiliously naturally it would not have escaped her then how did you find out demanded miss dammers that mr bradley informed her equably i regret that im not at liberty to say roger stroked his chin could there be another one of whom he had never heard in that case how would this new theory of his continue to stand up your so close parallel falls to the ground then mrs fielder flemming was stating not altogether but if it does ive got another just as good christina edmunds almost the same case with the insanity left out jealousy mania poisoned chocolates what could be better humph the mainstay of your last case i gathered observed sir charles or at any rate the starting point was the choice of nitrobenzene i suppose that and the deductions you drew from it are equally important to this one are we to take it that this lady is an amateur chemist with a copy of taylor on her shelves mr bradley smiled gently that as you rightly point out was the mainstay of my last case sir charles it isnt of this one im afraid my remarks on the choice of poison were rather special pleading i was leading up to a certain person you see and therefore only drew the deductions which suited that particular person however there was a good deal of possible truth in them for all that though i wouldnt rate their probability quite as high as i pretended to do then im quite prepared to believe that nitrobenzene was used simply because its so easy to get hold of but its perfectly true that the stuffs hardly known as a poison at all then you make no use of it in your present case oh yes i do i still think the point that the criminal not so much used it as knew of it to use is a perfectly sound one the reason for that knowledge should be capable of being established i stuck out before for a copy of some such book as taylor as the reason and i still do as it happens this good lady has got a copy of taylor she is a criminologist then mrs fielder flemming pounced mr bradley leaned back in his chair and gazed at the ceiling that i should think is very much open to question frankly im puzzled over the matter of criminology myself i dont see that lady as an ist of any description her function in life is perfectly obvious the one she fulfilled for sir eustace and i shouldnt have thought her capable of any other except to powder her nose rather charmingly and looked extremely decorative but all thats part and parcel of her real raison detre no i dont think she could possibly be a criminologist any more than a canary bird could but she certainly has a smattering of criminology because in her flat theres a whole bookshelf filled with works on the subject shes a personal friend of yours then queried mrs fielder flemming very casually oh no ive only met her once that was when i called at her flat with a brand new copy of a recently published book of popular murders under my arm and represented myself as a traveller for the publisher soliciting orders for the book might i have the pleasure of putting her name down the book had only been out four days but she proudly showed me a copy of it on her shelves already was she interested in criminology then oh yes she simply adored it murder was too fascinating wasnt it conclusive i think she sounds a bit of a fool commented sir charles she looks like a bit of a fool agreed mr bradley she talks like a bit of a fool meeting her at a tea fight i should have said she is a bit of a fool and yet she carried through a really cleverly planned murder so i dont see how she can be a bit of a fool it doesnt occur to you remarked miss dammers that perhaps she never did anything of the sort well no mr bradley had to confess im afraid it doesnt i mean a comparatively recent discarded mistress of sir eustaces who thinks no small champagne of herself and considers murder too fascinating for words well really by the way if you want any confirmatory evidence that she had been one of sir eustaces lady loves i might add that i saw a photograph of him in her flat it was in a frame that had a very wide border the border showed the word your and conveniently cut off the rest not yours notice but your i think its a reasonable assumption that something quite affectionate lies under that discreet border i have it from his own lips that sir eustace changes his mistresses as often as his hats miss dammers said briskly isnt it possible that more than one may have suffered from a jealousy complex but not i think have possessed a copy of taylor as well mr bradley insisted the criminological knowledge factor seems to have taken the place in this case of the nitrobenzene factor in the last meditated mr chitterwick am i right in thinking that quite mr bradley assured him kindly that in my opinion is the really important clue its so emphasised you see we get it from two entirely different angles the choice of poison and the reminiscent features of the case in fact were coming up against it all the time well well muttered mr chitterwick reproving himself as one might who had been coming up against a thing all the time and never even noticed it there was a short silence which mr chitterwick imputed to a general condemnation of his own obtuseness your list of conditions miss dammers resumed the charge you said you hadnt been able to check all of them which does this woman definitely fulfil and which havent you been able to check mr bradley assumed an air of alertness no i dont know whether she has any chemical knowledge no i do know that she has at least an elementary knowledge of criminology no she is almost certain to have had a reasonably good education and i think we may assume that she was never at a public school no i havent been able to connect her with masons notepaper except in so far as she has an account at masons and if that is good enough for sir charles its good enough for me no i havent been able to connect her with a hamilton typewriter but that ought to be quite easy one of her friends is sure to have one no she could have been in the neighbourhood of southampton street she tried to establish an alibi but bungled it badly its full of holes shes supposed to have been in a theatre but she didnt even get there till well past nine no i saw an onyx fountain pen on her bureau no i saw a bottle of harfields fountain pen ink in one of the pigeon holes of the bureau no i shouldnt have said she had a creative mind i shouldnt have said that she had a mind at all but apparently we must give her the benefit of any doubt there is no judging from her face i should say she was very neat with her fingers no if she is a person of methodical habits she must feel it an incriminating point for she certainly disguises it very well no this i think might be amended to must have the poisoners complete lack of imagination thats the lot i see said miss dammers there are gaps there are mr bradley agreed blandly to tell the truth i know this woman must have done it because really you know she must but i cant believe it ah said mrs fielder flemming putting a neat sentence into one word by the way sheringham remarked mr bradley you know the bad lady i do do i said roger apparently coming out of a trance i thought i might look here if i write a name down on a piece of paper do you mind telling me if im right or wrong not in the least replied the equable mr bradley as a matter of fact i was going to suggest something like that myself i think as president you ought to know who i mean in case there is anything in it roger folded his piece of paper in two and tossed it down the table thats the person i suppose youre quite right said mr bradley and you base most of your case on her reasons for interesting herself in criminology you might put it like that conceded mr bradley in spite of himself roger blushed faintly he had the best of reasons for knowing why mrs verreker le mesurer professed such an interest in criminology not to put too fine a point on it the reasons had been almost forced on him then youre absolutely wrong bradley he said without hesitation absolutely you know definitely roger suppressed an involuntary shudder quite definitely you know i never believed she did it said the philosophical mr bradley the poisoned chocolates case chapter xii roger was very busy flitting in taxis hither and thither utterly regardless of what the clocks had to tell him he was trying to get his case completed before the evening his activities might have seemed to that artless criminologist mrs verreker le mesurer not only baffling but pointless on the previous afternoon for instance he had taken his first taxi to the holborn public library and there consulted a work of reference of the most uninspiring description after that he had driven to the offices of messrs weall and wilson the well known firm which exists to protect the trade interests of individuals and supply subscribers with highly confidential information regarding the stability of any business in which it is intended to invest money roger glibly representing himself as a potential investor of large sums had entered his name as a subscriber filled up a number of the special enquiry forms which are headed strictly confidential and not consented to go away until messrs weall and wilson had promised in consideration of certain extra moneys to have the required information in his hands within twenty seven hours he had then bought a newspaper and gone to scotland yard there he sought out moresby moresby he said without preamble i want you to do something important for me can you find me a taximan who took up a fare in piccadilly circus or its neighbourhood at about ten minutes past nine on the night before the bendix murder and deposited same at or near the strand end of southampton street andor another taxi who took up a fare in the strand near southampton street at about a quarter past nine and deposited same in the neighbourhood of piccadilly circus the second is the more likely of the two im not quite sure about the first or one taxi might have been used for the double journey but i doubt that very much do you think you can do this for me we may not get any results after all this time said moresby doubtfully its really important is it quite important well ill try of course seeing its you mr sheringham and i know i can take your word for it that it is important but i wouldnt for any one else thats fine said roger with much heartiness make it pretty urgent will you and you might give me a ring at the albany at about tea time tomorrow if you think youve got hold of my man whats the idea then mr sheringham im trying to break down a rather interesting alibi said roger he went back to his rooms to dine after the meal his head was buzzing far too busily for him to be able to do anything else but take it for a walk restlessly he wandered out of the albany and turned down piccadilly he ambled round the circus thinking hard and paused for a moment out of habit to inspect with unseeing eyes the photographs of the new revue hanging outside the pavilion the next thing he realised was that he must have turned down the haymarket and swung round in a wide circle into jermyn street for he was standing outside the imperial theatre in that fascinating thoroughfare idly watching the last of the audience crowding in glancing at the advertisements of the creaking skull he saw that the terrible thing began at half past eight glancing at his watch he saw that the time was twenty nine minutes past that hour there was an evening to be got through somehow he went inside the night passed somehow too early the next morning in a bleak spot somewhere beyond the bounds of civilisation in short in acton roger found himself parleying with a young woman in the offices of the anglo eastern perfumery company the young woman was entrenched behind a partition just inside the main entrance her only means of communication with the outer world being through a small window fitted with frosted glass this window she would open to address a few curt replies to importunate callers and this window she would close with a bang by way of a hint that the interview in her opinion should now be closed good morning said roger blandly when his third rap had summoned this maiden from the depths of her fastness ive called to travellers tuesday and friday mornings ten to eleven said the maiden surprisingly and closed the window with one of her best bangs thatll teach him to try and do business with a respectable english firm on a thursday morning good gracious me said the bang roger stared blankly at the closed window then it dawned on him that a mistake had been made he rapped again and again at the fourth rap the window flew open as if something had exploded behind it ive told you already snapped the maiden righteously indignant that we only see im not a traveller said roger hastily at least he added with meticulousness thinking of the dreary deserts he had explored before finding this inhospitable oasis at least not a commercial one you dont want to sell anything asked the maiden suspiciously impregnated with all that is best in the go ahead spirit of english business methods she naturally looked with the deepest distrust on anybody who might possibly wish to do such an unbusinesslike thing as sell her firm something nothing roger assured her with the utmost earnestness impressed in his turn with the revolting vulgarity of such a proceeding on these conditions it appeared that the maiden though by no means ready to take him to her bosom was prepared to tolerate him for a few seconds well what do you want then she asked with an air of weariness patiently even nobly borne from her tone it was to be gathered that very few people penetrated as far as that door unless with the discreditable intention of trying to do business with her firm just fancy business im a solicitor roger told her now without truth and im enquiring into the matter of a certain mr joseph lea hardwick who was employed here i regret to say that sorry never heard of the gentleman said the maiden shortly and intimated in her usual way that the interview had lasted quite long enough once more roger got busy with his stick after the seventh application he was rewarded with another view of indignant young english girlhood ive told you already but roger had had about enough of this and now young woman let me tell you something if you refuse to answer my questions let me warn you that you may find yourself in very serious trouble havent you ever heard of contempt of court there are times when some slight juggling with the truth is permissible there are times too when even a shrewd blow with a bludgeon may be excused this time was one of both the maiden though far from cowed was at last impressed well what do you want to know then she asked resignedly this man joseph lea hardwick ive told you ive never heard of him as the gentleman in question had enjoyed an existence of only two or three minutes and that solely in rogers brain his creator was not unprepared for this it is possible that he was known to you under a different name he said darkly the maidens interest was engaged more she looked positively alarmed she spoke shrilly if its divorce let me tell you you cant hang anything on me i never even knew he was married besides it isnt as if there was a cause i mean to say well at least anyhow its a pack of lies i never it isnt divorce roger hastened to stem the tide himself scarcely less alarmed at these quite unmaidenly revelations its its nothing to do with your private life at all its about a man who was employed here oh the late maidens relief turned rapidly into indignation well why couldnt you say so employed here pursued roger firmly in the nitrobenzene department you have a nitrobenzene department havent you not that im aware of im sure roger made the noise that is usually spelt tchah you know perfectly well what i mean the department which handles the nitrobenzene used here you are hardly prepared to deny that nitrobenzene is used here i hope and extensively well and what if it is it has been reported to my firm that this man met his death through insufficient warning having been issued to the employees here about the dangerous nature of this substance i should like what one of our men died i dont believe it i should have been the first to know if its been hushed up roger inserted quickly i should like you to show me a copy of the warning that is hung up in the factory about nitrobenzene well im sorry then but im afraid i cant oblige you do you mean to tell me said roger much shocked that no warning is issued at all to your employees about this most dangerous substance theyre not even told that it is a deadly poison i didnt say that did i of course theyre warned that its poisonous everybody is and theyre most careful about the way its handled im sure it just happens that there isnt a warning hung up and if you want to know any more about it youd better see one of the directors ill thank you said roger speaking the truth at last ive learned all i wanted good morning he retreated jubilantly he retreated to websters the printers in a taxi websters of course are to printing what monte carlo is to the riviera websters practically speaking are printing so where more naturally should roger go if he wanted some new notepaper printed in a very special and particular way as apparently he did to the young woman behind the counter who took him in charge he specified at great length and in the most meticulous detail exactly what he did want the young woman handed him her book of specimen pieces and asked him to see if he could find a style there which would suit him while he looked through it she turned to another customer not to palter with the truth that young woman had been getting a little weary of roger and his wants apparently roger could not find a style to suit him for he closed the book and edged a little along the counter till he was within the territory of the next young woman to her in turn he embarked on the epic of his needs and in turn too she presented him with her book of specimens and asked him to choose one as the book was only another copy of the same edition it is not surprising that roger found himself no further forward once more he edged along the counter and once more he recited his saga to the third and last young woman knowing the game she handed him her book of specimens but this time roger had his reward this book was one of the same edition but it was not an exact copy of course im sure youll have what i want he remarked garrulously as he flicked over the pages because i was recommended here by a friend who is really most particular most particular is that so said the young woman doing her best to appear extremely interested she was a very young woman indeed young enough to study the technique of salesmanship in her spare time and one of the first rules in salesmanship she had learned was to receive a customers remark that it is a fine day with the same eager and respectful admiration of the penetrating powers of his observation as she would accord to a fortune teller who informed her that she would receive a letter from a dark stranger across the water containing an offer of money on her note of hand alone well she said trying hard some people are particular and thats a fact dear me roger seemed much struck do you know i believe ive got my friends photograph on me this very minute isnt that an extraordinary coincidence well i never said the dutiful young woman roger produced the coincidental photograph and handed it across the counter there recognise it the young woman took the photograph and studied it closely so thats your friend well isnt that extraordinary yes of course i recognise it its a small world isnt it about a fortnight ago i think my friend was in here last roger persisted is that right the young woman pondered yes it would be about a fortnight ago i suppose yes just about now this is a line were selling a good deal of just at present roger bought an inordinate quantity of note paper he didnt want in the least out of sheer lightness of heart and because she really was a very nice young woman and it was a shame to take advantage of her then he went back to his rooms for lunch most of the afternoon he spent in trying apparently to buy a second hand typewriter roger was very particular that his typewriter should be a hamilton no when the salesman tried to induce him to consider other makes he refused to look at them saying that he had had the hamilton no so strongly recommended to him by a friend who had bought a second hand one just about three weeks ago perhaps it was at this very shop no they hadnt sold a hamilton no for the last two months how very odd but at one shop they had and that was odder still the obliging salesman looked up the exact date and found that it was just a month ago roger described his friend and the salesman at once agreed that rogers friend and his own customer were one and the same good gracious and now i come to think of it roger cried i actually believe ive got my friends photograph on me at this very minute let me see he rummaged in his pockets and to his great astonishment produced the photograph in question the salesman most obligingly proceeded to identify his customer without hesitation he then went on just as obligingly to sell roger the second hand hamilton no which that enthusiastic detective felt he had not the face to refuse to buy detecting roger was discovering is for the person without official authority to back him a singularly expensive business but like mrs fielder flemming he did not grudge money spent in a good cause he went back to his rooms to tea there was nothing more to be done except await the call from moresby it came sooner than he expected is that you mr sheringham there are fourteen taxi drivers here littering up my office said moresby offensively they all took fares from piccadilly circus to the strand or vice versa at your time what do you want me to do with em kindly keep them till i come chief inspector returned roger with dignity and grabbed his hat he had not expected more than three at the most but he was not going to let moresby know that the interview with the fourteen was brief enough however to each grinning man in turn roger showed the photograph taking some pains to hold it so that moresby could not see it and asked if he could recognise his fare not a single one could moresby dismissed the men with a broad grin thats a pity mr sheringham puts a bit of a spoke in the case youre trying to work up no doubt roger smiled at him in a superior manner on the contrary my dear moresby it just about clinches it it what did you say asked moresby startled out of his grammar what are you up to mr sheringham eh i thought you knew all that arent we being sleuthed well moresby actually looked a shade out of countenance to tell you the truth mr sheringham all your people seemed to be going so far off the lines that i called my men off it didnt seem worth while keeping em on dear dear said roger gently fancy that well its a small world isnt it so what have you been doing mr sheringham youve no objection to telling me that i suppose none in the least moresby your work for you does it interest you to know that ive found out who sent those chocolates to sir eustace moresby eyed him for a moment it certainly does mr sheringham if you really have oh i have yes said roger very nonchalantly even mr bradley himself could not have spoken more so ill give you a report on it as soon as ive got my evidence in order it was an interesting case he added and suppressed a yawn was it now mr sheringham said moresby in a choked voice oh yes in its way but absurdly simple once one had grasped the really essential factor quite ridiculously so ill let you have that report some time so long then and he strolled out one cannot conceal the fact that roger had his annoying moments chapter xiii roger called on himself ladies and gentlemen as the one responsible for this experiment i think i can congratulate myself the three members who have spoken so far have shown an ingenuity of observation and argument which i think could have been called forth by no other agency each was convinced before beginning to speak that he or she had solved the problem and could produce positive proof in support of such solution and each i think is still entitled to say that his or her reading of the puzzle has not yet been definitely disproved even sir charless choice of lady pennefather is perfectly arguable in spite of the positive alibi that miss dammers is able to give to lady pennefather herself sir charles is quite entitled to say that lady pennefather has an accomplice and to adduce in support of that the rather dubious circumstances attending her stay in paris and in this connection i should like to take the opportunity of retracting what i said to bradley last night i said that i knew definitely that the woman he had in mind could not have committed the murder that was a misstatement i didnt know definitely at all i found the idea from what i personally know of her to be quite incredible moreover said roger bravely i have some reason to suspect the origin of her interest in criminology and im pretty sure its quite a different one from that postulated by bradley what i should have said was that her guilt of this crime was a psychological impossibility but so far as facts go one cant prove psychological impossibilities bradley is still perfectly entitled to believe her the criminal and in any case she must certainly remain on the list of suspects i agree with you sheringham you know about the psychological impossibility remarked mr bradley i said as much the trouble is that i consider i proved the case against her but you proved the case against yourself too pointed out mrs fielder flemming sweetly oh yes but that doesnt worry me with its inconsistency that involves no psychological impossibility you see no said mrs fielder flemming perhaps not psychological impossibility contributed sir charles robustly oh you novelists youre all so tied up with freud nowadays that youve lost sight of human nature altogether when i was a young man nobody talked about psychological impossibilities and why because we knew very well that theres no such thing in other words the most improbable person may in certain circumstances do the most unlikely things amplified mrs fielder flemming well i may be old fashioned but im inclined to agree with that constance kent led sir charles lizzie borden mrs fielder flemming covered the entire adelaide bartlett case sir charles brought out the ace of trumps mrs fielder flemming gathered the cards up into a neat pack in my opinion people who talk of psychological impossibilities are treating their subjects as characters in one of their own novels theyre infusing a certain percentage of their own mental make up into them and consequently never see clearly that what they think may be the impossible for themselves may quite well be the possible in somebody else then there is something to be said after all for the detective story merchants axiom of the most unlikely person murmured mr bradley good shall we hear what mr sheringhams got to say about the case now suggested miss dammers roger took the hint i was going on to say how interestingly the experiment had turned out too in that the three people who have already spoken happen each to have hit on a different person for the criminal i by the way am going to suggest another or even if miss dammers and mr chitterwick each agree with one of us that gives us four entirely different possibilities i dont mind confessing that id hoped something like that would happen though i hardly looked for such an excellent result still as bradley has pointed out in his remarks about closed and open murders the possibilities in this case really are almost infinite that of course makes it so much more interesting from our point of view for instance i began my own investigations from the point of view of sir eustaces private life it was there i felt convinced that the clue to the murder was to be found just as bradley did and like him i thought that this clue would be in the form of a discarded mistress jealousy or revenge i was sure would turn out to be the mainspring of the crime lastly like him i was convinced from the very first glance at the business that the crime was the work of a woman the consequence was that i began work entirely from the angle of sir eustaces women i spent a good many not too savoury days collecting data until i was convinced that i had a complete list of all his affairs during the past five years it was not too difficult sir eustace as i said last night is not a reticent man apparently i had not got the full list for mine hadnt included the lady whose name was not mentioned last night and if there was one omission its possible there may be more at any rate it seems that sir eustace to do him justice did have his moments of discretion but now all that is really beside the point what matters is that at first i was certain that the crime was the work not only of a woman but of a woman who had comparatively recently been sir eustaces mistress i have now changed all my opinions in toto oh really moaned mr bradley dont tell me i was wrong all along the line im afraid so said roger trying to keep the triumph out of his voice it is a difficult thing when one has really and truly solved a problem which has baffled so many excellent brains to appear entirely indifferent about it i regret to have to say he went on hoping he appeared humbler than he felt i regret to have to say that i cant claim all credit for this change of view for my own perspicacity to be quite honest it was sheer luck a chance meeting with a silly woman in bond street put me in possession of a piece of information trivial in itself but which immediately altered the whole case for me i saw in a flash that id been working from the beginning on mistaken premises that id been making in fact the particular fundamental mistake which the murderer had intended the police and everybody else to make its a curious business this element of luck in the solution of crime puzzles roger ruminated as it happens i was discussing it with moresby in connection with this very case i pointed out to him the number of impossible problems which scotland yard solves eventually through sheer luck a vital piece of evidence turning up of its own accord so to speak or a piece of information brought in by an angry woman because her husband happened to have given her grounds for jealousy just before the crime that sort of thing is happening all the time the avenging chance i suggested as a title if moresby ever wanted to make a film out of such a story well the avenging chance has worked again by means of that lucky encounter in bond street in one moment of enlightenment it showed me who really had sent those chocolates to sir eustace pennefather well well well mr bradley kindly expressed the feelings of the circle and who was it then queried miss dammers who had an unfortunate lack of dramatic feeling for that matter miss dammers was inclined to plume herself on the fact that she had no sense of construction and that none of her books ever had a plot novelists who use words like values and reflexes and oedipus complex simply wont have anything to do with plots who appeared to you in this interesting revelation mr sheringham oh let me work my story up a little first roger pleaded miss dammers sighed stories as roger as a fellow craftsman ought to have known simply werent done nowadays but then roger was a best seller and anything is possible with a creature like that unconscious of these reflections roger was leaning back in his chair in an easy attitude meditating gently when he began to speak again it was in a more conversational tone than he had used before you know this really was a very remarkable case you and bradley mrs fielder flemming didnt do the criminal justice when you described it as a hotch potch of other cases any ideas of real merit in previous cases may have been borrowed perhaps but as fielding says in tom jones to borrow from the classics even without acknowledgment is quite legitimate for the purposes of an original work and this is an original work it has one feature which not only absolves it from all charge to the contrary but which puts its head and shoulders above all its prototypes its bound to become one of the classical cases itself and but for the merest accident which the criminal for all his ingenuity couldnt possibly have foreseen i think it would have become one of the classical mysteries on the whole im inclined to consider it the most perfectly planned murder ive ever heard of its so exactly right ingenious utterly simple and as near as possible infallible humph not so very infallible as it turned out sheringham eh grunted sir charles roger smiled at him the motives so obvious when you know where to look for it but you didnt know the methods so significant once youve grasped its real essentials but you didnt grasp them the traces are so thinly covered when youve realised just what is covering them but you didnt realise everything was anticipated the soap was left lying about in chunks and we all hurried to stuff our eyes with it no wonder we couldnt see clearly it really was beautifully planned the police the public the press everybody completely taken in it seems almost a pity to have to give the murderer away really mr sheringham remarked mrs fielder flemming youre getting quite lyrical a perfect murder makes me feel lyrical if i was this particular criminal i should have been writing odes to myself for the last fortnight and as it is suggested miss dammers you feel like writing odes to yourself for having solved the thing i do rather roger agreed well ill begin with the evidence as to that i wont say that ive got such a collection of details as bradley was able to amass to prove his first theory but i think youll all agree that ive got quite enough perhaps i cant do better than run through his list of twelve conditions which the murderer must fulfil though as youll see i dont by any means agree with all of them i grant and can prove the first two that the murderer must have at least an elementary knowledge of chemistry and criminology but i disagree with both parts of the third i dont think a good education is really essential and i should certainly not rule out any one with a public school or university education for reasons which ill explain later nor do i agree with the fourth that he or she must have had possession of or access to masons note paper it was an ingenious idea of bradleys that the possession of the notepaper suggested the method of the crime but i think it mistaken a previous case suggested the method chocolates were decided on as the vehicle and masons as being the most important firm of chocolate manufacturers it then became necessary to procure a piece of their notepaper and im in a position to show how this was done the fifth condition i would qualify i dont agree that the criminal must have possession of or access to a hamilton no typewriter but i do agree that such possession must have existed in other words i would put that condition in the past tense remember that we have to deal with a very astute criminal and a very carefully planned crime i thought it most unlikely that such an incriminating piece of evidence as the actual typewriter would be allowed to lie about for anyone to discover much more probably that a machine had been bought specially for the occasion it was clear from the letter that it wasnt a new machine which had been used with the courage of my deduction therefore i spent a whole afternoon making inquiries at secondhand typewriter shops till i ran down the place where it had been bought and proved the buying the shopman was able to identify my murderer from a photograph i had with me and wheres the machine now asked mrs fielder flemming eagerly i expect at the bottom of the thames thats my point this criminal of mine leaves nothing to chance at all with the sixth condition about being near the post office during the critical hour of course i agree my murderer has a mild alibi but it doesnt hold water as to the next two the fountain pen and the ink i havent been able to check them at all and while i agree that their possession would be rather pleasing confirmation i dont attach great importance to them onyx pens are so universal and so is harfields ink that there isnt much argument there either way besides it would be just like my criminal not to own either of them but to have borrowed the pen unobtrusively lastly i agree about the creative mind and the neatness with the fingers and of course with the prisoners peculiar mentality but not with the necessity for methodical habits oh come said mr bradley pained that was rather a sound deduction i thought and it stands to reason too not to my reason roger retorted mr bradley shrugged his shoulders its the notepaper im interested in said sir charles in my opinion thats the point on which the case against any one must hang how do you prove possession of the notepaper sheringham the notepaper said roger was extracted about three weeks ago from one of websters books of sample notepaper headings the erasure would be some private mark of websters the price for instance this style s gd there are three books at websters containing exactly the same samples two of them include a piece of masons paper from the third its missing i can prove contact of my suspect with the book about three weeks ago you can can you sir charles was impressed that sounds pretty conclusive what put you on the idea of the sample books the yellowed edges of the letter roger said not a little pleased with himself i didnt see how a bit of paper that had been kept in a pile could get its edges quite so discoloured as all that so concluded that it must have been an isolated piece then it struck me that walking about london one does see isolated pieces of notepaper stuck on a board in the windows of printing firms but this piece showed no drawing pin holes or any other signs of having been fixed to a board besides it would be difficult to remove it from a board what was the next best thing obviously a sample book such as one usually finds inside the same shops so to the printers of masons notepaper i went and there so to speak my piece wasnt yes muttered sir charles certainly that sounds pretty conclusive he sighed one gathered that he was gazing wistfully in his minds eye at the diminishing figure of lady pennefather and the beautiful case he had built up around her then he brightened this time one had gathered that he had switched his vision to the figure equally diminishing of sir charles wildman and the beautiful case that had been built up around him too so now said roger feeling he could really put it off no longer we come to the fundamental mistake to which i referred just now the trap the murderer laid for us and into which we all so neatly fell everybody sat up roger surveyed them benignly you got very near seeing it bradley last night with your casual suggestion that sir eustace himself might not have been the intended victim after all thats right enough but i go further than that i fell in the trap though did i said mr bradley pained well what is this trap whats the fundamental mistake we all side slipped into why roger brought out in triumph that the plan had miscarried that the wrong person had been killed he got his reward what said every one at once good heavens you dont mean exactly roger crowed that was just the beauty of it the plan had not miscarried it had been brilliantly successful the wrong person had not been killed very much the right person was whats all this positively gaped sir charles how on earth do you make that out mrs bendix was the objective all the time roger went on more soberly thats why the plot was so ingenious every single thing was anticipated it was foreseen that if bendix could be brought naturally into sir eustaces presence when the parcel was being opened the latter would hand the chocolates over to him it was foreseen that the police would look for the criminal among sir eustaces associates and not the dead womans it was probably even foreseen bradley that the crime would be considered the work of a woman whereas really of course chocolates were employed because it was a woman who was the objective well well well said mr bradley then its your theory pursued sir charles that the murderer was an associate of the dead womans and had nothing to do with sir eustace at all he spoke as if not altogether averse from such a theory it is roger confirmed but first let me tell you what finally opened my eyes to the trap the vital piece of information i got in bond street was this that mrs bendix had seen that play the creaking skull before theres no doubt about it she actually went with my informant herself you see the extraordinary significance of course that means that she already knew the answer to that bet she made with her husband about the identity of the villain a little intake of breath testified to a general appreciation of this information oh what a marvellous piece of divine irony miss dammers was exercising her usual faculty of viewing things from the impersonal aspect then she actually brought her own retribution on herself the bet she won virtually killed her yes said roger the irony hadnt failed to strike even my informant the punishment as she pointed out was so much greater than the crime but i dont think roger spoke very gently in a mighty effort to curb his elation i dont think that even now you quite see my point everybody looked inquiringly youve all heard mrs bendix quite minutely described you must all have formed a tolerably close mental picture of her she was a straightforward honest girl making if anything almost too much of a fetish of straight dealing and playing the game does the making of a bet to which she already knew the answer fit into that picture or does it not ah nodded mr bradley oh very pretty just so it is a psychological impossibility it really is you know sir charles one simply cant see her doing such a thing in fun or out of it and i gather that fun wasnt her strong suit by any means ergo concluded roger briskly she didnt ergo that bet was never made ergo there never was such a bet ergo bendix was lying ergo bendix wanted to get hold of those chocolates for some reason other than he stated and the chocolates being what they were there was only one other reason thats my case chapter xiv when the excitement that greeted this revolutionary reading of the case had died down roger went on to defend his theory in more detail it is something of a shock of course to find oneself contemplating bendix as the very cunning murderer of his own wife but really once one has been able to rid ones mind of all prejudice i dont see how the conclusion can possibly be avoided every item of evidence however minute goes to support it but the motive ejaculated mrs fielder flemming motive good heavens hed motive enough in the first place he was frankly no not frankly secretly tired of her remember what we were told of his character hed sown his wild oats but apparently he hadnt finished sowing them because his name has been mentioned in connection with more than one woman even since his marriage usually in the good old fashioned way actresses so bendix wasnt such a solemn stick by any means he liked his fun and his wife i should imagine was just about the last person in the world to sympathise with such feelings not that he hadnt liked her well enough when he married her quite possibly though it was her money he was after all the time but she must have bored him dreadfully very soon and really said roger impartially i think one can hardly blame him there any woman however charming otherwise is bound to bore a normal man if she does nothing but prate continually about honour and duty and playing the game and that i have on good authority was mrs bendixs habit just look at the menage in this new light the wife would never overlook the smallest peccadillo every tiny lapse would be thrown up at him for years everything she did would be right and everything he did wrong her sanctimonious righteousness would be forever being contrasted with his vileness she might even work herself into the state of those half mad creatures who spend the whole of their married lives reviling their husbands for having been attracted by other women before they even met the girl it was their misfortune to marry dont think im trying to blacken mrs bendix im just showing you how intolerable life with her might have been but thats only the incidental motive the real trouble was that she was too close with her money and that too i know for a fact thats where she sentenced herself to death he wanted it or some of it badly and she wouldnt part one of the first things i did was to consult a directory of directors and make a list of the firms hes interested in with a view to getting a confidential report on their financial condition the report reached me just before i left my rooms it told me exactly what i expected that every single one of those firms is rocky some only a little but some within sight of a crash they all need money to save them its obvious isnt it hes run through all his own money and he had to get more i found time to run down to somerset house and again it was as i expected her will was entirely in his favour the really important point is that he isnt a good business man at all hes a rotten one and half a million well oh yes theres motive enough motive allowed said mr bradley and the nitrobenzene you said i think that bendix has some knowledge of chemistry roger laughed you remind me of a wagner opera bradley the nitrobenzene motif crops up regularly from you whenever a possible criminal is mentioned however i think i can satisfy even you in this instance nitrobenzene as you know is used in perfumery in the list of bendixs businesses is the anglo eastern perfumery company i made a special and dreadful journey out to acton for the express purpose of finding out whether the anglo eastern company used nitrobenzene at all and if so whether its poisonous qualities were thoroughly recognised the answer to both questions was in the affirmative so there can be no doubt that bendix is thoroughly acquainted with the stuff he might easily enough have got his supply from the factory but im inclined to doubt that i think hed be cleverer than that he probably made the stuff himself if the process is as easy as bradley told us because i happen to know that he was on the modern side at selchester which presupposes at any rate an elementary knowledge of chemistry do you pass that bradley pass friend nitrobenzene conceded mr bradley roger drummed thoughtfully on the table with his finger tips it was a well planned affair wasnt it he meditated and so extremely easy to reconstruct bendix must have thought hed provided against every possible contingency and so he very nearly had it was just that little bit of unlucky grit that gets into the smooth machinery of so many clever crimes he didnt know that his wife had seen the play before hed decided on the mild alibi of his presence at the theatre you see just in case suspicion should ever impossibly arise and no doubt he stressed his desire to see the play and take her with him not to spoil his pleasure she would have unselfishly concealed from him the fact that she had seen the play before and didnt much want to see it again that unselfishness let him down because its inconceivable that she would have turned it to her own advantage to win the bet he pretends to have made with her he left the theatre of course during the first interval and hurried as far as he dare go in the ten minutes at his disposal to post the parcel i sat through the dreadful thing myself last night just to see when the intervals came the first one fits excellently id hoped he might have taken a taxi one way as time was short but if he did no driver of such taxis as did make a similar journey that evening can identify him or possibly the right driver hasnt come forward yet i got scotland yard to look into that point for me but it really fits much better with the cleverness hes shown all through that he should have gone by bus or underground taxis hed know are traceable but if so hed run it very fine indeed and i shouldnt be surprised if he got back to his box a few minutes late the police may be able to establish that it seems to me observed mr bradley that we made something of a mistake in turning the man down from membership here we thought his criminology wasnt up to standard didnt we well well but we could hardly be expected to know that he was a practical criminologist rather than a mere theoretical one roger smiled it was a mistake though it would have been pleasant to include a practical criminologist among our members i must confess that i thought at one time that we did said mrs fielder flemming making her peace sir charles she added unnecessarily i apologise without reserve sir charles inclined his head courteously please dont refer to it madam and in any event the experience for me was an interesting one i may have been misled by the case i quoted said mrs fielder flemming rather wistfully it was a strangely close parallel it was the first parallel that occurred to me too roger agreed i studied the molineux case quite closely hoping to get a pointer from it but now if i were asked for a parallel i should reply with the caylyle harris case you remember the young medical student who sent a pill containing morphine to the girl helen potts to whom it turned out that he had been secretly married for a year he was by way of being a profligate and a general young rotter too a great novel as you know has been founded on the case so why not a great crime too then why mr sheringham miss dammers wanted to know do you think that mr bendix took the risk of not destroying the forged letter and the wrapper when he had the chance he very carefully didnt do so roger replied promptly because the forged letter and the wrapper had been calculated not only to divert suspicion from himself but actually to point away from him to somebody else an employee of masons for instance or an anonymous lunatic which is exactly what they did but wouldnt it be a great risk to send poisoned chocolates like that to sir eustace suggested mr chitterwick diffidently i mean sir eustace might have been ill the next morning or not offered to hand them over at all suppose he had given them to somebody else instead of bendix roger proceeded to give mr chitterwick cause for his diffidence he was feeling something of a personal pride in bendix by this time and it distressed him to hear a great man thus maligned oh really you must give my man credit for being what he is hes not a bungler you know it wouldnt have had any serious results if sir eustace had been ill that morning or eaten the chocolates himself or if theyd been stolen in transit and consumed by the postmans favourite daughter or any other unlikely contingency come mr chitterwick you dont imagine hed send the poisoned ones through the post do you of course not hed send harmless ones and exchange them for the others on the way home dash it all he wouldnt go out of his way to present opportunities to chance oh i see murmured mr chitterwick properly subdued were dealing with a very great criminal went on roger rather less severely that can be seen at every point take the arrival at the club just for example that most unusual early arrival well he doesnt wait outside and follow his unconscious accomplice in you see not a bit of it sir eustace is chosen because hes known to get there so punctually at half past ten every morning takes a pride in it boasts of it goes out of his way to keep up the good old custom so bendix arrives at ten thirty five and there things are it had puzzled me at the beginning of the case by the way to see why the chocolates had been sent to sir eustace at his club at all instead of to his rooms now its obvious well i wasnt so far out with my list of conditions mr bradley consoled himself but why dont you agree with my rather subtle point about the murderer not being a public school or university man sheringham just because bendix happens to have been at selchester and oxford no because id make the still more subtle point that where the code of a public school and university might influence a murderer in the way he murdered another man it wouldnt have much effect when a woman is to be the victim i agree that if bendix had been wanting to dispose of sir eustace he would probably have put him out of the world in a nice straightforward manly way but one doesnt use nice straightforward manly ways in ones dealings with women if it comes to hitting them on the head with a bludgeon or anything in that nature poison i fancy would be quite in order and theres very little suffering with a large dose of nitrobenzene unconsciousness soon intervenes yes admitted mr bradley that is rather too subtle a point for one of my unpsychological attributes i think i dealt with most of your other conditions as regards the methodical habits which you deduced from the meticulous doses of poison in each chocolate my point of course is that the doses were exactly equal in order that bendix could take any two of the chocolates and be sure of having got the right amount of nitrobenzene into his system to produce the symptoms he wanted and not enough to run any serious risk that dosing of himself with the poison really was a master stroke and its so natural that a man shouldnt have taken so many chocolates as a woman he exaggerated his symptoms considerably no doubt but the effect on everybody was tremendous we must remember you see that weve only got his word for the conversation in the drawing room over the eating of the chocolates just as weve only got his word for it that there ever was a bet at all most of that conversation certainly took place however bendix is far too great an artist not to make all possible use of the truth in his lying but of course he wouldnt have left her that afternoon till hed seen her take or somehow made her take at least six of the chocolates which hed know made up more than a lethal dose that was another advantage in having the stuff in those exact six minim quantities in fact mr bradley summed up our uncle bendix is a great man he really is said roger quite solemnly youve no doubt at all that he is the criminal queried miss dammers none at all said roger astonished um said miss dammers why have you um said miss dammers the conversation then lapsed well said mr bradley lets all tell sheringham how wrong he is shall we mrs fielder flemming looked tense im afraid she said in a hushed voice that he is only too right but mr bradley refused to be impressed oh i think i can find a hole or two to pick at you seem to attach a good deal of importance to the motive sheringham dont you exaggerate one doesnt poison a wife ones tired of one leaves her and really i find some difficulty in believing that bendix should have been so set on getting hold of more money to pour down the drainpipe of his businesses as to commit murder for it and that mrs bendix should have been so close as to refuse to come to her husbands help if he really was badly pressed then i think you fail to estimate the characters of both of them roger told him they were both obstinate as the devil it was mrs bendix not her husband who realised that his businesses were a drainpipe i could give you a list a yard long of murders that have been committed with far less motive than bendix had motive allowed again then now you remember that mrs bendix had had a lunch appointment for the day of her death which was cancelled didnt bendix know of that because if he did would he have chosen a day for the delivery of the chocolates when he knew his wife wouldnt be at home for lunch to receive them just the point i had thought of putting to mr sheringham myself remarked miss dammers roger looked puzzled it seems to me a most unimportant point if it comes to that why should he necessarily want to give the chocolates to his wife at lunch time for two reasons responded mr bradley glibly firstly because he would naturally want to put them to their right purpose as soon as he possibly could and secondly because his wife being the only person who can contradict this story of the bet he would obviously want her silenced as soon as practicable youre quibbling roger smiled and i refuse to be drawn for that matter i dont see why bendix should have known of his wifes lunch appointment at all they were constantly lunching out both of them and i dont suppose they took any particular care to inform each other beforehand humph said mr bradley and stroked his chin mr chitterwick ventured to raise his recently crushed head you really base your whole case on the bet mr sheringham dont you and the psychological deduction i drew from the story of it yes i do entirely so that if the bet could be proved after all to have been made you would have no case left why exclaimed roger in some alarm have you any independent evidence that the bet was made oh no oh dear me no nothing of the sort i was merely thinking that if any one did want to disprove your case as bradley suggested it is the bet on which he would have to concentrate you mean quibbling about the motive and the lunch appointment and such minor matters is altogether beside the point suggested mr bradley amiably oh i quite agree but i was only trying to test his case you know not disprove it and for why because i think its the right one the mystery of the poisoned chocolates so far as im concerned is at an end thank you bradley said mr sheringham so three cheers for our sleuth like president continued mr bradley with great heartiness coupled with the name of graham reynard bendix for the fine run hes given us hip hip and you say youve definitely proved the purchase of the typewriter and the contact of mr bendix with the sample book at websters mr sheringham remarked alicia dammers who had apparently been pursuing a train of thought of her own i do miss dammers said roger not without complacence would you give me the name of the typewriter shop of course roger tore a page from his notebook and copied out the name and address thank you and can you give me a description of the girl at websters who identified the photograph of mr bendix roger looked at her a little uneasily she gazed back with her usual calm serenity rogers uneasiness grew he gave her as good a description of websters young woman as he could recall miss dammers thanked him imperturbably well what are we going to do about it all persisted mr bradley who seemed to have adopted the role of showman for his president shall we send a delegation to scotland yard consisting of sheringham and myself to break the news to them that their troubles are over you are assuming that everybody agrees with mr sheringham of course isnt it customary to put this sort of question to a vote suggested miss dammers coolly carried unanimously quoted mr bradley yes do lets have the correct procedure well then sheringham moves that this meeting do accept his solution of the poisoned chocolates mystery as the right one and send a delegation of himself and mr bradley to scotland yard to talk pretty severely to the police i second the motion those in favour mrs fielder flemming mrs fielder flemming endeavoured to conceal her disapproval of mr bradley in her approval of mr bradleys suggestion i certainly think that mr sheringham has proved his case she said stiffly sir charles i agree said sir charles in stern tones equally disapproving of mr bradleys frivolity chitterwick i agree too was it rogers fancy or did mr chitterwick hesitate just a moment before he spoke as if troubled by some mental reservation which he did not care to put into words roger decided that it was his fancy and miss dammers concluded mr bradley miss dammers looked calmly round the table i dont agree at all i think mr sheringhams exposition was exceedingly ingenious and altogether worthy of his reputation at the same time i think it quite wrong tomorrow i hope to be able to prove to you who really committed this crime the circle gaped at her respectfully roger wondering whether his ears had not really been playing tricks with him found that his tongue too utterly refused to work an inarticulate sound oozed from him mr bradley was the first to recover himself carried non unanimously mr president i think this is a precedent does anybody know what happens when a resolution is not carried unanimously in the temporary disability of the president miss dammers took it upon herself to decide the meeting stands adjourned i think she said and adjourned the meeting found itself chapter xv roger arrived at the circles meeting room the next evening even more agog than usual in his heart of hearts he could not believe that miss dammers would ever be able to destroy his case against bendix or even dangerously shake it but in any event what she had to say could not fail to be of absorbing interest even without its animadversions of his own solution roger had been looking forward to miss dammerss exposition more than to that of any one else alicia dammers was so very much a reflection of the age had she been born fifty years ago it is difficult to see how she could have gone on existing it was impossible that she could have become the woman novelist of that time a strange creature with white cotton gloves an intense manner and passionate not to say hysterical yearnings towards a romance from which her appearance unfortunately debarred her miss dammerss gloves like her clothes were exquisite and cotton could not have touched her since she was ten tensity was for her the depth of bad form and if she knew how to yearn she certainly kept it to herself passion and purple one gathered miss dammers found quite unnecessary to herself if interesting phenomena in lesser mortals from the caterpillar in cotton gloves the woman novelist has progressed through the stage of cook like coccoondom at which mrs fielder flemming had stuck to the detached and serious butterfly not infrequently beautiful as well as pensive whose decorative pictures the illustrated weeklies are nowadays delighted to publish butterflies with calm foreheads just faintly wrinkled in analytical thought ironical cynical butterflies surgeon butterflies thronging the mental dissecting rooms passionless butterflies flitting gracefully from one brightly coloured complex to another and sometimes completely humourless and then distressingly boring butterflies whose gathered pollen seems to have become a trifle mud coloured to meet miss dammers and look at her classical oval face with its delicately small features and big grey eyes to glance approvingly over her tall beautifully dressed figure nobody whose imagination was still popular would ever have set her down as a novelist at all and that in miss dammerss opinion coupled with the ability to write good books was exactly what a properly minded modern authoress should hope to achieve no one had ever been brave enough to ask miss dammers how she could hope successfully to analyse in others emotions which she had never experienced in herself probably because the plain fact confronted the enquirer that she both could and did most successfully we listened last night began miss dammers at five minutes past nine on the following evening to an exceedingly able exposition of a no less interesting theory of this crime mr sheringhams methods if i may say so were a model to all of us beginning with the deductive he followed this as far as it would take him which was actually to the person of the criminal he then relied on the inductive to prove his case in this way he was able to make the best possible use of each method that this ingenious mixture should have been based on a fallacy and therefore never had any chance of leading mr sheringham to the right solution is rather a piece of bad luck than his fault roger who still could not believe that he had not reached the truth smiled dubiously mr sheringhams reading of the crime continued miss dammers in her clear level tones must have seemed to some of us novel in the extreme to me however it was perhaps more interesting than novel for it began from the same starting point as the theory on which i myself have been working namely that the crime had not failed in its objective roger pricked up his ears as mr chitterwick pointed out mr sheringhams whole case rested on the bet between mr and mrs bendix from mr bendixs story of that bet he draws the psychological deduction that the bet never existed at all that is clever but it is the wrong deduction mr sheringham is too lenient in his interpretation of feminine psychology i began i think i may say with the bet too but the deduction i drew from it knowing my sister women perhaps a little more intimately than mr sheringham could was that mrs bendix was not quite so honourable as she was painted by herself i thought of that of course roger expostulated but i discarded it on purely logical grounds theres nothing in mrs bendixs life to show that she wasnt honest and everything to show that she was and when there exists no evidence at all for the making of the bet beyond bendixs bare word oh but there does miss dammers took him up ive been spending most of today in establishing that point i knew i should never really be able to shake you till i could definitely prove that there was a bet let me put you out of your agony at once mr sheringham ive overwhelming evidence that the bet was made you have said roger disconcerted certainly it was a point you really should have verified yourself you know chided miss dammers gently considering its importance to your case well i have two witnesses mrs bendix mentioned the bet to her maid when she went up to her bedroom to lie down actually saying that the violent indigestion from which she thought herself to be suffering was a judgment on her for having made it the second witness is a friend of my own who knows the bendixes she saw mrs bendix sitting alone in her box during the second interval and went in to speak to her in the course of the conversation mrs bendix remarked that she and her husband had a bet on the identity of the villain mentioning the character in the play whom she herself fancied but mrs bendix did not tell my friend that she had seen the play before oh said roger now quite crestfallen miss dammers dealt with him as tenderly as possible there were only those two deductions to be made from that bet and by bad luck you chose the wrong one but how did you know said roger coming to the surface for the third time that mrs bendix had seen the play before i only found that out myself a couple of days ago and by the merest accident oh ive known that from the beginning said miss dammers carelessly i suppose mrs verreker le mesurer told you i dont know her personally but i know people who do i didnt interrupt you last night when you were talking about the amazing chance of this piece of knowledge reaching you if i had i should have pointed out that the agency by which anything known to mrs verreker le mesurer might become known to her friends too isnt chance at all but certainty i see said roger and sank for the third and final time but as he did so he remembered one piece of information which mrs verreker le mesurer had succeeded not wholly as it seemed but very nearly so in withholding from her friends and catching mr bradleys ribald eye knew that his thought was shared so even miss dammers was not quite infallible in her psychology we then resumed that lady somewhat didactically have mr bendix displaced from his temporary role of villain and back again in his old part of second victim she paused for a moment but without sir eustace returning to the cast in his original star part of intended victim of the piece amplified mr bradley miss dammers rightly ignored him now here i think mr sheringham will find my case as interesting as i found his last night for though we differ so vitally in some essentials we agree remarkably in others and one of the points on which we agree is that the intended victim certainly was killed what alicia exclaimed mrs fielder flemming you think too that the plot was directed against mrs bendix from the beginning i have no doubt of it but to prove my contention i must demolish yet another of mr sheringhams conclusions you made the point mr sheringham that half past ten in the morning was a most unusual time for mr bendix to arrive at his club and therefore highly significant that is perfectly true unfortunately you attached the wrong significance to it his arrival at that hour doesnt necessarily argue a guilty intention as you assumed it escaped you that if mrs bendix was the intended victim and mr bendix himself not her murderer his presence at the club at that convenient time might have been secured by the real murderer in any case i think mr sheringham might have given mr bendix the benefit of the doubt in so far as to ask him if he had any explanation of his own to offer as i did you asked bendix himself how it had happened that he arrived at the club at half past ten that morning mr chitterwick said in awed tones this was certainly the way real detecting should be done unfortunately his own diffidence seemed to have prevented mr chitterwick from doing any real detecting at all certainly agreed miss dammers briskly i rang him up and put the point to him from what i gathered not even the police had thought to put it before and though he answered it in a way i quite expected it was clear that he saw no significance in his own answer mr bendix told me that he had gone there to receive a telephone message but why not have had the message telephoned to his home you will ask exactly so did i the reason was that it was not the sort of message one cares about receiving at home i must admit that i pressed mr bendix about this message and as he had no idea of the importance of my questions he must have considered my taste more than questionable however i couldnt help that in the end i got him to admit that on the previous afternoon he had been rung up at his office by a miss vera delorme who plays a small part in heels up at the regency theatre he had only met her once or twice but was not averse from doing so again she asked him if he were doing anything important the next morning to which he replied that he was not could he take her out to a quiet little lunch somewhere he would be delighted but she was not quite sure yet whether she was free she would ring him up the next morning between ten thirty and eleven oclock at the rainbow club five pairs of brows were knitted i dont see any significance in that either finally plunged mrs fielder flemming no said miss dammers but if miss delorme straightly denies having ever rung mr bendix up at all five pairs of brows unravelled themselves oh said mrs fielder flemming of course that was the first thing i verified said miss dammers coolly mr chitterwick sighed yes undoubtedly this was real detecting then your murderer had an accomplice miss dammers sir charles suggested he had two retorted miss dammers both unwitting ah yes you mean bendix and the woman who telephoned well miss dammers looked in her unexcited way round the circle of faces isnt it obvious apparently it was not at all obvious at any rate it must be obvious why miss delorme was chosen as the telephonist because mr bendix hardly knew her and would certainly not be able to recognise her voice on the telephone and as for the real speaker well really miss dammers looked her opinion of such obtuseness mrs bendix squeaked mrs fielder flemming catching sight of a triangle of course mrs bendix carefully primed by somebody about her husbands minor misdemeanours the somebody being the murderer of course nodded mrs fielder flemming a friend of mrs bendixs then at least amended mrs fielder flemming in some confusion remembering that real friends seldom murder each other she thought of him as a friend dear me this is getting very interesting alicia miss dammers gave a small ironical smile yes its a very intimate little affair after all this murder tightly closed in fact mr bradley but im getting on rather too fast i had better complete the destruction of mr sheringhams case before i build up my own roger groaned faintly and looked up at the hard white ceiling it reminded him of miss dammers and he looked down again really mr sheringham your faith in human nature is altogether too great you know miss dammers mocked him without mercy whatever anybody chooses to tell you you believe a confirmatory witness never seems necessary to you im sure that if some one had come to your rooms and told you hed seen the shah of persia injecting the nitrobenzene into those chocolates you would have believed him unhesitatingly are you hinting that somebody hasnt told me the truth groaned the unhappy roger ill do more than hint it ill prove it when you told us last night that the man in the typewriter shop had positively identified mr bendix as the purchaser of a second hand no hamilton i was astounded i took a note of the shops address this morning first thing i went there i taxed the man roundly with having told you a lie he admitted it grinning so far as he could make out all you wanted was a good hamilton no and he had a good hamilton no to sell he saw nothing wrong in leading you to suppose that his was the shop where your friend had bought his own good hamilton no because he had quite as good a one as any other shop could have and if it eased your mind that he should recognise your friend from his photograph well said miss dammers drily he was quite prepared to ease it as many times as you had photographs to produce i see said roger and his thoughts dwelt on the eight pounds he had handed over to that sympathetic mind easing shopman in return for a hamilton no he didnt want as for the girl in websters continued miss dammers implacably she was just as ready to admit that perhaps she might have made a mistake in recognising that friend of the gentleman who called in yesterday about some notepaper but really the gentleman had seemed so anxious she should that it would have seemed quite a pity to disappoint him like and if it came to that she couldnt see the harm in it not even now she couldnt miss dammerss imitation of websters young woman was most amusing roger did not laugh heartily im sorry if i seem to be rubbing it in mr sheringham said miss dammers not at all said roger but its essential to my own case you see yes i quite see that said roger then that evidence is disposed of i dont think you really had any other did you i dont think so said roger you will see miss dammers resumed over rogers corpse that i am following the fashion of withholding the criminals name now that it has come to my turn to speak i am realising the advantages of this but really i cant help fearing that you will all have guessed it by the time i come to my denouement to me at any rate the murderers identity seems quite absurdly obvious before i disclose it officially however i should like to deal with a few of the other points not actual evidence raised by mr sheringham in his argument mr sheringham built up a very ingenious case it was so very ingenious that he had to insist more than once on the perfect planning that had gone to its construction and the true greatness of the criminal mind that had evolved it i dont agree said miss dammers crisply my case is much simpler it was planned with cunning but not with perfection it relied almost entirely upon luck that is to say upon one vital piece of evidence remaining undiscovered and finally the mind that evolved it is not great in any way but it is a mind which dealing with matters outside its usual orbit would certainly be imitative that brings me to a point of mr bradleys i agree with him to the extent that i think a certain acquaintance with criminological history is postulated but not when he argues that it is the work of a creative mind in my opinion the chief feature of the crime is its servile imitation of certain of its predecessors i deduced from it in fact the type of mind which is possessed of no originality of its own is intensely conservative because without the wit to recognise the progress of change is obstinate dogmatic and practical and lacks entirely any sense of spiritual values as one who am inclined to suffer myself from something of an aversion from matter i sensed my exact antithesis behind the whole atmosphere of this case everybody looked suitably impressed as for mr chitterwick he could only grasp before these detailed deductions from a mere atmosphere with another point of mr sheringhams i have already inferred that i agree that chocolates were used as the vehicle of the poison because they were meant to reach a woman and here i might add that i am sure no harm was intended to mr bendix himself we know that mr bendix did not care for chocolates and it is a reasonable assumption that the murderer knew it too he never expected that mr bendix would eat any himself it is curious how often mr sheringham hits the mark with small shafts while missing it with the chief one he was quite right about the notepaper being extracted from that sample book at websters im bound to admit that the possession of the piece of notepaper had worried me considerably i was at a complete loss there then mr sheringham very handily presented us with his explanation and i have been able today to destroy his application of it to his own theory and incorporate it in my own the attendant who pretended out of innocent politeness to recognise the photograph mr sheringham showed her was able to recognise in earnest the one i produced and not only recognise it said miss dammers with the first sign of complacence she had yet shown but identify the original of it actually by name ah nodded mrs fielder flemming much excited mr sheringham made a few other small points which i thought it advisable today to blunt miss dammers went on with a return to her impersonal manner because most of the small firms in which mr bendix figures on the board of directors are not in a flourishing state mr sheringham deduced not only that mr bendix was a bad business man with which i am inclined to agree but that he was desperately in need of money once again mr sheringham failed to verify his deduction and once am he must pay the penalty in finding himself utterly wrong the most elementary channels of enquiry would have brought mr sheringham the information that only a very small proportion of mr bendixs money is invested in these concerns which are really a wealthy mans toys by far the greater part is still where his father left it when he died in government stock and safe industrial concerns so large that even mr bendix could never aspire to a seat on the board and from what i know of him mr bendix is quite a big enough man to recognise that he is not the business genius his father was and has no intention of spending on his toys more than i he can comfortably afford the real motive mr sheringham gave him for his wifes death therefore completely disappears roger bowed his head for ever afterwards he felt would genuine criminologists point the finger of contempt at him as the man who failed to verify his own deductions oh shameful future as for the subsidiary motive i attach less importance to that but on the whole i am inclined to agree with mr sheringham i think mrs bendix must have become a dreadful bore to her husband who after all was a normal man with a normal mans reactions and scale of values i should be inclined to think that she morally drove him into the arms of his actresses in search of a little light companionship im not saying he wasnt deeply in love with her when he married her no doubt he was and hed have had a naturally deep respect for her then but its an unfortunate marriage observed the cynical miss dammers in which the respect outstays its usefulness a man wants a piece of humanity in his marriage bed not an object of deep respect but im bound to say that if mrs bendix did bore her husband before the end he was gentleman enough not to show it the marriage was generally considered an ideal one miss dammers paused for a moment to sip at the glass of water in front of her lastly mr sheringham made the point that the letter and wrapper were not destroyed because the murderer thought they would not only not harm him but definitely help him with that too i agree but i do not draw the same deduction from it that mr sheringham did i should have said that this entirely confirms my theory that the murder is the work of a second rate mind because a first rate mind would never consent to the survival of any clue which could be easily destroyed however helpful it might be expected to prove because he would know how often such clues deliberately left to mislead have actually led to the criminals undoing and i would draw the subsidiary deduction that the wrapper and letter were not expected to be just generally helpful but that there was some definite piece of misleading information contained in them i think i know what that piece of information was that is all the reference i have to make to mr sheringhams case roger lifted his bowed head and miss dammers sipped again at her water with regard to this matter of the respect mr bendix had for his wife mr chitterwick hazarded isnt there something of an anomaly there miss dammers because i understood you to say at the very beginning that the deduction you had drawn from that bet was that mrs bendix was not quite so worthy of respect as we had all imagined didnt that deduction stand the test then it did mr chitterwick and there is no anomaly where a man doesnt suspect he will respect said mrs fielder flemming swiftly before her alicia could think of it ah the horrid sepulchre under the nice white paint remarked mr bradley who didnt approve of that sort of thing even from distinguished dramatists now were getting down to it is there a sepulchre miss dammers there is miss dammers agreed without emotion and now as you say mr bradley were getting down to it oh mr chitterwick positively bounced on his chair if the letter and wrapper could have been destroyed by the murderer and bendix wasnt the murderer and i suppose the porter neednt be considered oh i see i wondered when somebody would said miss dammers chapter xvi from the very beginning of this case miss dammers proceeded imperturbable as ever i was of the opinion that the greatest clue the criminal had left us was one of which he would have been totally unconscious the unmistakable indications of his own character taking the facts as i found them and not assuming others as mr sheringham did to justify his own reading of the murderers exceptional mentality she looked challengely towards roger did i assume any facts that i couldnt substantiate roger felt himself compelled to answer her look certainly you did you assumed for instance that the typewriter on which the letter was written is now at the bottom of the thames the plain fact that it is not once more bears out my own interpretation taking the established facts as i found them then i was able without difficulty to form the mental picture of the murderer that i have already sketched out for you but i was careful not to look for somebody who would resemble my picture and then build up a case against him i simply hung the picture up in my mind so to speak in order to compare with it any individual toward whom suspicion might seem to point now after i had cleared up mr bendixs reason for arriving at his club that morning at such an unusual hour there remained so far as i could see only one obscure point apparently of no importance to which nobodys attention seemed to have been directed i mean the engagement sir eustace had had that day for lunch which must subsequently have been cancelled i dont know how mr bradley discovered this but i am quite ready to say how i did it was from that same useful valet who gave mrs fielder flemming so much interesting information i must admit in this connection that i have advantages over the other members of this circle so far as investigations regarding sir eustace were concerned for not only did i know sir eustace himself so well but i knew his valet too and you can imagine that if mrs fielder flemming was able to extract so much from him with the aid of money alone i myself backed not only by money but by the advantage of a previous acquaintance was in a position to obtain still more in any case it was not long before the man casually mentioned that four days before the crime sir eustace had told him to ring up fellowss hotel in jermyn street and reserved a private room for lunch time on the day on which the murder subsequently took place that was the obscure point which i thought it worth while to clear up if i could with whom was sir eustace going to lunch that day obviously a woman but which of his many women the valet could give me no information so far as he knew sir eustace actually had not got any women at the moment so intent was he upon the pursuit of miss wildman her hand and her fortune was it miss wildman herself then i was very soon able to establish that it wasnt does it strike you that there is a reminiscent ring about this cancelled lunch appointment on the day of the crime it didnt occur to me for a long time but of course there is mrs bendix had a lunch engagement for that day too which was cancelled for some reason unknown on the previous afternoon mrs bendix breathed mrs fielder flemming here was a juicy triangle miss dammers smiled faintly yes i wont keep you on the tenterhooks mabel from what sir charles told us i knew that mrs bendix and sir eustace at any rate were not total strangers and in the end i managed to connect them mrs bendix was to have lunched with sir eustace in a private room at the somewhat notorious fellows hotel to discuss her husbands shortcomings of course suggested mrs fielder flemming more charitably than her hopes possibly among other things said miss dammers nonchalantly but the chief reason no doubt was because she was his mistress miss dammers dropped this bombshell among the company with as little emotion as if she had remarked that mrs bendix was wearing a jade green taffeta frock for the occasion can you can you substantiate that statement asked sir charles the first to recover himself miss dammers just raised her fine eyebrows but of course i shall make no statements that i cant substantiate mrs bendix had been in the habit of lunching at least twice a week with sir eustace and occasionally dining too at fellows hotel always in the same room they took considerable precautions and used to arrive not only at the hotel but in the room itself quite independently of each other outside the room they were never seen together but the waiter who attended them has signed a declaration for me that he recognised mrs bendix from the photographs published after her death as the woman who used to come there with sir eustace pennefather he signed a declaration for you eh mused mr bradley you must find detecting an expensive hobby too miss dammers one can afford one expensive hobby mr bradley but just because she lunched with him mrs fielder flemming was once more speaking with the voice of charity i mean it doesnt necessarily mean that she was his mistress does it not of course that i think any the less of her if she was she added hastily remembering the official attitude communicating with the room in which they had their meals is a bedroom replied miss dammers in a desiccated tone of voice invariably after they had gone the waiter informed me he found the bedclothes disarranged and the bed showing signs of recent use i imagine that would be accepted as clear enough evidence of adultery sir charles oh undoubtedly undoubtedly rumbled sir charles in high embarrassment sir charles was always exceedingly embarrassed when women used words like adultery and sexual perversions and even mistress to him out of business hours sir charles was regrettably old fashioned sir eustace of course added miss dammers in her detached way had nothing to fear from the kings proctor she took another sip of water while the others tried to accustom themselves to this new light on the case and the surprising avenues it illuminated miss dammers proceeded to illuminate them still further with powerful beams from her psychological searchlight they must have made a curious couple those two their widely differing scales of values the contrast of their respective reactions to the business that brought them together the possibility that not even in a common passion could their minds establish any point of real contact i want you to examine the psychology of the situation as closely as you can because the murder was derived directly from it what can have induced mrs bendix in the first place to become that mans mistress i dont know i wont be so trite as to say i cant imagine because i can imagine all sorts of ways in which it may have happened there is a curious mental stimulus to a good but stupid woman in a bad mans business if she has a touch of the reformer in her as most good women have she soon becomes obsessed with the futile desire to save him from himself and in seven cases out of ten her first step in doing so is to descend to his level not that she considers herself at first to be descending at all a good woman invariably suffers for quite a long time from the delusion that whatever she does her own particular brand of goodness cannot become smirched she may share a reprobates bed with him because she knows that only through her body at first can she hope to influence him until contact is established through the body with the soul and he may be led into better ways than a habit of going to bed in the daytime but the initial sharing doesnt reflect on her own purity in the least it is a hackneyed observation but i must insist on it once more good women have the most astonishing powers of self deception i do consider mrs bendix as a good woman before she met sir eustace her trouble was that she thought herself so much better than she was her constant references to honour and playing the game which mr sheringham quoted show that she was infatuated with her own goodness and so of course was sir eustace he had probably never enjoyed the complaisance of a really good woman before the seduction of her would have amused him enormously he must have had to listen to hour after hours talk about honour and reform and spirituality but he would have borne it patiently enough for the exquisite revenge on which he had set his heart the first two or three visits to fellowss hotel must have delighted him but after that it became less and less amusing mrs bendix would discover that perhaps her own goodness wasnt standing quite so firm under the strain as she had imagined she would have begun to bore him with her self reproaches bore him dreadfully he continued to meet her there first because a woman to his type is always a woman and afterwards because she gave him no choice i can see exactly what must inevitably have happened mrs bendix begins to get thoroughly morbid about her own wickedness and quite loses sight of her initial zeal for reform they use the bed now because there happens to be a bed there and it would be a pity to waste it but she has destroyed the pleasure of both her one cry now is that she must put herself right with her own conscience either by running away with sir eustace on the spot or more probably by telling her husband arranging for divorce and marrying sir eustace as soon as both divorces are through in any case although she almost loathes him by now nothing else can be contemplated but that the rest of her life must be spent with sir eustace and his with her how well i know that type of mind naturally to sir eustace who is working hard to retrieve his fortunes by a rich marriage this scheme has small appeal he begins by cursing himself for having seduced the damned woman at all and goes on to curse still more the damned woman for having been seduced and the more pressing she becomes the more he hates her then mrs bendix must have brought matters to a head she has heard about the wildman girl affair that must be stopped at once she tells sir eustace that if he doesnt break it off himself she will take steps to break it off for him sir eustace sees the whole thing coming out his own appearance in a second divorce court and all hopes of miss wildman and her fortune gone for ever something has got to be done about it but what can be done nothing short of murder will stop the damned womans tongue well its high time somebody murdered her anyhow now im on rather less sure ground but the assumptions seems to me sound enough and i can produce a reasonable amount of proof to support them sir eustace decided to get rid of the woman once and for all he thinks it over carefully remembers to have read about a case several cases in some criminological book each of which just failed through some small mistake combine them eradicate the small mistake from each and so long as his relations with mrs bendix are not known there is no possibility of being found out that may seem a long guess but heres my proof when i was studying him i gave sir eustace every chance of plying his blandishments on me one of his methods is to profess a deep interest in everything that interests the woman naturally therefore he discovered a profound if hitherto latent interest in criminology he borrowed several of my books and certainly read them among the ones he borrowed is a book of american poisoning cases in it is an account of every single case that has been mentioned as a parallel by members of this circle about six weeks ago when i got in one evening my maid told me that sir eustace who hadnt been near my flat for months had called he waited for a time in the sitting room and then went shortly after the murder having also been struck by the similarity between this and one or two of those american cases i went to the bookstall in my sitting room to look them up the book was not there nor mr bradley was my copy of taylor but i saw them both in sir eustaces rooms the day i had that long conversation with his valet miss dammers paused for comment mr bradley supplied it then the man deserves whats coming to him he drawled i told you this murder wasnt the work of a highly intelligent mind said miss dammers well now to complete my reconstruction sir eustace decides to rid himself of his encumbrance and arranges what he thinks a perfectly safe way of doing so the nitrobenzene which appears to worry mr bradley so much seems to me a very simple matter sir eustace has decided upon chocolates as the vehicle and chocolate liqueurs at that he is searching then for some poison with a flavour which will mingle well enough with that of the liqueurs he is bound to come across oil of bitter almonds very soon in that connection actually used as it is in confectionery and from that to nitrobenzene which is more common easier to get hold of and practically untraceable is an obvious step he arranges to meet mrs bendix for lunch intending to make a present to her then of the chocolates which are to come to him that morning by post a perfectly natural thing to do he will already have the porters evidence of the innocent way in which he acquired them at the last minute he sees the obvious flaw in this plan if he gives mrs bendix the chocolates in person and especially at lunch at fellowss hotel his intimacy with her must be disclosed he hastily racks his brains and finds a very much better plan getting hold of mrs bendix he tells her some story of her husband and vera delorme in characteristic fashion mrs bendix loses sight of the beam in her own eye on learning of this mote in her husbands and at once falls in with sir eustaces suggestion that she shall ring mr bendix up disguising her voice and pretending to be vera delorme and just find out for herself whether or not he will jump at the chance of an intimate little lunch for the following day and tell him youll ring him up at the rainbow tomorrow morning between ten thirty and eleven sir eustace adds carelessly if he goes to the rainbow youll be able to know for certain that hes dancing attendance on her at any hour of the day and so she does the presence of bendix is therefore assured for the next morning at half past ten who in the world is to say that he was not there by purest chance when sir eustace was exclaiming over that parcel as for the bet which clinched the handing over of the chocolates i cannot believe that this was just a stroke of luck for sir eustace that seems too good to be true somehow im sure though i wont attempt to show her sir eustace arranged for that bet in advance and if he did the fact in no way destroys my initial deduction from it that mrs bendix was not so honest as she pretended for whether it was arranged or whether it wasnt the plain fact is left that it is dishonest to make a bet to which you know the answer lastly if i am to follow the fashion and cite a parallel case i decide unhesitatingly for john tawell who administered prussic acid in a bottle of beer to his mistress sarah hart when he was tired of her the circle looked at her admiringly at last it seemed they really had got to the bottom of the business sir charles voiced the general feeling if youve got any solid evidence to support this theory miss dammers he implied that in that case the rope was as good as round sir eustaces thick red neck meaning that the evidence ive given already isnt solid enough for the legal mind enquired miss dammers equably psy psychological reconstructions wouldnt carry very much weight with a jury sir charles took refuge behind the jury in question ive connected sir eustace with the piece of masons notepaper miss dammers pointed out im afraid on that alone sir eustace would get the benefit of the doubt sir charles was evidently deprecating the psychological obtuseness of that jury of his ive shown a tremendous motive and ive connected him with a book of similar cases and a book of poisons yes oh quite so but what i mean is have you any real evidence to connect sir eustace quite definitely with the letter the chocolates or the wrapper he has an onyx pen and the inkpot in his library used to be filled with harfields ink miss dammers smiled ive no doubt it is still he was supposed to have been at the rainbow the whole evening before the murder but ive ascertained that there is a gap of half an hour between nine oclock and nine thirty during which nobody saw him he left the dining room at nine and a waiter brought him a whisky and soda in the lounge at half past in the interim nobody knows where he was he wasnt in the lounge where was he the porter swears he did not see him go out or come in again but there is a back way which he could have used if he wanted to be unnoticed as of course he did i asked him myself as if by way of a joke and he said that he had gone up to the library after dinner to look up a reference in a book of big game hunting could he mention the names of any other members in the library he said there werent any there never were hed never seen a member in the library all the time he belonged to the club i thanked him and rang off in other words he says he was in the library because he knows there would be no other member there to prove he wasnt what he really did during that half hour of course was to slip out the back way hurry down to the strand to post the parcel slip in again run up to the library to make sure nobody was there and then go down to the lounge and order his whisky and soda to prove his presence there later isnt that more feasible than your version of mr bendix mr sheringham i must admit that its no less so roger had to agree then you havent any solid evidence at all lamented sir charles nothing that would really impress a jury yes i have said miss dammers quietly ive been saving it up till the end because i wanted to prove my case without it but this is absolutely and finally conclusive will everybody examine these please miss dammers produced from her bag a brown paper covered parcel unwrapping it she brought to light a photograph and a quarto sheet of paper which looked like a typed letter the photograph she explained i obtained it from chief inspector moresby the other day but without telling him the specific purpose for which i wanted it it is of the forged letter actual size i should like everybody to compare it with this typed copy of the letter will you look at them first mr sheringham and then pass them round notice particularly the slightly crooked ss and the chipped capital h in dead silence roger pored over the two he examined them for a full two minutes which seemed to the others more like two hours and then passed them on to sir charles on his right there isnt the slightest doubt that those two were done on the same machine he said soberly miss dammers showed neither less nor more emotion than she had displayed throughout her voice carried exactly the same impersonal inflection she might have been announcing her discovery of a match between two pieces of dress material from her level tone it could never have been guessed that a mans neck depended on her words no less than on the rope that was to hang him you will find the machine in sir eustaces rooms she said even mr bradley was moved then as i said he deserves all thats coming to him he drawled with a quite impossible nonchalance and even attempted a yawn dear me what a distressing bungler sir charles passed on the evidence miss dammers he said impressively you have rendered a very great service to society i congratulate you thank you sir charles replied miss dammers matter of factly but it was mr sheringhams idea you know mr sheringham intoned sir charles sowed better than he knew roger who had hoped to add another feather to his cap by solving the mystery himself smiled in a somewhat sickly way mrs fielder flemming improved the occasion we have made history she said with fitting solemnity when the whole police force of a nation had failed a woman has uncovered the dark mystery alicia this is a red letter day not only for you not only for this circle but for woman thank you mabel responded miss dammers how very nice of you to say so the evidence passed slowly round the table and returned to miss dammers she handed it on to roger mr sheringham i think you had better take charge of these as president i leave the matter in your hands you know as much as i do as you may imagine to inform the police officially myself would be extremely distasteful i should like my name kept out of any communication you make to them entirely roger was rubbing his chin i think that can be done i could just hand these things over to him with the information where the machine is and let scotland yard work the case up themselves these and the motive with the evidence of the porter at fellowss hotel of which i shall have to tell moresby are the only things that will really interest the police i think humph i suppose id better see moresby to night will you come with me sir charles it would add weight certainly certainly sir charles agreed with alacrity everybody looked and felt very serious i suppose mr chitterwick dropped shyly into all this solemnity i suppose you couldnt put it off for twenty four hours could you roger looked his surprise but why well you know mr chitterwick wriggled with diffidence well i havent spoken yet you know five pairs of eyes fastened on him in astonishment mr chitterwick blushed warmly of course no of course roger was trying to be as tactful as he could and well that is to say you want to speak of course i have a theory said mr chitterwick modestly i i dont want to speak no but i have a theory yes yes said roger and looked helplessly at sir charles sir charles marched to the rescue im sure we shall all be most interested to hear mr chitterwicks theory he pronounced most interested but why not let us have it now mr chitterwick it isnt quite complete said mr chitterwick unhappy but persistent i should like another twenty four hours to clear up one or two points sir charles had an inspiration of course of course we must meet tomorrow and listen to mr chitterwicks theory of course in the meantime sheringham and i will just call in at scotland yard and id much rather you didnt said mr chitterwick now in the deeps of misery really i would again roger looked helplessly at sir charles this time sir charles looked helplessly back well i suppose another twenty four hours wouldnt make much difference said roger with reluctance after all this time not very much difference pleaded mr chitterwick well not very much difference certainly agreed sir charles frankly puzzled then have i your word mr president persisted mr chitterwick very mournfully if you put it like that said roger rather coldly the meeting then broke up somewhat bewildered chapter xvii it was quite evident that as he had said mr chitterwick did not want to speak he looked appealingly round the circle of faces the next evening when roger asked him to do so but the faces remained decidedly unsympathetic mr chitterwick expressed the faces plainly was being a silly old woman mr chitterwick cleared his throat nervously two or three times and took the plunge mr president ladies and gentlemen i quite realise what you must be thinking and i must plead for leniency i can only say in excuse of what you must consider my perversity that convincing though miss dammerss clever exposition was and definite as her proofs appeared we have listened to so many apparently convincing solutions of this mystery and been confronted with so many seemingly definite proofs that i could not help feeling that perhaps even miss dammerss theory might not prove on reflection to be not quite so strong as one would at first think mr chitterwick having surmounted this tall obstacle blinked rapidly but was unable to recall the next sentence he had prepared so carefully he jumped it and went on a little as the one to whom has fallen the task both a privilege and a responsibility of speaking last you may not consider it out of place if i take the liberty of summing up the various conclusions that have been reached here so different in both their methods and results not to waste time however in going over old ground i have prepared a little chart which may show more clearly the various contrasting theories parallels and suggested criminals perhaps members would care to pass it round mr chitterwicks chart solver motive angle of view salient feature method of proof parallel case criminal sir charles wildman gain cui bono notepaper inductive marie lefarge

deductive and inductive carlyle harris bendix miss dammers elimination psychology of all participants criminals character psychological deduction tawell sir eustace pennefather police conviction or lust of killing general material clues routine horwood unknown fanatic or lunatic with much hesitation mr chitterwick produced the chart on which he had spent so much careful thought and offered it to mr bradley on his right mr bradley received it graciously and even condescended to lay it on the table between himself and miss dammers and examine it mr chitterwick looked artlessly gratified you will see said mr chitterwick with a shade more confidence that practically speaking no two members have agreed on any one single matter of importance the divergence of opinion and method is really remarkable and in spite of such variations each member has felt confident that his or her solution was the right one this chart more than any words of mine could emphasises not only the extreme openness as mr bradley would say of the case before us but illustrates another of mr bradleys observations too that is how surprisingly easy it is to prove anything one may desire by a process either of conscious or of unwitting selection miss dammers i think suggested mr chitterwick may perhaps find that chart especially interesting i am not myself a student of psychology but even to me it was striking to notice how the solution of each member reflected if i may say so that particular members own trend of thought and character sir charles for instance whose training has naturally led him to realise the importance of the material will not mind if i point out that the angle from which he viewed the problem was the very material one of cui bono while the equally material evidence of the notepaper formed for him its salient feature at the other end of the scale miss dammers herself regards the case almost entirely from a psychological view point and takes as its salient feature the character as unconsciously revealed of the criminal between these two other members have paid attention to psychological and material evidence in varying proportions then again the methods of building up the case against a suspected person have been widely different some of us have relied almost entirely on inductive methods some almost wholly on deductive while some like mr sheringham have blended the two in short the task our president set us has proved a most instructive lesson in comparative detection mr chitterwick cleared his throat smiled nervously and continued there is another chart which i might have made and which i think would have been no less illuminating than this one it is a chart of the singularly different deductions drawn by different members from the undisputed facts in the case mr bradley might have found particular interest in this possible chart as a writer of detective stories for i have often noticed apologised mr chitterwick to the writers of detective stories en masse that in books of that kind it is frequently assumed that any given fact can admit of only one single deduction and that invariably the right one nobody else is capable of drawing any deductions at all but the authors favourite detective and the ones he draws are invariably right miss dammers mentioned something of the kind one evening herself with her illustration of the two bottles of ink as an example of what really happens therefore i should like to cite the sheet of masons notepaper in this case from that single piece of paper the following deductions have at one time or another been drawn that the criminal was an employee or ex employee of mason sons that the criminal was a customer of mason sons that the criminal was a printer or had access to a printing press that the criminal was a lawyer acting on behalf of mason sons that the criminal was a relative of an ex employee of mason sons that the criminal was a would be customer of websters the printers there have been plenty of other deductions of course from that sheet of paper such as that the chance possession of it suggested the whole method of the crime but i am only calling attention to the ones which were to point directly to the criminals identity there are no less than six of them you see and all mutually contradictory ill write a book for you mr chitterwick promised mr bradley in which the detective shall draw six contradictory deductions from each fact hell probably end up by arresting seventy two different people for the murder and committing suicide because he finds afterwards that he must have done it himself ill dedicate the book to you yes do beamed mr chitterwick for really it wouldnt be far from what weve had in this case for example i only called attention to the notepaper besides that there were the poison the typewriter the postmark the exactness of the dose oh many more facts and from each one of them not much less than half a dozen different deductions have been drawn in fact mr chitterwick summed up it was as much as anything the different deductions drawn by different members that proved their different cases on second thoughts decided mr bradley my detectives in future will be the kind that dont draw any deductions at all besides that will be so much easier for me so with these few remarks on the solutions we have already heard continued mr chitterwick which i hope members will pardon me i will hurry on to my explanation of why i asked mr sheringham so urgently last evening not to go to scotland yard at once five faces expressed silent agreement that it was about time mr chitterwick was heard on that point mr chitterwick appeared to be conscious of the thoughts behind the faces for his manner became a little flurried i must first deal very briefly with the case against sir eustace pennefather as miss dammers gave it us last night without belittling her presentation of it in any way at all i must just point out that her two chief reasons for fixing the guilt upon him seemed to me to be firstly that he was the type of person whom she had already decided the criminal must be and secondly that he had been conducting an intrigue with mrs bendix and certainly would have seemed to have some cause for wishing her out of the way if miss dammerss own view of the progress of that intrigue was the correct one but the typewriter mr chitterwick cried mrs fielder flemming loyal to her sex mr chitterwick started oh yes the typewriter im coming to that but before i reach it i should like to mention two other points which miss dammers would have us believe are important material evidence against sir eustace as opposed to the psychological that he should be in the habit of buying masons liqueur chocolates for his his female friends hardly seems to me even significant if every one who is in the habit of buying masons liqueur chocolates is to be suspect then london must be full of suspects and surely even so unoriginal a murderer as sir eustace would seem to be would have taken the elementary precaution of choosing some vehicle for the poison which is not generally associated with his name instead of one that is and if i may venture the opinion sir eustace is not quite such a dunderhead as miss dammers would seem to think the second point is that the girl in websters should have recognised and even identified sir eustace from his photograph that also doesnt appear to me if miss dammers doesnt mind my saying so nearly as significant as she would have us believe i have ascertained said mr chitterwick not without pride that sir eustace pennefather buys his notepaper at websters and has done so for years he was in there about a month ago to order a fresh supply it would be surprising considering that he has a title if the girl who served him had not remembered him it cannot be considered significant said mr chitterwick quite firmly that she does apart from the typewriter then and perhaps the copies of the criminological books miss dammerss case has no real evidence to support it at all for the matter of the broken alibi i am afraid must be held to be neither here nor there i dont wish to be unfair said mr chitterwick carefully but i think i am justified in saying that miss dammerss case against sir eustace rests entirely and solely upon the evidence of the typewriter he gazed round anxiously for possible objections one came promptly but you cant possibly get round that exclaimed mrs fielder flemming impatiently mr chitterwick looked a trifle distressed is get round quite the right expression im not trying wilfully or maliciously to pick holes in miss dammerss case just for amusement you must really believe that please think that i am actuated only by a desire to bring this crime home to its real perpetrator and with that end alone in view i can certainly suggest an explanation of the typewriter evidence which excludes the guilt of sir eustace mr chitterwick looked so unhappy at what he conceived to be mrs fielder flemmings insinuation that he was merely wasting the circles time that roger spoke him kindly you can he said gently as one encourages ones daughter on drawing a cow which if not much like a cow is certainly unlike any other animal on earth thats very interesting mr chitterwick how do you explain it then mr chitterwick responding to treatment shone with pride dear me you cant see it really nobody sees it it seemed that nobody saw it and yet the possibility of such a thing has been before me right from the beginning of the case crowed the now triumphant mr chitterwick well well he arranged his glasses on his nose and beamed round the circle his round red face positively aglow well what is the explanation mr chitterwick queried miss dammers when it seemed that mr chitterwick was going to continue beaming in silence for ever oh oh yes of course why to put it one way miss dammers that you were wrong and mr sheringham was right in your respective estimates of the criminals ability that there was in fact an extremely able and ingenious mind behind this murder and that one of the ways in which this ingenuity was shown was to arrange the evidence in such a way that if any one were to be suspected it would be sir eustace that the evidence of the typewriter in a word and of the criminological books was as i believe the technical word is rigged mr chitterwick resumed his beam everybody sat up with what might have been a concerted jerk in a flash the tide of feeling towards mr chitterwick had turned the man had got something to say after all there actually was an idea behind that untimely request of the previous evening mr bradley rose to the occasion and he quite forgot to speak quite so patronisingly as usual i say dam good chitterwick but can you substantiate that oh yes i think so said mr chitterwick basking in the rays of appreciation that were being shone on him youll be telling us next you know who did it roger smiled mr chitterwick smiled back oh i know that what exclaimed five voices in chorus i know that of course said mr chitterwick modestly youve practically told me that yourselves coming last of all you see my task was comparatively simple all i had to do was to sort out the true from the false in everybody elses statements and well there was the truth the rest of the circle looked their surprise at having told mr chitterwick the truth without knowing it themselves mr chitterwicks face took on a meditative aspect perhaps i may confess now that when our president first propounded his idea to us i was filled with dismay i had had no practical experience of detecting i was quite at a loss as to how to set about it and i had no theory of the case at all i could not even see a starting point the week flew by so far as i was concerned and left me exactly where i had been at its beginning on the evening sir charles spoke he convinced me completely the next evening for a short time mrs fielder flemming convinced me too mr bradley did not altogether convince me that he had committed the murder himself but if he had named any one else then i should have been convinced as it was he convinced me that his his discarded mistress theory said mr chitterwick bravely must be the correct one that indeed was the only idea i had had at all that the crime might be the work of one of sir eustaces hm discarded mistresses but the next evening mr sheringham convinced me just as definitely that mr bendix was the murderer it was only last night during miss dammerss exposition that i at last began to realise the truth then i was the only one who didnt convince you mr chitterwick miss dammers smiled im afraid apologised mr chitterwick that is so he mused for a moment it is really remarkable quite remarkable how near in some way or other everybody got to the truth of this affair not a single person failed to bring out at least one important fact or make at least one important deduction correctly fortunately when i realised that the solutions were going to differ so widely i made copious notes of the preceding ones and kept them up to date each evening as soon as i got home i thus had a complete record of the productions of all these brains so much superior to my own no no murmured mr bradley last night i sat up very late poring over these notes separating the true from the false it might perhaps interest members to hear my conclusions in this respect mr chitterwick put forward the suggestion with the utmost diffidence everybody assured mr chitterwick that they would be only too gratified to hear where they had stumbled inadvertently on the truth chapter xviii mr chitterwick consulted a page of his notes for a moment he looked a little distressed sir charles he began er sir charles it was plain that mr chitterwick was finding difficulty in discovering any point at all on which sir charles had been right and he was a kindly man he brightened oh yes of course sir charles was the first to point out the important fact that there had been an erasure on the piece of notepaper used for the forged letter that was er very helpful then he was right too when he put forward the suggestion that sir eustaces impending divorce was really the mainspring of the whole tragedy though i am afraid mr chitterwick felt compelled to add that the inference he drew was not the correct one he was quite right in feeling that the criminal in such a clever plot would take steps to arrange an alibi and that there was in fact an alibi in the case that would have to be circumvented but then again it was not lady pennefathers mrs fielder flemming continued mr chitterwick was quite right to insist that the murder was the work of somebody with a knowledge of criminology that was a very clever inference and i am glad beamed mr chitterwick to be able to assure her that it was perfectly correct she contributed another important piece of information too just as vital to the real story underlying this tragedy as to her own case namely that sir eustace was not in love with miss wildman at all but was hoping to marry her simply for her money had that not been the case said mr chitterwick shaking his head i fear i very much fear that it would have been miss wildman who met her death instead of mrs bendix good god muttered sir charles and it is perhaps as great a tribute as mr chitterwick was ever to receive that the kc accepted this startling news without question that clinches it muttered mr bradley to mrs fielder flemming discarded mistress mr chitterwick turned to him as for you bradley its astonishing how near you came to the truth amazing mr chitterwick registered amazement even in your first case against yourself so many of your conclusions were perfectly right the final result of your deductions from the nitrobenzene for instance the fact that the criminal must be neat fingered and of a methodical and creative mind even what appeared to me at the time just a trifle far fetched that a copy of taylor would be found on the criminals shelves then beyond the fact that no must be qualified to must have had an opportunity of secretly obtaining a sheet of masons notepaper all twelve of your conditions were quite right with the exception of which does not admit of an alibi and and about the onyx pen and harfields ink mr sheringham was right in that matter with his rather more subtle point of the criminals probable unobtrusive borrowing of the pen and ink which is exactly what happened of course with regard to the typewriter as for your second case well mr chitterwick seemed to be without words to express his admiration of mr bradleys second case you reached to the truth in almost every particular you saw that it was a womans crime you deduced the outraged feminine feelings underlying the whole affair you staked your whole case on the criminals knowledge of criminology it was really most penetrating in fact said mr bradley carefully concealing his gratification i did everything possible except find the murderess well that is so of course deprecated mr chitterwick somehow conveying the impression that after all finding the murderess was a very minor matter compared with mr bradleys powers of penetration and then we come to mr sheringham dont implored roger leave him out oh but your reconstruction was very clever mr chitterwick assured him with great earnestness you put a new aspect on the whole affair you know by your suggestion that it was the right victim who was killed after all well it seems that i erred in good company roger said tritely with a glance at miss dammers but you didnt err corrected mr chitterwick oh roger showed his surprise then it was all aimed against mrs bendix mr chitterwick looked confused havent i told you about that im afraid im doing this in a very muddle headed way yes it is partially true to say that the plot was aimed against mrs bendix but the real position i think is that it was aimed against mrs bendix and sir eustace jointly you came very near the truth mr sheringham except that you substituted a jealous husband for a jealous rival very near indeed and of course you were entirely right in your point that the method was not suggested by the chance possession of the notepaper or anything like that but by previous cases im glad i was entirely right over something murmured roger and miss dammers bowed mr chitterwick was most helpful most helpful although not convincing supplemented that lady drily although im afraid i did not find her altogether convincing agreed mr chitterwick with an apologetic air but it was really the theory she gave us that at last showed me the truth for she also put yet another aspect on the crime with her information regarding the hm the affair between mrs bendix and sir eustace and that really said mr chitterwick with another little bow to the informant was the foundation stone of the whole business i didnt see how it could fail to be said miss dammers but i still maintain that my deductions from it are the correct ones perhaps if i may just put my own forward hesitated mr chitterwick apparently somewhat dashed miss dammers accorded a somewhat tart permission mr chitterwick collected himself oh yes i should have said that miss dammers was quite right in one important particular her assumption that it was not so much the affair between mrs bendix and sir eustace that was at the bottom of the crime as mrs bendixs character that really brought about her own death miss dammers i should imagine was perfectly right in her tracing out of the intrigue and her imaginative insight into mrs bendixs reactions i think that is the word mr chitterwick inquired diffidently of authority mrs bendixs reactions to it but not i consider in her deductions regarding sir eustaces growing boredom sir eustace i am led to believe was less inclined to be bored than to share the ladys distress for the real point which happened to escape miss dammers is that sir eustace was quite infatuated with mrs bendix far more so than she with him that pronounced mr chitterwick is one of the determining factors in this tragedy everybody pinned the factor down the circles attitude towards mr chitterwick by this time was one of intelligent expectation probably no one really thought that he had found the right solution and miss dammerss stock had not been appreciably lowered but certainly it seemed that the man had at any rate got something to offer miss dammers proceeded the object of their attention was right in another point she made too namely that the inspiration of this murder or perhaps i should say the method of it certainly came from that book of poisoning cases she mentioned of which her own copy is at present in sir eustaces rooms planted there added mr chitterwick much shocked by the murderess and another useful fact she established that mr bendix had been lured to the rainbow club that morning but it was not mrs bendix who telephoned to him on the previous afternoon nor was he sent there for the particular purpose of receiving the chocolates from sir eustace the fact that the lunch appointment had been cancelled was altogether outside the criminals knowledge mr bendix was sent there to be a witness to sir eustace receiving the parcel that was all the intention was of course that mr bendix should have sir eustace so connected in his mind with the chocolates that if suspicion should ever arise against any definite person that of mr bendix would be directed before long to sir eustace himself for the fact of his wifes intrigue would be bound to come to his knowledge as indeed i understand privately that it has causing him naturally the most intense distress so thats why hes been looking haggard exclaimed roger without doubt mr chitterwick agreed gravely it was a wicked plot sir eustace you see was expected to be dead by then and incapable of denying his guilt and such evidence as there was had been carefully arranged to point to murder and suicide on his part that the police never suspected him simply shows that investigations do not always take the turn that the criminal expects and in this case observed mr chitterwick with some severity i think the criminal was altogether too subtle if that was her very involved reason for ensuring the presence of mr bendix at the rainbow club agreed miss dammers with some irony her subtlety certainly overreached itself it was evident that not only on the point of psychology did miss dammers not find herself ready to accept mr chitterwicks conclusions that indeed is exactly what happened mr chitterwick pointed out mildly oh and while we are on the subject of the chocolates i ought to add that the reason why they were sent to sir eustaces club was not only so that mr bendix might be a witness of their arrival but also i should imagine so that sir eustace would be sure to take them with him to his lunch appointment the murderess of course would be sufficiently conversant with his ways to know that he would almost certainly spend the morning at his club and go straight on to lunch from there the odds were enormous that he would take the box of mrs bendixs favourite chocolates with him i think we may regard it as an instance of the criminals habitual overlooking of some vital point that is to lead eventually to detection that this murderess completely lost sight of the possibility that the appointment for lunch might be cancelled she is a particularly ingenious criminal said mr chitterwick with gentle admiration and yet even she is not immune from this failing who is she mr chitterwick ingenuously asked mrs fielder flemming mr chitterwick answered her with a positively roguish smile everybody else has withheld the name of the suspect till the right moment surely i may be allowed to do so too well i think i have cleared up most of the doubtful points now masons notepaper was used i should say because chocolates had been decided on as the vehicle and masons were the only chocolate manufacturing firm who were customers of websters as it happened this fitted very well because it was always masons chocolates that sir eustace bought for his er his friends mrs fielder flemming looked puzzled because masons were the only firm who were customers of websters im afraid i dont understand oh i am explaining all this badly cried mr chitterwick in much distress assuming all blame for this obtuseness it had to be some firm on websters books you see because sir eustace has his notepaper printed at websters and he was to be identified as having been in there recently if the purloined piece was ever connected with the sample book exactly in fact as miss dammers did roger whistled oh i see you mean weve all been putting the cart before the horse over this piece of notepaper im afraid so regretted mr chitterwick with earnestness really im very much afraid so insensibly opinion was beginning to turn in mr chitterwicks favour to say the least he was being just as convincing as miss dammers had been and that without subtle psychological reconstructions and references to values only miss dammers herself remained outwardly sceptical but that after all was only to be expected humph said miss dammers sceptically what about the motive mr chitterwick nodded sir charles with solemnity jealousy did you say i dont think youve quite cleared up that yet have you oh yes of course mr chitterwick actually blushed dear me i meant to make that clear right at the beginning i am doing this badly no not jealousy im inclined to fancy revenge or revenge at any rate so far as sir eustace was concerned and jealousy as regards mrs bendix from what i can understand you see this lady is dear me said mr chitterwick in distress and embarrassment this is very delicate ground but i must trespass on it well though she had concealed it successfully from her friends this lady had been very much in love with sir eustace and become er had become concluded mr chitterwick bravely his mistress that was a long time ago sir eustace was very much in love with her too and though he used to amuse himself with other women it was understood by both that this was quite permissible so long as there was nothing serious the lady i should say is very modern and broad minded it was understood i believe that he was to marry her as soon as he could induce his wife to divorce him but when this was at last arranged sir eustace found that owing to his extreme financial stringency it was imperative that he should marry money instead the lady was naturally very disappointed but knowing that sir eustace did not care at all for er was not really in love with miss wildman and the marriage would only be so far as he was concerned one of convenience she reconciled herself to the future and quite seeing sir eustaces necessity did not resent the introduction of miss wildman whom indeed mr chitterwick felt himself compelled to add she considered as quite negligible it never occurred to her to doubt you see that the old arrangement would hold good and she would still have sir eustaces real love with which to content herself but then something quite unforeseen happened sir eustace not only fell out of love with her he fell unmistakably in love with mrs bendix moreover he succeeded in making her his mistress that was quite recently since he began to pay his addresses to miss wildman and i think miss dammers has given us a true picture of the results in mrs bendixs case if not in that of sir eustace well you can see the position then so far as this other lady was concerned sir eustace was getting his divorce marriage with the negligible miss wildman was now out of the question but marriage with mrs bendix tortured in her conscience and seeing in divorce from her husband and marriage with sir eustace the only means of solving it marriage with mrs bendix the real beloved and even more eligible than miss wildman so far as the financial side was concerned was to all appearances inevitable i deprecate the use of hackneyed quotations as much as anybody but really i feel that if i permit myself to add that hell has no fury like can you prove all this mr chitterwick interposed miss dammers coolly on the hackneyed quotation mr chitterwick started i i think so he said though a little dubiously im inclined to doubt it observed miss dammers briefly somewhat uncomfortable under miss dammerss sceptical eye mr chitterwick explained well sir eustace whose acquaintance i have been at some pains to cultivate recently mr chitterwick shivered a little as if the acquaintance had not been his ideal one well from a few indications that sir eustace has unconsciously given me that is to say i was questioning him at lunch today as adroitly as i could my conviction as to the murderers identity having been formed at last and he did unwittingly let fall a few trifles which i doubt it repeated miss dammers bluntly mr chitterwick looked quite nonplussed roger hurried to the rescue well shelving the matter of proof for the moment mr chitterwick and assuming that your reconstruction of the events is just an imaginative one youd reached the point where marriage between sir eustace and mrs bendix had become inevitable yes oh yes said mr chitterwick with a grateful look towards his saviour and then of course this lady formed her terrible decision and made her very clever plan i think ive explained all that her old right of access to sir eustaces rooms enabled her to type the letter on his typewriter one day when she knew he was out she is quite a good mimic and it was easy for her when ringing up mr bendix to imitate the sort of voice miss delorme might be expected to have mr chitterwick do any of us know this woman demanded mrs fielder flemming abruptly mr chitterwick looked more embarrassed than ever er yes he hesitated that is you must remember it was she who smuggled miss dammerss two books into sir eustaces rooms too you know i shall have to be more careful about my friends in future i see observed miss dammers gently sarcastic an ex mistress of sir eustaces eh roger murmured conning over in his mind such names as he could remember from that lengthy list well yes mr chitterwick agreed but nobody has any idea of it that is dear me this is very difficult mr chitterwick wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked extremely unhappy shed managed to conceal it roger pressed him er yes shed certainly managed to conceal the true state of matters between them very cleverly indeed i dont think anybody suspected it at all they apparently didnt know each other mrs fielder flemming persisted they were never seen about together oh at one time they were said mr chitterwick looking in quite a hunted way from face to face quite frequently then i understand they thought it better to pretend to have quarrelled and and met only in secret isnt it time you told us this womans name chitterwick boomed sir charles down the table looking judicial mr chitterwick scrambled desperately out of this fire of questions its very strange you know how murderers never will let well alone isnt it he said breathlessly it happens so often im quite sure i should never have stumbled on the truth in this case if the murderess had only left things as they were in accordance with her own admirable plot but this trying to fix the guilt on another person really from the intelligence displayed in this case she ought to have been above that of course her plot had miscarried been only half successful i should say but why not accept the partial failure why tempt providence trouble was inevitable inevitable mr chitterwick seemed by this time utterly distressed he was shuffling his notes with extreme nervousness and wriggling in his chair the glances he kept darting from face to face were almost pleading but what he was pleading for remained obscure dear me said mr chitterwick as if at his wits end this is very difficult id better clear up the remaining point its about the alibi in my opinion the alibi was an afterthought owing to a piece of luck southampton street is near both the cecil and the savoy isnt it i happen to know that this lady has a friend another woman of a somewhat unconventional nature she is continually away on exploring expeditions and so on usually quite alone she never stays in london more than a night or two and i should imagine she is the sort of woman who rarely reads the newspapers and if she did i think she would certainly not divulge any suspicion they might convey to her especially concerning a friend of her own i have ascertained that immediately preceding the crime this woman whose name by the way is jane harding stayed for two nights at the savoy hotel and left london on the morning the chocolates were delivered for africa from there she was going on to south america where she may be now i have not the least idea nor i should say has any one else but she came to london from paris where she had been staying for a week the er criminal would know about this forthcoming trip to london and so hurried to paris it would be simple to ask this other lady to post the parcel in london as the parcel postage is so heavy from france and just as simple to ensure it being delivered on the morning of the lunch appointment with mrs bendix by saying it was a birthday present or some other pretext and and must be posted to arrive on that particular day mr chitterwick wiped his forehead again and glanced pathetically at roger roger could only stare back in bewilderment dear me muttered mr chitterwick distractedly this is very difficult well i have satisfied myself that alicia dammers had risen to her feet and was unhurriedly picking up her belongings im afraid she said i have an appointment will you excuse me mr president of course said roger in some surprise at the door miss dammers turned back im so sorry not to be able to stay to hear the rest of your case mr chitterwick but really you know as i said i very much doubt whether youll be able to prove it she went out of the room shes perfectly right whispered mr chitterwick gazing after her in a petrified way im quite sure i cant but there isnt the faintest doubt im afraid not the faintest stupefaction reigned you you cant mean twittered mrs fielder flemming in a strangely shrill voice mr bradley was the first to get a grip oh himself so we did have a practising criminologist amongst us after all he drawled in a manner that was never oxford how quite interesting again silence held the circle so now asked the president helplessly what the devil do we do nobody enlightened him
