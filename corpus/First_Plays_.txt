in the morningroom of robert crawshaws town house entering it with our friend the houseagent our attention would first be called to the delightful club fender round the fireplace on one side of this a chesterfield sofa comes out at right angles in a corner of the sofa miss viola crawshaw is sitting deep in the times the houseagent would hesitate to catalogue her but we notice for ourselves before he points out the comfortable armchair opposite that she is young and pretty in the middle of the room and facing the fireplace is observe a solid kneehole writingtable covered with papers and books of reference and supported by a chair at the middle and another at the side the rest of the furniture and the books and pictures round the walls we must leave until another time for at this moment the door behind the sofa opens and richard meriton comes in he looks about thirtyfive has a cleanshaven intelligent face and is dressed in a dark tweed suit we withdraw hastily as he comes behind viola and puts his hands over her eyes richard three guesses who it is viola putting her hands over his the archbishop of canterbury richard no viola the archbishop of york richard fortunately that exhausts the archbishops now then your last guess viola richard meriton mp richard wonderful he kisses the top of her head lightly and goes round to the club fender where he sits with his back to the fireplace how did you know he begins to fill a pipe viola smiling well it couldnt have been father richard nno i suppose not not just after breakfast anyway anything in the paper viola theres a letter from father pointing out that richard i never knew such a man as robert for pointing out viola anyhow its in big print richard it would be viola you are very cynical this morning dick richard the sausages were cold dear viola poor dick oh dick i wish you were on the same side as father richard but hes on the wrong side surely ive told you that before viola do you really think it would make a difference viola well you know what he said about you at basingstoke the other day richard no i dont really viola he said that your intellectual arrogance was only equalled by your spiritual instability i dont quite know what it means but it doesnt sound the sort of thing you want in a soninlaw richard still it was friendly of him to go right away to basingstoke to say it anyhow you dont believe it viola of course not richard and robert doesnt really viola then why does he say it richard ah now youre opening up very grave questions the whole structure of the british constitution rests upon roberts right to say things like that at basingstoke but really darling were very good friends hes always asking my advice about things he doesnt take it of course but still he asks it and it awfully good of him to insist on my staying here while my flat was being done up seriously i bless him for that if it hadnt been for the last week i should never have known you you were just viola the girl id seen at odd times since she was a child now oh why wont you let me tell your father i hate it like this viola because i love you dick and because i know father he would as they say in novels show you the door smiling and i want you this side of the door for a little bit longer richard firmly i shall tell him before i go viola pleadingly but not till then that gives us two more days you see darling its going to take me all i know to get round him you see apart from politics youre so poor and father hates poor people richard viciously damn money viola thoughtfully i think thats what father means by spiritual instability richard viola he stands up and holds out his arms to her she goes to him and oh lord look out viola reaching across to the mantelpiece matches richard thanks very much he lights his pipe as robert crawshaw comes in crawshaw is fortyfive but his closelytrimmed moustache and whiskers his inclination to stoutness and the loud oldgentlemanly style in trousers which he affects with his morningcoat make him look older and what is more important the pillar of the state which he undoubtedly is crawshaw goodmorning richard down at last richard good morning i did warn you didnt i that i was bad at breakfasts crawshaw viola wheres your mother viola making for the door i dont know father do you want her crawshaw i wish to speak to her viola all right ill tell her she goes out richard picks up the times and sits down again crawshaw sitting down in a businesslike way at his desk richard why dont you get something to do richard my dear fellow ive only just finished breakfast crawshaw i mean generally and apart of course from your ah work in the house richard a trifle cool i have something to do crawshaw oh reviewing i mean something serious you should get a directorship or something in the city richard i hate the city crawshaw ah there my dear richard is that intellectual arrogance to which i had to call attention the other day at basingstoke richard drily yes so viola was telling me crawshaw you understood my dear fellow that i meant nothing personal clearing his throat it is justly one of the proudest boasts of the englishman that his political enmities are not allowed to interfere with his private friendships richard carelessly oh i shall go to basingstoke myself one day enter margaret margaret has been in love with robert crawshaw for twentyfive years the last twenty four years from habit she is small comfortable and rather foolish you would certainly call her a dear but you might sometimes call her a poor dear margaret goodmorning mr meriton i do hope your breakfast was all right richard excellent thank you margaret thats right did you want me robert crawshaw obviously uncomfortable yes er hrm richard er what are your er plans richard is he trying to get rid of me mrs crawshaw margaret of course not to robert are you dear crawshaw perhaps we had better come into my room margaret we can leave richard here with the paper richard no no im going crawshaw going to the door with him i have some particular business to discuss if you arent going out i should like to consult you in the matter afterwards richard right he goes out crawshaw sit down margaret i have some extraordinary news for you margaret sitting down yes robert crawshaw this letter has just come by hand he reads it lincolns inn fields dear sir i have pleasure to inform you that under the will of the late mr antony clifton you are a beneficiary to the extent of margaret robert crawshaw wait a trifling condition is attached namely that you should take the name of wurzelflummery margaret robert crawshaw i have the honour to be your obedient servant denis clifton he folds the letter up and puts it away margaret robert whoever is he i mean the one whos left you the money crawshaw calmly i have not the slightest idea margaret doubtless we shall find out before long i have asked mr denis clifton to come and see me margaret leaving you fifty thousand pounds just fancy crawshaw wurzelflummery margaret we can have the second car now dear cant we and what about moving you know you always said you ought to be in a more central part mr robert crawshaw mp of curzon street sounds so much more more cabinety crawshaw mr robert wurzelflummery mp of curzon street i dont know what that sounds like margaret i expect thats only a legal way of putting it dear they cant really expect us to change our name to wurzleyfothergill crawshaw wurzelflummery margaret yes dear didnt i say that i am sure you could talk the solicitor round this mr denis clifton after all it doesnt matter to him what we call ourselves write him one of your letters dear crawshaw you dont seem to apprehend the situation margaret margaret yes i do dear this mr mr crawshaw antony clifton margaret yes hes left you fifty thousand pounds together with the name of wurzleyfothergill crawshaw wurzel oh well never mind margaret yes well you tell the solicitor that you will take the fifty thousand pounds but you dont want the name its too absurd when everybody knows of robert crawshaw mp to expect you to call yourself wurzleyfothergill crawshaw impatiently yes yes the point is that this mr clifton has left me the money on condition that i change my name if i dont take the name i dont take the money margaret but is that legal crawshaw perfectly it is often done people change their names on succeeding to some property margaret i thought it was only when your name was moses and you changed it to talbot crawshaw to himself wurzelflummery margaret i wonder why he left you the money at all of course it was very nice of him but if you didnt know him why do you think he did dear crawshaw i know no more than this letter i suppose he had ah followed my career and was ah interested in it and being a man with no relations felt that he could ah safely leave this money to me no doubt wurzelflummery was his mothers maiden name or the name of some other friend even dearer to him he wished the name ah perpetuated perhaps even recorded not unworthily in the history of our country and ah made this will accordingly in a way it is a kind of ah sacred trust margaret then of course youll accept it dear crawshaw it requires some consideration i have my career to think about my duty to my country margaret of course dear money is a great help in politics isnt it crawshaw money wisely spent is a help in any profession the view of riches which socialists and suchlike people profess to take is entirely illconsidered a rich man who spends his money thoughtfully is serving his country as nobly as anybody margaret yes dear then you think we could have that second car and the house in curzon street crawshaw we must not be led away fifty thousand pounds properly invested is only two thousand a year when you have deducted the incometax and the tax on unearned income is extremely high just now margaret oh but surely if we have to call ourselves wurzelflummery it would count as earned income crawshaw i fear not strictly speaking all money is earned even if it is left to you by another it is presumably left to you in recognition of certain outstanding qualities which you possess but parliament takes a different view i do not for a moment say that fifty thousand pounds would not be welcome fifty pounds is certainly not to be sneezed at margaret i should think not indeed crawshaw unconsciously rising from his chair and without this preposterous condition attached i should be pleased to accept this trust and i would endeavour mr speaker he sits down again suddenly i would margaret to carry it out to the best of my poor ability but wurtzelflummery margaret you would soon get used to it dear i had to get used to the name of crawshaw after i had been debenham for twentyfive years it is surprising how quickly it comes to you i think i only signed my name margaret debenham once after i was married crawshaw kindly the cases are rather different margaret naturally a woman who from her cradle looks forward to the day when she will change her name cannot have this feeling for the ah honour of his name which every man ah feels such a feeling is naturally more present in my own case since i have been privileged to make the name of crawshaw in some degree ah wellknown i might almost say famous margaret wistfully i used to be called the beautiful miss debenham of leamington everybody in leamington knew of me of course i am very proud to be mrs robert crawshaw crawshaw getting up and walking over to the fireplace in a way it would mean beginning all over again it is half the battle in politics to get your name before the public whoever is this man wurzelflummery people will say margaret anyhow dear let us look on the bright side fifty thousand pounds is fifty thousand pounds crawshaw it is margaret and no doubt it is my duty to accept it but well all i say is that a gentleman would have left it without any conditions or at least he would merely have expressed his wish that i should take the name without going so far as to enforce it then i could have looked at the matter all round in an impartial spirit margaret pursuing her thoughts the linen is marked r m c now of course we should have to have that altered do you think r m f would do or would it have to be r m w hyphen f crawshaw what oh yes there will be a good deal of that to attend to going up to her i think margaret i had better talk to richard about this of course it would be absurd to refuse the money but well i should like to have his opinion margaret getting up do you think he would be very sympathetic dear he makes jokes about serious things like bishops and hunting just as if they werent at all serious crawshaw i wish to talk to him just to obtain a new ah point of view i do not hold myself in the least bound to act on anything he says i regard him as a constituent margaret margaret then i will send him to you crawshaw putting his hands on her shoulders margaret what do you really feel about it margaret just whatever you feel robert crawshaw kissing her thank you margaret you are a good wife to me she goes out crawshaw goes to his desk and selects a whos who from a little pile of referencebooks on it he walks round to his chair sits down in it and begins to turn the pages murmuring names beginning with c to himself as he gets near the place when he finds it he murmurs clifton thats funny and closes the book evidently the publishers have failed him enter richard richard well whats the news he goes to his old seat on the fender been left a fortune crawshaw simply yes by a mr antony clifton i never met him and i know nothing about him richard surprised not really well i congratulate you he sighs to them that hath but what on earth do you want my advice about crawshaw there is a slight condition attached richard oho crawshaw the condition is that with this money fifty thousand pounds i take the name of ah wurzelflummery richard jumping up what crawshaw sulkily i said it quite distinctly wurzelflummery richard in an awed silence walks over to the desk and stands looking down at the unhappy crawshaw he throws out his left hand as if introducing him richard reverently mr robert wurzelflummery m p one of the most prominent of our younger parliamentarians oh youoh oh how too heavenly he goes back to his seat looks up and catches crawshaws eye and breaks down altogether crawshaw rising with dignity shall we discuss it seriously or shall we leave it richard how can we discuss a name like wurzelflummery seriously mr wurzelflummery in a few wellchosen words seconded the motion sir went on mr wurzelflummery oh poor robert crawshaw sitting down sulkily you seem quite certain that i shall take the money richard i am quite certain crawshaw would you take it richard hesitating well i wonder crawshaw after all as william shakespeare says whats in a name richard i can tell you something else that shakespeare william shakespeare said dramatically rising who steals my purse with fifty thousand in it steals trash in his natural voice trash robert dramatically again but he who filches from me my good name of crawshaw lightly and substitutes the rotten one of wurzel crawshaw annoyed as a matter of fact wurzelflummery is a very good old name i seem to remember some ah hampshire wurzelflummeries it is a very laudable spirit on the part of a dying man to wish to ah perpetuate these old english names it all seems to me quite natural and straightforward if i take this money i shall have nothing to be ashamed of richard i see look here may i ask you a few questions i should like to know just how you feel about the whole business crawshaw complacently folding his hands go ahead richard suppose a stranger came up in the street to you and said my poor man heres five pounds for you what would you do tell him to go to the devil i suppose wouldnt you crawshaw humorously in more parliamentary language perhaps richard i should tell him i never took money from strangers richard quite so but that if it were ten thousand pounds you would take it crawshaw i most certainly shouldnt richard but if he died and left it to you then you would crawshaw blandly ah i thought you were leading up to that that of course is entirely different richard why crawshaw well ah wouldnt you take ten thousand pounds if it were left to you by a stranger richard i daresay i should but i should like to know why it would seem different crawshaw professionally hahum well in the first place when a man is dead he wants his money no longer you can therefore be certain that you are not taking anything from him which he cannot spare and in the neat place it is the mans dying wish that you should have the money to refuse would be to refuse the dead to accept becomes almost a sacred duty richard it really comes to this doesnt it you wont take it from him when hes alive because if you did you couldnt decently refuse him a little gratitude but you know that it doesnt matter a damn to him what happens to his money after hes dead and therefore you can take it without feeling any gratitude at all crawshaw no i shouldnt put it like that richard smiling im sure you wouldnt robert crawshaw no doubt you can twist it about so that richard all right well leave that and go on to the next point suppose a perfect stranger offered you five pounds to part your hair down the middle shave off your moustache and wear only one whisker if he met you suddenly in the street seemed to dislike your appearance took out a fiver and begged you to hurry off and alter yourself of course youd pocket the money and go straight to your barbers crawshaw now you are merely being offensive richard i beg your pardon i should have said that if he had left you five pounds in his will well then twenty pounds a hundred pounds a thousand pounds fifty thousand pounds jumping up excitedly its only a question of price fifty thousand pounds robert a pink tie with purple spots hair across the back trousers with a patch in the fall myself wurzelflummery any old thing you like you cant insult me anything you like gentlemen for fifty thousand pounds lowering his voice only you must leave it in your will and then i can feel that it is a sacred duty a sacred duty my lords and gentlemen he sinks back into the sofa and relights his pipe crawshaw rising with dignity it is evidently useless to prolong this conversation richard waving him dorm again no no robert ive finished i just took the other side and i got carried away i ought to have been at the bar crawshaw you take such extraordinary views of things you must look facts in the face richard this is a modern world and we are modern people living in it take the matteroffact view you may like or dislike the name of ah wurzelflummery but you cant get away from the fact that fifty thousand pounds is not to be sneezed at richard wistfully i dont know why people shouldnt sneeze at money sometimes i should like to start a society for sneezing at fifty thousand pounds wed have to begin in a small way of course wed begin by sneezing at five pounds and work up the trouble is that were all inoculated in our cradles against that kind of cold crawshaw pleasantly you will have your little joke but you know as well as i do that it is only a joke there can be no serious reason why i should not take this money and i ah gather that you dont think it will affect my career richard carelessly not a bit itll help it itll get you into all the comic papers margaret comes in at this moment to the relief of crawshaw who is not quite certain if he is being flattered or insulted again margaret well have you told him richard making way for her on the sofa i have heard the news mrs crawshaw and i have told robert my opinion that he should have no difficulty in making the name of wurzelflummery as famous as he has already made that of crawshaw at any rate i hope he will margaret how nice of you crawshaw well its settled then looking at his watch this solicitor fellow should be here soon perhaps after all we can manage something about ah viola did you want your mother enter viola viola sorry do i interrupt a family meeting theres richard so it cant be very serious richard what a reputation crawshaw well its over now margaret viola had better know hadnt she crawshaw shell have to know some time of course viola sitting done firmly on the sofa of course she will so youd better tell her now i knew there was something exciting going on this morning crawshaw embarrassed hum ha to margaret perhaps youd better tell her dear margaret simply and naturally father has come into some property viola it means changing our name unfortunately but your father doesnt think it will matter viola how thrilling what is the name mother margaret your father says it is dear me i shall never remember it crawshaw mumbling wurzelflummery viola after a pause dick you tell me if nobody else will richard robert said it just now viola that wasnt a name was it i thought it was just a do say it again father crawshaw sulkily but plainly wurzelflummery viola surprised do you spell it like that i mean like a wurzel and like flummery richard exactly i believe viola to herself miss viola wurzelflummery i mean theyd have to look at you wouldnt they bubbling over oh dick what a heavenly name who had it first richard they are an old hampshire family that is so isnt it robert crawshaw annoyed i said i thought that i remembered margaret can you find burke there she finds it and he buries himself in the families of the great margaret well viola you havent told us how you like being miss wurzelflummery viola i havent realized myself yet mummy i shall have to stand in front of my glass and tell myself who i am richard its all right for you you know youll change your name one day and then it wont matter what youve been called before viola secretly hsh she smiles lovingly at him and then says aloud oh wont it its got to appear in the papers a marriage has been arranged between miss viola wurzelflummery and everybody will say and about time too poor girl margaret to crawshaw have you found it dear crawshaw resentfully this is the edition margaret still dear if its a very old family it ought to be in by then viola i dont mind how old it is i think its lovely oh dick what fun it will be being announced just think of the footman throwing open the door and saying maid announcing mr denis clifton there is a little natural confusion as clifton enters jauntily in his summer suiting with a bundle of papers under his arm crawshaw goes towards him and shakes hands crawshaw how do you do mr clifton very good of you to come looking doubtfully at his clothes er it is mr denis clifton the solicitor clifton cheerfully it is i must apologize for not looking the part more but my clothes did not arrive from clarksons in time very careless of them when they had promised and my clerk dissuaded me from the sidewhiskers which i keep by me for these occasions crawshaw bewildered ah yes quite so but you have ah full legal authority to act in this matter clifton oh decidedly oh theres no question of that crawshaw introducing my wife and daughter clifton bows gracefully my friend mr richard meriton clifton happilydear me mr meriton too this is quite a situation as we say in the profession richard amused by him in the legal profession clifton in the theatrical professionturning to margaret i am a writer of plays mrs crawshaw i am not giving away a professional secret when i tell you that most of the managers in london have thanked me for submitting my work to them crawshaw firmlyi understood mr clifton that you were the solicitor employed to wind up the affairs of the late mr antony clifton clifton oh certainly oh theres no doubt about my being a solicitor my clerk a man of the utmost integrity not to say probity would give me a reference i am in the books i belong to the law society but my heart turns elsewhere officially i have embraced the profession of a solicitor frankly to mrs crawshaw but you know what these official embraces are margaret im afraid she turns to her husband for assistance clifton to richard unofficially mr meriton i am wedded to the muses viola dick isnt he lovely crawshaw quite so but just for the moment mr clifton i take it that we are concerned with legal business should i ever wish to produce a play the case would be different clifton admirably put pray regard me entirely as the solicitor for as long as you wish he puts his hat down on a chair with the papers in it and taking off his gloves goes on dreamily mr denis clifton was superb as a solicitor in spite of an indifferent makeup his manner of taking off his gloves and dropping them into his hat he does so margaret to crawshaw i think perhaps viola and i richard making a move too well leave you to your business robert clifton holding up his hand just one moment if i may i have a letter for you mr meriton richard surprised for me clifton yes my clerk a man of the utmost integrity oh but i said that before he took it round to your rooms this morning but found only painters and decorators there he is feeling in his pockets and now brings the letter out i brought it along hoping that mr crawshaw but of course i never expected anything so delightful as this he hands over the letter with a bow richard thanks he puts it in his pocket clifton oh but do read it now wont you to mr crawshaw one so rarely has an opportunity of being present when ones own letters are read i think the habit they have on the stage of reading letters aloud to other is such a very delightful one richard with a smile and a shrug has opened his letter while clifton is talking richard good lord viola dick what is it richard reading lincolns inn fields dear sir i have the pleasure to inform you that under the will of the late mr antony clifton you are a beneficiary to the extent of viola dick richard a trifling condition is attached namely that you should take the name of wurzelflummery clifton with his hand on his heart bows gracefully from one to the other of them crawshaw annoyed impossible why should he leave any money to you viola dick how wonderful margaret mildly i dont remember ever having had a morning quite like this richard angrily is this a joke mr clifton clifton oh the money is there all right my clerk a man of the utmost richard then i refuse it ill have nothing to do with it i wont even argue about it tearing the letter into bits thats what i think of your money he stalks indignantly from the room viola dick oh but mother he mustnt oh i must tell him she hurries after him margaret with dignity really mr clifton im surprised at you she goes out too clifton looking round the room and now mr crawshaw we are alone crawshaw yes well i think mr clifton you have a good deal to explain clifton my dear sir im longing to begin i have been looking forward to this day for weeks i spent over an hour this morning dressing for it he takes papers from his hat and moves to the sofa perhaps i had better begin from the beginning crawshaw interested indicating the papers the documents in the case clifton oh dear no just something to carry in the hand it makes one look more like a solicitor reading the title watherston v towser in re great missenden canal company my clerk invents the titles it keeps him busy he is very fond of towser towser is always coming in frankly you see mr crawshaw this is my first real case and i only got it because antony clifton is my uncle my efforts to introduce a little picturesqueness into the dull formalities of the law do not meet with that response that one would have expected crawshaw looking at his watch yes well im a busy man and if you could tell me as shortly as possible why your uncle left this money to me and apparently to mr meriton too under these extraordinary conditions i shall be obliged to you clifton say no more mr crawshaw i look forward to being entirely frank with you it will be a pleasure crawshaw you understand of course my position i think i may say that i am not without reputation in the country and proud as i am to accept this sacred trust this money which the late mr antony clifton has seen fit modestly one cannot say why to bequeath to me yet the use of the name wurzelflummery would be excessively awkward clifton cheerfully excessively crawshaw my object in seeing you was to inquire if it was absolutely essential that the name should go with the money clifton well thoughtfully you may have the name without the money if you like but you must have the name crawshaw disappointed ah bravely of course i have nothing against the name a good old hampshire name clifton shocked my dear mr crawshaw you didnt think you didnt really think that anybody had been called wurzelflummery before oh no no you and mr meriton were to be the first the founders of the clan the designers of the wurzelflummery sporran crawshaw what do you mean sir are you telling me that it is not a real name at all clifton oh its a name all right i know it is because er i made it up crawshaw outraged and you have the impudence to propose sir that i should take a madeup name clifton soothingly well all names are made up some time or other somebody had to think of adam crawshaw i warn you mr clifton that i do not allow this trifling with serious subjects clifton its all so simple really you see my uncle antony was a rather unusual man he despised money he was not afraid to put it in its proper place the place he put it in was er a little below golf and a little above classical concerts if a man said to him would you like to make fifty thousand this afternoon he would say well it would depend what he was doing if he were going to have a round at walton heath crawshaw its perfectly scandalous to talk of money in this way clifton well thats how he talked about it but he didnt find many to agree with him in fact he used to say that there was nothing however contemptible that a man would not do for money one day i suggested that if he left a legacy with a sufficiently foolish name attached to it somebody might be found to refuse it he laughed at the idea that put me on my mettle two people i said leave the same silly name to two people two wellknown people rival politicians say men whose own names are already public property surely they wouldnt both take it that touched him denis my boy youve got it he said upon what vile bodies shall we experiment we decided on you and mr meriton the next thing was to choose the name i started on the wrong lines i began by suggesting names like porker tosh bugge spiffkins the obvious sort my uncle crawshaw boiling with indignation how dare you discuss me with your uncle sir how dare you decide in this coldblooded way whether i am to be called ah tosh or ah porker clifton my uncle wouldnt bear of tosh or porker he wanted a humorous name a name he could roll lovingly round his tongue a name expressing a sort of humorous contempt wurzelflummery i can see now the happy ruminating smile which carne so often on my uncle antonys face in those latter months he was thinking of his two wurzelflummerys i remember him saying once it was at the zoo what a pity it was he hadnt enough to divide among the whole cabinet a whole bunch of wurzelflummerys it would have been rather jolly crawshaw you force me to say sir that if that was the way you and your uncle used to talk together at his death can only be described as a merciful intervention of providence clifton oh but i think he must be enjoying all this somewhere you know i hope he is he would have loved this morning it was his one regret that from the necessities of the case he could not live to enjoy his own joke but he had hopes that echoes of it would reach him wherever he might be it was with some such idea i fancy that toward the end he became interested in spiritualism crawshaw rising solemnly mr clifton i have no interest in the present whereabouts of your uncle nor in what means he has of overhearing a private conversation between you and myself but if as you irreverently suggest he is listening to us i should like him to hear this that in my opinion you are not a qualified solicitor at all that you never had an uncle and that the whole story of the will and the ridiculous condition attached to it is just the tomfool joke of a man who by his own admission wastes most of his time writing unsuccessful farces and i propose clifton pardon my interrupting but you said farces not farces comedies of a whimsical nature crawshaw whatever they were sir i propose to report the whole matter to the law society and you know your way out sir clifton then i am to understand that you refuse the legacy mr crawshaw crawshaw startled whats that clifton i am to understand that you refuse the fifty thousand pounds crawshaw if the money is really there i most certainly do not refuse it clifton oh the money is most certainly there and the name both waiting for you crawshaw thumping the table then sir i accept them i feel it my duty to accept them as a public expression of confidence in the late mr cliftons motives i repudiate entirely the motives that you have suggested to him and i consider it a sacred duty to show what i think of your story by accepting the trust which he has bequeathed to me you will arrange further matters with my solicitor good morning sir clifton to himself as he rises mr crawshaw here drank a glass of water to crawshaw mr wurzelflummery farewell may i express the parting wish that your future career will add fresh lustre to my name to himself as he goes out exit mr denis clifton with dignity but he has left his papers behind him crawshaw walking indignantly back to the sofa sees the papers and picks them up crawshaw contemptuously watherston v towser in re great missenden canal company bah he tears them up and throws them into the fare he goes back to his writingtable and is seated there as viola followed by meriton comes in viola father dick doesnt want to take the money but i have told him that of course he must he must mustnt he richard we neednt drag robert into it viola crawshaw if richard has the very natural feeling that it would be awkward for me if there were two wurzelflummerys in the house of commons i should be the last to interfere with his decision in any case i dont see what concern it is of yours viola viola surprised but how can we get married if he doesnt take the money crawshaw hardly understanding married what does this mean richard richard im sorry it has come out like this we ought to have told you before but anyhow we were going to have told you in a day or two viola and i want to get married crawshaw and what did you want to get married on richard with a smile not very much im afraid viola were all right now father because we shall have fifty thousand pounds richard sadly oh viola viola crawshaw but naturally this puts a very different complexion on matters viola so of course he must take it mustnt he father crawshaw i can hardly suppose richard that you expect me to entrust my daughter to a man who is so little provident for himself that he throws away fifty thousand pounds because of some fanciful objection to the name which goes with it richard in despair you dont understand robert crawshaw i understand this richard that if the name is good enough for me it should be good enough for you you dont mind asking viola to take your name but you consider it an insult if you are asked to take my name richard miserably to viola do you want to be mrs wurzelflummery viola well im going to be miss wurzelflummery anyhow darling richard beaten heaven help me youll make me take it but youll never understand crawshaw stopping to administer comfort to him on his way out come come richard patting him on the shoulder i understand perfectly all that you were saying about money a little while ago its all perfectly true its all just what i feel myself but in practice we have to make allowances sometimes we have to sacrifice our ideals for ah others i shall be very proud to have you for a soninlaw and to feel that there will be the two of us in parliament together upholding the honour of the ah name and perhaps now that we are to be so closely related you may come to feel some day that your views could be ah more adequately put forward from my side of the house richard go on robert i deserve it crawshaw well well margaret will be interested in our news and you must send that solicitor a line or perhaps a telephone message would be better he goes to the door and turns round just as he is going out yes i think the telephone richard it would be safer exit richard holding out his hands to viola come here mrs wurzelflummery viola not mrs wurzelflummery mrs dick and soon please darling she comes to him richard shaking his head sadly at her i dont know what ive done viola suddenly but youre worth it he kisses her and then says in a low voice and god help me if i ever stop thinking so enter mr denis clifton he sees them and walks about very tactfully with his back towards them humming to himself richard hullo clifton to himself now

farringdon his greataunt pamela carey his betrothed henry wentworth his friend thomas todd his friend letty herbert his friend mason his old nurse act i at sir james farringdons in the country act ii a private hotel in dover street two months later act iii at sir james farringdons again three months later the lucky one act i scene the hall of sir james farringdons house in the country it is a large and pleasantly unofficial sort of room used as a meetingplace rather than a resting place to be in it pledges you to nothing whereas in the billiardroom you are presumably pledged to billiards the french windows at the back open on to lawns the door on the right at the back will take you into the outer hall the door on the left leads to the servants quarters the door on the right in front will disclose other inhabited rooms to you an oak gallery runs round two sides of the hall and descends in broad and gentle stairs down the right side of it four stairs from the bottom it turns round at right angles and deposits you fairly in the hall entering in this way you will see immediately opposite to you the large open fireplace occupied by a pile of unlit logs for it is summer there is a chair on each side of the fireplace but turned now away from it in the left centre of the hall there is a gatelegged table to which trays with drinks on them have a habit of finding their way it is supported on each side by a coffinstool a sofa which will take two strangers comfortably and three friends less comfortably comes out at right angles to the staircase but leaves plenty of space between itself and the stool on its side of the table beneath the window on the left of the french windows is a small table on which letters and papers are put beneath the window on the other side is a writingtable the walls are decorated impartially with heads of wild animals and of farringdons at the present moment the inhabitants of the hall are three henry wentworth a barrister between forty and fifty dressed in rather a serious tweed suit for a summer day is on the sofa thomas todd an immaculate young gentleman of twentyfive is halfsitting on the gatelegged table with one foot on the ground and the other swinging he is dressed in a brown flannel coat and white trousers shoes and socks and he has a putter in his hand indicative of his usual line of thought the third occupant is the butler who in answer to tommys ring has appeared with the drinks the time is about four oclock on a june afternoon tommy to the butler thanks james just leave it here exit butler whisky or lemonade wentworth wentworth neither thanks tommy tommy well i will he pours himself out some lemonade and takes a long drink i should have thought you would have been thirsty driving down from london a day like this he finishes his drink lets see where was i up to the sixth wasnt it wentworth the sixth tommy with resignation only twelve more tommy yes thats right well at the seventh i got an absolutely topping drive but my approach was sliced a bit however i chipped on within about six feet and was down in four gerald took it in three but i had a stroke so i halved then the eighth i told you about wentworth was that where you fell into the pond tommy no no youre thinking of the fifth where i topped my drive into the pond wentworth i knew the pond came into it somewhere i hoped i mean i thought you fell in tommy look here you must remember the eighth old chap that was the one i did in one awful bit of luck wentworth bit of luck for me too tommy tommy why wentworth because now you can hurry on to the ninth tommy i say wentworth i thought you were keen on golf wentworth only on my own tommy youre a fraud here ive been absolutely wasting my precious time on you and i suppose it wouldnt even interest you to hear that gerald went round in seventytwo five under bogey wentworth it would interest me much more to hear something about this girl hes engaged to tommy pamela carey oh shes an absolute ripper wentworth yes but youve said that of every girl youve met tommy well dash it you dont expect me to describe what she looks like do you wentworth well no i shall see that for myself directly one gets introduced you know tommy it isnt as though i were meeting her at charing cross station for the first time but who is she tommy well she was poor old bobs friend originally he brought her down here but of course as soon as she saw gerald wentworth quickly why poor old bob tommy i dont know everybody seems to call him that after all he isnt quite like gerald is he wentworth paderewski isnt quite like tommy todd but i dont say poor old paderewski nor poor old tommy if it comes to that tommy well hang it old man theres a bit of a difference paderewski and i well i mean we dont compete wentworth oh i dont know i daresay hes as rotten at golf as you if the truth were really known tommy no but seriously its a bit different when you get two brothers like gerald and bob and whatever the elder one does the younger one does a jolly sight better now paderewski and i wentworth good heavens i wish i hadnt started you on that get back to bob i thought bob was on the stock exchange and gerald in the foreign office there cant be very much competition between them there tommy well but there you are why isnt bob in the foreign office and gerald on the stock exchange why because geralds the clever one geralds the popular one the goodlooking one the lucky one the county cricketer the plus three at golf wentworth oh lord i thought youd get golf into it i suppose you were working up to your climax poor old bob is about eighteen at golf eh tommy as a matter of fact hes a very decent five and there you are again in any other family bob would be thought rather a nut as it is wentworth as it is tommy there are about thirtyfive million people in england whove never played golf and who would recognize bob if they met him for the decent english gentleman that he is tommy i think you exaggerate old chap golfs been getting awfully popular lately wentworth personally i am very fond of bob tommy oh so am i hes an absolute ripper still gerald you know i mean its jolly bad luck on poor old bob now paderewski and i enter gerald from the garden a charming figure in a golfing coat and white flannels perhaps he is a little conscious of his charm if so it is hardly his fault for heroworship has been his lot from boyhood he is now about twentysix everything that he has ever tried to do he has done well and if he is rather more unembarrassed than most of us when praised his unselfconsciousness is to a stranger as charming as the rest of him with it all he is intensely reserved with the result that those who refuse to succumb to his charm sometimes make the mistake of thinking that there is nothing behind it gerald hallo wentworth how are you all right wentworth getting up and shaking hands yes thanks how are you gerald simply bursting have you seen your room and all that sort of thing wentworth yes thanks gerald good and tommys been entertaining you to tommy tommy i interrupted your story about paderewski i dont think i know it to wentworth you must listen to this it may be fairly new tommy dont be an ass as a matter of fact we were discussing something quite serious gerald to wentworth how long have you been here wentworth about ten minutes gerald and tommy hasnt told you that he did the eighth in one this morning wentworth he hasnt really told me yet hes only mentioned it once or twice in passing tommy modestly well i mean its bound to appear in the papers so naturally one gerald oh its a great business champagne will flow like water tonight there will also be speeches wentworth which reminds me gerald i have to congratulate you gerald thank you very much when youve seen her youll want to do it again tommy looking through the window hallo theres letty gerald if you want to tell her about it run along tommy tommy moving off i thought id just take her on at putting he goes out gerald sitting down youll stay till well how long can you tuesday anyhow wentworth i think i can manage till tuesday thanks very much miss carey is here of course gerald yes shell be in directly shes gone to the station to meet bob wentworth smiling and gerald didnt go with her gerald smiling at least six people suggested that gerald should go with her they suggested it very loudly and archly wentworth so gerald didnt gerald so gerald didnt after a pause i cant stand that sort of thing wentworth what sort of thing gerald after a pause poor old boy youve never been in love barring the nine or ten times youre just going to tell me about i mean never really in love wentworth dont drag me into it what is it you cant stand gerald people being tactful about pamela and me aunt tabitha asked me yesterday if she might have pamela for half an hour to do something or other as if she were an umbrella with my initials on it and somebody else said ive quite fallen in love with your pamela i hope you dont mind mind i tell you wentworth my boy if you arent in love with pamela by tuesday therell be the very deuce of a row your electroplated butterdish or whatever its going to be will be simply flung back at you wentworth well as long as miss pamela understands gerald of course she understands we understand each other wentworth preening himself then ill do my best mind if she does happen to reciprocate my feelings i wash my hands of all responsibility going towards the staircase goodafternoon miss farringdon miss farringdon is coming slowly down the stairs miss farringdon goodafternoon mr wentworth welcome she must be well over eighty she was pretty once and sharptongued so much you could swear to now for the rest she is very very wise and intensely interested in life gerald going over and kissing her goodmorning aunt tabitha your chair is waiting for you he conducts her to it miss farringdon im a nasty cross old thing before lunch mr wentworth so i dont come down till afterwards nowadays is gerald being as charming as usual wentworth smiling oh pretty well gerald looking at her lovingly and then turning to wentworth its having a very bad effect on her this morning seclusion shes supposed to be resting but she spends her time trying to think of nasty things to say about me the trouble with a mind like aunt tabithas is that it cant think of anything really nasty miss farringdon the trouble with gerald mr wentworth is that he goes about expecting everybody to love him the result is that they nearly all do however he cant get round me gerald it isnt true wentworth she adores me miss farringdon he wouldnt be happy if he didnt think so wentworth gracefully i can sympathize with him there gerald the slight coolness which you perceive to have arisen between my aunt tabitha and myself is due to the fact that i discovered her guilty secret a few days ago for years she has pretended that her real name was harriet i have recently found out that she was christened tabitha or anyhow would have been if the clergyman had known his job miss farringdon my greatnephew gerald mr wentworth gerald nephew wentworth i agreed to waive the great a long time ago wentworth youll excuse my asking but do you never talk to each other except through the medium of a third person miss farringdon to gerald thats how they prefer to do it in the foreign office isnt it dear gerald always aunt tabitha but really you know we both ought to be talking to wentworth and flaking after his mother and his liver and things like that miss farringdon yes im afraid were rather rude mr wentworth the farringdons great fault wentworth protesting oh no miss farringdon how is mrs wentworth wentworth wonderfully well thank you considering her age miss farringdon dear me we met first in gerald all frills and lavender miss farringdon and now heres gerald engaged have you seen pamela yet wentworth not yet i have been hearing about her from tommy he classes her with the absolute rippers gerald good old tommy miss farringdon yes shes much too good for gerald gerald of course she is aunt tabitha but if women only married men who were good enough for them where should we be as lots of young men said to you in vain on those afternoons when they read tennyson aloud to you miss farringdon she ought to have married bob wentworth surprised and amused bob is bob good enough for her miss farringdon she would have made a good wife for bob enter suddenly letty herbert and tommy from the garden letty is an entirely delightful irresponsible girl of the type which might have shocked queen victoria however she seems to suit tommy they are not engaged yet but she has already that air of proprietorship letty i say tommy did the eighth in one why theres aunt harriet going over and kissing her how are you darling tommys done the eighth in one i know it doesnt mean much to you but do say hooray because hes so bucked about it gerald to wentworth do you know miss herbert letty come and be introduced mr wentworth miss herbert letty shaking hands eagerly how do you do i say tommy did the eighth in one do you know tommy or the eighth wentworth both miss herbert gerald to a man who knows both the performance seems truly astonishing miss farringdon i dont know anything about golf mr todd but doing anything in one sounds rather clever so i say hooray too tommy i wish youd let me teach you miss farringdon lots of people begin when theyre frightfully old letty to wentworth this is one of tommys polite days gerald mr todds famous oldworld courtesy is the talk of many a salon miss farringdon to tommy dont you mind them i am frightfully old i am very proud of it i hope youll all live to be as old as i am gerald i only hope we shall be half as nice miss farringdon gerald being charming as usual gerald firmly i will also add that i hope we shall be kinder to our greatnephews than some letty putting her arm in his diddums gerald yes i did i am very much hurt tommy i say you know miss farringdon i never meant letty i love tommy when he apologizes enter sir james and lady farringdon from the door to front of the staircase sir james in a country checksuit is a man of no particular brain and no ideas but he has an unconquerable belief in himself and a very genuine pride in and admiration of gerald his grey hair is bald on the top and he is cleanshaven except for a hint of whisker he might pass for a retired captain r n and he has something of the quarterdeck manner so that even a remark on the weather is listened to with attention neither of his sons loves him but gerald is no longer afraid of him lady farringdon is outwardly rather intimidating but she never feels so she worships gerald and would love a good many other people if they were not a little overawed by her lady farringdon ah youre here mr wentworth how do you do wentworth coming forward how do you do lady farringdon how do you do sir james sir james how are you wentworth come to see gerald play for the county gerald hes come to see pamela havent you wentworth wentworth i rather hope to see both sir james ah aunt harriet i

telling me at the club the other day letty t lady farringdon gerald dived off the monks rock this morning im glad i didnt see him i should have been horribly frightened tommy proudly i saw him letty tommy of course slithered down over the limpets in the ordinary way lady farringdon fondly oh gerald how could you sir james still talking to wentworth he tells me that gerald is a marked man in the service now tommy to letty do you remember when gerald miss farringdon incisively lets all talk about gerald gerald who has been listening to all this with more amusement than embarrassment gives a sudden shout of laughter gerald oh aunt tabitha youre too lovely he blows her a kiss and she shakes her stick at him enter pamela from the door in front of the staircase tall beautiful and serene a born mother gerald carried her off her feet a month ago but it is a question if he really touched her heart a heart moved more readily by pity than by love pamela gerald dear id know your laugh anywhere am i too late for the joke gerald hullo pamela brought bob with you pamela hes just washing london off himself lady farringdon pamela dear do you know mr wentworth pamela shaking hands how do

letty good then tommy can tell him tommy they do pull my leg dont they miss farringdon enter bob from the outer hall in a blue flannel suit he has spoilt any chance he had of being considered handsome by a sullen expression now habitual two years older than gerald he is not so tall but bigger and altogether less graceful he has got in the way of talking in rather a surly voice as if he suspected that any interest taken in him was merely a polite one gerald hullo bob good man bob hullo he goes up to lady farringdon and kisses her how are you mother lady farringdon its so nice that you could get away dear bob how are you father all right sir james ah bob come down to see your brother play for the county pamela quickly hes come down to see me havent you bob bob hullo wentworth hullo letty

mary bob will bring me out i want to have a word with him while i can everybody talks at once in this house sir james picking up his hat hows the city hey bob just as usual sir james coming round to the stables rob later on perhaps lady farringdon bob is bringing aunt harriet along dear sir james ah yes they go out together miss farringdon smoke bob and tell me how horrible the city is bob lighting a pipe and sitting down its damnable aunt harriet miss farringdon more damnable than usual bob yes miss farringdon any particular reason why bob after a long pause no miss farringdon nods to herself and then speaks very casually miss farringdon my bankers sent in my passbook the other day i seem to have a deal of money lying idle as they call it if anybody wanted it i should really be in no hurry to get it back again bob awkwardly thanks very much it isnt that after a pause not altogether miss farringdon it was a great pity you ever went into the city bob bob fiercely i could have told anybody that miss farringdon after waiting for him to say something more well suppose we go into the garden with the others she begins to get up and he goes to help her theres nothing you want to tell me bob bob looking away what would there be miss farringdon im a wise old woman they say and i dont talk bob i dont think you can help me er thanks very much miss farringdon quite naturally as she turns towards the door if you dont mind giving me your arm as they get to the door they are met by gerald and pamela coming in gerald hullo bob we were just coming back for you miss farringdon thoughtful gerald gerald pamelas idea she thought that the elder members of the family could discuss life more freely unhampered by the younger generation pamela what i really said was wheres bob gerald well its the same thing miss farringdon bob is looking after me thank you very much they go out together gerald after watching them go to pamela stay here a bit there are too many people and dogs and things outside come and sit on the sofa and ill tell you all the news he takes her hand and they go to the sofa together what ages youve been away pamela an hour and a half and it need not have been that if youd come with me gerald taking her hand if i had come with you i would have held your hand all the way pamela i shouldnt have minded gerald but just think what would have happened you would have had to have driven with one hand down all the hills we should have had a smashup before we got halfway a wellknown society beauty and a promising young gentleman in the foreign office would have been maimed for life and bob would have to have walked here carrying his portmanteau besides i love you going away from me when you come back youve only got to come into the room and the sun seems to shine pamela the sun always shines on gerald gerald does it thats a different sort of sunshine not the gentle caressing september afternoon sunshine which you wear all round you she is looking at him lovingly and happily as he says this but she withdraws into herself quickly as he pulls himself up and says with a sudden change of tone dear me im getting quite poetical and two minutes ago i was talking to wentworth about fetlocks pamela getting up oh gerald gerald gerald getting up and smiling at her oh pamela pamela pamela i wonder how much you really want me gerald ill show you when were married i dont think i could even begin to tell you now pamela wistfully couldnt you try gerald catches hold of her suddenly and holding her tightly to him kisses her again and again gerald there pamela releasing herself oh gerald my darling you frighten me sometimes gerald did i frighten you then pamela happily oh no no no no earnestly always want me very much gerald always be in need of me dont be too successful without me however much the sun shines on you let me make it gentler and more caressing for you gerald it is so darling didnt i say so pamela ah but i want such a lot of telling gerald laughing happily as he goes over to the table by the fireplace and takes a cigarette who was the fellow who threw something into the sea because he was frightened by his own luck what shall i throw looking at a presentation clock on the mantelpiece thats rather asking for it in a way it would be killing two birds with one stone oh lord i am lucky pamela coming to him and taking his arm as long as you dont throw me gerald pamela youre talking rubbish i talk a good deal myself but i do keep within the bounds lets go and chatter to bob about contangos i dont know what they are but they sound extraordinarily sober pamela gently poor old bob gerald quickly why poor old bob pamela hes worried about something i tried to get him to tell me as we came from the station but he wouldnt gerald poor old bob i suppose things are going up or down or something brokerage oneeighth thats whats worrying him i expect pamela i think he wants to talk to you about it be nice to him darling wont you gerald surprised nice to him pamela you know what i mean sympathetic i know its a difficult relationship brothers gerald all relationships are difficult but after you hes the person i love best in the world with a laugh but i dont propose to fall on his neck and tell him so pamela smiling i know you will help him if you can gerald of course i will though i dont quite see how hopefully perhaps hes only slicing his drives again pamela oh i love you gerald wonderingly do i love you or am i only just charmed by you gerald you said you loved me once you cant go back on that pamela then i love you and make a century for me on monday gerald well ill try of course the bowler may be in love too but even if i get out first ball i can say well anyhow pamela loves me pamela oh i think i hope you get out first ball gerald baby pamela pamela and on thursday we shall be alone together here and youve promised to take me out in the boat for the day gerald you mean youve promised to let me pamela what happy days there are in the world enter bob from the garden gerald hullo bob tea he moves towards the door bob cigarettes he goes over to the fireplace and fills his cigarette case gerald still i expect teas nearly ready pamela going towards door r at the back ill join you im not going out without a sunshade again exit there is an awkward silence bob to gerald i say gerald turning round hullo bob just wait a moment gerald comes back slowly gerald i warn you those are rotten cigarettes holds out his own case bob taking one thanks awkwardly youre so confoundedly difficult to get hold of nowadays never less than halfadozen all round you gerald laughing good old bob bob after lighting a cigarette i want to talk to you about something gerald well of course bob after a pause youve heard of marcus my partner gerald with the idea of putting himself and bob more at their ease good old marcus and farringdon its the most perfect name for a firm they sound so exactly as though they could sell you anything from a share to a shavingbrush marcus and farringdons pure badger two shillings giltedged badger halfacrown bob fiercely i suppose everything is just a pleasant joke to you gerald utterly surprised bob bob old boy whats the matter putting his hand on bobs shoulder i say bob i havent hurt you have i bob hopelessly oh jerry i believe im in the devil of a hole gerald you havent called me jerry since we were at school bob you got me out of holes then damn you and you were my younger brother oh jerry get me out of this one gerald but of course firmly as if a little nervous of a scene from bob my dear bob youre as right as anything youve got nothing on earth to worry about at the worst its only a question of money and we can always put that right somehow bob im not sure that it is only a question of money gerald frightened what do you mean turning away with a laugh youre talking nonsense bob gerald marcus is a wrong un fiercely an outandout wrong un gerald the only time i saw him he looked like it bob god knows what hes let me in for gerald you mean money bob more than that perhaps gerald you mean youre just going bankrupt bob no after a pause prosecution gerald well let them prosecute that ends marcus youre well rid of him bob miserably perhaps it isnt only marcus gerald sharply after this has sunk in what can they prosecute you for bob speaking rapidly what the devil did they ever send me to the city for i didnt want to go i was never any good at figures i loathe the whole thing what the devil did they want to send me there for and shove me on to a wrong un like marcus thats his life messing about with money in the city how can i stand out against a man like that i never wanted to go into it at all gerald holding out his cigarettecase have another cigarette they each light one and gerald sits down in the chair opposite to him lets look at it calmly youve done nothing dishonourable i know that thats obvious bob you see jerry im so hopeless at that sort of business naturally i got in the way of leaving things to marcus but thats all resentfully of course thats all gerald good well then youre making much too much fuss about it my dear boy innocent people dont get put into prison nowadays youve been reading detective stories the stain on the bath mat or the crimson sponge good lord i shall be coming to you next and saying that im going to be put in prison for selling secret documents to a foreign country these things dont happen they dont really old boy bob cheered but not convinced i dont know it looks devilish bad what i can make of it gerald well lets see what i can make of it bob trying not to show his eagerness i was wondering if you would come up on monday and well have a go at it together marcus has gone of course probably halfway to south america by now bitterly or wherever you go to gerald righto at least i cant come on monday of course but well have a go at it on thursday bob why cant you come on monday gerald well the surrey match bob bitterly i suppose as long as you beat surrey it doesnt matter if i go to prison gerald annoyed oh shut up about going to prison theres not the slightest chance of your going to prison you know perfectly well if there were that id walk on my hands and knees to london tonight to try and stop it as it is i have promised to play for the county its a particularly important match and i dont think its fair to let them down anyway if i did the whole family would want to know why and i dont suppose you want to tell them that yet bob mumbling you could say the foreign office had rung you up gerald earnestly really bob old boy im sure youre making too much of it dammit youve done nothing wrong what is there to worry about and if its only a question of money well manage it on our heads somehow ill come up directly the match is over it may be tuesday night with luck bob grumbling if the weathers like this its bound to last three days gerald then at the worst ill come first train thursday morning that i promise anyway why dont you consult wentworth hes a good chap and he knows all about the law he could probably help you much more than i could bob i suppose you think i like talking about it to everybody gerald getting up and touching bob gently on the shoulder as he goes past him poor old bob but youre as right as anything ill come up by the first train on thursday and well good lord bob whats the matter now gerald i am a damned fool why of course we arranged bob sneeringly and now you cant come on thursday i suppose gerald why you see i arranged bob you must keep your promise to the county but you neednt keep your promise to me gerald yes but the trouble is i promised pamela oh well that will have to go shell understand all right bob that holds directly the match is over i come and for the lords sake keep smiling till then bob its all very well for you i wish you could have well anyhow i suppose thursdays better than nothing youll see just how it is then getting up you wont say anything about it to the others gerald of course not what about pamela does she know anything bob she knows that im worried about something but of course she doesnt know what ive told you gerald all right then i wont tell her anything at least ill just say that bananas remain firm at and that ive got to go and see my broker about it smiling something like that bob goes towards the garden while gerald stops to wait for pamela at the door he turns round bob awkwardly er thanks exit gerald throws him a nod as much as to say thats all right he stands looking after him gives a little sigh laughs and says to himself poor old bob he is halfsitting on halfleaning against the table thinking it all over when pamela comes in again pamela i waited for him to go i knew he wanted to talk to you about something gerald he is all right isnt he gerald taking her hands who bob oh yes hes all right so is pamela pamela sure gerald oh yes hes all right pamela i take rather a motherly interest in bob you know what was worrying him gerald smiling his arithmetic again compound interest his masters are very pleased with his progress in english and he wants more pocketmoney he says that fourpence a week doesnt give him enough scope pamela smiling but he really is all right gerald well ive got to go up on thursday to see his house master i mean ive got to go up to town on thursday pamela drawing back thursday that was our day gerald gerald yes i know its a confounded nuisance pamela slowly yes it is rather a nuisance gerald im awfully sorry darling i hate it just as much as you do pamela i wonder if you do gerald shaking his head at her oh woman woman and you asked me to be kind to bob pamela it is for bob he really does want you gerald he thinks i can help him if i go up on thursday smiling we arent going to quarrel about that pamela holding out her hand to him come along of course we arent going to quarrel i dont think i could quarrel with you for more than five minutes only you make me wonder sometimes gerald getting up and taking her arm what do you wonder about pamela oh things they go out into the garden together act ii it is a quiet oldfashioned hotel which sir james and lady farringdon patronize in dover street on their occasional visits to london their private sittingroom is

me gerald smiling affectionately at her whenever theres any trouble about we send for nanny i wonder she ever came to london without you mason i told her id better come but she wouldnt listen to me dear dear there is trouble about now master gerald gerald yes mason i thought a few flowers would cheer us up i said to mr underhill before i started give me some flowers to take with me i said so that i can make the place look more homey and comfortable for her ladyship gerald and you have no one like nanny for that mason timidly is there any news of master bob this morning of course weve all been reading about it in the papers theyre not going to send him to prison gerald im afraid they are mason dear dear she goes on arranging the flowers hes not in prison now gerald no hes on bail for the moment perhaps hell be round here for lunch but im afraid that tonight mason even as a baby he was never quite like you master gerald never was there such a little lamb as you how long will they send him to prison for gerald we dont know yet i expect we shall know this evening but theres no doubt which way the case is going mason two of the men were making their bets about it over the suppertable last night i didnt wait long before giving them a piece of my mind i can promise you gerald turning round sharply who were they out they go tomorrow mason that wouldnt be quite fair would it sir theyre young and thoughtless like gerald to himself rather than to her after all its only what everybody else has been doing mason it wouldnt be anything very bad that master bob has done gerald emphatically no nanny no nothing bad only stupid mason i didnt know they put you in prison for being stupid some of us have been lucky gerald they can put you in prison for everything nanny being stupid or being wise being bad or being good being poor or yes or being rich mason putting her last touches to the flowers there now it looks much more like what her ladyships used to if you arent sent to prison for being bad it doesnt seem to matter so much gerald well it isnt nice you know mason theres lots of things that arent nice in the world they havent come your way yet and i only hope they never will gerald i wish they hadnt come bobs way mason ah master bob was born to meet them well ill go up to her ladyship now gerald oh are they back mason sir james and her ladyship came

gerald exit gerald pamela have you just come up pamela mother and i are staying with aunt judith oh gerald poor poor bob gerald have you seen him pamela he came down to us last week and he has been writing the most heartrending letters gerald youre a dear to be so good to him pamela how can one help it oh gerald he has been stupid how he could have gone on as he did hating it all understanding nothing but feeling all the time that things were wrong and yet too proud or too obstinate to ask for help hadnt you any idea any of you gerald awkwardly you never could get him to talk about the city at all if you asked him he changed the subject pamela reproachfully ah but how did you ask him lightly jokingly hullo rothschild hows the city getting on that sort of way you didnt really mind gerald smiling well if it comes to that he didnt much mind how i was getting on at the foreign office he never even said hullo grey how are balkans pamela you had plenty of people to say that bob was different i think i was the first person he really talked to about himself that was before i met you i begged him then to get out of it little knowing i wonder if it would have made any difference if you had gone up with him on oh well it doesnt matter now gerald defensively what were you going to say pamela nothing looking at him thoughtfully poor gerald its been bad for you too gerald youre not making it better by suggesting that ive let bob down in some way i dont quite know how pamela in distress oh gerald dont be angry with me i dont want to hurt you but i can only think of bob now youre so you want so little bob wants so much why doesnt he come i sent a note round to his rooms to say that id be here doesnt he have lunch here oh gerald suppose the case is over and theyve taken him to prison and ive never said goodbye to him he said it wouldnt be over till this evening but how would he know oh i cant bear it if theyve taken him away and his only friend never said goodbye to him gerald pamela pamela dont be so silly its all right dear of course im not angry with you and of course bob will be here i rang up wentworth an hour ago and he said the case cant end till this evening pamela recovering sorry gerald im being rather a fool gerald taking her hands youre being there is a knock at the door and he turns round impatiently oh what is it enter mason mason handing note theres a telephone message been waiting for you sir and her ladyship will be down directly gerald thank you nanny exit mason to pamela may i he reads it oh i say this is rather this is from wentworth hes taken bob round to lunch with him pamela going towards the door i must go gerald mr wentworth wont mind gerald stopping her look here dear its going to be quite all right wentworth rang up from his rooms theyre probably halfway through lunch by now and theyll be round in ten minutes pamela supposing he doesnt come supposing he didnt get my note it may be waiting for him in his rooms now gerald all right then darling ill ring him up pamela determined no ill do it yes gerald i know how to manage him it isnt only that i must see him myself but if bravely if the case is to be over this evening and if what we fear is going to happen he must oh he must say goodbye to his mother too gerald well if thats all ill tell him pamela he mightnt come for you he will for me no gerald i mean it none of you understand him i do gerald but supposing hes already started and you miss him pamela ill telephone to him at his rooms oh dont stand there talking gerald opening the door for her oh well but i think youre she has gone he walks up and down the room absently picking up papers and putting them down mason comes in and arranges the sofa r mason miss pamela gone master gerald gerald shes coming back enter lady farringdon lady farringdon oh gerald i hoped youd be here gerald kissing her ive only just got away i couldnt get round to the court seeing her to the sofa youre all right dear exit mason lady farringdon now youre here gerald i telegraphed for mason shes such a comfort how nicely shes done the flowers she sits down on the sofa gerald im so glad you sent for her lady farringdon i dont think your father enter sir james sir james ah gerald i had to take your mother out she was ah overcome they have adjourned i suppose gerald yes the judge is summing up directly after lunch bob will be round here when hes had something to eat sir james looking at his watch well i suppose we ought to try and eat something lady farringdon i couldnt touch anything gerald going over to her poor mother lady farringdon oh gerald couldnt you do anything im sure if youd gone into the witnessbox or told the judge oh why didnt you go to the bar and then you could have defended him you would have been so much better than that stupid man sir james i must say i didnt at all like his tone hes practically making out my son to be an idiot gerald well its really the only line he could take sir james what do you mean bob is far from being an idiot lady farringdon we always knew he wasnt as clever as gerald dear gerald you see bob either understood what was going on or he didnt if he did then hes in it as much as marcus if he didnt well of course we know that he didnt but no doubt the jury will think that he ought to have known sir james the old story a knave or a fool eh gerald the folly was in sending him there sir james angrily that was parkinsons fault it was he who recommended marcus to me i shall never speak to that man again to his wife mary if the parkinsons call you are out remember that gerald he never ought to have gone into business at all why couldnt you have had him taught farming or estate agency or something sir james weve got to move with the times my boy land is played out as a living for gentlemen they go into business nowadays if he cant get on there its his own fault he went to eton and oxford what more does he want lady farringdon to gerald you must remember he isnt clever like you gerald gerald oh well its no good talking about it now poor old bob wentworth thinks sir james ah now why couldnt wentworth have defended him that other man why to begin with i dont even call him a gentleman gerald wentworth recommended him but i wish he had gone to wentworth before as soon as he knew what was coming sir james why didnt he come to me why didnt he come to any of us then we might have done something lady farringdon didnt he even tell you gerald gerald awkwardly only just at the last it was it was too late to do anything then it was the saturday before he was arrested to himself the saturday before bob was arrested what a way to remember anything by lady farringdon to gerald bob is coming round dear gerald yes wentworths looking after him pamela will be here too sir james we havent seen much of pamela lately what does she think about it gerald sharply what do you mean sir james the disgrace of it i hope its not going to affect your engagement gerald disgrace what disgrace sir james well of course he hasnt been found guilty yet gerald whats that got to do with it what does it matter what a lot of rotten jurymen think of him we know that he has done nothing disgraceful lady farringdon im sure pamela wouldnt think anything like that of your brother dear gerald of course she wouldnt shes been a perfect angel to bob these last few weeks what does it matter if he does go to prison sir james i suppose you think i shall enjoy telling my neighbours when they ask me what my elder boy is doing that hes ah in prison gerald of course you wont enjoy it and i dont suppose bob will enjoy it either but thats no reason why we should make it worse for him by pretending that hes a disgrace to the family half to himself if anything weve done has helped to send him to prison then its we who should be ashamed sir james i dont profess to know anything about business but i flatter myself that i understand my fellow men if i had been in bobs place i should have pretty soon seen what that fellow marcus was up to i dont want to be unfair to bob i dont think that any son of mine would do a dishonourable action but the law is the law and if the law sends bob to prison i cant help feeling the disgrace of it gerald yes its rough on you and mother lady farringdon i dont mind about myself dear its you i feel so sorry for and bob of course gerald i dont see how its going to affect me sir james in the foreign office one has to be like caesars wife above suspicion gerald yes but in this case its caesars brotherinlaws partner whos the wrong un i dont suppose caesar was so particular about him lady farringdon i dont see how caesar comes into it at all sir james kindly i spoke in metaphors dear the door opens and wentworth appears gerald come in wentworth wheres bob wentworth i dropped him at his rooms a letter or something he wanted to get but hell be here directly nervously how do you do lady farringdon how do you do sir james sir james ah wentworth there is an awkward silence and nobody seems to know what to say wentworth very hot this morning sir james very hot very there is another awkward silence wentworth this is quite a good hotel my mother always stays here when shes in london sir james ah yes we use it a good deal ourselves lady farringdon how is mrs wentworth wentworth shes been keeping very well this summer thank you lady farringdon im so glad there is another awkward silence gerald impatiently oh whats the good of pretending this is a formal call wentworth tell us about bob hows he taking it wentworth he doesnt say much he had lunch in my rooms you got my message he couldnt bear the thought of being recognized by anyone so i had something sent up gerald realizing what it must feel like poor old bob wentworth lady farringdon i cant possibly tell you what i feel about this but i should like to say that all of us who know bob know that he couldnt do anything dishonourable whatever the result of the trial we shall feel just the same towards him lady farringdon is hardly able to acknowledge this and sir james goes across to comfort her sir james helplessly there there mary gerald seizing his opportunity to wentworth whatll he get wentworth quietly three months six months one cant be certain gerald cheering up thank the lord i imagined awful things sir james his ministrations over after all he hasnt been found guilty yet eh wentworth wentworth certainly sir james with a jury theres always hope sir james what do you think yourself wentworth i think he has been very foolish whether the law will call it criminally foolish i should hardly like to say i only wish i had known about it before he must have suspected something didnt he say anything to anybody sir james he told gerald apparently for some reason he preferred to keep his father in the dark gerald eagerly that was the day you came down to us wentworth five days before he was arrested i asked him to tell you but he wouldnt wentworth oh it was too late then marcus had absconded by that time gerald earnestly nobody could have helped him then could they wentworth oh no gerald to himself thank god sir james to lady farringdon as he looks at his watch well dear i really think you ought to try to eat something lady farringdon i couldnt james getting up but you must have your lunch sir james well one oughtnt to neglect ones health of course but i insist on your having a glass of claret anyhow mary what about you gerald gerald im all right ill wait for bob ive had something lady farringdon you wont let bob go without seeing us gerald of course not dear he goes with them to the door and sees them out gerald coming back to wentworth three months by jove thats nothing wentworth its long enough for a man with a grievance it gives him plenty of time to brood about it gerald anxiously who has bob got a grievance against particularly wentworth the world gerald relieved ah still three months wentworth i could do it on my head wentworth youre not bob bob will do it on his heart gerald we must buck him up wentworth if he takes it the right way its nothing i had awful thoughts of five years wentworth im not the judge you know it may be six months gerald of course how does he decide tosses up for it three months or six months or six years its all the same to him and theres the poor devil in the dock praying his soul out that hell hit on the shortest one good lord im glad im not a judge wentworth drily yes that isnt quite the way the law works gerald oh im not blaming the law smiling stick to it wentworth by all means but i should make a bad judge i should believe everything the prisoner said and just tell him not to do it again bob comes in awkwardly and stops at the door wentworth getting up come along bob taking out his case have a cigarette bob gruffly no thanks he takes out his pipe gerald brightly but awkwardly hullo bob old boy bob wheres pamela she said shed be here he sits down in the large armchair gerald if she said shed be here she will be here bob with a grunt m there is an awkward silence bob angrily to gerald why dont you say something you came here to say goodbye to me i suppose why dont you say it wentworth steady bob gerald eagerly look here bob old son you mustnt take it too hardly wentworth thinks it will only be three months dont you wentworth you know we none of us think any the worse of you for it bob thanks that will console me a lot in prison gerald oh bob dont be an old fool you know what i mean you have done nothing to be ashamed of so whats the good of brooding in prison and grousing about your bad luck and all that sort of thing if you had three months in bed with a broken leg youd try and get some sort of satisfaction out of it well so you can now if you try wentworth after waiting for bob to say something theres a good deal in that bob you know prison is largely what you make it bob what do either of you know about it gerald everything the man with imagination knows the best and the worst of everything bob fiercely imagination you think i havent imagined it gerald wentworths right you can make what you like of it you can be miserable anywhere if you let yourself be you can be happy anywhere if you try to be wentworth to lead him on i cant quite see myself being actually happy in prison gerald gerald i could wentworth i swear i could bob hed get popular with the warders hed love that gerald smiling silly old ass but there are lots of things one can do in prison only no one ever seems to think of them he gets interested and begins to walk up and down the room now take this solitary confinement theres so much fuss about if you look at it the right way theres nothing in it at all wentworth a bit boring perhaps gerald boring nonsense youre allowed one book a week from the prison library arent you wentworth you know you mustnt think that because im a barrister i know all about the inside of a prison gerald well suppose you are allowed one and you choose a french dictionary and try to learn it off by heart before you come out why its the chance of a lifetime to learn french wentworth well of course if you could get a french dictionary gerald well thered be some book there anyway if its a bible read it when youve read it count the letters in it have little bets with yourself as to which mans name is mentioned most times in it put your money on moses and see if you win anything like that if its a hymnbook count how many of the rhymes rhyme and how many dont try and make them all rhyme learn em by heart i dont say that that would be particularly useful to you in the business world afterwards but it would be amusing to see how quickly you could do it how many you could keep in your head at the same time wentworth this is too intellectual for me my brain would go in no time gerald you arent doing it all day of course there are other things physical training swedish exercises tell yourself that youll be able to push up fifty times from the ground before you come out learn to walk on your hands practise cartwheels if you like gad you could come out a hercules wentworth i cant help feeling that the strain of improving myself so enormously would tell on me gerald oh youd have your games and so on to keep you bright and jolly wentworth sarcastically golf and cricket i suppose gerald golf of course im doubtful about cricket you must have another one for cricket and im afraid the warder wouldnt play but golf and squash rackets and bowls and billiards and croquet wentworth in despair oh go on gerald really youre hopeless what the swiss family wentworth would have done if theyd ever been shipwrecked i cant think dont you ever invent anything for yourself excitedly man alive youve got a hymnbook and a piece of soap what more do you want you can play anything with that thoughtfully oh i forgot the olympic games standing long jump and they talk about the boredom of it wentworth thoughtfully youve got your ideas gerald i wonder if youd act up to them gerald one never knows but honestly i think so there is silence for a little bob is that all gerald oh bob i know its easy for me to talk bob i wonder you didnt say at once try not to think about it youre always helpful gerald youre a little difficult to help you know bob awkwardly i thought i might just give you an idea if i only could help you you know how bob doggedly i asked you to help me once gerald distressed oh i didnt realize then besides wentworth says it would have been much too late didnt you wentworth wentworth taking up his hat i think i must be getting along now holding out his hand goodbye bob i can only say the best of luck and er whatever happens you know what i feel about it bob shaking his hand goodbye wentworth and thanks very much for all youve done for me wentworth hurriedly thats all right to gerald quietly as he passes him on the way to the door you must bear with him gerald naturally hes nodding goodbye he goes out gerald going back to bob bob bob why doesnt pamela come i want pamela gerald speaking quickly look here think what you like of me for the moment but you must listen to what ive got to say you can imagine its somebody else speaking pamela if you like pamela would say just the same you must not go to prison and spend your time there brooding over the wrongs people have done to you and the way the world has treated you and all that sort of thing you simply must make an effort and and well come out as good a man as you went in i know its easy for me to talk but that doesnt make it any the less true oh bob be a be a sportsman about it you can take it out of me afterwards if you like but dont take it out of me now by by not bucking up just because i suggest it bob i want pamela why doesnt she come pamela has come in while he is saying this pamela here i am bob bob getting up at last i began to be afraid you were never coming pamela you couldnt think that i told you i was coming gerald look here pamela weve got to cheer old bob up bob almost shouting good lord cant you see that i dont want you i want pamela alone pamela putting her hand on geralds shoulder gerald dear you mustnt be angry with bob now let me be alone with him gerald with a shrug all right poor old bob he goes over to his brother and holds out his hand goodbye old boy and good luck bob coldly goodbye gerald shake hands bob bob no ive been nothing to you all your life you could have saved me from this and you wouldnt help me gerald angrily dont talk such rot pamela coming between them gerald dear youd better go bob wont always feel like this towards you but just now gerald indignantly pamela you dont believe this about me pamela i cant think of you dear now i can only think of bob gerald gives a shrug and goes out bob pamela pamela coming to him yes dear bob come and sit near me youre the only friend ive got in the world pamela you know that isnt true she sits down in the armchair and he sits on the floor at her feet bob if it hadnt been for you i should have shot myself long ago pamela that would have been rather cowardly wouldnt it bob i am a coward theres something about the law that makes people cowards its so whats the word it goes on you cant stop it you cant explain to it you cant even speak to it pamela but you can stand up to it you neednt run away from it bob i think i would have broken my bail and run if it hadnt been for you but you would have thought less of me if i had besides i shouldnt have seen you again pamela bob you mustnt just do or not do things for me you must do them because of yourself you must be brave because its you and honourable because its you and cheerful because its you you mustnt just say i wont let pamela down you must say i wont let myself down you must be proud of yourself bob bitterly ive been taught to be proud of myself havent i proud of myself whats the family creed i believe in gerald i believe in gerald the brother i believe in gerald the son i believe in gerald the nephew i believe in gerald the friend the lover gerald the holy marvel there may be brothers who dont mind that sort of thing but not when youre born jealous as i was do you think father or mother cares a damn what happens to me theyre upset of course and they feel the disgrace for themselves but the belovd gerald is all right and thats all that really matters pamela bob dear forget about gerald now dont think about him think about yourself bob i shant think about myself or about gerald when im in prison i shall only think of you pamela will it help you to think of me bob youre the only person in the world ive got to think of i found you first and then gerald took you from me just as hes always taken everything from me pamela no no not about gerald again lets get away from gerald bob you cant hes a devil to get away from there is silence for a little when i was a small boy i used to pray very hard on the last day of the holidays for a telegram to come saying that the school had been burnt down it never had pamela oh bob bob i suppose ive got about ten minutes more but nothing will happen pamela in a hopeless effort to be hopeful perhaps after all you might bob why cant the world end suddenly now it wouldnt matter to anybody they wouldnt know they wouldnt have time to understand he looks up and sees her face of distress and says all right pamela you neednt worry im going through with it all right pamela you must keep thinking of the afterwards only of the afterwards the day when you come back to us bob will that be such a very great day pamela is silent triumphant procession through the village all the neighbours hurrying out to welcome the young squire home great rush in the city to offer him partnerships pamela quietly do you want to go back to the city bob good god no pamela then why are you being sarcastic about it be honest with yourself bob you made a mess of the city oh i know you werent suited to it but men have had to do work they didnt like before now and they havent all made a mess of it youre getting your punishment now much more than you deserve and were all sorry for you but men have been punished unfairly before now and they have stood it youll have your chance when you come back ill stand by you for one and youve plenty of other friends but we cant help a man who wont help himself you know bon sulkily thank you pamela pamela shaking him bob bob dont be such a baby oh i want to laugh at you and yet my heart just aches for you youre just a little boy bob with a sigh on the last day of his holidays bob after a pause are you allowed to have letters in prison pamela i expect so every now and then bob you will write to me pamela of course dear whenever i may bob i suppose some beast will read it but you wont mind that will you pamela no dear bob ill write to you whenever they let me that will be something to look forward to will you meet me when i come out pamela happily yes bob so very gladly bob ill let you know when it is i expect ill be owed to pamela you must just think of that day all the time whenever you are unhappy or depressed or angry you must look forward to that day bob youll let it be a fine day wont you what shall we do pamela rather startled what bob what shall we do directly after i come out pamela well i suppose we i mean you well well come up to london together i suppose and youll go to your old rooms at least if you still have them bob instantly depressed again my old rooms thatll be lively pamela well unless youd rather bob im not going home if thats what you mean the prodigal son and gerald falling on my neck pamela stroking his head never mind gerald baby he turns round suddenly and seizes her hands bob in a rush whatever happens you mustnt desert me when i come out i want you ive got to know youre there waiting for me im not making love to you youre engaged to somebody else but you were my friend before you were his and youve got to go on being my friend i want you i want you more than he does im not making love to you you can marry him if you like but youve got to stand by me i want you pamela havent i stood by you bob in a low voice youve been an angel he kisses her hands and then gets up and walks away from her with his back to her looking out of the window he says when are you marrying him pamela taken by surprise i i dont know bob we had thought about but of course things are different now we havent talked about it lately bob casually i wonder if youd mind promising me something pamela what is it bob not to get married till after i come out after waiting for pamela to speak you will have about forty years together afterwards it isnt much to ask pamela why should it make a difference to you bob it would pamela it isnt a thing i like making promises about but i dont suppose for a moment would it help you very much bob bob from the bottom of his heart i dont want geralds wife to be waiting for me when i come out i want my friend pamela standing up and facing him as he turns round towards her all right bob she shall be there they stand looking at each other intently for a moment voices are heard outside and sir james lady farringdon and gerald come into the room act iii scene in the hall at sir james farringdons again it is autumn nom and there is a fire burning letty and tommy are on the sofa side by side holding hands and looking the picture of peaceful happiness indeed tommy has his mouth open

seeing you young people together by the way i interrupted you just now letty you did rather gerald well i absolutely refuse to go away now but of course if youre longing to show each other the stables

that pamela and i havent been writing to each other miss farringdon very innocently havent you gerald no you see oh i hate discussing pamela with anyone but youre different miss farringdon i always like that sort of compliment best gerald the unintended sort gerald i think you know pamela felt that bobs doing to prison might make a difference i dont mean that she didnt like the disgrace for herself but that she was afraid that i mightnt like it for her and so she went away and beyond a letter or two at the start there hasnt been a pamela miss farringdon but gerald went on being successful gerald oh aunt tabitha aunt tabitha if ever i were going to be conceited and i dont think i am really youd soon stop it wouldnt you i wonder if you do know me as well as you think you think im all outside dont you and inside theres nothing miss farringdon oh youve got brains ill grant you that youre the first farringdon thats had any of the men of course gerald oh brains i dont mean

a heart at all miss farringdon well youve never shown it youve shown a lot of delightful things which silly people mistake for it but thats all gerald curtly no ive never shown my heart to anybody

the way of being looked after by other people i wish you would look after him and tell him what to do its going to be difficult for him i expect hell want to get away from all of us for a bit wheres

dont know why ive been rather unkind to you sometimes gerald what an idea you know ive loved our little skirmishes miss farringdon thats because youve been happy and havent minded one way or another but if ever you were in trouble gerald i dont think i should be unsympathetic gerald you dear of course you wouldnt but why do you say that now just when i am so happy miss farringdon getting up

big nephew come and tuck me up on the sofa in the drawingroom i shall be quite happy there she puts her hand on his arm and they go together towards the door in front of the staircase miss farringdon poor gerald gerald laughing why poor they go out together the door on the right at the back opens quietly and bob comes in he stands there for a moment looking at the hall and then speaks over his shoulder to somebody behind him bob its all right theres nobody here pamela i wonder where gerald is bob youre sure hes down here pamela yes i had a letter from him he told me he was going to be bob going up to her pamela you cant see him alone pamela i must you can see him afterwards but i must see him alone first poor gerald bob he never really loved you pamela i dont think he did really but it will hurt him bob eagerly say youre not sorry for what youre doing pamela arent i doing it bob say you love me and not gerald say you really love me and its not just because you are sorry for me pamela oh i have so much in my heart for you bob im glad im marrying you but you must always love me and want me as you want me now bob seizing her is his arms by god youll get that he kisses her fiercely pamela satisfied oh bob oh bob im glad i found you at last she goes away from him and stands looking into the fire one hand on the mantelpiece bob shall i go and look for gerald pamela looking into the fire yes no hell come bob you wont let him talk you round pamela looking up at him in surprise oh no im quite safe now bob i can never thank you for all youve done for all youve been to me when we are out of this cursd country and i have you to myself i will try to show you she says nothing and he walks restlessly about the room he picks up a hat and says hullo tommys here pamela quickly i dont want to see him i dont want to see anybody we must just tell gerald and then go bob anybody might come at any moment you should have let me write as i wanted to or waited till he came back to london pamela weve given up being cowards perhaps youd better try and find him well only tell gerald if we see the others well just have to make the best of it bob moving off towards the door in front of the staircase all right if i find him ill send him in here he goes out pamela drops into a chair and remains looking at the fire gerald coming down from the gallery above suddenly catches sight of her gerald rushing down the stairs pamela why pamela excitedly why are you you said tomorrow pamela you said never mind youre here oh bless you pamela has got up to meet him and he is now standing holding her hands and looking at her happily pamelas here alls right with the world he leans forward to kiss her but she stops him pamela nervously no no ive something to tell you gerald gerald ive got a thousand things to tell you pamela bobs here gerald excited bob did you come down with him pamela yes gerald i had a telegram but it didnt say did you meet him why didnt he tell us where is he pamela he just went to look for you gerald ill soon find him he turns away to go after bob but pamela stops him pamela gerald gerald turning round yes pamela never mind bob for the moment i wanted to see you alone gerald coming back quickly of course hang bob come on the sofa and tell me everything jove its wonderful to see you again youve been away for years he takes her hand and tries to lead her towards the sofa but she stops pamela gerald youre making it very hard for me ive got something to tell you gerald afraid suddenly and speaking sharply what do you mean pamela oh dont look at me like that i know it will hurt you but it wont be more than that i want you to release me from my promise gerald what promise pamela in a low voice my promise to marry you gerald i dont understand why pamela bravely i want to marry bob keeping his eyes on her all the time gerald moves slowly away from her gerald to himself bob bob but you knew bob first pamela yes gerald and then you promised to marry me you couldnt have been in love with him i dont understand pamela sadly i dont understand either but thats how its happened gerald and to think how ive been throwing you in bobs way and wanting you and him to be fond of each other fiercely that didnt make you think that i didnt love you pamela faltering i i dont you didnt gerald i was so confident of you that was your fault you made me pamela i think you could have made me love you if you hadnt been so confident gerald i trusted you you had told me i knew i should never change and i thought i knew you wouldnt pamela i was wrong i never did love you gerald then why did you say pamela looking at him rather wistfully youre rather charming gerald you know and you gerald turning away from her furiously damn charming thats what you all say im sick of it you think that if a mans charming thats the end of him and that all hes good for is to amuse a few old ladies at a tea party im sick of it the rude rough man with the heart of gold thats the only sort that can have a heart at all according to some of you pamela utterly surprised by this gerald gerald im sorry pamela of course you wouldnt understand but we were just talking with a sudden disarming smile i dont know whether an apology is overdoing the charm pamela in distress oh gerald you couldnt really have loved me you dont really now of course it will hurt you but youll soon get over it oh whats the good of my talking like this ive never really known you i dont know you now gerald quietly its no good now anyway he walks away from her and looks out through the windows at the back just tell me one or two things were you in love with him when he went to prison pamela i dont know really i dont know i was so dreadfully sorry for him all that time before and i felt so very friendly towards him so very oh gerald so motherly and i wanted to be wanted so badly and you didnt seem to want me in that way that was why when he had gone i went right away from you and asked you not to write to me i wanted to think it all out alone gerald but you wrote to bob pamela oh gerald he wanted it so badly gerald im sorry pamela i wrote to him and he wrote to me i met him when he came out he told me when to come i suppose i had decided by then we came down here to tell you i had to come at once gerald you do love him pamela it isnt just pity pamela i do gerald i think i found that out this afternoon timidly say you dont hate me very much gerald i wish to god i could what are you and bob going to do pamela canada as soon as we can ive got friends there weve a little money between us bob ought to have done it a long time ago coming up to him just do one more nice thing for me before we go gerald moving away from her on pretence of getting a cigarette what is it pamela bob will want to see you before he goes gerald i dont want to see him pamela ah but you must gerald what have we got to say to each other pamela i dont know but i feel you must see him otherwise hell think that he ran away from you gerald with a shrug all right youll go back to london at once i suppose pamela yes we hired a car we left it outside at the gates we didnt want to see anybody but you if possible gerald father and mother are out aunt harriet knows oh and tommy and letty that bob was coming today nobody else but i can make up something well keep tommy and letty out of it for the moment of course theyll all have to know in the end pamela well write of course gerald yes tommy and letty are engaged by the way pamela oh understanding how he must feel about it oh gerald she makes a movement towards him but he takes no notice ill send bob to you hes waiting outside i expect timidly goodbye gerald gerald still with his back to her goodbye pamela pamela wont you gerald from the bottom of his heart go away go away i cant bear the sound of your voice i cant bear to look at you go away pamela oh gerald she goes out gerald looks up as she goes out and then looks quickly down again when bob comes in he is still resting with his arm on the mantelpiece looking into the fire gerald looking up hullo bob hullo after a pause is that all youve got to say gerald ive just seen pamela bob trying not to show his eagerness well gerald well isnt that enough bob what do you mean gerald bitterly do you want me to fall on your neck and say take her and be happy bob you never loved her gerald thats a lie and anyhow we wont discuss it shes going to marry you and thats an end of it bob very eagerly she is going to gerald sharply dont you know it bob mumbling yes but she might ah you couldnt charm her away from me this time gerald with an effort i dont know what you mean by this time i think wed better leave pamela out of it altogether shes waiting for you outside last time i offered to shake hands with you you had some fancied grievance against me and you wouldnt now if theres any grievance between us its on my side holding out his hand goodbye bob and quite honestly good luck bob ignoring the hand magnanimous gerald gerald looks at him in surprise for a moment then he shrugs his shoulders turns round and goes back to the mantelpiece and takes a cigarette from the box there gerald im tired of you bob if you dont want me i dont want you he sits down in a chair and lights his cigarette bob and now i suppose youre thoroughly pleased with yourself and quite happy gerald looking at him in absolute wonder happy you fool something in bobs face surprises him and he gets up and says why do you suddenly hate me like this bob with a bitter laugh suddenly gerald almost frightened bob bob letting the jealousy that has been pent up for years come out at last youre surprised surprised you would be youve never stopped to think what other people are thinking you take it for granted that they all love you and thats all you care about do you think i liked playing second fiddle to you all my life do you think ive never had any ambitions of my own i suppose you thought i was quite happy being one of the crowd of admirers round you all saying oh look at gerald isnt he wonderful gerald astounded bob i had no idea i never dreamt bob they thought something of me when i was young when i first went to school they thought something of me i daresay even you thought something of me then i could come back in the holidays and tell you what school was like and what a lot they thought of me they didnt think much of me when you came you soon put a stop to that i was just young farringdons brother then and when we came home together all the talk was of the wonderful things gerald had done it was like that at eton it was like that at oxford its always been like that i managed to get away from you a bit after oxford but it went on just the same how do you do mr farringdon are you any relation to gerald farringdon with the utmost contempt and you actually thought i liked that you thought i enjoyed it you thought i smiled modestly and said oh yes hes my brother my young brother isnt he wonderful gerald hardly able to realise it and youve felt like this for years to himself for years bob not noticing him and that wasnt enough for you they got you into the foreign office they could have got me there they could have put me into the army almost shouting arent i the eldest son but no it didnt matter about the eldest son never mind about him put him in the city anywhere as long as hes out of the way if we have any influence we must use it for gerald the wonderful gerald gerald if this is an indictment its drawn against the wrong person bob more quietly then at last i found a friend somebody who took me for my own sake bitterly and like a damned fool i brought her down here and she saw you i might have known what would happen gerald pamela bob yes and you took her after taking everything you could all your life you took her she was bobs friend that was quite enough she must be one more in the crowd of admirers round you so you took her triumphantly ah but i got her back in the end ive got her now and i think im square gerald gerald yes i think youre square now bob rather jauntily as he leans back against the end of the sofa and feels for his cigarettecase i seem to have surprised you rather gerald youve thought like that about me for years and youve never said anything youve felt like that about pamela and youve never said anything bob ive been thinking it over particularly these last few months in prison gerald you have a lot of time for thinking in prison oh i know you advised me to stand on my head and waggle my legs in the air something like that you were full of brilliant ideas i had a better idea i thought gerald realising his state of mind my god what a time you must have had bob furiously damn you i wont be pitied by you gerald coolly and youre not going to be youve talked about yourself and thought about yourself quite long enough now im going to talk about myself bob and it wont be the first time either gerald quickly it will be the first time to you you say ive never tried to understand your feelings have you ever tried to understand mine my god bob ive thought a good deal more about you than you have about me have i ever talked about myself to you when a boy does well at school he likes talking about it did i ever bore you with it never because i knew how youd feel about it i knew how id feel about it and so i tried to make it easy for you bob very noble of you gerald angrily dont be such a damned fool bob whats the good of talking like that if whatever i do is wrong then youre only convicting yourself youre not convicting me according to you if i talk about myself im being conceited and superior and if i dont talk about myself im being noble and still more superior in fact whatever i do i cant please you that doesnt condemn me it condemns yourself wearily whats the good of talking bob go on i like to hear it gerald very well well take the definite accusations first apart from the general charge of being successful whatever that amounts to you accuse me of two things one you didnt mention just now but it was more or less obvious the last time i saw you that was that i neglected to help you when you were in trouble and that through me you went to prison bob yes i forgot that this time with an unpleasant laugh but i didnt forget it in prison gerald you had a sense of humour once bob i dont know whats happened to it lately dont you think its rather funny to hate a person steadily for fifteen years judge all his acts as youd hardly judge those of your bitterest enemy and yet the first time you are in trouble to expect him to throw everything on one side and rush to your help and then to feel bitterly illused if he doesnt bob rather taken aback i you didnt i didnt gerald quietly thats been rather like you all through bob you were always the one who had to be helped you were always the one who was allowed to have the grievance still that doesnt make it any better for me if i could have helped you and didnt however im quite certain that i couldnt have helped you then well take the other accusation that i stole pamela from you ive only got two things to say to that first that pamela was not engaged to you and was perfectly free to choose between us secondly that you never told me and i hadnt the slightest idea that you were the least bit fond of her indeed i dont believe you realized it yourself at that time bob rather shamefaced ive realized it since gerald yes and youve taken pamela back since i think if i were you i would keep her out of it bob looks away and gerald goes on now we come to the general charge which seems to be very deliberately that im better than you at games that ive got better manners than you that im cleverer than you in fact that im superior to you in every outward way and am only inferior to you in well in the moral qualities quietly bob what are these moral qualities in which i am so deficient and you so endowed you judge me by the qualities i am supposed to have shown to you now what have you shown to me have you been generous have you been friendly have you been sympathetic no youve just told me that for fifteen years youve hated me and been jealous of me things have been rotten for you i admit have you ever tried to make the best of them youve had disadvantages to fight against have you ever fought against them never youve turned every trouble into a grievance and hoarded it up i said just now i was sick of you i am utterly you said just now you didnt want my pity you havent got it youve only got my contempt he turns away and then suddenly turns back and holding out his hand to bob says utterly unexpectedly and now damn you will you shake hands bob incoherent with surprise what do you i you didnt geralds hand is still held out and he is smiling oh jerry he takes the hand gerald thats all right goodbye bob and good luck bob bewildered goodbye he tuns round and goes towards the door halfway there he looks over his shoulder and says awkwardly had rather a rotten time in prison gerald nods at the door bob says pamela and i with rather a forced smile gerald nods again and bob goes out left alone gerald stands looking into the fire and thinking he tries sitting down to see if that will make thinking any pleasanter then he tries standing up again he goes to the door in front of the staircase and opens it to see if there is anybody there then he goes to the windows at the back and looks through them evidently he sees somebody for he beckons and then returns to his old place by the fire in a few moments letty and tommy come in tommy excitedly i say has bob come gerald why tommy i could have sworn we saw him just now as we were coming in at least letty swore she did letty i know i did tommy so i gave him a shout but he fairly trekked off was it bob gerald yes now look here i want you to be two nice people dont say anything to anybody he came but he didnt want to see the whole crowd of us hes going to canada ill do all the explaining if you two just say nothing do you see letty of course gerald tommy rather old boy besides it will make it much better for letty and me letty no rival attraction tommy means enter sir james and lady farringdon from the outer hull having just returned from their lunch sir james ah here you all are gerald had a good lunch sir james lunch was all right but the people were dull very dull lady farringdon there were one or two nice ones i thought dear they all knew about you gerald tommy proudly of course they would sir james oh one or two were all right but he was well i was discussing shorthorns with him after lunch and he hardly seemed interested at all dull very dull ive got no use for that sort of man during this speech the butler has come in with a telegram for gerald gerald taking it just a moment he reads it quickly no answer exit butler gerald reads his telegram again more thoughtfully lady farringdon from pamela dear gerald from the office i shall have to go up at once lady farringdon very disappointed oh gerald sir james something on gerald rather an important thing really i never thought i should get it but there was just a chance looking at his watch oh i can do it comfortably sir james obviously proud that gerald is in the thick of things what is it i suppose you mustnt tell us gerald something abroad sir james diplomatic mission eh gerald yes letty that does sound so frightfully exciting lady farringdon proudly oh gerald thoughtfully i wish we had known about it this morning we could have mentioned it at lunch sir james that ought to lead to something gerald yes i think it will its rather an opportunity they are all round him now just as they have always been the buzz begins sir james aha youll be an ambassador yet what do you think of that letty letty well done gerald lady farringdon how like you gerald tommy good old gerald i never knew such a chap you really are gerald softly i wish i werent tommy oh i wish i werent they dont hear him they are still buzzing the boy comes home a comedy in one act characters uncle james aunt emily philip mary mrs higgins this play was first produced by mr owen nares at the victoria palace theatre on september with the following cast philip owen nares uncle james tom reynolds aunt emily dorothy radford mary adah dick mrs higgins rachel de solla the boy comes home scene a room in uncle jamess house in the cromwell road time the day after the war any room in uncle jamess house is furnished in heavy midvictorian style this particular morningroom is perhaps solider and more respectable even than the others from the heavy table in the middle of it to the heavy engravings on the walls there are two doors to it the one at the back opens into the hall the one at the side into the diningroom philip comes from the hall and goes into the diningroom apparently he finds nothing there for he returns to the morningroom looks about him for a moment and then rings the bell it is ten oclock and he wants his breakfast he picks up the paper and sits in a heavy armchair in front of the fire a pleasantlooking wellbuilt person of twentythree with an air of decisiveness about him mary the parlourmaid comes in mary did you ring master philip philip absently yes i want some breakfast please mary mary coldly breakfast has been cleared away an hour ago philip exactly thats why i rang you can boil me a couple of eggs or something and coffee not tea mary im sure i dont know what mrs higgins will say philip getting up who is mrs higgins mary the cook and shes not used to being put about like this philip do you think shell say something mary i dont know what shell say philip you neednt tell me you know if you dont want to anyway i dont suppose it will shock me one gets used to it in the army he smiles pleasantly at her mary well ill do what i can sir but breakfast at eight sharp is the masters rule just as it used to be before you went away to the war philip before i went away to the war i did a lot of silly things dont drag them up now more curtly two eggs and if theres a ham bring that along too he turns away mary doubtfully as she prepares to go well im sure i dont know what mrs higgins will say exit mary as she goes out she makes way for aunt emily to come in a kindhearted midvictorian lady who has never had any desire for the vote emily there you are philip goodmorning dear did you sleep well philip rather splendidly thanks aunt emily how are you he kisses her emily and did you have a good breakfast naughty boy to be late for it i always thought they had to get up so early in the army philip they do thats why theyre so late when they get out of the army emily dear me i should have thought a habit of four years would have stayed with you philip every morning for four years as ive shot out of bed ive said to myself wait a time will come smiling that doesnt really give a habit a chance emily well i daresay you wanted your sleep out i was so afraid that a really cosy bed would keep you awake after all those years in the trenches philip well one isnt in the trenches all the time and one gets leave if ones an officer emilyreproachfully you didnt spend much of it with us philip philip taking her hands i know but you did understand didnt you dear emily were not very gay and i know you must have wanted gaiety for the little time you had but i think your uncle james felt it after all dear youve lived with us for some years and he is your guardian philip i know youve been a darling to me always aunt emily but awkwardly uncle james and i emily of course he is a little difficult to get on with im more used to him but im sure he really is very fond of you philip philip hm i always used to be frightened of him i suppose hes just the same he seemed just the same last night and he still has breakfast at eight oclock been making pots of money i suppose emily he never tells me exactly but he did speak once about the absurdity of the excessprofits tax you see jam is a thing the army wants philip it certainly gets it emily it was so nice for him because it made him feel he was doing his bit helping the poor men in the trenches enter mary mary mrs higgins wishes to speak to you maam she looks at philip as much as to say there you are emily getting up yes ill come to philip i think id better just see what she wants philip philip firmly to mary tell mrs higgins to come here mary hesitates and looks at her mistress at once please exit mary emily upset philip dear i dont know what mrs higgins will say philip no nobody seems to i thought we might really find out for once emily going towards the door perhaps id better go philip putting his arm round her waist oh no you mustnt you see she really wants to see me emily you philip yes i ordered breakfast five minutes ago emily philip my poor boy why didnt you tell me and i daresay i could have got it for you though i dont know what mrs higgins an extremely angry voice is heard outside and mrs higgins stout and aggressive comes in mrs higgins truculently you sent for me maam emily nervously yes er i think if you perhaps philip calmly i sent for you mrs higgins i want some breakfast didnt mary tell you mrs higgins breakfast is at eight oclock it always has been as long as ive been in this house and always will be until i get further orders philip well youve just got further orders two eggs and if theres a ham mrs higgins orders were talking about orders from whom in this house do i take orders may i ask philip in this case from me mrs higgins playing her trumpcard in that case maam i wish to give a months notice from today inclusive philip quickly before his aunt can say anything certainly in fact youd probably prefer it if my aunt gave you notice and then you could go at once we can easily arrange that to aunt emily as he takes out a fountain pen and chequebook what do you pay her emily faintly fortyfive pounds philip writing on his knee twelves into fortyfive pleasantly to mrs higgins but without looking up i hope you dont mind a coxs cheque some people do but this is quite a good one tearing it out here you are mrs higgins taken aback whats this philip your wages instead of notice now you can go at once mrs higgins who said anything about going philip surprised im sorry i thought you did mrs higgins if its only a bit of breakfast i dont say but what i mightnt get it if im asked decent philip putting back the cheque then let me say again two eggs ham and coffee and mary can bring the ham up at once and ill get going on that turning away thanks very much mrs higgins well i well well exit speechless philip surprised is that all she ever says it isnt much to worry about emily philip how could you i should have been terrified philip well you see ive done your job for two years out there emily what job philip mess president i think ill go and see about that ham he smiles at her and goes out into the diningroom aunt emily wanders round the room putting a few things tidy as is her habit when she is interrupted by the entrance of uncle james james is not a big man nor an impressive one in his black morningcoat and his thin straggly beard now going grey does not hide a chin of any great power but he has a severity which passes for strength with the weak james philip down yet emily hes just having his breakfast james looking at his watch ten oclock snapping it shut and putting it back ten oclock i say ten oclock emily emily yes dear i heard you james you dont say anything emily vaguely i expect hes tired after that long war james thats no excuse for not being punctual i suppose he learnt punctuality in the army emily i expect he learnt it james but i understood him to say that hed forgotten it james then the sooner he learns it again the better i particularly stayed away from the office today in order to talk things over with him and looking cat his watch heres ten oclock past ten and no sign of him im practically throwing away a day emily what are you going to talk to him about james his future naturally i have decided that the best thing he can do is to come into the business at once emily are you really going to talk it over with him james or are you just going to tell him that he must come james surprised what do you mean whats the difference naturally we shall talk it over first and er naturally hell fall in with my wishes emily i suppose he can hardly help himself poor boy james not until hes twentyfive anyhow when hes twentyfive he can have his own money and do what he likes with it emily timidly but i think you ought to consult him at little dear after all he has been fighting for us james with his back to the fire now thats the sort of silly sentiment that theres been much too much of i object to it strongly i dont want to boast but i think i may claim to have done my share i gave up my nephew to my country and i er suffered from the shortage of potatoes to an extent that you probably didnt realize indeed if it hadnt been for your fortunate discovery about that time that you didnt really like potatoes i dont know how we should have carried on and as i think ive told you before the excessprofits tax seemed to me a singularly stupid piece of legislation but i paid it and i dont go boasting about how much i paid emily unconvinced well i think that philips four years out there have made him more of a man he doesnt seem somehow like a boy who can be told what to do im sure theyve taught him something james ive no doubt that theyve taught him something about er bombs and er which end a revolver goes off and how to form fours but i dont see that that sort of thing helps him to decide upon the most suitable career for a young man in afterwar conditions emily well i can only say youll find him different james i didnt notice any particular difference last night emily i think youll find him rather more i cant quite think of the word but mrs higgins could tell you what i mean james of course if he likes to earn his living any other way he may but i don t see how he proposes to do it so long as i hold the pursestrings looking at his watch perhaps youd better tell him that i cannot wait any longer emily opens the door leading into the diningroom and talks through it to philip emily philip your uncle is waiting to see you before he goes to the office will you be long dear philip from the diningroom is he in a hurry james shortly yes emily he says he is rather dear philip couldnt he come and talk in here it wouldnt interfere with my breakfast james no emily he says hed rather you came to him darling philip resigned oh well emily to james hell be here directly dear just sit down in front of the fire and make yourself comfortable with the paper he wont keep you long she arranges him james taking the paper the morning is not the time to make oneself comfortable its a most dangerous habit i nearly found myself dropping off in front of the fire just now i dont like this hanging about wasting the day he opens the paper emily you should have had a nice sleep dear while you could we were up so late last night listening to philips stories james yes yes he begins a yawn and stifles it hurriedly you mustnt neglect your duties emily ive no doubt you have plenty to do emily all right james then ill leave you but dont be hard on the boy james sleepily i shall be just emily you can rely upon that emily going to the door i dont think thats quite what i meant she goes out james who is now quite comfortable begins to nod he wakes up with a start turns over the paper and nods again soon he is breathing deeply with closed eyes philip coming in sorry to have kept you waiting but i was a bit late for breakfast he takes out his pipe are we going to talk business or what james taking out his match a bit late i make it just two hours philip pleasantly all right uncle james call it two hours late or twentytwo hours early for tomorrows breakfast if you like he sits down in a chair on the opposite side of the table from his uncle and lights his pipe james you smoke now philip staggered i what james nodding at his pipe you smoke philip good heavens what did yolk think we did in france james before you start smoking all over the house i should have thought you would have asked your aunts permission philip looks at him in amazement and then goes to the door philip calling aunt emily aunt emily do you mind my smoking in here aunt emily from upstairs of course not darling philip to james as he returns to his chair of course not darling he puts back his pipe in his mouth james now understand once and for all philip while you remain in my house i expect not only punctuality but also civility and respect i will not have impertinence philip unimpressed well thats what i want to talk to you about uncle james about staying in your house i mean james i dont know what you do mean philip well we dont get on too well together and i thought perhaps id better take rooms somewhere you could give me an allowance until i came into my money or i suppose you could give me the money now if you really liked i dont quite know how father left it to me james coldly you come into your money when you are twentyfive your father very wisely felt that to trust a large sum to a mere boy of twentyone was simply putting temptation in his way whether i have the power or not to alter his dispositions i certainly dont propose to do so philip if it comes to that i am twentyfive james indeed i had an impression that that event took place in about two years time when did you become twentyfive may i ask philip quietly it was on the somme we were attacking the next day and my company was in support we were in a socalled trench on the edge of a wood a damned rotten place to be and we got hell the company commander sent back to ask if we could move the co said certainly not hang on we hung on doing nothing you know just hanging on and waiting for the next day of course the boche knew all about that he had it on us nicely sadly dear old billy he was one of the best our company commander you know they got him poor devil that left me in command of the company i sent a runner back to ask if i could move well id had a bit of a scout on my own and found a sort of trench five hundred yards to the right not what youd call a trench of course but compared to that wood well it was absolutely hyde park i described the position and asked if i could go there my man never came back i waited an hour and sent another man he went west too well i wasnt going to send a third it was murder so i had to decide wed lost about half the company by this time you see well there were three things i could do hang on move to this other trench against orders or go back myself and explain the situation i moved and then i went back to the co and told him id moved and then i went back to the company again quietly that was when i became twentyfive or thirtyfive or fortyfive james recovering himself with an effort ah yes yes he coughs awkwardly no doubt points like that frequently crop up in the trenches i am glad that you did well out there and im sure your colonel would speak kindly of you but when it comes to choosing a career for you now that you have left the army my advice is not altogether to be despised your father evidently thought so or he would not have entrusted you to my care philip my father didnt foresee this war james yes yes but you make too much of this war all you young boys seem to think youve come back from france to teach us our business youll find that it is you wholl have to learn not we philip im quite prepared to learn in fact i want to james excellent then we can consider that settled philip well we havent settled yet what business im going to learn james i dont think thats very difficult i propose to take you into my business youll start at the bottom of course but it will be a splendid opening for you philip thoughtfully i see so youve decided it for me the jam business james sharply is there anything to be ashamed of in that philip oh no nothing at all only it doesnt happen to appeal to me james if you knew which side your bread was buttered it would appeal to you very considerably philip im afraid i cant see the butter for the jam james i dont want any silly jokes of that sort you were glad enough to get it out there ive no doubt philip oh yes perhaps thats why im so sick of it now no its no good uncle james you must think of something else james with a sneer perhaps youve thought of something else philip well i had some idea of being an architect james you propose to start learning to be an architect at twentythree philip smiling well i couldnt start before could i james exactly and now youll find its too late philip is it arent there going to be any more architects or doctors or solicitors or barristers because weve all lost four years of our lives are all the professions going to die out james and how old do you suppose youll be before youre earning money as an architect philip the usual time whatever that may be if im four years behind so is everybody else james well i think its high time you began to earn a living at once philip look here uncle james do you really think that you can treat me like a boy whos just left school do you think four years at the front have made no difference at all james if there had been any difference i should have expected it to take the form of an increased readiness in obey orders and recognize authority philip regretfully you are evidently determined to have a row perhaps i had better tell you once and for all that i refuse to go into the turnip and vegetable narrow business james thumping the table angrily and perhaps id better tell you sir once and for all that i dont propose to allow rude rudeness from an impertinent young puppy philip reminiscently i remember annoying our brigadier once he was covered with red had a very red face about twenty medals and a cold blue eye he told me how angry he was for about five minutes while i stood to attention im afraid you arent nearly impressive uncle james james rather upset oh recovering himself fortunately i have other means of impressing you the power of the purse goes a long way in this world i propose to use it philip i see yes thats rather awkward isnt it james pleasantly i think youll find it very awkward philip thoughtfully yes with an amused laugh james settles down to his paper as if the interview were over philip to himself i suppose i shall have to think of another argument he takes out a revolver from him pocket and fondles it affectionately james looking up suddenly as he is doing this amazed what on earth are you doing philip souvenir from france do you know uncle james that this revolver has killed about twenty germans james shortly oh well dont go playing about with it here or youll be killing englishmen before you know where you are philip well you never know he raises it leisurely and points it at his uncle its a nice little weapon james angrily put it down sir you ought to have grown out of monkey tricks like that in the army you ought to know better than to point an unloaded revolver at anybody thats the way accidents always happen philip not when youve been on a revolver course and know all about it besides it is loaded james very angry because he is frightened suddenly put it down at once sir philip turns it away from him and examines it carelessly whats the matter with you have you gone mad suddenly philip mildly i thought youd be interested in it its shot such a lot of germans james well it wont want to shoot any more and the sooner you get rid of it the better philip i wonder does it ever occur to you uncle james that there are about a hundred thousand people in england who own revolvers who are quite accustomed to them and who have nobody to practise on now james no sir it certainly doesnt philip thoughtfully i wonder if it will make any difference you know one gets so used to potting at people its rather difficult to realize suddenly that one oughtnt to james getting up i dont know what the object of this tomfoolery is if it has one but you understand that i expect you to come to the office with me tomorrow at nine oclock kindly see that youre punctual he turns to go away philip softly uncle james james over his shoulder i have no more philip in his parade voice damn it sir stand to attention when you talk to an officer james instinctively turns round and stiffens himself thats better you can sit down if you like he motions james to his chair with the revolver james going nervously to his chair what does this bluff mean philip it isnt bluff its quite serious pointing the revolver at his uncle do sit down james sitting donor threats eh philip persuasion james at the point of the revolver you settle your arguments by force good heavens sir this is just the very thing that we were fighting to put down philip we were fighting we we uncle youre humorist james well you if you prefer it although those of us who stayed at home philip yes never mind about the excess profits now i can tell you quite well what we fought for we used force to put down force thats what im doing now you were going to use force the force of money to make me do what you wanted now im using force to stop it he levels the revolver again james youre youre going to shoot your old uncle philip why not ive shot lots of old uncles landsturmers james but those were germans its different shooting germans youre in england now you couldnt have a crime on your conscience like that philip ah but you mustnt think that after four years of war one has quite the same ideas about the sanctity of human life how could one james youll find that juries have kept pretty much the same ideas i fancy philip yes but revolvers often go off accidentally you said so yourself this is going to be the purest accident cant you see it in the papers the deceaseds nephew who was obviously upset james i suppose you think its brave to come back from the front and threaten a defenceless man with a revolver is that the sort of fair play they teach you in the army philip good heavens of course it is you dont think that you wait until the other side has got just as many guns as you before you attack youre really rather lucky strictly speaking i ought to have thrown half a dozen bombs at you first taking one out of his pocket as it happens ive only got one james thoroughly alarmed put that back at once philip putting down the revolver and taking it in his hands you hold it in the right hand so taking care to keep the lever down then you take the pin in the finger so and but perhaps this doesnt interest you james edging his chair away put it down at once sir good heavens anything might happen philip putting it down and taking up the revolver again does it ever occur to you uncle james that there are about three million people in england who know all about bombs and how to throw them and james it certainly does not occur to me i should never dream of letting these things occur to me philip looking at the bomb regretfully its rather against my principles as a soldier but just to make things a bit more fair generously you shall have it he holds it out to him suddenly james shrinking back again certainly not sir it might go off at any moment philip putting it back in his pocket oh no its quite useless theres no detonator sternly now then lets talk business james what do you want me to do philip strictly speaking you should be holding your hands over your head and saying kamerad however ill let you off that all i ask from you is that you should be reasonable james and if i refuse youll shoot me philip well i dont quite know uncle james i expect we should go through this little scene again tomorrow you havent enjoyed it have you well theres lots more of it to come well rehearse it every day one day if you go on being unreasonable the thing will go off of course you think that i shouldnt have the pluck to fire but you cant be quite certain its a hundred to one that i shant only i might fear its a horrible thing elderly men die of it sometimes james pooh im not to be bluffed like that philip suddenly youre quite right youre not that sort i made a mistake aiming carefully i shall have to do it straight off after all one two james on his knees with uplifted hands in an agony of terror philip mercy what are your terms philip picking him up by the scruff and helping him into the chair good man thats the way to talk ill get them for you make yourself comfortable in front of the fire till i come back heres the paper he gives his uncle the paper and goes out into the hall james opens his eyes with a start and looks round him in a bewildered way he rubs his heart takes out his match and looks at it and then stares round the room again the door from the diningroom opens and philip comes in with a piece of toast in his hand philip his mouth full you wanted to see me uncle james james still bewildered thats all right my boy thats all right what have you been doing philip surprised breakfast putting the last piece in his mouth rather late im afraid james thats all right he laughs awkwardly philip anything the matter you dont look your usual bright self james i er seem to have dropped asleep in front of the fire most unusual thing for me to have done most unusual philip let that be a lesson to you not to get up so early of course if youre in the army you cant help yourself thank heaven im out of it and my own master again james ah thats what i wanted to talk to you about sit down philip he indicates the chair by the fire philip taking a chair by the table you have that uncle i shall be all right here james hastily no no you come here he gives philip the armchair and sits by the table himself i should be dropping off again he laughs awkwardly philip righto he puts his hand to his pocket uncle james shivers and looks at him to horror philip brings out his pipe and a sickly grin of relief comes into jamess face james i suppose you smoked a lot in france philip rather nothing else to do its allowed in here james hastily yes yes of course philip lights his pipe well now philip what are you going to do now youve left the army philip promptly burn my uniform and sell my revolver james starting at the word revolver sell your revolver eh philip surprised well i dont want it now do i james no oh no oh most certainly not i should say oh i cant see why you should want it at all with an uneasy laugh youre in england now no need for revolvers here eh philip staring at him well no i hope not james hastily quite so well now philip what next we must find a profession for you philip yawning i suppose so i havent really thought about it much james you never wanted to be an architect philip surprised architect james rubs his head and wonders what made him think of architect james or anything like that philip its a bit late isnt it james well if youre four years behind so is everybody else he feels vaguely that he has heard this argument before philip smiling to tell the truth i dont feel i mind much anyway anything you like except a commissionaire i absolutely refuse to wear uniform again james how would you like to come into the business philip the jam business well i dont know you wouldnt want me to salute you in the mornings james my dear boy no philip all right ill try it if you like i dont know if i shall be any good what do you do james its your experience in managing and er handling men which i hope will be of value philip oh i can do that all right stretching himself luxuriously uncle james do you realize that im never going to salute again or wear a uniform or get wet really wet i mean or examine mens feet or stand to attention when im spoken to or oh lots more things and best of all im never going to be frightened again have you ever known what it is to be afraid really afraid james embarrassed i er well he coughs philip no you couldnt not really afraid of death i mean well thats over now good lord i could spend the rest of my life in the british museum and be happy james getting up all right well try you in the office i expect you want a holiday first though philip getting up my dear uncle this is holiday being in london is holiday buying an evening paper wearing a waistcoat again running after a bus anything its all holiday james all right then come along with me now and ill introduce you to mr bamford philip right whos he james our manager a little stiff but a very good fellow hell be delighted to hear that you are coming into the firm philip smiling perhaps id better bring my revolver in case he isnt james laughing with forced heartiness as they go together to the door ha ha a good joke that ha ha ha a good joke but only a joke of course ha ha he he he philip goes out james following him turns at the door and looks round the room in a bewildered way was it a dream or wasnt it he will never be quite certain belinda an april folly in three acts characters belinda tremayne delia her daughter harold baxter claude devenish john tremayne betty the action takes place in belindas countryhouse in devonshire at the end of april this play was first produced by mr dion boucicault at the new theatre london on april with the following cast belinda tremayne irene vanbrugh delia isobel elsom harold baxter dion boucicault claude devenish dennis neilsonterry john tremayne ben webster betty anne walden belinda act i it is a lovely april afternoon a foretaste of summer in belindas garden betty a middleaged servant is fastening a hammock its first appearance this year between two trees at the back in front of these there is a solid oak gardentable with a comfortable chair on the right of it and a straightbacked one on the left there are books papers and magazines on the table belinda of whom we shall know more presently is on the other side of the open windows which look on to the garden talking to betty belinda from inside the house are you sure youre tying it up tightly enough betty betty coming to front of hammock yes maam i think its firm belinda because im not the fairy i used to be betty trying the knots at the other end of the hammock yes maam its quite firm this end too belinda its not the ends im frightened of its the middle where the weights coming she comes into the garden it looks very nice betty yes maam belinda trying the middle of it with her hand i asked them at the stores if they were quite sure it would bear me and they said it would take anything up to i forget how many tons i know i thought it was rather rude of them looking at it anxiously how does one get in so trying to be a sailor betty i think you sit in it maam and then explaining with her hands throw your legs over belinda i see she sits gingerly in the hammock and then with a sudden flutter of white does what betty suggests yes regretfully im afraid that was rather wasted on you betty we must have some spectators next time betty yes maam belinda cushions she arranges them at her back with bettys help with a sigh of comfort there now then betty about callers betty yes maam belinda if mr baxter calls he is the rather prim gentleman betty yes maam the one whos been here several times before belinda giving betty a quick look yes well if he calls youll say not at home betty yes maam belinda he will say oh er oh er really then youll smile very sweetly and say i beg your pardon was it mr baxter and hell say yes and youll say oh i beg your pardon sir this way please betty yes maam belinda thats right betty well now if mr devenish calls he is the rather poetical gentleman betty yes maam the one whos always coming here belinda with a pleased smile yes well if he calls youll say not at home betty yes maam belinda hell immediately throw down his bunch of flowers and dive despairingly into the moat youll stop him just as he is going in and say i beg your pardon sir was it mr devenish and he will say yes and you will say oh i beg your pardon sir this way please betty yes maam and suppose they both call together belinda we wont suppose anything so exciting betty betty no maam and suppose any other gentleman calls belinda with a sigh there arent any other gentlemen betty it might be a clergyman come to ask for a subscription like belinda if its a clergyman betty i shall i shall want your assistance out of the hammock first betty yes maam belinda thats all to anybody else im not at home trying to secure book on table and nearly falling out of the hammock oh just give me that little green book pointing to books on the table the one at the bottom there thats the one betty gives it to her thank you reading the title the lute of love by claude devenish to herself as she turns the pages it doesnt seem much for halfacrown when you think of the daily telegraph lute lute i should have quite a pretty mouth if i kept on saying that with a great deal of expression lute she pats her mouth back betty is that all maam belinda thats all betty prepares to go oh what am i thinking of waving to the table i want that review i think its the blue one as betty begins to look it has an article by mr baxter on the rise of lunacy in the eastern counties yes thats the one id better have that too im just at the most exciting place you shall have it after me betty betty is that all maam belinda yes that really is all betty goes into the house belinda reading to herself it is a matter of grave concern to all serious students of social problems putting the review down in hammock and shaking her head gently but not in april lazily opening the book and reading tell me where is love well thats the question isnt it she puts the book down gives a sigh of happiness and lazily closes her eyes delia comes into the garden from paris she is decidedly a modern girl pretty and selfpossessed her hair is halfway up waiting for her birthday perhaps she sees her mother suddenly stops and then goes on tiptoe to the head of the hammock she smiles and kisses her mother on the forehead belinda looking supremely unconscious goes on sleeping delia kisses her lightly again belinda wakes up with an extraordinarily natural start and is just about to say oh mr devenish you mustnt when she sees delia delia delia well mummy arent you glad to see me belinda my darling child they kiss each other frantically delia say youre glad belinda sitting up my darling im absolutely hold the hammock while i get out dear we dont want an accident getting out with delias help theyre all right when youre there and theyll bear two tons but theyre horrid getting in and out of kissing her again darling it really is you delia oh it is jolly seeing you again i believe you were asleep belinda with dignity certainly not child i was reading the nineteenth century with an air and after earnestly darling wasnt it next thursday you were coming back delia no this thursday silly belinda penitently oh my darling and i was going over to paris to bring you home delia i half expected you belinda so confusing their both being called thursday and you were leaving school for the very last time if you dont forgive me delia i shall cry delia stroking her hand fondly silly mother belinda sits down in a basket chair and delia sits on a table next to her belinda isnt it a lovely day for april darling ive wanted to say that to somebody all day and youre the first person whos given me the chance oh i said it to betty but she only said yes maam delia poor mother belinda jumping up suddenly and kissing delia again i simply must have another one and to think that youre never going back to school any more looking at her fondly darling you are looking pretty delia am i belinda lovely going back to her seat and now youre going to stay with me for just as long as you want a mother anxiously darling you didnt mind being sent away to school did you it is the usual thing you know delia silly mother of course it is belinda relieved im so glad you think so too delia have you been very lonely without me belinda very delia holding up a finger the truth mummy belinda ive missed you horribly delia primly the absence of female companionship of the requisite delia are you really all alone belinda smiling mysteriously well not always of course delia excitedly at she slips off the table mummy i believe youre being bad again belinda really darling you forget that im old enough to be in fact am your mother delia nodding her head you are being bad belinda rising with dignity and drawing herself up to her full height my child that is not the way to oh i say what a lot taller i am than you delia and prettier belinda fluttering her eyelids oh do you think so firmly dont be silly child delia holding up a finger now tell me all thats been happening here at once belinda with a sigh and i was just going to ask you how you were getting on with your french delia bother french youve been having a much more interesting time than i have so youve got to tell belinda with a happy sigh ooh she sinks back into her chair delia is it like the count at scarborough belinda surprised and pained my darling what do you mean delia dont you remember the count who kept proposing to you at scarborough i do belinda reproachfully dear one you were the merest child paddling about on the beach and digging castles delia smiling to herself i was old enough to notice the count belinda sadly and id bought her a perfectly new spade how one deceives oneself delia and then there was the mp who proposed at windermere belinda yes dear but it wasnt seconded i mean he never got very far with it delia and the artist in wales belinda darling child what a memory you have no wonder your teachers are pleased with you delia settling herself comfortably now tell me all about this one belinda meekly which one delia excitedly oh are there lots belinda severely only two delia two you abandoned woman belinda its something in the air darling ive never been in devonshire in april before delia is it really serious this time belinda pained i wish you wouldnt say this time delia it sounds so unromantic if youd only put it into french cette fois it sounds so much better cette fois parentally when ones daughter has just returned from an expensive schooling in paris one likes to feel delia what i meant dear was am i to have a stepfather at last belinda now youre being too french darling delia why do you still think father may be alive belinda why not its only eighteen years since he left us and he was quite a young man then delia yes but surely youd have heard from him in all those years if hed been alive belinda well he hasnt heard from me and im still alive delia looking earnestly at her mother i shall never understand it belinda understand what delia were you as heavenly when you were young as you are now belinda rapturously oh i was sweet delia and yet he left you after only six months belinda rather crossly i wish you wouldnt keep on saying he left me i left him too delia why belinda smiling to herself well you see he was quite certain he knew how to manage women and i was quite certain i knew how to manage men thoughtfully if only one of us had been certain it would have been all right delia seriously what really happened mummy im grown up now so i think you ought to tell me belinda thoughtfully that was about all you know except for his beard delia had he a beard how funny belinda yes dear it was but he never would see it he took it quite seriously delia and did you say dramatically if you really loved me youd take it off belinda apologetically im afraid i did darling delia and what did he say belinda he said very rudely that if i loved him id do my hair in a different way delia how ridiculous belinda touching her hair of course i didnt do it like this then with a sigh i suppose we never ought to have married really delia why did you belinda mother rather wanted it solemnly delia never get married because your mother oh i forgot im your mother delia and i dont want a better one and so you left each other belinda yes delia but darling didnt you tell him there was going to be a me belinda oh no delia i wonder why not belinda well you see if i had he might have wanted to stay delia but belinda hurt if he didnt want to stay for me i didnt want him to stay for you penitently forgive me darling but i didnt know you very well then delia jumps off the table and hugs her mother impetuously weve been very happy together havent we delia going back to her seat i should think we have belinda i dont want to deny you anything and of course if youd like a stepfather looking down modestly or two delia oh you have been enjoying yourself belinda only you see how awkward it would be if jack turned up in the middle of the wedding like like eugene aram delia enoch arden darling belinda its very confusing their having the same initials perhaps id better call them both e a in future and then i shall be safe well anyhow it would be awkward darling wouldnt it not that i should know him from adam after all these years except for a mole on his left arm delia perhaps adam had a mole belinda no darling youre thinking of noah he had two delia thoughtfully i wonder what would happen if you met somebody whom you really did fall in love with belinda reproachfully now youre being serious and its april delia arent these two the present two serious belinda oh no they think they are but they arent a bit really besides im doing them such a lot of good im sure theyd hate to marry me but they love to think theyre in love with me and i love it and and they love it and and we all love it delia you really are the biggest darlingest baby who ever lived kisses her do say i shant spoil your lovely times belinda surprised spoil them why youll make them more lovely than ever delia well but do they know you have a grownup daughter belinda suddenly realizing oh delia it doesnt really matter because you dont look a day more than thirty belinda absently no hurriedly i mean how sweet of you only delia what belinda playing with her rings well one of them mr baxter harold she looks quickly up at delia and down again in pretty affectation but she is really laughing at herself all the time he writes statistical articles for the reviews percentages and all those things hes just the sort of man if he knew that i was your mother to work it out that i was more than thirty the other one mr devenish claude she looks up and down as before hes rather rather poetical he thinks i came straight from heaven last week delia jumping up i think id better go straight back to paris belinda jumping up and catching her firmly by the arms you will do nothing of the sort you will take off that hat she lets go of the arm and begins to take out the pin which is a perfect duck and i dont know why i didnt say so before she puts the hat down on the table and let me take a good look at you she does so and kiss you she does so and then well go to your room and unpack and have a lovely talk about clothes and then well have tea betty comes in belinda and now heres betty coming in to upset all our delightful plans just when weve made them delia how are you betty ive left school betty very nicely thank you miss youve grown belinda patting the top of delias head im much taller than she is well betty what is it betty the two gentlemen mr baxter and mr devenish have both called together maam belinda excited oh how how very simultaneous of them delia eagerly oh do let me see them belinda darling youll see plenty of them before youve finished to betty what have you done with them betty theyre waiting in the hall maam while i said i would see if you were at home belinda all right betty give me two minutes and then show them out here betty yes maam exit belinda they cant do much harm to each other in two minutes delia taking her hat well ill go and unpack you really wont mind my coming down afterwards belinda of course not a little awkwardly darling one i wonder if youd mind just at first being introduced as my niece you see i expect theyre in a bad temper already having come here together and we dont want to spoil their day entirely delia smiling ill be your mother if you like belinda oh no that wouldnt do because then mr baxter would feel that he ought to ask your permission before paying his attentions to me hes just that sort of man a niece is so safe however good you are at statistics you cant really prove anything delia all right mummy belinda enjoying herself youd like to be called by a different name wouldnt you theres something so thrilling about taking a false name such a lot of adventures begin like that how would you like to be miss robinson darling its a nice easy one to remember persuasively and you shall put your hair up so as to feel more disguised what fun were going to have delia you baby all right then im miss robinson your favourite niece she moves towards the house belinda how sweet of you oh im coming with you to do your hair you dont think youre going to be allowed to do it yourself when so much depends on it and husbands leave you because of it and they do in together betty comes from the other side of the house into the garden followed by mr baxter and mr devenish mr baxter is fortyfive prim and erect with closetrimmed moustache and sidewhiskers his clothes are dark and he wears a bowlerhat mr devenish is a longhaired goodlooking boy in a nglig costume perhaps twentytwo years old and very scornful of the world betty looking about her surprised the mistress was here a moment ago i expect shell be back directly if youll just wait she goes back into the house mr baxter puts his bowlerhat firmly on his head and sits down very stiffly and upright in a chair on the lefthand side of the table devenish throws his felt hat on to the table and walks about inquisitively he sees the review in the hammock and picks it up devenish good heavens baxter shes been reading your article baxter i dare say shes not the only one devenish thats only guesswork going to back of table you dont know of anyone else baxter how many people may i ask have bought your poems devenish loftily i dont write for the mob baxter i think i may say that of my own work devenish baxter i dont want to disappoint you but i have reluctantly come to the conclusion that you are one of the mob annoyed dash it what are you doing in the country at all in a bowlerhat baxter if i wanted to be personal i could say why dont you get your hair cut only that form of schoolboy humour doesnt appeal to me devenish this is not a personal matter i am protesting on behalf of nature what do the birds and the flowers and the beautiful trees think of your hat baxter if one began to ask oneself what the birds thought of things he pauses devenish well and why shouldnt one ask oneself it is better than asking oneself what the stock exchange thinks of things baxter well looking up at devenishs extravagant hair its the nesting season your hair suddenly ha ha ha ha ha ha devenish hastily smoothing it down really baxter youre vulgar he turns away and resumes his promenading suddenly he sees his book on the grass beneath the hammock and makes a dash for it ha my book gloating over it baxter she reads my book baxter i suppose you gave her a copy devenish exultingly yes i gave her a copy my next book will be hers and hers alone baxter then let me say that in my opinion you took a very great liberty devenish liberty and this from a man who is continually forcing his unwelcome statistics upon her baxter at any rate i flatter myself that there is no suggestion of impropriety in anything that i write devenish im not so sure about that baxter baxter what do you mean sir devenish did you read the times this month on the new reviews baxter well devenish oh nothing it just said mr baxters statistics are extremely suggestive i havent read them so of course i dont know what youve been up to baxter turning away in disgust pah devenish poor old baxter he wanders about the garden again and having picked a flower comes to rest against one of the trees from which the hammock is swung he leans against this and regards the flower thoughtfully baxter baxter crossly i wish you wouldnt keep calling me baxter devenish harold baxter it is only by accident an accident which we both deplore that we have met at all and in any

leaning over her if only belinda youd better not say anything mr devenish keep it for your next volume he turns away one two three that was better than last time they turn round to see her safely in the hammock devenish leans against the tree at her feet and baxter draws the chair from the right side of the table and turns it round towards her he presses his hat more firmly on and sits down i wonder if either of you can guess what ive been reading this afternoon devenish looking at her lovingly i know belinda giving him a fleeting look how did you know to baxter yes mr baxter it was your article i was reading if youd come five minutes earlier youd have found me wrestling i mean revelling in it baxter i am very greatly honoured mrs tremayne ah it seemed to me a very interesting curve showing the rise and fall of belinda i hadnt got up to the curves they are interesting arent they they are really more in mr devenishs line to devenish mr devenish it was a great disappointment to me that all the poems in your book seemed to be written to somebody else devenish it was before i met you lady they were addressed to the goddess of my imagination it is only in these last few weeks that i have discovered her belinda and discovered she was dark and not fair devenish she will be dark in my next volume belinda oh how nice of her baxter kindly you should write a real poem to mrs tremayne belinda excitedly oh do to belinda i dont know what rhymes except cinder you could say your heart was like a cinder all burnt up devenish pained oh my lady im afraid that is a cockney rhyme belinda how thrilling ive never been to hampstead heath devenish belinda it is far too beautiful to rhyme with anything but itself belinda fancy but what about tremayne singing oh i am mrs tremayne and i dont want to marry again devenish protesting my lady baxter protesting belinda belinda pointing excitedly to baxter there thats the first time hes called me belinda devenish are you serious belinda not as a rule devenish youre not going to marry again belinda well who could i marry devenish and baxter together me belinda dropping her eyes modestly but this is england baxter mrs tremayne i claim the right of age of my greater years to speak first devenish mrs tremayne i belinda kindly to devenish you can speak afterwards mr devenish its so awkward when you both speak together baxter mrs tremayne i am a man of substantial position and perhaps i may say of some repute in serious circles all that i have whether of material or mental endowment i lay at your feet together with an admiration which i cannot readily put into words as my wife i think you would be happy and i feel that with you by my side i could achieve even greater things belinda how sweet of you but i ought to tell you that im no good at figures devenish protesting my lady belinda i dont mean what you mean mr devenish you wait till its your turn to baxter yes baxter i ask you to marry me belinda belinda settling herself happily and closing her eyes ooh now its your turn mr devenish devenish excitedly money thank heaven i have no money reputation thank heaven i have no reputation what can i offer you dreams nothing

belinda marry me and i will open your eyes to the beauty of the world come to me belinda happily ooh youve got such different ways of putting things how can i choose between you devenish then you will marry one of us belinda you know i really oughtnt to baxter i dont see why not belinda well theres just a little difficulty in the way devenish what is it i will remove it for you i could remove anything yes even baxter he looks at baxter who is sitting more solidly than ever in his chair belinda and anyhow i should have to choose between you devenish in a whisper choose me baxter stiffly mrs tremayne does not require any prompting a fair field and let the best man win devenish going across to and slapping the astonished baxter on the back aye let the best man win well spoken baxter to belinda send us out into the world upon some knightly quest lady and let the victor be rewarded baxter i er ought to say that i should be unable to go very far i have an engagement to speak at newcastle on the lst devenish baxter i will take no unfair advantage of you let the beard of the lord mayor of newcastle be the talisman that my lady demands i am satisfied baxter this sort of thing is entirely contrary to my usual mode of life but i will not be outfaced by a mere boy slapping his bowlerhat on the table i am prepared devenish speak lady belinda speaking in a deep mysterious voice gentlemen ye put wild thoughts into my head in sooth i am minded to send ye forth upon a quest that is passing strange know ye that there is a maid journeyed hither hight robinson whose in her natural voice whats the old for aunt baxter hopefully mothers sister belinda you know i think i shall have to explain this in ordinary language you wont mind very much will you mr devenish devenish it is the spirit of this which matters not the language which clothes it belinda oh im so glad you think so well now about miss robinson shes my niece and shes just come to stay with me and poor girl shes lost her father absolutely lost him he disappeared ever such a long time ago and poor miss robinson delia naturally wants to find him poor girl she cant think where he is devenish nobly i will find him belinda oh thank you mr devenish miss robinson would be so much obliged baxter yes er but what have we to go upon beyond the fact that his name is robinson belinda i shouldnt go on that too much you see he may easily have changed it by now he was never very much of a robinson nothing to do with peter or any of those devenish i will find him baxter well can you tell us what hes like belinda well its such a long time since i saw him looking down modestly of course i was quite a girl then the only thing i know for certain is that he has a mole on his left arm about here she indicates a spot just below the elbow devenish folding his arms and looking nobly upwards i will find him baxter i am bound to inform you mrs tremayne that even a trained detective could not give you very much hope in such a case however i will keep a lookout for him and of course if devenish fear not lady i will find him baxter annoyed yes you keep on saying that but what have you got to go on devenish grandly faith the faith which moves mountains belinda yes and this is only just one small molehill mr baxter baxter yes but still belinda ssh here is miss robinson if mr devenish will hold the hammock while i alight we dont want an accident i can introduce you he helps her to get out thank you delia darling this is mr baxter and mr devenish my niece miss robinson delia how do you do belinda miss robinson has just come over from france mon dieu quel pays baxter i hope you had a good crossing miss robinson delia oh i never mind about the crossing aunt belinda she stops and smiles belinda yes dear delia i believe tea is almost ready i want mine and im sure mr baxters hungry mr devenish scorns food i expect devenish hurt why do you say that delia arent you a poet belinda yes darling but that doesnt prevent him eating hell be absolutely lyrical over bettys sandwiches devenish you wont deny me that inspiration i hope miss robinson belinda well lets go and see what theyre like delia and devenish begin to move towards the house mr baxter just a moment baxter yes belinda secretly not a word to her about mr robinson it must be a surprise for her baxter quite so i understand belinda thats right raising her voice oh mr devenish devenish yes mrs tremayne he comes back belinda secretly not a word to her about mr robinson it must be a surprise for her devenish of course i shouldnt dream indignantly robinson what an unsuitable name baxter and delia are just going into the house belinda dismissing devenish all right ill catch you up devenish goes after the other two left alone belinda laughs happily to herself and then begins to look rather aimlessly about her she picks up her sunshade and opens it she comes to the hammock picks out her handkerchief says ah there you are and puts it away she goes slowly towards the house turns her head just as she comes to the door and comes slowly back again she stops at the table looking down the garden belinda to herself have you lost yourself or something no the latch is this side yes thats right tremayne comes in he has been knocking about the world for eighteen years and is very much a man though he has kept his manners his hair is greying a little at the sides and he looks the fortyodd that he is without his moustache and beard he is very different from the boy belinda married tremayne with his hat in his hand im afraid im trespassing belinda winningly but its such a pretty garden turns away dosing her parasol isnt it tremayne rather confused ii beg your pardon ier he is wondering if it can possibly be she belinda thinks his confusion is due to the fact that he is trespassing and hastens to put him at his ease belinda i should have done the same myself you know tremayne pulling himself together oh but you mustnt think i just came in because i liked the garden belinda clapping her hands no but say you do like it quick tremayne its lovely and he hesitates belinda hopefully yes tremayne with conviction yes its lovely belinda with that happy sigh of hers ooh now tell me what really did happen tremayne i was on my way to marytown belinda to where tremayne marytown belinda oh you mean mariton tremayne do i belinda yes we always call it mariton down here earnestly you dont mind do you tremayne smiling not a bit belinda just say it to see if youve got it right tremayne mariton belinda shaking her head oh no thats quite wrong try it again with a rustic accent mariton tremayne mariton belinda yes thats much better as if it were he who had interrupted well do go on tremayne im afraid it isnt much of an apology really i saw what looked like a private road but what i rather hoped wasnt and well i thought id risk it i do hope youll forgive me belinda oh but i love people seeing my garden are you staying in mariton tremayne i think so oh yes decidedly belinda well perhaps the next time the road wont feel so private tremayne how charming of you he feels he must know are you mrs tremayne by any chance belinda yes tremayne nodding to himself yes belinda how did you know tremayne hastily inventing they use you as a signpost in the village past mrs tremaynes house and then bear to the left belinda and you couldnt go past it tremayne im afraid i couldnt thank you so much for not minding well i must be getting on i have trespassed quite enough belinda regretfully and you havent really seen the garden yet tremayne if you wont mind my going on this way i shall see some more on my way out belinda please do it likes being looked at with the faintest suggestion of demureness all pretty things do tremayne thank you very much er he hesitates belinda helpfully yes tremayne i wonder if youd mind very much if i called one day to thank you formally for the lesson you gave me in pronunciation belinda gravely yes i almost think you ought to i think its the correct thing to do tremayne contentedly thank you very much mrs tremayne belinda youll come in quite formally by the frontdoor next time wont you because because that seems the only chance of my getting to know your name tremayne oh i beg your pardon my name is er er robinson belinda laughing how very odd tremayne startled odd belinda yes we have someone called robinson staying in the house i wonder if she is any relation tremayne hastily oh no no no she couldnt be i have no relations called robinson not to speak of belinda holding out her hand you must tell me all about your relations when you come and call mr robinson tremayne i think we can find something better worth talking about than that belinda do you think so he says yes with his eyes bows and goes off down the garden belinda stays looking after him then gives that happy sigh of hers only even more so ooh enter betty betty if you please maam miss delia says are you coming in to tea belinda looking straight in front of her and taking no notice of betty in a happy dreamy voice betty about callers if mr robinson calls hes the handsome gentleman who hasnt been here before you will say not at home and he will say oh and you will say i beg your pardon sir was it mr robinson and he will say yes and you will say oh i beg your pardon sir almost as if she were betty she begins to move towards the house this way she would be smiling an invitation over her shoulder to mr robinson if he were there and she were betty please and the abandoned woman goes in to tea act ii it is morning in belindas hall a lowroofed oakbeamed place comfortably furnished as a sittingroom there is an inner and an outer frontdoor both of which are open devenish who has just rung the bell is waiting with a bouquet of violets between the two midway on the right is a door leading to a small room where hats and coats are kept a door on the left leads towards the livingrooms betty good morning sir devenish good morning i am afraid this is an unceremonious hour for a call but my sense of beauty urged me hither in defiance of convention betty yes sir devenish holding up his bouquet to betty see the dew is yet lingering upon them how could i let them wait until this afternoon betty yes sir but i think the mistress is out devenish they are not for your mistress they are for miss delia betty oh i beg your pardon sir if you will come in ill see if i can find her she brings him in and goes away to find delia devenish tries a number of poses about the room for himself and his bouquet and finally selects one against the right side of the door by which he has just come in enter delia from the door on the left delia shutting the door and going to devenish oh good morning mr devenish im afraid my er aunt is out devenish i know miss delia i know delia shell be so sorry to have missed you it is her day for you isnt it devenish her day for me delia yes mr baxter generally comes tomorrow doesnt he devenish miss delia if our friendship is to progress at all it can only be on the distinct understanding that i take no interest whatever in mr baxters movements delia oh im so sorry i thought you knew what lovely flowers are they for my aunt devenish to whom does one bring violets to modest shrinking tender youth delia i dont think we have anybody here like that devenish with a bow miss delia they are for you delia oh how nice of you but im afraid i oughtnt to take them from you under false pretences i dont shrink devenish a fanciful way of putting it perhaps they are none the less for you delia well its awfully kind of you im afraid im not a very romantic person aunt belinda does all the romancing in our family devenish your aunt is a very remarkable woman delia she is dont you dare to say a word against her devenish my dear miss delia nothing could be further from my thoughts why am i not indebted to her for that great happiness which has come to me in these last few days delia surprised good gracious and i didnt know anything about it but what about poor mr baxter devenish stiffly i must beg that mr baxters name be kept out of our conversation delia but i thought mr baxter and you do tell me whats happened i seem to have lost myself devenish what has happened miss delia is that i have learnt at last the secret that my heart has been striving to tell me for weeks past as soon as i saw that gracious lady your aunt i knew that i was in love foolishly i took it for granted that it was she for whom my heart was thrilling how mistaken i was directly you came you opened my eyes and now delia mr devenish you dont say youre proposing to me devenish i am i feel sure i am delia i love you delia how exciting of you devenish with a modest shrug its nothing i am a poet delia you really want to marry me devenish such is my earnest wish delia but what about my aunt devenish simply she will be my auntinlaw delia shell be rather surprised devenish delia i will be frank with you i admit that i made mrs tremayne an offer of marriage delia excitedly you really did was it that first afternoon i came devenish yes delia oh i wish id been there devenish with dignity it is not my custom to propose in the presence of a third party it is true that on the occasion you mention a man called baxter was on the lawn but i regarded him no more than the old appletree or the flowerbeds or any other of the fixtures delia what did she say devenish she accepted me conditionally delia oh do tell me devenish it is rather an unhappy story this man called baxter in his vulgar way also made a proposal of marriage mrs tremayne was gracious enough to imply that she would marry whichever one of us fulfilled a certain condition delia how sweet of her devenish it is my earnest hope miss delia that the man called baxter will be the victor as far as is consistent with honour i shall endeavour to let mr baxter banging the table with his hand win delia what was the condition devenish that i am not at liberty to tell it is i understand to be a surprise for you delia how exciting mr devenish you have been very frank may i be equally so devenish bows why do you wear your hair so long devenish pleased you have noticed it delia well yes i have devenish i wear it so to express my contempt for the conventions of socalled society delia i always thought that people wore it very very short if they despised the conventions of society devenish i think that the mere fact that my hair annoys mr baxter is sufficient justification for its length delia but if it annoys me too devenish heroically it shall go delia apologetically i told you i wasnt a very romantic person didnt i kindly you can always grow it again if you fall in love with somebody else devenish that is cruel of you delia i shall never fall in love again enter belinda in a hat belinda why its mr devenish how nice of you to come so early in the morning how is mr baxter devenish i do not know mrs tremayne belinda to delia i got most of the things delia to devenish the things mr devenish is my rather stuffy way of referring to all the delightful poems that you are going to eat tonight devenish i am looking forward to it immensely mrs tremayne belinda i do hope ive got all your and mr baxters favourite dishes devenish im afraid mr baxter and i are not likely to appreciate the same things belinda coyly oh mr devenish and you were so unanimous a few days ago delia i think mr devenish was referring entirely to things to eat belinda i felt quite sad when i was buying the lamb cutlets to think that only a few days before they had been frisking about with their mammas and having poems written about them by mr devenish there im giving away the whole dinner delia take him away before i tell him any more we must keep some surprises for him delia to devenish as she picks up the flowers come along mr devenish belinda wickedly are those my flowers mr devenish devenish after a little hesitation with a bow which might refer to either of them they are for the most beautiful lady in the land belinda oh how nice of you devenish follows delia out through the door on the left belinda unpinning her hat before a mirror i suppose he means delia bless them she gives a few pats to her hair and then walks about the room singing softly to herself she does to the frontdoor and looks happily out into the garden suddenly she sees mr baxter approaching she hurries back into a chair and pretends to be very busy reading baxter rather nervously er may i come in mrs tremayne belinda dropping her book and turning round with a violent start oh mr baxter how you surprised me she puts her hand to her heart baxter i must apologize for intruding upon you at this hour mrs tremayne belinda holding up her hand stop baxter startled what belinda i cannot let you come in like that baxter looking down at himself like what belinda dropping her eyes you called me belinda once baxter coming down to her may i explain my position mrs tremayne belinda before you begin have you been seeing my niece lately baxter surprised no belinda oh sweetly please go on baxter why is she lost too belinda oh no i just do sit down let me put your hat down somewhere for you baxter keeping it firmly in his hand and sitting down on the sofa it will be all right here thank you belinda returning to her chair im dying to hear what you are going to say baxter first as regards the use of your christian name i felt that as a man of honour i could not permit myself to use it until i had established my right over that of mr devenish belinda all my friends call me belinda baxter as between myself and mr devenish the case is somewhat different until one of us is successful over the other in the quest upon which you have sent us i feel that as far as possible we should hold aloof from you belinda pleadingly just say belinda once more in case youre a long time baxter very formally belinda belinda how nicely you say it harold baxter half getting out of his seat mrs tremayne i must not listen to this belinda meekly i wont offend again mr baxter please go on tell me about the quest are you winning baxter i am progressing mrs tremayne indeed i came here this morning to acquaint you with the results of my investigations yesterday i located a man called robinson working upon a farm close by i ventured to ask him if he had any marks upon him by which he could be recognized he adopted a threatening attitude and replied that if i wanted any he could give me some with the aid of halfa crown i managed to placate him putting my inquiry in another form i asked if he had any moles a regrettable misunderstanding which led to a fruitless journey to another part of the village was eventually cleared up and on my return i satisfied myself that this man was in no way related to your niece belinda admiringly how splendid of you well now we know hes not she holds up one finger baxter yes in the afternoon i located another mr robinson following the profession of a carrier my first inquiries led to a similar result with the exception that in this case mr robinson carried his threatening attitude so far as to take off his coat and roll up his sleeves perceiving at once that he was not the man i withdrew belinda how brave you are that makes two she holds up another finger it still leaves a good many pleadingly just call me belinda again baxter nervously you mustnt tempt me mrs tremayne belinda penitently i wont baxter to resume then my narrative this morning i have heard of a third mr robinson whether there is actually any particular fortune attached to the number three i cannot say for certain it is doubtful whether statistics would be found to support the popular belief but one likes to flatter oneself that in ones own case it may be true and so belinda and so the third mr robinson baxter something for which i cannot altogether account inspires me with hope he is i have discovered staying at mariton this afternoon i go to look for him belinda to herself mariton how funny i wonder if its the same one baxter what one belinda oh just one of the ones gratefully mr baxter you are doing all this for me baxter pray do not mention it i dont know if its devonshire or the time of the year or the sort of atmosphere you create mrs tremayne but i feel an entirely different man there is something in the air which yes i shall certainly go over to mariton this afternoon belinda gravely i have had the same feeling sometimes mr baxter i am not always the staid respectable matron which i appear to you to be sometimes i she looks absently at the watch on her wrist good gracious baxter alarmed what is it belinda looking anxiously from the door to him mr baxter im going to throw myself on your mercy baxter my dear mrs tremayne belinda looking at her watch again a strange man will be here directly he must not find you with me baxter rising jealously a man belinda excitedly yes yes a man he is pursuing me with his attentions if he found you here there would be a terrible scene baxter i will defend you from him belinda no no he is a big man he will he will overpower you baxter but you belinda i can defend myself i will send him away but he must not find you here you must hide before he overpowers you baxter with dignity i will withdraw if you wish it belinda no not withdraw hide he might see you withdrawing leading the way to a door on the right quick in here baxter embarrassed at the thought that this sort of thing really only happens in a bedroom farce i dont think i quite belinda reassuring him its perfectly respectable its where we keep the umbrellas she takes him by the hand baxter still resisting im not at all sure that i belinda earnestly oh but dont you see what trust im putting in you some people are so nervous about their umbrellas baxter well of course if you but i dont see why i shouldnt just slip out of the door before he comes belinda reproachfully of course if you grudge me every little pleasure quick here he is she bundles him through the door and with a sigh of happiness comes back and looks at herself in the mirror she goes to the frontdoor moves her hand to somebody in the distance and comes into the hall again seeing mr baxters bowler hat on the sofa she carries across to his door knocks hands it to him saying your hat ssh and returns to her chair tremayne comes in tremayne at the door its no good your pretending to be surprised because you said i could come belinda welcoming him but i can still be surprised that you wanted to come tremayne oh no you arent belinda marking it off on her fingers just a little bit that much tremayne it would be much more surprising if i hadnt come belinda sitting down on the sofa it is a pretty garden isnt it tremayne sitting down next to her you forget that i saw the garden yesterday belinda oh but the things have grown so much since then let me see this is the third day youve been and we only met three days ago and then youre coming to dinner again tonight tremayne eagerly am i belinda yes havent you been asked tremayne no not a word belinda yes thats quite right i remember now i only thought of it this morning so i couldnt ask you before could i tremayne earnestly what made you think of it then belinda romantically it was at the butchers there was one little lamb cutlet left over and sitting out all by itself and there was nobody to love it and i said to myself suddenly i know that will do for mr robinson prosaically i do hope you like lamb tremayne i adore it belinda oh im so glad when i saw it sitting there i thought youd love it im afraid i cant tell you any more about the rest of the dinner because i wouldnt tell mr devenish and i want to be fair tremayne whos mr devenish belinda oh havent you met him hes always coming here tremayne is he in love with you too belinda too oh you mean mr baxter tremayne confound it thats three belinda innocently three she looks up at him and down again tremayne who is mr baxter belinda oh havent you met him hes always coming here tremayne who is mr baxter belinda oh hes a sort of statistician isnt that a horrid word to say so stishany tremayne what does he make statistics about belinda oh umbrellas and things dont lets talk about him tremayne all right then who is mr devenish belinda oh hes a poet she throws up her eyes and sighs deeply ah me tremayne what does he write poetry about belinda looks at him and down again and then at him again and then down and gives a little sigh all of which means cant you guess what does he write poetry about belinda obediently he wrote the lute of love and other poems by claude devenish the lute of love to herself i havent been saying that lately with great expression the lute of love the lute she pats her mouth back tremayne and what is mr devenish belinda putting her hand on his sleeve youll let me know when its my turn wont you tremayne your turn belinda yes to ask questions i love this game its like clumps she crosses her hands on her lap and waits for the next question tremayne i beg your pardon i er of course have no right to crossexamine you like this belinda oh do go on i love it with childish excitement ive got my question ready tremayne smiling i think perhaps it is your turn belinda eagerly is it really he nods well then who is mr robinson tremayne alarmed what belinda i think its a fair question i met you three days ago and you told me you were staying at mariton mariton you can say it all right now cant you tremayne i think so belinda coaxingly just say it tremayne mariton belinda clapping her hands lovely i dont think any of the villagers do it as well as that tremayne well belinda well that was three days ago you came the next day to see the garden and you came the day after to see the garden and youve come this morning to see the garden and youre coming to dinner tonight and its so lovely we shall simply have to go into the garden afterwards and all i know about you is that you havent any relations called robinson tremayne what do i know about mrs tremayne but that she has a relation called robinson belinda and two dear friends called devenish and baxter tremayne annoyed i was forgetting them belinda to herself i mustnt forget mr baxter tremayne getting up but what does it matter what would it matter if i knew nothing about you i know everything about you everything that matters belinda closing her eyes contentedly tell me some of them tremayne bending over her earnestly belinda belinda still with her eyes shut hes going to propose to me i can feel it coming tremayne confound it how many men have proposed to you belinda surprised since when tremayne since your first husband proposed to you belinda oh i thought you meant this year sitting up well now let me see slowly and thoughtfully one she pushes up her first finger two she pushes up the second three she pushes up the third finger holds it there for a moment and then pushes it gently down again no i dont think that one ought to count really she pushes up two more fingers and the thumb three four five do you want the names or just the total tremayne this is horrible belinda innocently but anybody can propose now if youd asked how many id accepted let me see where was i up to i shant count yours because i havent really had it yet six seven yes betty what is it betty has just come in from the door on the left betty if you please maam cook would like to speak to you for a minute belinda getting up yes ill come to tremayne youll forgive me wont you youll find some cigarettes there she starts to go but comes back and adds confidentially its probably about the lamb cutlets i expect your little one refuses to be cooked she goes out after betty left alone tremayne stalks moodily about the room occasionally kicking things which come in his way he takes up his hat suddenly and goes towards the door stops irresolutely and comes back he is standing in the middle of the room with his hands in his pockets when devenish comes in from the door on the left devenish surprised hullo tremayne hullo are you mr devenish devenish yes tremayne devenish the poet devenish coming up and shaking him warmly by the hand my dear fellow you know my work tremayne grimly my dear mr devenish your name is most familiar to me devenish i congratulate you i thought your greatgrandchildren would be the first to hear of me tremayne my names robinson by the way devenish then let me return the compliment robinson your name is familiar to me tremayne hastily i dont think im related to any robinsons you know devenish well no i suppose not when i was very much younger i began a collection of robinsons actually it was only three days ago but it seems much longer many things have happened since then tremayne uninterested really devenish there is a man called baxter who is still collecting i believe for myself i am only interested in one of the great family delia tremayne eagerly you are interested in her devenish devotedly in fact i am at this moment waiting for her to put on her hat tremayne warmly my dear devenish i am delighted to make your acquaintance he seizes his hand and grips it heartily how are you devenish feeling his fingers fairly well thanks tremayne thats right they sit on the sofa together devenish still nursing his hand you are a very lucky fellow robinson tremayne in what way devenish people you meet must be so very reluctant to say goodbye to you have you ever tried strangling lions or anything like that tremayne with a laugh well as a matter of fact i have devenish i suppose you won all right tremayne in the end with the help of my beater devenish personally i should have backed you alone against any two ordinary lions tremayne one was quite enough as it was he gave me something to remember him by putting up his left sleeve he displays a deep scar devenish looking at it casually by jove thats a nasty one he suddenly catches sight of the mole and stares at it fascinated good heavens tremayne whats the matter devenish clasping his head wait let me think after a pause have you ever met a man called baxter tremayne no devenish would you like to tremayne grimly very much indeed devenish hes the man i told you about whos interested in robinsons hell be delighted to meet you with a nervous laugh funny thing hes rather an authority on lions you must show him that scar of yours it will intrigue him immensely earnestly dont shake hands with him too heartily just at first it might put him off the whole thing tremayne this mr baxter seems to be a curious man divenish absently yes he is rather odd looking at his watch i wonder if i to tremayne i suppose you wont be he stops suddenly a slight tapping noise comes from the room where they keep umbrellas tremayne whats that the tapping noise is repeated a little more loudly this time devenish come in the door opens and baxter comes in nervously holding his bowler hat in his hand baxter oh i just tremayne stands up i

takes it baxter is noticeably impressed baxter really i am very glad to meet you sir tremayne very good of you to say so devenish to baxter robinson is a great biggame hunter baxter indeed i have

lion once extraordinary story looking at his watch suddenly jove i must be off see you again baxter goodbye robinson no dont shake hands im in a hurry he looks at his watch again and goes out hurriedly by the door on the left tremayne sit down together on the sofa tremayne unusual man your friend devenish i suppose it comes of being a poet baxter i have no great liking for mr devenish tremayne oh hes all right baxter but i am sure that if he is impressed by anything outside himself or his own works it must be something rather remarkable pray tell me of your adventure with the lion tremayne laughing really you mustnt think that i go about telling everybody my adventures it just happened to come up im afraid i shook his hand rather more warmly than i meant and he asked me if id ever tried strangling lions that was all baxter and had you tremayne well it just happened that i had baxter indeed you came off scathless i trust tremayne carelessly indicating his arm well he got me one across there baxter obviously excited really really one across there not bad i hope tremayne laughing well it doesnt show unless i do that he pulls up his sleeve carelessly and baxter bends eagerly over his arm baxter good heavens ive found it tremayne found what he pulls down his sleeve baxter i must see mrs tremayne wheres mrs tremayne tremayne she went out just now whats the matter baxter out i must find her this is a matter of life and death he seizes his hat and hurries out by the front door tremayne stares after him in amazement then he pulls up his sleeve looks at his scar again and shakes his head while he is still puzzling over it belinda comes back belinda such a todo in the kitchen the cooks given notice at least she will directly and your lamb cutlet slipped back to the shop when nobody was looking and ive got to go into the village again and oh dear oh dear i have such a lot of things to do looking across at mr baxters door oh yes thats another one mr robinson you will have to leave me farewell tremayne belinda belinda no not even belinda wait till this evening tremayne i have a thousand things to say to you i shall say them this evening belinda giving him her hand begin about eight oclock goodbye till then he takes her hand looks at her for a moment then suddenly bends and kisses it and out belinda stands looking from her hand to him gives a little wondering exclamation and then presses the back of her hand against her cheek and goes to the swing doors she turns back and remembers mr baxter again with a smile she goes to the door and taps gently belinda mr baxter mr baxter you may come in now he has withdrawn i have unhanded him she opens the door and finds the room empty oh baxter comes in at the front door baxter ah there you are belinda turning with a start oh how you frightened me mr baxter i couldnt think what had happened to you i thought perhaps youd been eaten up by one of the umbrellas baxter mrs tremayne i have some wonderful news for you i have found miss robinsons father belinda hardly understanding miss robinsons father baxter yes mr robinson belinda oh you mean oh yes he told me his name was robinson oh but hes no relation baxter wait i saw his arm by a subterfuge i managed to see his arm belinda her eyes opening more and more widely as she begins to realize you saw baxter i saw the mole belinda faintly as she holds out her own arm show me baxter very decorously indicating there belinda holds the place with her other hand and still looking at mr baxter slowly begins to laugh halflaughter halftears wonderingly happily contentedly belinda and i didnt know baxter mrs tremayne i am delighted to have done this service for your niece belinda to herself of course he knew all the time baxter to the world still more am i delighted to have gained the victory over mr devenish in this enterprise belinda eighteen years but i ought to have known baxter at large i shall not be accused of exaggerating when i say that the odds against such an enterprise were enormous belinda eighteen years and now ive eight whole hours to wait baxter triumphantly it will be announced tonight mr devenish i shall say young fellow he arranges his speech in his mind belinda so i was right after all slowly and triumphantly he does look better without a beard baxter making his speech mr devenish young fellow when you matched yourself against a man of my repute when you matched yourself against a man belinda has slipped out to enjoy her happiness alone who has read papers at soires of the royal statistical society when er he looks round the room and discovers to his amazement that he is alone he claps on his bowlerhat gives another amazed look round says with a shrug unusual and goes out act iii it is after dinner in belindas hall belinda is lying on the sofa with a coffeecup in her hand delia in the chair on the right has picked up the lute of love from a table and is reading it impatiently delia what rubbish he writes belinda coming back from her thoughts who dear delia claude mr devenish of course hes very young belinda so was keats darling delia i dont think claude has had keats advantages keats started life as an apothecary belinda so much nicer than a chemist delia now claude started with nothing to do belinda mildly do you always call him claude darling i hope you arent going to grow into a flirt like that horrid mrs tremayne delia silly mother seriously i dont think hell ever be any good till he really gets work did you notice his hair this evening belinda dreamily whose dear delia mummy look me in the eye and tell me you are not being bad belinda innocently bad darling delia youve made mr robinson fall in love with you belinda happily have i delia yes its serious this time hes not like the other two belinda however did you know that delia oh i know belinda darling i believe youve grown up its quite time i settled down delia with mr robinson belinda looks thoughtfully at delia for a little time and then sits up belinda mysteriously delia are you prepared for a great secret to be revealed to you delia childishly oh i love secrets belinda reproachfully darling you mustnt take it like that this is a great deep dark secret youll probably need your sal volatile delia excitedly go on belinda well looking round the room shall we have the lights down a little delia go on mummy belinda well mr robinson is impressively is not quite the robinson he appears to be delia yes belinda in fact child he is hadnt you better come and hold your mothers hand delia struggling with some emotion go on belinda well mr robinson is a sort of relation of yours in fact playing with her rings and looking down coyly he is your father she looks up at delia to see how the news is being received dear one this is not a matter for mirth delia coming over and kissing her darling it is lovely isnt it i am laughing because i am so happy belinda arent you surprised delia no you see claude told me this morning he found out just before mr baxter belinda well every one seems to have known except me delia didnt you see how friendly father and i got at dinner i thought id better

just at present ive rather got mr baxter on my mind i suppose darling you wouldnt like him as well as mr devenish pathetically you see theyre so used to going about together delia claude is quite enough belinda i think i must see mr baxter and get it over do you mind if i have mr devenish too i feel more at home with both of them ill give you him back oh dear i feel so happy tonight she jumps up and goes over to delia and is my little girl going to be happy too thats what mothers always say on the stage i think its so sweet delia smiling at her yes i think so mummy of course im not romantic like you i expect im more like father really belinda dreamily jack can be romantic now he was telling me this morning all about the people he has proposed to i mean i was telling him anyhow he wasnt a bit like a father of course he doesnt know he is a father yet darling i think you might take him into the garden only dont let him know who he is you see he ought to propose to me first oughtnt he as the men come in she gets up here you all are i do hope you havent been throwing away your cigars because smoking is allowed all over the house tremayne oh weve finished thank you belinda isnt it a wonderful night and so warm for april delia you must show mr robinson the garden by moonlight its the only light he hasnt seen it by devenish quickly i dont think ive ever seen it by moonlight miss delia belinda i thought poets were always seeing things by moonlight baxter i was hoping mrs tremayne that er perhaps delia come along mr robinson tremayne looks at belinda who gives him a nod tremayne its very kind of you miss robinson i suppose there is no chance of a nightingale belinda there ought to be i ordered one specially for mr devenish delia and tremayne go out together belinda settles herself comfortably on the sofa now were together again well mr devenish devenish er i belinda no i think ill let mr baxter speak first i know hes longing to baxter yes hrm mrs tremayne i beg formally to claim your hand belinda sweetly on what grounds mr baxter devenish spiritedly yes sir on what grounds baxter on the grounds that as i told you this morning i had succeeded in the quest devenish appearing to be greatly surprised succeeded baxter yes mr devenish young fellow you have lost i have discovered the missing mr robinson devenish who where baxter dramatically miss robinson has at this moment gone out with her father devenish good heavens it was he belinda sympathetically poor mr devenish devenish pointing tragically to the table and to think that i actually sat on that table no that seat no not that one it was the sofa that i sat on the sofa with him this morning and never guessed why ten minutes ago i was asking him for the nuts baxter aha devenish youre not so clever as you thought you were devenish why i must have given you the clue myself he told me he had a scar on his arm and i never thought any more of it and then i went away innocently and left you two talking about it belinda alarmed a scar on his arm devenish where a lion mauled him belinda gives a little shudder baxter its quite healed up now mrs tremayne belinda looking at him admiringly a lion what you two have adventured for my sake baxter i suppose you will admit devenish that i may fairly claim to have won looking the picture of despair devenish droops his head raises his arms and lets them fall hopelessly to his sides belinda mr devenish i have never admired you so much as i do at this moment baxter indignantly to devenish i say you know thats not fair its all very well to take your defeat like a man but you mustnt overdo it mrs tremayne i claim the reward which i have earned belinda after a pause mr baxter mr devenish i have something to tell you penitently i have not been quite frank with you i think you both ought to know that i i made a mistake delia is not my niece she is my daughter devenish your daughter i say how ripping belinda gives him an understanding look baxter your daughter belinda yes baxter but but you arent old enough to have a daughter of that age belinda apologetically well there she is baxter but but shes grown up belinda quite baxter then in that case you must be he hesitates evidently working it out belinda hastily im afraid so mr baxter baxter but this makes a great difference i had no idea why when im fifty you would be belinda sighing yes i suppose i should baxter and when im sixty belinda pleadingly to devenish cant you stop him devenish look here baxter another word from you and youll never get to sixty baxter and then theres miss er delia in the event of our marrying mrs tremayne she i take it would be my stepdaughter belinda i dont think she would trouble us much mr baxter i have an idea that she will be getting married before long she glances at devenish who returns her look gratefully baxter none the less the fact would be disturbing i have never yet considered myself seriously as a stepfather i dont think i am going too far if i say that to some extent i have been deceived in this matter belinda reproachfully and so have i i thought you loved me devenish sympathetically yes yes belinda turning to him suddenly and mr devenish too baxter er devenish er they stand before her guiltily and have nothing to say belinda with a shrug well i shall have to marry somebody else thats all baxter who belinda i suppose mr robinson after all if i am delias mother and mr baxter says that mr robinsons her father its about time we were married devenish eagerly mrs tremayne what fools we are he is your husband all the time belinda yes baxter youve had a husband all the time belinda apologetically i lost him it wasnt my fault baxter really this is very confusing i dont know where i am i gather i am to gather it seems that you are no longer eligible as a possible wife belinda i am afraid not mr baxter baxter but this is very confusing this is very disturbing to a man of my age for weeks past i have been regarding myself as a a possible benedict i have ah taken steps only this morning in writing to my housekeeper i warned her that she might hear at any moment a most startling announcement devenish cheerfully oh thats all right that might only mean that you were getting a new bowlerhat baxter suddenly ah and what about you sir how is it that you take this so lightly triumphantly i have it it all becomes clear to me you have transferred your affections to her daughter devenish oh i say baxter this is very crude belinda and why should he not mr baxter softly he has made me very happy baxter he has made you happy mrs tremayne belinda very happy baxter thoughtfully ah he takes a turn round the room in silence and then comes back to her mrs tremayne i have taken a great resolve solemnly i also will make you happy thumping his heart i also will woo miss delia suddenly seizing devenishs arm come we will seek miss delia together it may be that she will send us upon another quest in which i shall again be victorious tempestuously come i say he marches the resisting devenish to the swing doors devenish to belinda please belinda gently mr baxter harold baxter stops and turns round you are too impetuous i think that as delias mother baxter your pardon mrs tremayne in the intoxication of the moment i am forgetting formally i have the honour to ask your permission to pay my addresses belinda no no i didnt mean that but as delias mother i ought to warn you that she is hardly fitted to take the place of your housekeeper she is not very domesticated baxter indignantly not domesticated why did i not hear her tell her father at dinner that she had arranged all the flowers belinda there are other things than flowers devenish bedsocks for instance baxter its a very tricky thing airing bedsocks i am sure your housekeeper baxter mrs tremayne she will learn the daughter of such a mother i need say no more belinda oh thank you but there is something else mr baxter you are not being quite fair to yourself in starting out upon this simultaneous wooing you forget that mr devenish has already had his turn this morning alone you should have yours alone too devenish oh i say baxter yes yes you are right i must introduce myself first as a suitor i see that to devenish you stay here i will go alone into the garden and belinda it is perhaps a little cold out of doors for people of of our age mr baxter now in the library baxter astonished library belinda yes baxter you have a library belinda to devenish he doesnt believe i have a library devenish you ought to see the library baxter baxter but you are continually springing surprises on me this evening mrs tremayne first a daughter then a husband and then a library i have been here three weeks and i never knew you had a library dear me i wonder how it is that i never saw it belinda modestly i thought you came to see me baxter yes yes to see you certainly but if i had known you had a library belinda oh i am so glad i mentioned it wasnt it lucky mr devenish baxter my work has been greatly handicapped of late by lack of certain books to which i wanted to refer it would be a great help belinda my dear mr baxter my whole library is at your disposal to devenish as she leads the way to the door in a confidential whisper im just going to show him the encyclopedia britannica she smiles at him and he opens the door for them both then he goes towards the garden door and looks outside delia from the garden hullo were just coming in he goes back and waits for them tremayne wheres mrs tremayne devenish shes gone to the library with baxter tremayne carelessly oh the library wheres that devenish promptly going towards the door and opening it the end door on the right right at the end you cant mistake it on the right tremayne ah yes he looks round at delia yes he looks at devenish yes he goes out devenish hastily shuts the door and comes back to delia devenish i say your mother is a ripper delia enthusiastically isnt she remembering at least you mean my aunt devenish smiling at her no i mean your mother to think that i once had the cheek to propose to her delia oh is it cheek to propose to people devenish to her delia but not to me devenish oh i say delia delia with great dignity thank you my name is miss robinson i mean tremayne devenish well if youre not quite sure which it is its much safer to call you delia delia smiling well perhaps it is devenish and if i did propose to you you havent answered delia if you want an answer now its no but if you like to wait till next april devenish reproachfully oh i say and i cut my hair for you the same afternoon you havent really told me how you like it yet delia oh how bad of me you look lovely devenish and i promised to give up poetry for your sake delia perhaps i oughtnt to have asked you that devenish as far as im concerned delia ill do it gladly but of course one has to think about posterity delia but you neednt be a poet you could give posterity plenty to think about if you were a statesman devenish i dont quite see your objection to poetry delia you would be about the house so much i want you to go away every day and do great things and then come home in the evening and tell me all about it devenish then you are thinking of marrying me delia well i was just thinking in case i had to devenish it would be rather fun if you did and look here i will be a statesman if you like and go up to downing street every day and come back in the evening and tell you all about it delia how nice of you devenish magnificently holding up his hand to heaven farewell parnassus delia what does that mean devenish well it means that ive chucked poetry a statesmans life is the life for me behold mr devenish the new mp no look here that was quite accidental delia smiling at him i believe i shall really like you when i get to know you devenish i dont know if its you or devonshire or the fact that ive had my hair cut but i feel quite a different being from what i was three days ago delia you are different perhaps its your sense of humour coming back devenish perhaps thats it its a curious feeling delia holding out her hand lets go outside theres a heavenly moon devenish taking her hand moon moon now where have i heard that word before delia what do you mean devenish i was trying not to be a poet well ill come with you but i shall refuse to look at it putting his left hand behind his back he walks slowly out with her saying to himself the prime minister then left the house belinda and tremayne come from the library belinda as he opens the door thank you i dont think its unkind to leave him do you he seemed quite happy tremayne i shouldnt have been happy if wed stayed belinda going to the sofa and putting her feet up yes but i was really thinking of mr baxter tremayne not of me belinda well i thought it was mr baxters turn poor man hes had a disappointment lately tremayne eagerly a disappointment belinda yes he thought i was younger than i was tremayne smiling to himself how old are you belinda belinda dropping her eyes twentytwo after a pause he thought i was eighteen such a disappointment tremayne smiling openly at her belinda how old are you belinda just about the right age mr robinson tremayne the right age for what belinda for this sort of conversation tremayne shall i tell you how old you are belinda do you mean in figures or poetically tremayne i meant belinda mr devenish said i was as old as the now i must get this the right way round as old as the tremayne i dont want to talk about mr devenish belinda with a sigh nobody ever does except mr devenish as old as the stars and as young as the dawn settling herself cosily i think thats rather a nice age to be dont you tremayne a very nice age to be belinda its a pity hes thrown me over for delia i shall miss that sort of thing rather you dont say those sort of things about your auntinlaw not so often tremayne eagerly he really is in love with miss robinson belinda oh yes i expect he is out in the moonlight with her now comparing her to diana tremayne well that accounts for him now what about baxter belinda i thought i told you deeply disappointed to find that i was four years older than he expected mr baxter hurried from the drawingroom and buried himself in a column of the encyclopedia britannica tremayne well that settles baxter are there any more men in the neighbourhood belinda shaking her head isnt it awful ive only had those two for the last three weeks tremayne sits on the back of the sofa and looks down at her tremayne belinda belinda yes henry tremayne my name is john belinda well you never told me i had to guess everybody thinks they can call me belinda without giving me the least idea what their own names are you were saying john tremayne my friends call me jack belinda jack robinson thats the man who always goes away so quickly i hope youre making more of a stay tremayne oh you maddening maddening woman belinda well i have to keep the conversation going you do nothing but say belinda tremayne taking her hand have you ever loved anybody seriously belinda belinda i dont ever do anything very seriously the late mr tremayne my first husband jack isnt it funny his name was jack he used to complain about it too sometimes tremayne with conviction silly ass belinda ah i think you are a little hard on the late mr tremayne tremayne has he been dead long belinda dead to me tremayne you quarrelled belinda yes it was his fault entirely tremayne im sure it was belinda how sweet of you to say that tremayne belinda i want you to marry me and forget about him belinda happily to herself this is the proposal that those lamb cutlets interrupted this morning tremayne belinda i love you do you understand belinda suppose my first husband turns up suddenly like like e a tremayne like who belinda well like anybody tremayne he wont i know he wont dont you love me enough to risk it belinda belinda i havent really said i love you at all yet tremayne well say it now belinda looks at him and then down again you do well im going to have a kiss anyway he comes round the sofa and kisses her quickly there belinda rising ooh the late mr tremayne never did that tremayne i have already told you that he was a silly ass sitting down on the sofa belinda belinda yes henry i mean jack tremayne do you know who i am he is thoroughly enjoying the surprise he is about to give her belinda nodding yes jack tremayne who belinda jack tremayne tremayne jumping up good heavens you know belinda gently yes jack tremayne angrily youve known all the time that i was your husband and youve been playing with me and leading me on belinda mildly well darling you knew all the time that i was your wife and youve been making love to me and leading me on tremayne thats different belinda thats just what the late mr tremayne said and then he slammed the door and went straight off to the rocky mountains and shot bears and i didnt see him again for eighteen years tremayne remorsefully darling i was a fool then and im a fool now belinda i was a fool then but im not such a fool now im not going to let you go its quite time i married and settled down tremayne you darling how did you find out who i was belinda awkwardly well it was rather curious darling after a pause it was april and i felt all sort of aprily and and there was the garden all full of daffodils and and there was mr baxter the one we left in the library knowing all about moles hes probably got the m volume down now well we were talking about them one day and i happened to say that the late mr tremayne that was you darling had rather a peculiar one on his arm and then he happened to see it this morning and told me about it tremayne what an extraordinary story belinda yes darling its really much more extraordinary than that i think perhaps id better tell you the rest of it another time coaxingly now show me where the nasty lion scratched you tremayne pulls up his sleeve oh she kisses his arm you shouldnt have left chelsea darling tremayne i should never have found you if i hadnt belinda squeezing his arm no jack you wouldnt after a pause i ive got another little surprise for you if if youre ready for it standing up properly speaking i ought to be wearing white i shall certainly stand up while im telling you modestly darling we have a daughter our little delia tremayne delia you said her name was robinson belinda yes darling but you said yours was one always takes ones fathers name unless of course you were lord robinson tremayne but you said her name was robinson before you oh never mind about that a daughter belinda how could you let me go and not tell me belinda you forget how youd slammed the door it isnt the sort of thing you shout through the window to a man on his way to america tremayne taking her in his arms oh belinda dont let me ever go away again belinda im not going to jack im going to settle down into a staid old married woman tremayne oh no youre not youre going on just as you did before and im going to propose to you every april and win you over all the other men in love with you belinda you darling delia and devenish come in from the garden tremayne quietly to belinda our daughter delia going up to tremayne youre my father tremayne if you dont mind very much delia delia youve been away a long time tremayne ill do my best to make up for it belinda delia darling i think you might kiss your poor old father as the does to devenish suddenly and hastily kisses belinda on the cheek devenish just in case youre going to be my motherinlaw tremayne we seem to be rather a family party belinda suddenly there weve forgotten mr baxter again baxter who has come in quietly with a book in his hand oh dont mind about me mrs tremayne ive enjoyed myself immensely referring to his book i have been collecting some most valuable information on looking round at them lunacy in the er county of devonshire the red feathers an operetta in one act in the livingroom of a countryhouse half farm half manor a mother and her daughter are sitting it is any year you please between let us say the day when the fiddle first came to england and the day when romance left it as for the time of the year let us call it may oh yes it is certainly may and about twelve oclock and the daughter is singing at the spinet while her mother is at her needlework through the lattice windows the murmur of a stream can be heard on whose banks but we shall come to that directly let us listen now to what the daughter is singing life passes by i do not know its pleasure or its pain the spring was here the spring is here again the spring will die life passes by the doors of pain and pleasure open wide the crowd streams in and i am left outside they know not i you dont like it neither did her mother mother looking up from her work yes i should call that a melancholy song dear daughter it is sung by a melancholy person mother mother why are you that child daughter getting up i want so much that i shall never have mother well so do we all daughter impatiently oh why does nothing ever happen we sit here all day and we sing or do our embroidery and we go to bed and the next day we get up and do the same things over again and so it goes on mother is that all there is in the world mother its all there is in our world daughter are we so very poor mother we have the house and very little else daughter oh i wish that we were really poor mother you neednt wish child daughter oh but i mean so that it wouldnt matter what clothes we wore so that we could wander over the hills and down into the valleys and sleep perhaps in a barn and bathe ourselves in the brook next morning and mother i dont think i should like that very much perhaps im peculiar daughter oh if only i were a boy to go out and make my own way in the world would you let me go mother if i were a boy mother i dont suppose youd ask me dear daughter sighing oh well we must make the best of it i suppose perhaps one day something will happen she goes back to the spinet and sings again lads and lasses what will you sell what will you sell four stout walls and a roof atop warm fires gleaming brightly wellstored cellar and garnered crop moneybags packed tightly an ordered task in an ordered day and a sure bed nightly years which peacefully pass away until death comes lightly lads and lasses what will you buy what will you buy here is a cap to cover your head a cap with one red feather here is a cloak to make your bed warm or winter weather here is a satchel to store your ware strongly lined with leather and here is a staff to take you there when you go forth together lads and lasses what will you gain what will you gain chatter of rooks on tall elmtrees new spring houses taking daffodils in an april breeze golden curtsies making shadows of clouds across the weald from hill to valley breaking the first faint stir which the woodlands yield when the world is waking lads and lasses this is your gain this is your gain towards the end of the song the face and shoulders of the talker appear at the open lattice window on the left he listens with a bland and happy smile until the song is finished talker brava brava they turn round towards the window in astonishment a vastly pleasing song vastly well sung mademoiselle nightingale permit me to felicitate you turning to the mother the mother of the nightingale also mon dieu what is voice of a richness of a purity to live with it always madame i felicitate you again mother i must ask you sir to explain the meaning of this intrusion talker intrusion oh fie madame not intrusion my feet stand

taciturn disposition this i frankly madame i have lost that sentence have i your gracious permission to begin again mother i think it would be better sir talker then to put it shortly madame mother if you could sir talker to be completely frank in this matter madame i er go round with the hat it is a sordid but necessary business daughter eagerly oh i hope they give you plenty of money talker enough to support life mademoiselle the hungry look which you observe upon his flutiness is as i have explained due to melancholy daughter you are going to perform arent you talker of a surety mademoiselle perhaps i should add that for myself i am resting just now and that my part of the performance will be limited to nothing more than a note or two upon the pipe mother with a friendly smile sir you are generous we shall be glad to hear your friends the talker bows and turns to his company talker a song good master duke a song which her royal sweetness will accompany upon the fiddle let it end i pray you with a g so that i may bring the thing to a climax upon the last note fiddler to singer morland hill singer you like that she nods very well he sings oh when the wind is in the north i take my staff and sally forth and when it whistles from the east i do not mind it in the least the warm wind murmurs through the trees its messages from southern seas but after all perhaps the best is that which whispers from the west oh let the wind the wind be what it will so long as i may walk on morland hill the staff which helps to carry me i cut it from the hazeltree but once i had a cudgel torn most circumspectly from the thorn i know a fellow far from rash who swears entirely by the ash and all good travellers invoke a blessing on the mighty oak oh let the wood the wood be what it will so long as i may walk on morland hill some years ago i gave my heart to prue until we had to part then seeing susans pretty face i left it with her for a space and susan had my heart until i wanted it for mistress jill i think although i am not clear that chloes had it this last year oh let the wench the wench be whom you will so long as i may walk on morland hill the talker comes in proudly on the last note and takes most of the applause daughter im not sure that i like that last verse talker oh you mustnt believe all he sings a cursed melancholy fellow by nature but waggish waggish withal singer to daughter we have to sing what the poets write for us mademoiselle had i written a song myself it had been about one woman only talker and there would have been a hundred and twentyfive verses to it mother your song was well sung sir i thank you for it to the fiddler will you not play us something now fiddler if you wish it talker you would wish me to accompany her of course mother with a smile it is kind of you sir but i think perhaps my daughter daughter eagerly yes of course i will if i can she goes to the spinet fiddler playing a few notes do you know this daughter yes i think so she plays at the end of it the talker finds himself bowing to the applause talker and now madame you have had a sample of all our poor talents save and except that paltry talent of mine which in other company concludes such a performance i pray you tell me what you think of the entertainment mother i have enjoyed it immensely good master johannes and if you did wish to exercise that talent of yours of which so far we have only heard talker nay nay madame i beg you mother then sir i offer you my grateful thanks for your entertainment daughter and i too talker ladies you are too kind er he hesitates er mother yes talker the fact is madame that now we approach or so to speak draw nigh or adjacent in other words madame we are perilously approximate fiddler tell her straight out mother tell her what fiddler what weve come for singer master johannes madam is so accustomed when he goes round with the hat to disguise under it flow of words the fact that money is as necessary to an artist as applause that he has lost the habit of saying anything in less than ten sentences talker mournfully and yet i am a taciturn man mower well will somebody tell me for i confess i have been wondering what is behind it all fiddler tell her johannes talker if you will allow me madame but tell me first did you notice anything lacking in our performance mother surprised no i dont think so talker to daughter perhaps you mademoiselle daughter shyly it seemed to lack a womans voice sir talker admiringly what intelligence what profundity to mother madam i felicitate you again on your daughter unerringly she has laid her finger on the weak joint in our armour we have no womans voice mother well sir i dont see how i can help you talker madame you have a nightingale it has lived in a cage all its life it looks through the bars sometimes and sees the great world outside and sighs and turns back to its business of singing madame it would sing better outside in the open air with the other birds mother i dont understand you sir are you referring to my daughter talker looking towards the window there is a stream which runs beyond the road with a green bank to it we were seated on that bank i and my two companions eating our bread and cheese and washing it down with draughts from that good stream we were tired for we had come from over the hills that morning and it was good to lie on our backs there and watch the little clouds taking shape after shape in the blue and so to dream our dreams in a little while the road would take us westward here through a wood banked with primroses there across a common or between high spring hedges with the little stream babbling ever at the side of us and in the evening we would come to an inn where there would be good company and we would sing and play to them and they would reward us with a shrug it is a pleasant life daughter eagerly oh go on mother yes go on sir talker we were lying on our backs thus madame when we heard the nightingale duke says i it is early yet for the nightingale his flutiness removes his cap from his face takes a squint at the sun and says monstrous early good master johannes and claps his cap back again what says you fiddler says i in this matter of nightingales is it possible says i the sun being where it is and nightingales being what they are to wit nightingales its not a nightingale says fiddler dreamily its a girl then says i jumping up it is a girl we want she must put the red feather in her cap and come her ways with us with a bow madame your humble servant daughter oh mother you will let me go wont you i must i must he is quite right im caged here oh you will let me see something of the world before i grow old fiddler suddenly yes let her come if she feels like that she ought to come singer with a very winning smile we will take great care of her madame as if she were our own sister mother surprisingly to johannes what do you think of cider as a drink master johannes talker who had not expected it but is always ready cider ah theres a drink oh i can talk to you about cider glum body as i am by nature having been as it were taciturn from birth yet of cider i could talk you mother ours is considered very good cider to her daughter take them child and give them such refreshment as they want they have deserved it for their entertainment daughter why of course mother come this way please she leads the way and the others follow the talker coming last and murmuring cider to himself mother master johannes he turns round a word with you if you please sir talker but certainly madame the cider will be all the better for the expectation mother sit down please he does so master johannes who are you all of you talker i thought i had explained madame her royal sweetness princess carissima his flutiness the duke of bogota and myself a humble marquis we may be referred to collectively as the red feathers for myself i am sometimes called silent john being of a close disposition mother whatever you are called you are i think a man of the world and you will understand that if i am to trust my daughter to you for however little a time i must know something more about you talker madame i will make a confession to you a confession i have never yet made to man woman or child i am fortysix years of age it is in fact my birthday were i to begin to tell you something about myself starting from that day fortysix years ago when i was born were i to begin well madame i am only too ready to begin it is a subject i find vastly pleasant but looking at her comically shall i begin mother with a smile would you make it so long a story sir talker with a sigh the tongue is an unruly member and to one who has but three notes on the pipe and yet desires to express himself talking is a great comfort mother i said you were a man of the world sir may i say now that i think you must be a man of our world talker i am a man of many worlds but if it would comfort your mothers heart to know that your daughter will be in good company i think i can give you that comfort mother is that all you can give me the talker gets up and walks about frowning to himself suddenly he takes out his pipe plays cuckoo to himself very solemnly and is immensely relieved thereby he comes back to the mother with a beaming face talker madame i will tell you a story holding up his hand to stop any expostulation no quite a short one once on a time there was a certain noble gentleman a baron of estates and family conceiving himself to be in love he dared to put it to the touch to win or lose it all i regret to say that he lost it all in a fit of melancholy he abjured society cursed all women and took to the road a pleasant melancholy gentleman i made him a duke mother eagerly indicating the door out of which the duke has just gone you mean he really is talker we will name no names madame i doubt not i have no right to speak of him to another it is just a story putting his pipe to his lips cuckoo mother poor child she is not happy here we live so quietly we have no neighbours i have wondered what to do it seemed that i could do so little if only i could be sure suddenly master johannes do you like the look of this house with its little stream opposite and the green bank running down on which one may lie on ones back and look up at the sky talker did we not single it out above all others by having our bread and cheese outside it mother will you all stay with me for a little i think i can find room for you before i can lend my daughter to you i feel that i must know something of you i think that is the best way is it not with a very friendly smile the cider is good you know talker rising and boning madame we need say no more the other three come in the daughter has found from somewhere a cap with a red feather in it they stand in a row opposite the mother and to the fiddlers accompaniment sing a merry song together the cuckoo comes in april sings his song in may changes his tune in the middle of june and then he flies away he the cuckoo comes when aprils here he is not very good i fear he goes and takes another nest perhaps he does it for the best cuckoo cuckoo she when aprils over he begins repenting of his former sins from tree to tree he takes his way but this is all he finds to say cuckoo cuckoo he by june he gets a trifle flat which is not to be wondered at and critical observers note a huskiness about the throat huskily cuckoo cuckoo she alas he does not stay for long but other birds take up the song of summer gently following the wild and happy days of spring cuckoo the talker conducts with his pipe in his hand and hums la la la to himself he pipes the chorus with them at the conclusion they all bow or curtsey deeply to the mother mother half laughing half crying oh talker suddenly and dramatically holding up his hand listen everybody what talker didnt i hear somebody say cider it is eight days later when we see them again the daughter is at the spinet playing an accompaniment to the song which she and the singer are sharing for the moment she he does not know i love him he does not care the sky is blue above him the road is there for those who dare alas why should he care he she does not know i love her she does not know the sky is blue above her the soft winds blow where violets grow alas how should she know together yet those who sing about the spring all say it should bring two lovers together oh where oh where will you find a pair so matched as you and i love come rain or shine come wet or fine if you are mine what matter the weather oh take my hand and kiss me and confess that you are my love he she does not know i love her ah yes she knows the sky is blue above her the buds disclose the first wild rose ah yes she knows she knows she he cares not that i love him ah yes he cares the sky is blue above him a thrush declares the world is theirs ah yes how much he cares together for those who sing etc daughter looking up at him it is a pretty song singer the words i thought were good i liked the words daughter who thinks of the words of a song if the tune be pretty singer but if the heart of the singer be in the words daughter suddenly as she gets up tell me about chloe singer surprised chloe daughter or whatever her name was singer hurt i am not sure that i understand this conversation daughter i mean the first one singer i am not sure that i like this conversation daughter she was the first wasnt she the one who made you renounce the world and take to the road singer stiffly her name was not chloe daughter coaxingly what was it singer annoyed why rake up the dead ashes of the past i was but a boy it was five months ago besides her name was penelope daughter you still remember it though it was so long ago singer i could have pretended to have forgotten if it would have pleased you better daughter coldly i oh i am not interested singer well i didnt start the subject perhaps as neither of us is interested i had better withdraw since we are to start this afternoon i have much to see about bowing with your permission daughter stopping him dont go i am sorry i have been unkind singer smiling shall we practise that other song our voices agree if our our hearts do not daughter distressed oh dont say that we must be friends singer only friends daughter gently tell me about her singer there is not much to tell dear i thought she loved me perhaps that was why i thought i loved her when i told her she pretended to be surprised i dont think she was surprised she was very pretty he pauses daughter and hard singer it is not for me to say anything against her it is through her that i came here daughter when you came here the other day had you forgotten her singer singing oh let the wench the wench be whom she will so long as i can walk on morland hill didnt i say so on that first day daughter of course i know very little of the world but i do wonder sometimes if people who sing about the joys of wandering are really enjoying it all the time singer looking round at the window is johannes about daughter surprised no singer then i will be frank with you just lately i have been wondering too daughter oh singer rapidly i have a house you would like my house i have a park you would like the park horses to ride and jewels to wear i go to london sometimes and see the king you would like london daughter tragically i have never been to london singer letting himself go suddenly sweetheart all that i have in an ordinary whisper be careful fiddler just went past the window keeping his arm round her he breaks into the last line or two of his song she joins in as if they were rehearsing enter the fiddler singer to daughter yes i think we have it pretty well now tis a good song turning round suddenly and seeing the fiddler ah fiddler are you there what do you think of it fiddler isnt it time to start singer to start ah yes we start this afternoon well we have had a pleasant holiday and must get to work again daughter eagerly and i am coming with you fiddler it is settled daughter oh yes i think so fiddler it is the best life to daughter play something as the daughter goes to the spinet the singer goes out they play when it is over the daughter turns round and looks at the fiddler and sighs daughter that is all you want just you and your fiddle and the open road fiddler it is the best life the talker appears at the window talker aha what did i hear did i hear our loquacious fiddler perorating upon life life quoth she with much argument and circumstantial matter life she continued making her points singly and one by one thus keeping the business in its true perspective life is lamely well what is life fiddler when do we start johannes the daughter goes out talker are you so eager to be gone fiddler we have been here eight days talker eight days and troy was besieged for eleven years eight days why i could talk for eight days without taking breath and i am by nature a glum silent man nay nay say not to me eight days eight days will not make a man grow old or a woman lose her beauty the mother comes into the room or a woman lose her beauty madame i kiss your hands were i of less girth i would flit through the window and fall upon my knees at your feet the fiddler with a shrug goes out as it is i shall enter by the door in the usual way i have your permission mother smiling you asked my permission a week ago you do not need to ask it now talker still at the window it has been a happy week the week has liked me well mother you take the road again this afternoon your plan still holds talker with a sigh they say so lady mother who say so is not master johannes the master of his company who say so talker the birds i held converse with a cuckoobird this morning cuckoo he said in this manner he imitates it on his pipe meaning as i gathered o fool i bowed low to him and pardon bird said i but i would have you tell me why i am a fool he answered thus in parables cuckoo mother and what did that mean talker sighing it meant theres no fool like an old fool she looks away he waits a little then sighs again and leaves the window entering a moment later by the door mother looking up well sir talker madame i am a man of good family although although i quarrelled with my good family i left them many years ago and took to the road i have seen something of the world since then but i think i must always have had at the back of my mind some dim picture of what a home was some ancient memory perhaps that memory has been very strong within me these last days mother you have liked my home master johannes talker i have liked it well he takes out his pipe and plays a melancholy cuckoo well well we start this afternoon mother you want my daughter talker sadly not your daughter madame mother what is it you want are you so backward in asking it is not like the master johannes who came to my house eight days ago talker taking his courage in his hands madame though i have wandered about the world i have saved some pennies in my time a few trifling coins enough for middleage since i have had the great honour of knowing you he breaks of as the voice of the singer to full song is heard approaching oh god bless that poor young fool madame i entreat you mother rising and moving hastily away another time dear johannes she smiles very fondly at him as she goes out another time you must tell me all the talker stares after her hardly believing then with an air of solemn happiness he takes out his pipe and dances carefully but cheerfully round the room piping to himself the singer comes in singing merrily he joins the talker at the end of the room turns round with hint and trips up and down the room with him one singing and the other piping talker friend we are gay singer very very gay master johannes they turn round and go up and down the room as before talker something is stirring our middleaged blood i feel years younger singer i have only just been born talker with a wave of the hand shall we take another turn singer at your pleasure they go up and down as before talker looking at the other anxiously out of the corners of his eyes what do you think has happened to us singer with a similar look i i wonder talker nervously i suppose the fact that we are going off this afternoon the joy of returning to our old gay life is is affecting us singer i i suppose so without enthusiasm yes that must be it talker this cauliflower existence this settled life which even the least enterprising cabbage would find monotonous we have had more than enough of it my friend singer yes he sighs deeply i sigh to think how we have wasted these eight days talker ah he sighs still more deeply however heaven be praised we are for the road this afternoon singer gloomily heaven be praised it is a grand life talker carelessly of course if you came to me and said johannes you said i left my home in a fit of melancholy five months agone the melancholy is cured i will return home again why i would say god bless you master duke go your way well i can understand such a thing happening to a man of your age not born to the wandering as i am singer bless you johannes you are a true gentleman talker airily say no more say no more singer but i cannot accept this sacrifice i pledged myself to serve you for a year and ill keep my pledge talker considerably upset by this wait a moment master duke i have myself thought of retiring these many months past indeed it was only for your sake singer no no i cannot allow it it is only for my sake that you are saying this we will take the road this afternoon heroically indeed i would infinitely prefer it i am enamoured of the wandering life talker it is a great life it means everything to me they stand side by side looking gloomily in front of them gradually they begin to glance towards each other they catch each others eyes and understand each other thoroughly talker clapping the singer heartily on the back i knew it i knew it you and the wandering life singer delightedly you too johannes youve had enough of it they suddenly turn round and go up and down the room together piping and singing a genteel cough is heard outside the window and the mother is seen for a moment the talker turns round with his pipe to his lips they go up the room together again and at the top the talker with a wave of the hand leaves his companion and goes out he is seen passing the window the daughter comes in singer sweetheart daughter going to him is it all right singer everything is all right beloved daughter you have told him singer nodding it couldnt have fallen out better he too was tired of wandering and wanted to settle down daughter i told mother she seemed glad you know i think she seems younger about something enter fiddler fiddler are we starting this afternoon daughter oh fiddler dear do you mind very much she holds out her hand and the singer takes it we arent coming at all we we singer we are getting married fiddler nodding to herself i thought so daughter but you will come and stay with us sometimes oh say you will singer smiling at fiddler with great friendliness of course she will the talker and the mother are seen coming least the windows fiddler theres johannes i expect we shall be starting this afternoon the talker and the mother come in arminarm he bows to her and takes the floor talker ladies and gentlemen companionsinarms knights and ladies of the road comrades all i have the honour to make an announcement to you the wandering company of the red feathers is determined from this date likewise disbanded or as others would say dissolved what means this master johannes i hear you say who has done this thing ladies and gentles all i answer you that young cupid has done this thing with unerring aim he has loosed his arrows with the same happy arrow taking the mothers hand he has pierced the hearts of this gracious lady and myself while yonder gallant gentleman i name no names but the perspicacious will perceive whom i mean is about to link his life with the charming maiden who stands so modestly by his side there is one other noble lady present to whom i have not yet referred fiddler holding out her hand to the mother i think i must go goodbye and thank you mother taking her hand and patting it wait a moment dear talker continuing his speech noble lady to whom i have not yet referred i will not hide from you the fact that she plays upon the fiddle with an elegance rarely to be heard it is the earnest wish of swelling his chest my future wife and myself that she should take up her abode with us fiddler its very kind of you but i dont think daughter coming across mother shes going to stay with us she promised mother its sweet of you to ask her dear but i think it would be much more suitable that she should live with us singer we should love to have her and she could come and see you whenever she liked mother i was going to suggest that she should live with us and come and see you sometimes talker who has been thinking deeply i have it what say you to this for six months making in all twentysix weeks of the year she shall live reside dwell or as one might say take up her habitation with us whereas for the other six months they have been so busy discussing the future of the fiddler that they have not noticed that she is no longer there suddenly the sound of the fiddle is heard whats that the fiddler comes in wearing her cap now with the red feather in it she is playing a wild song a song of the road she is content again she goes up the room and as she passes them she gives them a little bend of the head and the beginnings of a grave smile she goes out of the door still playing she is still playing as she goes past the windows they follow her with their eyes when she is gone they still listen until the music dies in the distance
