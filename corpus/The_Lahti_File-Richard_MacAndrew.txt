 chapter one a job for munro read these said naylor passing three small pieces of newspaper across the table on their own theyre not much but together he stopped talking and looked out of his office window for a moment half closing his eyes in thought together he continued they could mean something strange is happening ian munro picked up the three short newspaper stories and read them carefully some fish were dead and nobody knew why two people were dead probably because some poison gas had escaped and there werent as many birds as usual in a town if they were three stories from three different places probably noone would think twice but they were three stories about the same place lahti in finland and they were all stories from within the last eight months in fact the last one was dated april th only a few days ago munro looked across at naylor naylor was a tall man with grey hair and hard bright blue eyes he was dressed in a dark grey suit with a white shirt and a dark blue tie munro thought not for the first time how little he knew about naylor but then naylor spent his working life sending people on jobs from which they might never return perhaps it wasnt surprising that he didnt seem to have a lot of friends i see what you mean said munro sitting back in his chair what do you think is happening im not sure replied naylor looking at munro poison of some sort poison gas maybe possibly someone is making it but we dont know who or why not yet anyway naylor put the three stories back into the file on his desk as he closed it munro saw the name lahti written on the front you lived in finland for some years didnt you said naylor hows your finnish its fine replied munro people usually think i come from lapland north of the arctic circle good i want you to go over there to lahti twenty years ago people would have called ian munro a spy today he was called a foreign executive it was the same business really just a different name naylor continued youre on the plane to helsinki finland your tickets are ready downstairs in the travel office youve got a meeting in lahti at six oclock this evening on the steps of the church in kirkkokatu who am i meeting asked munro a man called pentti virolainen he has some information for us about these stories find out what he knows and then wait for my orders any questions munro had lots of questions but he knew that naylor would only tell him what he needed to know just one said munro why us i mean its a finnish problem why dont we let the finns do something about it naylor moved forward in his chair and put his hands on the table the information i have at the moment leads me to believe that it would not be a good idea to tell the finns what we know i cant tell you more than that for now it may become clear later munro said nothing sometimes it made the job easier if you didnt have the complete picture chapter two meeting at the church seven hours later munro checked into the hotel lahden seurahuone on aleksanterinkatu one of lahtis main streets he spoke english to the receptionist behind the desk he enjoyed speaking finnish but it might be an advantage if people didnt know he could they might give away information thinking that he did not understand in his room he took his clothes out of his suitcase and put them away carefully he always did this in the same way so that he would know if someone had searched his room munro knew they would find nothing he never carried important papers he never carried a gun if someone found a gun there were always a lot of questions to answer munro checked his watch it was already time to go he looked in the mirror light grey eyes looked back at him his hair dark brown almost black was a bit long but tidy he was wearing jeans and a grey top he picked up his map of lahti just another tourist out sightseeing out on the street munro checked that noone was waiting for him he had already checked at the airport and when he got off the coach in lahti however it was impossible to be too careful last year an executive was killed at bangkok airport before he had even started the job there were some very red faces in london that day the street was busy so munro took his time checking noone was following good the days were already getting longer it was still very light and it was warm for april as he walked across kauppatori the market square he could see the church rising up over on his right he knew from some tourist information in the hotel that the church completed in was the work of the finnish architect alvar aalto munro usually liked the clean lines that finnish architects brought to their buildings he was surprised to discover that the church was rather an ugly building munro turned into the bottom of mariankatu and started walking up the short hill towards the church the street was empty he looked at his watch again there was noone on the church steps at the top of the street he looked left and right along kirkkokatu a woman was walking her dog about a hundred metres away to the right there was an art gallery on the lefthand side of the street it was closed munro crossed the road and stood in the doorway of the art gallery he could see the church steps but it would be difficult to see him the basic condition for a safe meeting with someone you dont know make sure you can see them before they can see you the woman and her dog disappeared round a corner a boy on a bicycle came along from the left and turned down towards the market square an old lady in a black dress and black shoes came out of the church carrying a heavy shopping bag munro seemed to be looking at the paintings in the window of the art gallery something to take back home perhaps a present from lahti actually he was checking the streets in all directions and looking up at the church steps again where was virolainen minutes passed the old lady turned left along kirkkokatu crossed the road and went into an apartment building a cat crossed the road quickly in the other direction and jumped over the low wall round the church grounds it stopped sat on the grass and started cleaning itself carefully munro looked at his watch although he knew what the time was still no virolainen five more minutes then he would go back to the hotel it would be dangerous to wait any longer he would call london for new orders just then he heard a noise the sound of running feet munro stepped further back into the doorway people ran when they were late but they also ran to get away from danger a man appeared suddenly from the righthand side of the church he stopped at the top of the steps and looked all around him he looked worried as if someone was chasing him but he did not know where they were going to come from next munro stayed where he was if this was pentti virolainen there was a problem something was wrong if someone was chasing virolainen munro shouldnt be here above all this should be a safe meeting the executive from london should not be put in danger munro heard noise at the bottom of mariankatu a car was coming up the hill the noise seemed loud too loud in fact munro looked quickly to his right too late he realised what was happening chapter three waiting for new orders the car was a black mercedes when munro saw that there were two men in the front and two in the back he knew they were not out sightseeing he got right down onto the ground in the doorway making himself as small as possible by the time the car reached the top of the street it was travelling fast the engine very loud as it turned the corner into kirkkokatu the wheels screamed a little on the road and there were four short sounds gun shots the mercedes quickly disappeared down kirkkokatu turning right at the bottom into vesijarvenkatu munro looked up from where he was ready to run across the street luckily the men in the mercedes hadnt seen him across the street virolainen had not been so lucky he was lying on his back on the church steps blood on the front of his shirt munro looked up and down the road there was noone else around yet virolainen was clearly beyond help any information had died with him it was time for munro to leave back at his hotel munro took a whisky from the bar up to his room his work meant that he saw death more often than many people but he never got used to it he drank the whisky slowly and took out his phone munro decided a text message was quicker and safer than a phone conversation anyway he did not have much to say quickly he typed a short message and sent it to naylor meeting off executive well new orders needed while he waited for a reply from london munro looked through etela suomen sanomat one of the south finland newspapers which he had picked up from the hotel bar there was a long piece about developments in finnish bioengineering and an interview with jorma lappalainen a rich businessman who owned a number of bioengineering companies lappalainen was saying that finland should lead the world not just in areas like the internet and mobile phones but also in science and especially bioengineering munro also discovered that jorma lappalainen was making a name for himself as an important politician in fact the country would soon choose a new president a new leader for finland and lappalainen was saying that he was interested the newspaper article ended with some personal information about lappalainen he lived with his sister and had homes in helsinki lahti and the south of france there was also a photo of him speaking to a crowd of people at a meeting in helsinki he was a short man with the very fair almost white blonde hair that finnish people sometimes have he was waving with both hands at the crowd and smiling a political smile thought munro rather than a smile of truth and happiness it seemed no more probable that lappalainen would tell the truth than politicians anywhere else in the world a sound came from munros phone he read the message wait munro smiled to himself naylor was never a man to use more words than necessary anyway he clearly needed time before deciding the next move so how should munro spend the waiting time a few minutes later munro sat down at a table in the bar and ordered another whisky while he waited for his drink he looked out of the window at the people walking past on aleksanterinkatu lahti was getting ready for friday night young men and women going out to bars and discos to enjoy themselves he thought back to the time he had spent in finland three years as a student at the university of jyvaskyla followed by a couple of years travelling up and down the country doing all kinds of different jobs he remembered staying in lahti for a few months and he remembered thinking in those days that lahti seemed to be home to the most beautiful women in finland he smiled to himself munro picked up a menu and realised he was very hungry his last meal had been a long time ago on the plane from heathrow as he looked at the menu he heard a soft voice over his shoulder if you dont understand the menu perhaps i can help you he turned his head looking over his right shoulder were two beautiful dark blue eyes they were set in a face that was also beautiful a small but pretty nose short blonde hair and bright white teeth that were smiling at him at this very minute that would be very kind said munro smiling back riitta koivisto said the young woman holding out her right hand munro took her hand in his and shook it it felt warm ian munro are you english said koivisto taking the menu from munro and sitting down next to him scottish said munro but its an easy mistake to make koivisto put her head on one side are you making fun of me she asked no said munro seriously koivisto smiled again she was wearing a bright blue jumper and a short black skirt she opened her bag took out some cigarettes and offered one to munro no thanks he said and you shouldnt i know she said but i like a lot of things i shouldnt she lit her cigarette and smiled at him again so tell me whats a handsome scottish man like you doing in a place like lahti she asked munro laughed im just on holiday he said enjoying finland and meeting wonderful finnish people of course we are wonderful she said it is because of the wonderful weather we have here and they both laughed so ian she continued what do you do in scotland or england at that moment the waiter arrived with munros drink she explained the menu to him and then ordered some open sandwiches for him and a jaloviina a type of finnish brandy for herself while she was ordering munro sat back in his chair and looked at her she was very beautiful and she spoke excellent english but she asked too many questions who was she and why did she want to know so much chapter four a dangerous woman at midnight munro was standing in the shower in his room at the lahden seurahuone he let the hot water run down his body washing away the troubles of the day there was still no message from naylor virolainens death had stopped one line of information naylor would need time to find another munro turned his thoughts to riitta koivisto she seemed to believe his story that he worked for a bank and was in finland on holiday she said she worked for a company called bioratkaisut she was only an office worker so she didnt really know what the company did it was something biological but she didnt know what she lived in nastola seventeen kilometres outside lahti and at eleventhirty she had left to get a taxi home without knowing why munro did not believe much of what koivisto had told him munro stepped out of the shower drying himself on the large white hotel towel it had been a long day and he felt tired as he looked in the mirror there was a soft knocking at the door looking through the spy hole in the door he saw short blonde hair and a bright white smile he tied his towel round his waist and opened the door riitta koivisto was standing there a glass of whisky in one hand and a glass of jaloviina in the other there were too many people waiting for taxis she said so i came back i thought you might like a bedtime drink she held out the glass of whisky munro took the glass smiled and stepped back letting koivisto walk into the room she passed very close to him as she came in munro shut and locked the door munro drank a little whisky and put his glass on the table next to the television koivisto put her glass next to his then she walked up to him and put her hands on his shoulders she pulled him towards her kissing him full on the lips his arms went round her one hand reaching up his fingers running through her short blonde hair he kissed her back hard as his lips came away from hers he said friday nights always a problem for taxis shh she said quietly putting a finger to his lips dont talk she stepped back a little freeing herself from munro then she reached behind her neck pulled her jumper off and let it drop to the floor she reached forward again behind munros head her hand pulling him down towards her dont say another word she whispered munro woke up suddenly he felt terrible his mouth was dry his eyes hurt he had a headache he looked around the room it was light outside but this was finland the land of the midnight sun even in april the days were long what time was it what had happened why did he feel so bad he got out of bed with difficulty and made his way to the bathroom trying to find his watch on the way he stopped and looked round the bedroom riitta koivisto thats right he remembered having a drink with her in the bar and he remembered her coming to his room at midnight they had made love but then what there were two empty glasses on the table by the bed he picked them up and smelled them they did not smell unusual he found his watch it was already midday he hadnt drunk very much last night so he shouldnt feel as bad as this had she given him some drugs to make him sleep but why would she want him to sleep he opened the wardrobe his clothes were in different places he looked in the drawers she had searched here too his suitcase had moved she had looked in there as well he got into the shower and turned the water on a thirtysecond cold shower woke him up completely he took two aspirin to clear his head drank about a litre of iced water from the minibar and dressed quickly in jeans a light blue denim shirt and a brown leather jacket as he was putting his jacket on his phone made a sound he had a message call on safe line naylor had found a new way into the problem munro was back on the job chapter five being followed mobile phones were useful but munro didnt like them although it was generally considered impossible to listen in to a conversation on a mobile phone munro was not so sure finland was the home of nokia if anyone could listen in to a conversation the finns could munro just used his mobile for short text messages that other people would not be able to understand for a safe line munro would need something different surprisingly public phone boxes were the safest he went out of the hotel onto aleksanterinkatu to find one as he walked along the street he could hear bits of the conversations around him shot on the church steps a terrible thing to happen are we going to be safe on the streets any longer nothing like that has happened before in the daytime too virolainen yes such a kind man my cousin knew him well this is usually such a safe town what is happening in the world today the death of pentti virolainen had shaken the people of lahti it was a small town of only about people like almost all the small towns of finland it was a safe place both adults and children could walk or cycle the streets without danger at almost any hour of the day or night but today people seemed worried afraid even their safe world had broken into pieces munro felt sorry for them he found a phone box naylor answered at the first ring give me the complete picture said naylor munro told him about virolainens death and then went on id like you to check on a woman called riitta koivisto munro spelled the name whos she asked naylor i dont know said munro she says she works for a company called bioratkaisut and lives in nastola id be interested to know how much of that is true she searched my room last night i see said naylor describe her about centimetres tall slim goodlooking short blonde hair blue eyes intelligent but good at giving the appearance of not being very intelligent ill check on her and let you know if i find out anything said naylor thanks ok naylor went on weve had some difficulty finding a way back to virolainens information however i now have an address for you ruolankatu flat b munro repeated the address back to naylor naylor said nothing for a moment as if searching for the right words then he spoke these people are very dangerous munro theyve killed one person already they could kill again be careful with this address it may be our last chance munro put the phone down then immediately picked it up again and called the hotel hotel lahden seurahuone said a voice munro put the phone down after a safe call it was important to make another call immediately if you didnt anyone could ring the last number to find out who you had called munro decided that it would be a good time to have a look at the market place before he went to the address at ruolankatu he needed to be sure he wasnt being followed this was more important now than ever before the market would be a good place to find out if there was anyone behind him munro had not even gone a hundred metres when he saw the first a man in a dark green jacket when munro looked at him the man suddenly found something in a bookshop window of great interest getting away from one person should be quite easy even in a place as small as lahti however there might be more than one person following him within ten minutes munro knew there were more he took his time looking in shop windows reading restaurant menus playing the tourist he did not go straight down to the kauppatori but decided to walk around the streets taking his time enjoying the sunshine twenty minutes later he crossed aleksanterinkatu towards the market it was saturday and the market was busy munro moved around looking at everything changing direction going back the way he had come making it difficult for his followers to know exactly where he was going a couple of times he started to leave the market but then he seemed to see something which made him turn round and go back for another look he now realised the size of his problem first of all he was in a box of eight three men in front at any one time three behind and one on either side secondly his followers were not just on foot at the west side of the kauppatori was a line of taxis munro had walked up to the first taxi found out that the taxi driver spoke english and asked the way to the sibeliustalo the concert hall near lake vesijarvi as he got near the taxi he saw two cars stop suddenly and at least two of the followers hurry towards them he thanked the taxi driver and set off on foot towards the sibeliustalo as he did so one of the followers went over to the taxi and started talking to the driver on another day at another time munro would have enjoyed the walk to sibeliustalo today his mind was so full of all kinds of thoughts and plans that he almost missed the entrance to kariniemi park munro had forgotten what the hard finnish winter did to the countryside the snow had gone now but much of the land was still a light brown colour only in a few places was the bright green of spring starting to show munro was pleased he was here now and not a few months ago when the temperatures were often down to celsius even so the lake was still frozen after the winter munro walked round to the right along the side of the lake towards the sibeliustalo and a couple of cafes the followers came with him some in front some behind munro bought a beer and sat at a table in the sunshine looking north to vaaksy you could go by boat from lahti to vaaksy and then to lake paijanne the longest lake in finland and finally all the way to jyvaskyla he drank his beer and thought about the problem he did not know who was waiting to meet him at ruolankatu but if anyone followed him there it was sure to mean death for both him and anyone he might meet the followers had not killed him yet because they did not know who he was meeting he needed to get away from them quickly he made a plan there was a phone box near the cafe and he needed naylors help he called london chapter six hiding after calling naylor munro walked back towards the centre of town past the bus station the followers were still with him he could also see one of the cars parked further down the street when he arrived at the bottom of aleksanterinkatu he took a side street off to the right and turned immediately left into hameenkatu he was walking slowly as he came to the front door of the hotel lahti but when he reached it he stepped inside quickly and shut the door for the first time in two hours none of the followers could see him he had to act quickly he had visited the hotel lahti about ten years before he was hoping that the inside of the hotel was the same as it was then it was there was no real reception desk the front door led straight into the bar and restaurant in front of munro was a lift to the left some double doors and stairs there were a few drinkers in the bar but no barperson munro turned left and ran up the stairs he needed to disappear to find somewhere to hide he stopped at the first floor and looked left and right there was noone there just closed doors he heard the front door crash open downstairs loud voices shouting he ran up more stairs as he reached the second floor he looked left and saw a man trying to open the door to a room it was only about two oclock in the afternoon but the man had clearly drunk far too much in fact he looked as if he had been up all night he had very short grey hair a grey denim jacket and black jeans he was moving slowly from side to side while trying to put his key in the door dont move the drunk said in finnish to the door voi perkele stop moving while i put the key in you you stupid door munro ran up to him and took the key out of his hand let me help he said he could hear the sound of someone running up the stairs there was no time to lose munro opened the door quickly and pulled the man into the room behind him he closed the door quietly and looked round the room on the right was a door to the bathroom on the left a wardrobe there were two single beds a table with a television on it an armchair and a couple of other chairs beside one of the beds was a small table with a half empty bottle of whisky on it the grey man moved slowly from side to side looking at munro as if he was trying to decide if he knew him or not munro thought quickly he turned the television on and pulled the armchair round in front of it sit down he said watch this ill get you a drink the grey man fell into the chair room service the man said quietly to himself great room service here his head fell forward and his eyes closed munro put his ear to the door to try and hear what was happening outside he heard a knock on one of the other bedroom doors he heard the door open and the question have you seen a man in a brown leather jacket and blue jeans he couldnt hear the answer he heard another knock this time there was no answer then he heard the sound of keys oh no theyd got the keys they were going to search all the rooms he turned and opened the wardrobe inside there were some clothes and a sports bag munro heard the door to the next room open and the voices of the men looking for him hes not in here you try that one and ill try over here well search every room if we have to quickly munro took off his shoes his jacket his shirt and his jeans he put them in the sports bag and closed it he took the whisky bottle and put some whisky on his hands chest and in his hair he ran his fingers through his hair to make it untidy there was a black tshirt lying over the back of one of the chairs munro pulled it on there was a knock at the door anyone in there a voice said the grey man continued sleeping munro lay on the bed wearing only pants and socks and the black tshirt his head was turned away from the door the almost empty whisky bottle close to his face he heard the key in the lock the door opened and a man walked into the room he was short with dark hair he saw the two men the grey man asleep in front of the tv and munro asleep on the bed he went to the first bed and looked under it he stood up and looked at the sleeping man on the bed munro could not see the man but he felt him move closer to try and look at munros face then he heard the man make a noise and move back as the smell of the whisky reached his nose munros heart began to slow down a little but he knew he was not safe yet the darkhaired man pushed open the door to the bathroom and looked inside there was a noise as he pulled back the shower curtain munro heard the wardrobe doors open please dont look in the bag he thought anything in there a voice came from outside the room munro heard the man speak no hes not in here theres just a couple of allnight drinkers sleeping off the whisky then munro heard the wardrobe door close followed by the door to the room munro waited a few minutes then turned on his back and looked at his watch it was almost twothirty it would be some time before the followers left the hotel he lay back on the bed and thought chapter seven breaking out shortly before four oclock munro got up off the bed the grey man was still asleep in front of the television munro thought that he and the man were probably about the same size looking in the wardrobe again he found some old black trousers and a dark blue wool jacket also quite old and dirty in one of the drawers he found a dark blue baseball cap and some sunglasses quickly he changed looking in the mirror he was pleased at the difference there were some trainers on the floor so munro decided to change his shoes too they were a bit small but not too uncomfortable anyway munro thought small trainers would make him walk a little differently that would be useful often we know someone by the way they walk so it was a good idea to change your walk as well as your clothes everything about his appearance was now very different as a final touch munro drank some whisky and put some more whisky over his clothes anyone who met him now would think he was in the middle of a weekend he would never remember as he moved things from the pockets of his old clothes to his new clothes munro turned his phone on and checked for messages there was just one from london it read vej before he left the room munro looked out of the window down into the car park at the back of the hotel on the far side was a blue car with a man in the drivers seat he was smoking a cigarette and reading a newspaper on the wheel in front of him from time to time he looked up at the back door of the hotel it was still going to be difficult to get away from the hotel but at least now they did not know what he looked like as munro went quietly down the stairs he decided to try getting away through the back door he was almost sure there would be someone watching both the back and the front but if there were going to be any problems the car park at the back was not so public the london office did not like their executives making trouble in public places munro got to the bottom of the stairs pushed open the back door of the hotel and half fell into the car park he wanted anyone watching to think that he had just come from the bar after a few too many drinks he walked a little way across the car park towards hameenkatu and then he suddenly turned round moving like a man half asleep and started walking in the opposite direction as he did so he saw the man in the car open the door and start to get out he was wearing a red tshirt with the name harri on it perhaps its his name thought munro munro looked at him and realised that harris orders must be to speak to everyone leaving the hotel munro moved closer to the wall of the hotel so that it would more difficult for other people to see them as harri came across to munro he spoke to him in finnish are you having a good party my friend he asked not bad said munro in finnish his voice thick like a man who has had too much to drink i dont drink here much myself said harri i prefer more expensive places got a cigarette asked munro he wanted harri close to him and he wanted to be sure he didnt know who munro was harri put his hand into his jacket pocket but suddenly stopped and looked closely at munro munro couldnt take a chance he took one step forward and brought his knee up hard between harri s legs harris head came forward and munro hit him as hard as he could in the face this time his head went back and he crashed to the ground as he did so however munro saw a dangerouslooking knife in harris hand munro knew from harris face that he had hurt him and that this fight was now very serious harri got to his feet his face red with anger holding the knife in front of him he moved towards munro youll be sorry for that he said in english munro moved back until he could feel the wall behind him harri smiled you cant go back any further my english friend now i have you and as he said this he ran forward munro took a step to his right the knife hit the wall and flew out of harris hand his hand crashed into the wall and he half fell turning towards munro munro closed his hand into a fist and threw it hard crashing it up into the bottom of harris nose there was a horrible sound as the bone in his nose broke harris eyes closed his body dropped to the ground munro looked down at him i should have told you he said im scottish not english munros hand hurt and he was shaking after the fight he checked the car park quickly but noone else was around he moved the body under one of the cars near the back of the car park and then ran towards hameenkatu now he had to take care of the men at the front of the hotel chapter eight pentti virolainens sister munro ran out onto hameenkatu he looked to the right and as he expected there were a couple of men standing and smoking cigarettes outside the front door of the hotel quickly munro looked to the left twenty metres away on the other side of the street facing away from the hotel was a grey car number vej munro turned back to the right the men had thrown away their cigarettes and were coming towards him quick shouted munro in finnish call the police theres a serious fight back there the two men started running towards him munro didnt move the men ran past munro without looking at him and turned the corner into the car park it would take them a few seconds to find their friend munro did not wait he ran to the grey car and opened the door he felt under the seat the keys were there two minutes later he was driving along the road to helsinki checking that he really had lost all his followers when he was sure he pulled in to the side of the road and sent a short message to london thanks for the car ruolankatu was a housing development to the southwest of the city centre built in the late sixties there were a number of tall buildings with two or three flats on each floor set in some pretty woodland number was almost at the end of the road and there was a small supermarket on the ground floor munro parked behind the flats and made his way round to the front he pressed the button by the front door and a voice came out of the speaker next to it yes who is it said a womans voice in finnish ian munro from london come up said the voice munro pushed the front door open and climbed the stairs the door to flat b was not open so he knocked quietly on it for a moment he realised that someone was looking at him through the spy hole and then the door opened and munro heard a voice from inside the flat come in the flat was very small munro walked through a short narrow hall into a small sitting room there was a sofa an armchair and shelves along one wall with books cds and a cd player on them there was a door from the sitting room leading into an even smaller kitchen in fact the kitchen was more like a cupboard munro turned to look at the woman who had let him in she was in her midthirties with shoulderlength red hair bluegreen eyes and a strong serious face she wore a shirt that was the same colour as her eyes white trousers and flat blue and white shoes she looked tired and worried im sorry i didnt come earlier munro explained and im sorry about the smell too i had a little trouble getting here thats ok im just pleased youre here the woman said in english we can speak finnish if you prefer said munro in finnish to show that he had no difficulty with the language thank you that would be easier she said smiling weakly would you like some coffee or something to eat munro realised that he had eaten nothing since he had woken from a drugged sleep at the hands of riitta koivisto that morning it seemed like days ago he suddenly felt extremely hungry yes id love something to eat he said while the woman was in the kitchen munro looked round the room there were books in english and finnish the cds were mainly pop music there were also family photos the woman with her parents a couple of pictures of the parents on their own and one of a man about the same age as her perhaps a little older munro looked more closely at the photo of the man it was pentti virolainen the woman looked a little bit like him they must be brother and sister the woman came back into the sitting room with a plate of sandwiches and two cups of coffee she gave the plate and one of the cups to munro and then sat down opposite him with the other cup munro spoke pentti was he your brother yes said the woman how do you know the pictures munro looked over at the photographs the woman put her hands together on her knees and looked straight at munro yes im sirpa virolainen penttis sister just before he went to meet you he told me everything he knew i think he realised that something might happen to him i think he realised that they knew about him munro reached out and put his hand softly on hers im sorry about pentti he said and took his hand away thank you she replied please continued munro tell me what he told you chapter nine answers for munro sirpa virolainen looked past munro through the window behind him getting her thoughts together you have to understand something about pentti you know she began he was bright i mean he didnt have a great job he didnt go to university or anything like that but he was intelligent he did well at school but he just didnt want to go on studying for the rest of his life munro sat quietly watching her saying nothing anyway she continued he left school at and got a job with a company called bioratkaisut which had just started bioratkaisut munro couldnt stop himself speaking yes do you know it asked virolainen i met someone last night who said she worked there what was her name asked virolainen munro told her but virolainen shook her head i havent heard of her she said but that doesnt mean she doesnt work there pentti and i werent very close i mean we lived in the same town but we didnt see each other very often and we never talked about his work really except for the other night ok said munro anyway you were saying yes he had a job at bioratkaisut he was a laboratory assistant he helped the scientists with their work usually he just organised their equipment but sometimes he actually helped them with their work she stopped for a moment and drank some of her coffee this woman you met did she tell you what bioratkaisut does asked virolainen suddenly not really replied munro something biological yes thats right said virolainen the company is well known in finland for its soap and things like that it also produces a famous cream for keeping mosquitoes away munro smiled the mosquitoes could be terrible in the north well pentti began to realise that there was other scientific work going on at bioratkaisut which was how can i say not in the public interest i see said munro what sort of work and how did he find out about it when he was helping in the laboratory he could usually understand what the scientists were doing and why but he realised there were some special areas of work that he was never allowed to help with at first he thought it was just chance then one day one of the scientists left some papers in the laboratory by mistake and pentti had a look at them virolainen was speaking more quickly now and her eyes were bright it was work to develop a special kind of poison gas munro put his coffee on the table go on he said virolainen went on well pentti then kept his eyes and ears open he thought there were probably only two or three scientists in the company doing this kind of work they were certainly developing different types of poison gas but he thought they were working on other poisons as well and nobody else knew about it said munro no nobody said virolainen and pentti didnt know who to tell he didnt think the police would do anything it would be his word against the word of scientists working for one of the most famous companies in finland then a couple of months ago in lahti there was a big meeting of biologists from all over the world by chance pentti met a british biologist in a bar one evening and well he didnt tell him everything but he must have told him enough last week someone from london phoned him and asked him to meet you virolainen stood up and went into the kitchen she opened a cupboard and took out a box of breakfast cereal she opened the box put her hand inside and took out a piece of paper she put the box back shut the cupboard door and turned to munro he also gave me this she said passing munro the piece of paper munro opened the paper and looked at it munro was not a scientist so he had no idea what the writing on the paper meant however it was clearly scientific and probably biological you said that pentti thought something might happen to him said munro yes he thought someone was following him munro knew the feeling he looked at the piece of paper again id like to keep this he said and take it back to london ok said sirpa munro put the paper carefully in an inside pocket of his blue jacket there is a phone box up the street he said im just going out to make a call and then well decide what to do about you you cant stay here munro saw that virolainen looked less worried than when he had arrived some colour had come back into her cheeks for the first time munro realised how pretty sirpa virolainen was munro got through to naylor quickly and explained what virolainen had told him ive got the paper that pentti virolainen left with his sister he said good work said naylor i want you to fax a copy to me here as soon as possible ok said munro but i need to get virolainens sister somewhere safe first right said naylor ill take her to helsinki itll take about ninety minutes said munro ok said naylor make sure shes safe fax me the paper and then call ive got a lot of information for you and ill have new orders the line went dead one of the things munro liked about working for naylor was that he never asked unnecessary questions if munro said that virolainen was not safe naylor believed him if munro felt helsinki was the best place to take her that was fine with naylor naylor had information to give munro but he would wait until munro was clear back in the flat munro explained to sirpa virolainen that someone might have followed her brother to her flat it was not a safe place any more he was going to take her to helsinki because it was easier to hide in the capital ten minutes later they were driving south on the road to helsinki five minutes after that munro looked in the mirror two large jeeps were driving up fast behind him and he knew that he was in trouble again chapter ten car chase munros car was probably the only car that naylor had been able to organise in such a short time it was not the car that munro would have chosen it was not very strong or heavy nor was it very fast the jeeps on the other hand were strong and fast as soon as he saw them munro put his foot to the floor and the car went faster virolainen immediately turned towards him whats the matter she asked look behind us said munro munro was driving at over kilometres an hour but the jeeps were getting closer all the time he thought quickly there was no way he could escape by going faster than the jeeps the motorway was almost empty and they were not near any towns where he might be able to get away in some heavy traffic he looked in the mirror they were still about thirty metres away munro looked ahead as far as he could he had to get off the main road the only advantage he might have was on smaller roads that were not so straight he saw a side road coming up on the righthand side he let the jeeps come up close behind him then at the last moment he pulled the wheel round to the right and turned into the side road the first of the jeeps was taken completely by surprise it continued straight on past the turning the driver of the second jeep was more awake he must have seen the turning and realised that munro might take it he pulled hard on the wheel of the jeep taking it up dangerously on two wheels as it went round the corner munro checked the mirror only one jeep was left but the driver knew what he was doing munro was taking the corners as fast as he could but the jeep was getting closer again there were trees along both sides of the road no turnings at all suddenly they were on a straight piece of road again and the jeep was right behind him munro could see the face of the driver in the mirror then the jeep hit the back of their car munro and virolainen shot forwards in their seats the car was thrown across the road and almost off the other side virolainen screamed hold on shouted munro he could see a forest road further ahead on the left if he could turn onto that they might have time to stop the car and make a run for it through the trees they would never get away in the car but on foot they might have a chance the forest road was still fifty metres away and the jeep getting bigger in the mirror come on come on shouted munro to himself then to virolainen when i stop the car get out and run ill follow you the forest road came nearer but so did the jeep there was another loud crash as the front of the jeep hit the car hard on the lefthand corner at the back munro pulled hard at the wheel to try and keep straight but it was no good time seemed suddenly to go slow the car was moving across the road on its side now on its top now on its other side munro heard virolainen scream once more as the car turned over again on its way off the road and into the trees the thought entered his mind that he must take off his seat belt as soon as the car stopped turning over but then there was a terrible noise as the car hit the first of the trees and a loud crash as the car stopped munro felt his head hit the side of the car darkness came down behind his eyes chapter eleven in the sauna munro woke up with a terrible headache he was lying on a wooden seat in a small wooden room he was in a sauna his hands were tied behind his back he turned his head lying on the opposite seat also with her hands tied was sirpa virolainen her eyes were closed her red hair lying across her face munro called her name she moved and opened her eyes only a little at first but then wide as she remembered what had happened where are we she asked munro i dont know he answered he moved about and managed to sit up just then the door opened a short man with white blonde hair came into the room holding a gun in his right hand munro realised that he knew who the man was mr munro ms virolainen said the man looking at each of them in turn mr lappalainen said munro it was the businessman and politician that munro had read about at the hotel suddenly a number of things became clear as pieces of the picture fell into place lappalainen was interested in bioengineering perhaps that interest included poisons too also it might explain why naylor had not told munro the complete story lappalainen was an important person in finland it was difficult to know how many people might take orders from him it would be easy to talk to the wrong person someone who was a friend or employee of lappalainen ah said lappalainen i see you know who i am yes i do said munro its difficult not to know one of the most important men in finland but i dont know why youve locked us in here well mr munro it seems that you and ms virolainens brother have been putting your nose into areas of my business which are nothing to do with you areas of your business asked munro yes my business replied lappalainen bioratkaisut is one of my companies i own it bioratkaisut that name again more parts of the picture became clear in munros mind lappalainen continued the company does well it makes a lot of money not just for me but for finland and the poisons asked munro ah yes the poisons said lappalainen of course developing poisons is not really allowed but a foreign country no mr munro im not going to tell you which country have offered me a lot of money to organise this work we have developed an extremely strong and cheap poison they wanted a gas if possible strong powerful and with almost no smell at all we have the technology they have the money i have to say im not quite sure why they want this poison to start a war maybe to kill groups of people who do not like their leader i dont know to tell you the truth i dont really care and anyway they offered me so much money that i felt i couldnt really refuse and of course i will be able to use the money to become president of my own country and the scientists oh they get well paid explained lappalainen but they dont really care about the money you know what scientists are like they dont care about rules or the law either theyre just interested in science but of course when people find out what has been happening your chances of becoming president will disappear forever said munro lappalainen did not look worried well i dont know who is going to tell them mr munro but it certainly wont be you lappalainen took a piece of paper out of his pocket it was the piece of paper that sirpa had given him earlier ive got this now lappalainen went on and as you have probably realised you are in a sauna in finland we like our saunas very hot you know not like in sweden usually we have them between and celsius but today i am going to give you a special sauna a rather hot one and lappalainen stopped speaking and looked from one to the other with a smile on his face the terrible thing is that you will find the door impossible to open lappalainen threw back his head and laughed again virolainens mouth opened wide as she realised what lappalainen was saying although it was hot in the sauna an icy feeling moved up munros back so finished lappalainen it is beginning to get nice and warm in here goodbye mr munro ms virolainen i dont think you will be telling anyone about my business anymore he turned and left the room there was a little window in the door munro could see lappalainen through the window checking that the door would not open as soon as he had disappeared munro spoke quick get over here with your back to me lets try and get our hands untied virolainen sat up and moved across to where munro was sitting but it was difficult to reach each others hands the temperature was beginning to rise and munro could feel the sweat on his face lets stand up said virolainen it might be easier they stood up back to back munro felt his fingers touch virolainens hands he started to try and untie her but she was tied very tightly he worked hard but it was no use sweat was now running down his face and he could feel it running down his body inside his shirt stop said virolainen let me try to untie yours munro stopped he felt virolainens fingers working behind him the temperature continued to rise lappalainen had only left ten minutes ago and already munro felt as if he was burning alive his shirt was dark with sweat he could hear virolainen crying as she pulled and pulled with her fingers i think its coming she said i think ive got it munro felt her pull once more and then suddenly his hands were free he quickly turned round to untie virolainens hands her face was red her hair was wet with sweat munros hands were shaking but now that he could see what he was doing he untied her hands in only a few seconds he turned and threw himself against the door but it didnt move at all quickly he started to break off a piece of wood from one of the seats in the sauna help me he said virolainen took hold of the piece of wood too and together they pulled at it suddenly there was a crash and it came off in munros hand he turned to the door and using the piece of wood he hit the small window again and again trying to break the glass virolainen sat back against the wall unable to do anything come on break shouted munro at the glass on about the tenth hit the glass started to break munro hit it harder and harder and finally it broke welcome cold air filled the sauna quickly munro knocked out the broken pieces of glass and put his hand through the window reaching the other side of the door saunas dont usually have locks they dont usually need them but lappalainen had put a large and heavy piece of wood against the door to stop it opening munro could just reach the wood but he could not move it he tried moving it to the left and then to the right it still did not move the sauna started to get warm again as munros arm was stopping cold air from coming in through the window munro moved his hand as far as he could to the left and then hit the wood as hard as possible he felt it move he hit it again and again and again munro could feel blood running down his hand finally there was a crash the wood fell to the floor and the door shot open they were free munro carefully put his head outside looking both ways and expecting trouble it was sunday the factory was empty lets go said munro and taking virolainens hand he started running towards some stairs down whispered munro and they ran down the stairs trying to be as quiet as possible at the bottom of the stairs they looked round there were some large double doors to the right that looks like the way out said virolainen they ran towards the doors munro heard a shot and saw virolainen fall at the same time he stopped running and turned back to see how badly she was hit quickly he pulled her behind some boxes looking to see where the shot had come from he couldnt see lappalainen anywhere but he heard his voice i dont know how you are still alive mr munro but you wont be for long chapter twelve fighting for life munro thought from the sound of lappalainens voice that he was on the floor above virolainen had been hit in the leg the shot had gone straight through munro took out his handkerchief and tied it round her leg then he pulled her further behind the boxes stay here he said quietly to her he cant see you from where he is im going to look for him munro moved around the boxes keeping his head down and trying to get to the bottom of the stairs lappalainen knew that munro did not have a gun he would be feeling good about that but lappalainen was a businessman and a politician he was probably not a gunman himself guns are dangerous and munro knew a lot of different ways of taking guns away from people munro reached the bottom of the stairs and looked up lappalainen was not there looking along the factory floor munro saw there were other stairs going up in different parts of the factory lappalainen might have come down one of these he might already be on the ground floor looking for munro with his gun munro moved round carefully and quietly suddenly he heard a sound behind him he turned round quickly lappalainen was standing there a gun in his hand he smiled you have begun to make me rather angry he said now you can show me where you have put ms virolainen and then i can send you both on your way he waved his gun in the direction of the front of the factory munro turned his back on lappalainen and started walking he walked slowly and he could hear lappalainen following behind him he wanted lappalainen to push the gun into his back so that he would know where it was he walked even more slowly lappalainen came right up behind him and munro felt the hard metal press against him immediately munros hand flew up behind his back knocking the gun upwards as soon as he hit the gun munro started to turn reaching up with both hands lappalainen fired a shot but it went into the air away from munro the two men fought munro was using both hands to hold the gun and to try and pull it away lappalainen was holding on with one hand and using the other to reach for munros face and eyes munro realised he was going to have to let go he was in danger of lappalainen seriously hurting his eyes suddenly munro let go of the gun put a hand on each of lappalainens shoulders and crashed his head onto lappalainens nose the finn screamed and the gun fell to the floor his face was now red and blood was coming from his nose munro watched him carefully being angry would make lappalainen stronger but it would also make him careless suddenly he ran at munro screaming like an animal and throwing his fists at him munro stepped easily to one side and hit him on the side of the head as lappalainen went down on the floor munro picked up the gun and turned towards him lappalainen was sitting where he had fallen with his back against one of the boxes in one hand was a metal bottle with the other hand he was taking the top off the bottle munro stood and watched him well it all seems to be over he said looking up at munro i dont really like the thought of spending time in prison you know and i dont like the thought of not being president either so its really quite useful that my company has been so good at making poisons no shouted munro but he could do nothing lappalainen held up the metal bottle towards munro and then drank what was inside munro watched as lappalainens face changed colour the finn reached up to his throat and a strange noise came out of his mouth then his body shook once and he stopped moving chapter thirteen an unwelcome phone call munro and virolainen spent the next day helping the police at the salininkatu police station munro had called naylor in london and told him what had happened naylor had told him not to keep any information back from the police with lappalainen now dead people would be more interested in telling the truth teams of police searched the bioratkaisut factory and all the scientists were brought in for questioning radio and television services carried the news of lappalainens death saying only that he had had a heart problem being a full time politician and running a busy company at the same time had been too much work for him the truth was not necessary and bioratkaisut would have enough problems when the public found out that it had produced poison gas for a foreign country munro told the police about riitta koivisto and another piece of the picture fell into place riitta koivisto was jorma lappalainens sister koivisto was her married name although she was no longer married to her husband munro remembered from the newspaper that she lived with her brother since she had searched his room at the hotel it seemed probable that she was involved in her brothers plans too lappalainens homes in finland and france were immediately searched but koivisto had disappeared the following day munro took virolainen back to her ruolankatu flat the hospital had looked at her leg and allowed her to go home but she was not walking very well as she put the key in the door of her flat and opened it she turned to munro come in ian she said smiling at him as soon as they were inside the flat she turned to face munro pulling him towards her she reached up and kissed him hard on the lips as she stepped back munro saw that her leg was clearly hurting her he reached out and putting one arm under her knees and the other round her shoulders he carried her into the small bedroom and put her down carefully on her feet by the bed munro again realised how beautiful this woman was she pulled him towards her again kissing him full on the mouth her body moved towards his pressing close against him she moved back a little and looked at him running her fingers through his hair they kissed again more impatiently and virolainen reached to undo the buttons of munros shirt love me ian she said quietly looking straight into his eyes make love to me back at his hotel the next morning munro packed his bag and went down to the reception desk to check out he had promised to go to ruolankatu to say goodbye to sirpa virolainen before catching the coach to vantaa airport he paid his bill picked up his bag and was turning to leave when he heard a voice mr munro it was one of the receptionists yes said munro theres a phone call for you you can take it on the phone over there the man showed munro the phone at the end of the reception desk munro picked up the phone hello ian munro said the voice at the other end there is someone here who would like to speak to you another voice came on the line ian is that you it was sirpa virolainen the first voice came back i hope you know whose voice that was yes said munro thoughts were flying through his mind he knew whose the first voice was too it was riitta koivisto where was she what was she doing koivisto spoke again good well ms virolainen and i are at the top of the ski jump in the salpausselka area of town you can see a long way from the top here its also a long way down in fact if you dont get here very quickly ms virolainen is going to find out just how far down it is what do you want said munro i want you ian munro said koivisto i want you up here now dont call the police dont come with a gun get in the lift and come up to the top now the line went dead munro looked at the phone and put it down slowly the colour had left his cheeks his face was white are you all right mr munro asked the receptionist is there anything i can do munro looked at him it took a few moments for munro to realise what the receptionist had said then he spoke yes he said passing his bag to the man could you look after this for a few hours ive just discovered theres something i have to do before i leave lahti chapter fourteen at the ski jump munro took a taxi to the bottom of the ski jump there were three ski jumps next to each other at salpausselka the tallest was sometimes used for the world championships and had a lift that went up to the top at the bottom there was a small shop which sold tshirts and tickets to the top munro paid and went to wait for the lift it was a tuesday afternoon in the middle of april nobody was around on the way up munro tried to organise his thoughts he didnt know what to expect when he arrived at the top he had to follow riittas instructions but it was clearly going to be difficult and dangerous the lift stopped and the doors opened the room was empty except for koivisto standing opposite the door a gun in her hand she was wearing jeans and a white sweater she seemed tired but there was an angry look in her eye get out she said waving the gun at munro munro moved forward and the lift doors closed behind him there were stairs on the right going up and there was blood on the stairs on your knees munro said koivisto and you can stop worrying about the girl shes dead already munro got down onto his left knee his heart turned cold he was too late to help sirpa so you were in this with your brother he said he immediately realised he needed to keep her talking he needed a chance to take her gun he was everything to me my brother said koivisto when my husband left me jorma looked after me he made sure i was ok he made sure my husband paid a lot of money for leaving me then jorma asked me to work for him i helped him run some of his companies including bioratkaisut she was about two metres away in front of munro too far for him to reach the gun safely she would shoot him before he got to it so you knew what was happening at bioratkaisut said munro of course i knew said koivisto angrily he was making lots of money so that he could become president he really wanted to be the president of finland he knew what this country needed he had great plans he would have been a great president but not now hes dead my wonderful brother is dead and its your fault down on one knee it was impossible for munro to move forward without koivisto realising she did not take her eyes off him for one moment so how did you know who i was so soon after i arrived in lahti asked munro he needed more time time to think of something time to think of a way of getting to the gun or a way of getting koivisto nearer to him lahti is a small place she said we knew virolainen had spoken to a british biologist and we thought the british might send someone to try and find out what was happening so when a british tourist arrived and he didnt have a camera with him to take holiday photos we thought it would be a good idea to keep an eye on him just two metres away two seconds was all he needed two seconds when she wasnt looking at him so why kill virolainens sister munro looked to the right at the blood on the stairs out of the corner of his eye he could see that that koivisto was still watching him she did not look at the stairs or the blood she tried to stop us too just like her brother just like you she gave you information about the poisons we were developing she helped you and you killed my brother the gun moved a little in koivistos hand she was getting ready to kill him so what now asked munro there was little left to talk about now if he was going to do something he would have to act quickly what now repeated koivisto smiling unpleasantly now im going to at that moment a sound came from the room at the top of the stairs a halfscreaming halfcrying sound the sound of someone hurt extremely badly sirpa this time koivistos head did move she looked towards the stairs in surprise it was the chance munro was waiting for he threw himself forward pushing off hard with his right foot his hands reaching for the gun his left hand went over the top of the gun pushing koivisto backwards his right hand went under the gun pushing it up in the air there was a loud noise as the gun went off koivisto fell back against the wall the gun flew out of her hand and across the floor into the corner of the room she did not run after it but instead turned towards munro if munro thought the fight was over he was wrong koivisto looked as if she knew how to look after herself and she was angry she moved right keeping her hands in front of her munro moved with her keeping a couple of metres away and watching her carefully suddenly koivisto took a step forward with her left leg her right leg came round in a wide circle towards munros head he stepped back and koivistos foot went past the end of his nose taekwondo she really was dangerous but munro knew one or two taekwondo moves too he stepped a little closer to her she moved back he moved a little closer again not speaking watching her eyes in her eyes he saw only a fight for life or death there was no talking now he took a step closer again and this time she came at him as he knew she would have to her hands moved fast towards him her left hand trying to reach his shirt her right hand going for his eyes munro was ready he quickly moved to his right turning as he did so as koivisto reached out she fell forward munros right hand shot out hitting her on the neck just below the ear there was a sound like a tennis ball hitting a wall and koivisto fell her neck broken munro quickly picked up riittas gun from the corner of the room and ran up the stairs the room at the top had large glass walls on three sides you could see a long way but munro did not look out sirpa virolainen was lying on her side on the floor munro put his fingers to the side of her neck she was still alive he took his mobile phone out of his pocket and rang for the emergency services quickly i need a doctor at salpausselka the top of the skijump theres been a shooting he put his phone down on the ground next to virolainen there was blood on the front of her blouse high on the left side of her chest carefully he undid the blouse and moved it away there was a small hole where the bullet had gone in there was one the other side too where the bullet had come out that was good there was some blood from when she had been shot but there was no blood coming out now that was good too she made a noise her eyes moved and opened its ok sirpa said munro gently taking her hand youre going to be ok yes said sirpa youre here now dont talk said munro smiling at her youre going to be fine the doctor will be here very soon he looked over the glass wall over to the right was lake vesijarvi shining in the sunlight you really could see a long way probably halfway to vaaksy he thought spring in finland winter finished the sun out and sirpa was alive and was going to live for the shortest of moments his job done munro felt everything was right with the world the end
