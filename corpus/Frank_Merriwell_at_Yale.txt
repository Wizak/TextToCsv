old yale drink it down heres to good old yale drink it down heres to good old yale shes so hearty and so hale drink it down drink it down down down from the open window of his rooms on york street frank merriwell heard the distant chorus of a rollicking band of students who had been having a merry evening in town frank had passed his examinations successfully and had been admitted as a student at yale in order to accomplish this without taking a preparatory course at phillips academy he had found it necessary to vigorously brush up the knowledge he had acquired at the fardale military academy which was a college preparatory school professor scotch franks guardian had been of great assistance to him for the professor knew just about what would be required at the entrance examination and he had kept the boy digging away away at the propositions in the first book of euclid had drilled him in caesar caused him to spend weary hours over virgil and the iliad and made him not a little weary of his xenophon as he passed without a condition although he had been told again and again that a course at phillips academy was almost an absolute necessity frank was decidedly grateful to the professor professor scotchs anxiety had brought him to new haven where he remained till the agony was over as frank expressed it the little man bubbled over with delight when he found his protйgй had gone through without a struggle having secured the rooms on york street the professor saw frank comfortably settled and then before taking his departure he attempted to give the boy some wholesome advice dont try to put on many frills here the first year he said you will find that freshmen do not cut much of a figure here it doesnt make any difference what you have done or what you have been elsewhere you will have to establish a record by what you do and what you become here youll find these fellows here wont care a rap if you have discovered the north pole or circumnavigated the globe in er ah ten days it will be all the better for you if you do not let them know you are rich in your own name and have traveled in south america africa europe and other countries theyd think you were bragging or lying if you mentioned it and you know well enough that i am not given to boasting about myself professor and so you are wasting your breath said frank rather resentfully hum ha dont fly off the handle keep cool i know you have sand and youre made of the right kind of stuff but you are the greatest hand to get into scrapes i ever saw and a little advice wont do you any harm you will find that in many things you cannot do just as you would like so you must ill get into the game all right so dont worry you will remember that i did fairly well at fardale and you should not worry about me while i am here i will not you did well at fardale thats right you were the most popular boy in the academy but you will find yale is far different from fardale so the professor took his departure and frank was left to begin life at college his roommate was a rollicking headstrong thoughtless young fellow from ohio harry rattleton was his name and it seemed to fit him perfectly he had a way of speaking rapidly and heedlessly and turning his expressions end for end frank had been able to assist harry at examination harry and frank were seated close to each other and when it was all over and the two boys knew they had passed all right harry came to frank held out his hand and said i believe your name is merriwell mine is rattleton and i am from ohio merriwell you are a brick and i am much obliged to you lets room together what do you say i am agreeable smiled frank that was the way frank found his roommate harry was interested in sports and athletics and he confided to frank that he was bound to make a try for both the baseball and football teams he had brought a set of boxing gloves foils and a number of sporting pictures the foils were crossed above the mantel and the pictures were hung about the walls but he insisted on putting on the gloves with frank before hanging them up where they would be ornamental ive taken twenty lessons old man he said and i want to point you a few shows i mean show you a few points well practice every day and ill bet in less than ten weeks ill have you so youll be able to hold your own with any fellow of your age and weight ever had the gloves on a few times answered frank with a quiet smile thats all the better i wont have to show you how to start in here here that hand goes on the other glove i mean that glove goes on the other hand thats the way now were off left forward foot er left foot forward hold your guard this way now hit me if you can almost like a flash of lightning franks glove shot out and he caused the glove to snap on harrys nose whee jiz i mean jee whiz gasped the astonished boy from ohio youre quick but it was an accident you cant do it again he had scarcely uttered the words before frank feinted and then shot in a sharp one under harrys uplifted guard great scott you do know some tricks ill bet you think you can box well ill have to drive that head out of your notion i mean that notion out of your head look out for me now im coming then harry rattleton sailed into frank and met with the greatest surprise of his life for he found he could not touch merriwell and he was beaten and hammered and battered about the room till he finally felt himself slugged under the ear and sent flying over a chair to land in a heap in one corner of the room he sat up and held his gloved hand to his ear which was ringing with a hundred clanging bells while he stared astounded at his roommate wow he gurgled what have i been up against are you a prize fighter in disguise that experience was enough to satisfy him that frank merriwell knew a great deal more than he did about boxing as frank sat by his window listening to the singing on the evening that this story opens he was wondering where harry could be for his roommate had been away since shortly after supper frank knew the merry singers were sophomores the malicious and unrelenting foes of all freshmen he would have given not a little had he been able to join them in their songs but he knew that was not to be thought of for a moment as he continued to listen a clear tenor voice struck into that most beautiful of college songs when heard from a distance when the matin bell is ringing uralio uralio from my rushy pallet springing uralio uralio fresh as the morning light forth i sally with my sickle bright thro the valley to my dear one gayly singing uralio uralio then seven or eight strong musical young voices came in on the warbling chorus and the boy at the window listened enchanted and enraptured feeling the subtle charm of it all and blessing fortune that he was a youth and a student at yale the charm of the new life he had entered upon was strong and it was weaving its spell about him the spell which makes old yale so dear to all who are fortunate enough to claim her as their alma mater he continued to listen eagerly drinking in the rest of the song as it came through the clear evening air when the day is closing oer us uralio uralio and the landscape fades before us uralio uralio when our merry men quit their mowing and along the glen horns are blowing sweetly then well raise the chorus uralio uralio the warbling song died out in the distance there was a rush of feet outside the door and harry breathless and excited came bursting into the room i say old man he cried what do i think really i dont know laughed frank what do you think i i mean whwhat do you think spluttered harry why i think a great many things whats up anyway you know diamond the fellow they call jack yes i should say so it was his bull pup that chewed a piece out of the leg of my trousers i kicked the dog downstairs and diamond came near having a fit over it hes got a peppery temper and he was ready to murder me i reckon he thought i should have taken off my trousers and given them to the dog to chew hes a southerner from virginia hes a dangerous chap frank just as lief eat as fight i mean fight as eat hes been in town tonight drinking beer with the boys and hes in a mighty ugly mood he says you insulted him is that so its just so and hes going to dallenge you to a chewel i mean challenge you to a duel frank whistled softly elevating his brows a bit what sort of a duel he asked why a regular duel with deadly weapons hes awfully in earnest frank and he means to kill you if you dont apologize all the fellows are backing him they think you will not fight is that so looking for me to show the white feather are they well i like that but you cant fight him i tell you hes a fire eater ive heard that his father killed a man in a duel and that makes the son dangerous no harry i cant afford to whats all that racket the sound of voices and of many feet ascending the stairs could be heard harry turned pale theyre coming frank he exclaimed its the whole gang and diamond is with them he means to force you to fight or squeal chapter ii challenged and hazed the voices were hushed the feet halted in the hall and then there was a sharp knock on the door before harry could reach the door frank called out come in open flew the door and there stood the tall straight darkeyed southerner with half a dozen other fellows behind him mr merriwell said diamond stiffly i have called to see you on a very important matter sir walk right in invited frank rising to receive them bring your friends in state your business mr diamond the party came trooping in and frank was not a little astonished to observe among them bruce browning a big strong lazy sophomore a fellow who was known to be a great hand to plan deviltry which was usually carried into execution by his friends as for browning he was not given to exerting himself when he could avoid it that a soph should associate with a party of freshmen seemed but a little short of marvelous and frank instantly scented a job believing he had been singled out for the party to jolly his blood was up in a moment and he resolved to show them that he was not easy jack diamond drew himself up his eyes fastened threateningly on frank and said sir you had the impudence to kick my dog and when i remonstrated with you you insulted me i demand an apology before these gentlemen frank held himself in check he appeared as cool as an iceberg sir he said your confounded dog spoiled a pair of tendollar trousers for me and i demand another pair or satisfaction harry rattleton caught his breath was merriwell crazy he started forward as if to intervene but diamond his eyes blazing motioned him back very well sir said the southerner addressing frank you shall have all the satisfaction you desire mr ditson will represent me roland ditson pressed forward he was a loudvoiced youth who wore loud clothes and sported a large amount of jewelry name your second merriwell he said in an authoritative way we want to settle this matter as soon as possible frank named harry and the seconds conferred together merriwell sat down and coolly awaited the result with his hands in his pockets diamond drew aside his friends gathering about him bruce browning interested himself in what was passing between rattleton and ditson and it was plain that he was urging them to do something after a few minutes harry approached frank a troubled look on his face its an outrage he indignantly exclaimed ditson insists that it be a degular ruel i mean a regular duel with rapiers he says you gave the challenge and so diamond has the right to name the weapons such a thing cant take place oh yes it can said frank coolly accept the proposition and have the affair come off as soon as possible but frank think of it ill bet diamond is an expert swordsman and hes just the kind of a chap to lose his head and run you through the body why it would be dimply serrible i mean simply terrible ill have to fight him or take water now harry old man you dont want me to show the white feather so go back and complete the arrangements but there ought to be some other way of settling it if you could fight him with your fists i know youd beat him but you dont stand a show this way frank looked his roommate squarely in the eye go back and accept every proposition ditson makes he commanded and rattleton felt the influence of merriwells superior will back he went and it did not take the seconds long with bruce brownings aid to settle matters browning said he knew a nice quiet place where the duel could take place without danger of interruption and in a short time the entire party was on the street following the lead of the big sophomore harry was at franks side and he was greatly agitated if you are counting on diamond backing down youll be dadly i mean sadly disappointed he whispered that fellow doesnt know what it is to be afraid and hell stand up to the end keep cool directed frank hell find there are others harry gave up in despair this is a terrible affair he muttered to himself its likely to mean arrest disgrace imprisonment for the whole of us if those blamed hotheaded fools dont kill each other but he decided to stand by his roommate no matter what came browning led them away from the vicinity of the college buildings and down a dark street at length they came to an old brick structure in which not a light was to be seen down some slippery stone steps they went and the big soph let them in by unlocking a door it was dark inside browning closed and locked the door after which he conducted them along a narrow passage opened another door and ushered them into a room the smell of cigarette smoke was strong there and frank knew the place had been lately occupied by smokers a match spluttered and then a lamp was lighted get ready for business directed browning i will bring the rapiers and another light then he vanished beyond a door that opened into another dark room frank looked around and saw a table upon which were cards and empty beer bottles there were chairs and some copies of illustrated sporting papers the walls were bare it was warm down there and frank immediately discarded his coat diamond was about to follow merriwells example when there was a sudden rush of feet and the room filled in a twinkling with masked youths who flung themselves on the astonished freshmen and made all but frank a prisoner in a moment frank instantly understood that they had been trapped and he knocked down four of his assailants before they could bear him to the floor and overpower him his hands were securely bound and then he was lifted to his feet well fellows that was a pretty slick trick he half laughed as he coolly looked around you sophs have been trying to corral a gang of us for a week and with the aid of the smooth mr browning you succeeded very finely this time silence roared a deep voice and a tall fellow in a scarlet mephisto rig confronted frank you have intruded upon forbidden ground none but the chosen may enter here and escape with life not one chorused all the masks in deep and dismal unison mephisto made a signal once more the freshmen were seized away with them shouted the fellow in red in another moment all but frank had been hustled out of the room then frank was suddenly held fast and blindfolded he was dragged along to some place where the opening of another door brought to his ears the sound of horns and shouts of fiendish glee he was made to mount some stairs and then his feet were kicked from beneath him and he shot down a steep and slippery incline into the very midst of the shouting demons he dropped through space and landed in a vat of icecold water then he was dragged out thumped on the head with stuffed clubs deafened by the horns that bellowed in his ears and tossed in a blanket till his head bumped against the ceiling then he was forced to crawl through a piano box that was filled with sawdust he was pushed and pulled and hammered and thumped till he was sore in every part of his body all through this ordeal not a word or murmur escaped his lips his teeth were set and he felt that he had rather die than utter a sound that betrayed pain or agitation this seemed to infuriate his assailants they banged him about till he could scarcely stand and then of a sudden there was a great hush while a terrible voice croaked bring forth the guillotine there was a bustle and then the bandage was stripped from franks eyes he was tripped up and a second later found himself lying helpless with his neck in the socket of a mock guillotine above him was suspended a huge gleaming knife that seemed to tremble as if about to fall at his side was a fellow dressed in the somber garments of an executioner it was really a severe strain upon his nerves but still his teeth were clinched and not a sound came from his lips the knife is broken whispered the mock executioner in franks ear so it may accidentally fall and cut you have you any last message fresh hoarsely whispered the mock executioner there might be a fatal accident frank made no reply save to wink tauntingly at the fellow the next instant with a nervebreaking swish the shining blade fell a piece of ice was drawn across franks throat and a stream of warm water squirted down his back it was most horribly real and awful and for a moment it seemed that the knife had actually done the frightful deed despite his wonderful nerve frank gasped but he quickly saw that the knife had swung aside and his head was still attached to his body then he forced a derisive laugh from his lips and seemed not the least disturbed much to the disgust of the assembly confound him growled a voice which frank fancied he recognized as belonging to browning theres no fun in him lets try another then frank was lifted to his feet and assisted to don his coat if you want to stay and see the fun put on a mask directed mephisto you must not be recognized by the other freshies he was given a mask and he put it on as directed a moment later the masked youths began to howl and blow horns a door opened and diamond blindfolded and bound was led into the room the young virginian stood up haughtily and he was seen to strain and struggle in an effort to free his hands i protest against this outrage he cried angrily i want you to know that my father the horns and the shouts drowned his words he was forced to mount the steps to a high platform and an instant later he found himself shooting down a slippery incline of planed and greased boards the racket stopped as diamond scooted down the slippery surface he dropped sprawling into the vat of icy water several hands caught hold of him yanked him up and thrust him down again oh somebody shall suffer for this gurgled the helpless freshman spluttering water from his mouth he was dragged out of the vat and then he was forced to endure all the hustling and thumping and banging which frank merriwell had passed through his protests seemed to fall on deaf ears it had been reported that diamond had declared that the sophomores would not dare to haze him as his father would make it hot for them if they did the report was remembered and he was used more severely than frank had been hazing at yale was said to be a thing of the past but frank saw it was still carried on secretly make a speech fresh shouted a voice speech speech yelled the masked lads diamond was placed on a low table for a moment he hesitated and then he fancied he saw his opportunity to make a protest that would be heard i will make a speech he declared ill tell you young ruffians what i think of you and what swish a sponge that was dripping with dirty water struck him square in the mouth some of the water went down his throat and he choked and strangled the table was jerked from beneath his feet and he fell into the waiting arms of the masked sophomores he called us ruffians give it to him then the unfortunate freshman was used worse than ever he was tossed in a blanket given a powerful shock of electricity deafened by the horns pounded with the stuffed clubs and hustled till there was scarcely any breath left in his body then the bandage was torn from diamonds eyes and he was confronted by the guillotine over which fresh red ink had been liberally spattered the blade of the huge knife was dripping in a gory manner and it really looked as if it had just completed a deadly piece of work despite himself the young virginian shivered when his eyes rested on the apparently bloodstained blade be careful some one distinctly whispered we do not want to kill more than one freshman in a night some one else spoke of the frightful manner in which the knife had cut merriwell and then despite his feeble struggles diamond was placed upon the instrument of torture the other fresh died game muttered the executioner of course we didnt mean to kill him but the knife is out of order and it slipped by accident we havent time to fix it properly but there are only about nine chances out of ten that it will fall again oh you fellows shall pay for this feebly gasped diamond despite himself although he knew how unlikely such a thing was he could not help wondering if a terrible accident had really happened if not where was merriwell he looked around but saw nothing of frank who was keeping in the background and then when his nerves had been quite unstrung the knife fell the ice and warm water were applied and diamond could not choke back the cry of horror that forced itself from his lips a roar of laughter broke from the masked students when diamond was lifted to his feet he was almost too weak to stand he clinched his teeth vowing over and over to himself that he would find a way to square accounts if it takes me a year ill find out who the leaders in this affair are and they shall suffer for it he thought give him a chance to see the others put through the mill said mephisto and diamonds hands were released the virginian looked around seeming irresolute for a moment not far away he saw a masked lad whose clothes were wet and bedaubed with dirt and sawdust in an instant diamond sprang toward this person and snatched the mask from his face its merriwell he triumphantly shouted and he has helped to haze me his career at yale will be suddenly cut short chapter iii the blow there was a sudden hush the students saw that diamond was really revengeful and his words seemed to indicate that he intended to report any one whose identity he discovered the virginian was pale and he trembled with anger you dont mean to say that you will blow do you asked one thats exactly what i do mean sir came resolutely from the lips of the infuriated freshman i am a gentleman and the son of a gentleman and ill never stand it to be treated like a cur hazing is said to be no longer tolerated here and an investigation is certain to follow my report of this affair a little fellow stepped out you claim to be a gentleman he said distinctly but you will prove yourself a cad if you peach i had rather be a cad than a ruffian sir if you were a gentleman you would take your medicine like a gentleman youd never squeal you fellows are the ones who are squealing now for you see you have been imposing on the wrong man man shot back the little fellow contemptuously theres not much man about a chap that blows when he is hazed a little a little a little is this what you call a little oh this is nothing think of what the poor freshies used to go through in the old days of delta kappa and signa epsilon why sometimes a fellow would be roasted so his skin would smell like burned steak for a week that was when he was burned at the stake said a chap in the background and there was a universal dismal groan this is some of the delta kappa machinery here the little fellow explained sometimes some of the fellows come here to have a cold bot and hot lob you freshies walked right in on us tonight and we gave you a pleasant reception now if you blow ill guarantee youll never become a soph the fellows will do you and do you dirty before your first year is up such threats do not frighten me haughtily flung back the lad from virginia i know this was a putup job and bruce browning was in it he got us to come here frank merriwell knew something about it or hed never been so ready to come and i know you too tad horner the little fellow fell back a step and then with a sudden angry impulse he tore off his mask showing a flushed chubby boyish face from which a pair of great blue eyes flashed at diamond well i am tad horner he cried and im not ashamed of it if you want to throw me down go ahead it will be a low dirty trick and will show the kind of big stuff you are the masked lads were surprised for tad had never exhibited such spirit before he had always seemed like a mild shy motherboy sort of chap he had been hazed and had cried but he wouldnt beg and he never squealed after that browning had taken him under his wing had fought his battles and had stood by him through the freshman year anybody who was looking for trouble could find it by imposing on horner and browning for all of his laziness could fight like a tiger when he was aroused some of the students clapped their hands in approbation of tads plain words and there was a general stir one fellow proposed that everybody unmask so that all would be on a level with horner but the little fellow quickly cried dont do it youd all be spotted and the faculty would know who to investigate if anything should happen to diamond if im fired i want you fellows to settle with him for me well do it well do it tad cried more than twenty voices diamond showed his white even teeth and laughed shortly perhaps you think that will scare me he sneered if so you will find i am not bluffed so easily we are not trying to scare you declared another of the masked students but youll find we are in earnest if you blow well you will find i am in earnest and i do not care for you all the boys began to despair for they saw that diamond was determined and obstinate and it would be no easy thing to induce him to abandon his intention of reporting the hazing if he did so browning and horner would find themselves in deep trouble and others might become involved during the investigation it was not probable that the consequences would be serious for merriwell who would be able to prove his innocence in the matter what could be done the boys fell to discussing the matter in little groups and not a few expressed regret that tad horner had unmasked as an alibi could have been arranged for him if he had not done so now he would be too proud to permit them to try anything of the sort and he would tell the truth about his connection with the affair if the truth were demanded of him were in a bad box said one fellow in one of the little groups diamond is mad enough to do as he threatens sure nodded another and that breaks up this joint no more little lunches here no more games of penny ante its a howling shame exploded a third it makes me feel grouchy i move we strangle diamond suggested the first speaker it seems that that is the only way to keep his tongue still dolefully groaned a tall chap this is a big horse on us thats what sighed a boy with a face like a girls the whole business puts me in a blue funk then they stood and stared silently at each other through the eyeholes in their masks and not one of them was able to propose anything practicable the rest of the assembled sophomores seemed in quite as bad a plight and some of them were inclined to indulge in profanity which although it relieved their feelings for the moment did not suggest any way out of the scrape at this point merriwell spoke up addressing diamond look here old man he said in a friendly way youve only taken the same dose they gave me its nothing when you get used to it diamond gave him a contemptuous look but did not speak now i dont propose to make a fuss about this little joke frank went on whats the use im not half killed perhaps you think you can hoodwink me cried diamond well you cannot you were in the game all the time thats why you were so ready to meet me in a duel thats why you came here i assure you on my word of honor that you are wrong your word of honor yes my word of honor he calmly returned see look at my clothes you can tell that i have been through the mill you may have had them fixed that way on purpose to fool me oh you must know better than that be reasonable diamond the virginian made a savage gesture if you are so pleased to be made a laughingstock of its nothing to me he flashed keep still if you want to im going to tell all i know that would make a very large book full of nice clean blank pages said some one in the background franks manner suddenly changed look here diamond he said you wont tell a thing the southerner caught his breath and his eyes stared eh he muttered surprised at the others manner i wont not on your life why not because it will mean expulsion for you as well as myself if you do every one was listening they gathered about the two freshmen wondering not a little at merriwells words and manner expulsion for me slowly repeated diamond how is that its straight goods explain it well i will we came here to fight a duel didnt we yes sir you admit that i do sir that is all thats needed how why i dont understand duels are not countenanced in the north and nothing would cause a fellow to be fired from yale quicker than the knowledge that he had had anything to do with one while here do you twig there was a moment of silence and then a stir a deep sigh of relief came from the masked lads and some of them showed an inclination to cheer merriwell diamond seemed nonplused for the moment he glared at frank his hands clinched and his face pale at last he slowly said a duel is something no gentleman can blow about so if you are a gentleman you will have to remain silent sir thats the way you southerners look at it but yon will excuse us northerners if we do not see it in the same light a hazing is something we do not blow about but you seem determined to let out everything for all that it would be a dirty thing to do in order to even the matter these fellows are sure to tell that you came here to fight a duel with deadly weapons and youll find yourself rusticating in virginia directly way down in ole virginny softly warbled one of the delighted sophomores thats the stuff merry old boy diamond trembled with intense anger he tried to speak but his voice was so hoarse that his words were unintelligible a blue line seemed to form around his mouth merriwells got him bruce brown lazily whispered in tad horners ear see him squirm tad was relieved although he endeavored not to show it but a satisfied smile crept over his rosy face and he felt like giving frank merriwell the glad hand diamonds anger got the best of him he strode forward looked straight into franks eyes and panted i hate you sir i could kill you and then before he realized what he was doing he struck merriwell a sharp blow on the cheek with his open hand chapter iv the fight the blow staggered frank it had come so suddenly that he was quite unprepared for it his face became suddenly pale save where diamonds hand had struck and there the crimson prints of four fingers came out quickly like a danger signal with the utmost deliberation merriwell removed his coat come sir he said to diamond as he passed coat and hat to a ready sophomore i i cant fight you that way protested the virginian bring the rapiers this time i claim the right to name the weapons and they will be bare fists right right cried several voices youll have to fight him that way diamond i will fight him grated jack furiously it is the prize fighters way but ill fight him and i will lick him he tore off his coat and flung it down the boys quickly formed a ring and the freshmen foes faced each other then the door of the room where the other freshmen were confined was thrust open and harry rattleton excitedly cried whee jiz i mean jee whiz what do you fellows think do you imagine we are going to stay penned in here while there is a scrap going on well i guess not were coming out harry came with a rush and the other freshmen followed at his heels the party having been abandoned by the sophs who had been placed on guard over them hold on hold on commanded harry forcing his way toward the fighters i am merriwells second and im going to see fair play you bet and i am diamonds second said roland ditson just give me a chance in the ring there the appearance of the freshmen caused a brief delay there was some talk about rules and rounds and diamond said if i must fight with my fists ill fight as i please i dont know about your rules and there will be but one round that will finish it how does that suit you merriwell asked tad horner who seemed to have assumed the position of referee i am willing that mr diamond should arrange that matter to suit himself but there is to be no kicking tad horner hastily put in certainly not stiffly agreed the southerner all right shake hands diamond placed both hands behind his back and merriwell laughed ready called horner on guard now youre off barely had the words left the little referees lips when top tap slap merriwell had struck diamond three light blows with his open hand a gasp of astonishment came from the watching sophomores never had they seen three blows delivered in such lightninglike rapidity but their ears had not fooled them and they heard each blow distinctly merriwells guard was perfect his pose was light and professional and he suddenly seemed catlike on his feet diamond was astonished but only for an instant the tapping blows started his blood and he sprang toward his foe striking out with his left and then with his right merriwell did not attempt to guard but he dodged both blows with ease and then smiled sweetly into the face of the baffled virginian oh say chuckled harry rattleton hugging himself in delighted anticipation just you fellows wait a minute diamond will think he has been struck by an earthquake bruce browning himself a scientific boxer was watching every movement of the two freshmen he turned to puss parker at his side and said merriwell handles himself like an old professional by jove i believe theres good stuff in that fellow diamond would like to kill merriwell said parker you can see it in his face and eyes in truth there was a deadly look in the eyes of the palefaced young virginian his lips were pressed together and a hardening of the jaws told that his teeth were set he was following merriwell up and the latter was avoiding him with ease plainly diamond meant to corner the lad he hated and then force the fighting to a finish the rivals were nearly of a height and they wore built much alike although frank had slightly the better chest development merriwell seemed to toy with diamond giving him several little patlike blows on the breast and in the ribs when the virginian felt that he had frank cornered he was astonished to see merriwell slip under his arm and come up laughing behind him merriwells laughter filled diamonds very soul with gall and wormwood wait he thought he laughs best who laughs last give it to him frank urged rattleton youll get out of wind dodging about and then it will not be so easy to finish him off but frank saw that in a scientific way diamond was no match for him and he disliked to strike the fellow he regretted very much that the unfortunate affair had come about and he felt that there could be no satisfaction in whipping the southerner merriwell hoped to toy with diamond till the latter should see that his efforts were fruitless and give up in disgust but he did not yet recognize the kind of stuff of which john diamond was built come come impatiently called one of the spectators quit ducking and dodging and get into the game thats right thats right chorused several this is no sport and its no sixday walking match sneered roland ditson merriwell seems afraid to stand up and face diamond is that what you think frank mentally exclaimed well i suppose i will have to hit him a few times although it goes against my grain a moment later he dropped his hands by his side and took a step to meet the virginian it seemed like a great opportunity for diamond and he led off straight for franks face striking with his left with a slight side movement of his head frank avoided the blow allowing his enemys fist to pass over his shoulder at the same time he cross countered with his right hand cracking jack a heavy one under the ear hooray cried harry rattleton in delight that was a corker bet sparkler saw more stars than there are in the wilky may i mean milky way for a few minutes the fight was hot again and again frank struck his enemy but without putting his full strength into any of the blows but it did not seem to have any effect on diamond save to make him more fierce and determined the southerners got some sand commented bruce browning thats right nodded puss parker he takes punishment well for a while at least but i dont believe he will hold out much longer i think he is the kind of a fellow to go to pieces in an instant you cant tell about that i have a fancy that hes deceptive none of them save rattleton possibly knew that merriwell was reserving any of his strength when he struck his foe the fellows who a short time before were the most indignant against the southerner because he seemed determined to blow were now forced to admire his bulldog tenacity and sand merriwell had no desire to severely injure diamond although he had felt some resentment toward the fellow for forcing him into a duel with rapiers to frank it had seemed that the virginian had no hesitation in taking advantage of an enemy for diamond must have presumed that merriwell knew nothing of the art of fencing and swordplay but for this belief merriwell would have been inclined to keep on and tire his enemy out without striking a single blow that could leave a mark but when frank came to consider everything he decided that it was no more than fair that he should give his persistent foe a certain amount of punishment again and again frank cross countered and uppercut diamond and gradually he came to strike harder as the virginian forced the fighting without showing signs of letting up bruises and swellings began to appear on diamonds face on one cheek merriwells knuckles cut through the skin and the blood began to run creeping down to his chin and dropping on the bosom of his white shirt still from the determination and fury with which he fought it seemed that diamond was utterly unconscious that he had been struck at all jack did not consider how he had led frank into a duel with rapiers without knowing whether the fellow he hated had ever taken a fencing lesson in all his life his one thought was that being an expert boxer himself merriwell had forced him to a fist fight believing it would be easy to dispose of him that way diamonds hatred of frank made him blind to the fact that he was in the least to blame and filled him with a passionate belief that he could kill the smiling northerner without a qualm of conscience without a pang of remorse at last disgusted with his nonsuccess in striking frank at all he sprang forward suddenly and grappled with him frank had been on the watch for that move then the boys saw a pretty struggle for a moment ending with diamond being lifted and dropped heavily squarely on his back merriwell came down heavily on his persistent enemy frank fell on jack with the hope of knocking the wind out of the fellow and thus bringing the fight to a close for a few moments it seemed that he had succeeded frank sprang up lightly just as tad horner grappled him by the hair with both hands and yelled break away roland ditson was at diamonds side in a twinkling come come old man he whispered get up and get into the game again dont let them count you out but the virginian was gasping for breath and he did not seem to hear the words of his second that settles it said puss parker promptly better wait and see advised bruce browning diamond may not give up when he gets his breath it doesnt look as if hed ever get his breath again harry rattleton was at franks side swiftly saying why didnt you knock him out and show the fellows what you can do you monkeyed with the goat too long hes stuffy and you had to settle him sometime it didnt make a dit of bifference whether it was first or last thats all right smiled frank hes got sand and i hated to nail him hard it seemed a shame to thump such a fellow and cover his face with decorations shame shame spluttered harry why didnt he force you into a duel with rapiers or try to and he is an expert say whats the matter with you if id been in your place id gone into him tooth and nail and i wouldnt have left him in the shape of anything have you got a soft spot around you somewhere merriwell i admire sand even if it is in an enemy you take the cherry pie yes you take the whole bakery harry gazed at his roommate in wonder that was not entirely unmingled with pity and disgust he could not understand merriwell and such generosity toward a persistent foe on the part of frank seemed like weakness in the meantime ditson had been urging diamond to get up theyll call the scrap finished if you dont get onto your pins in a jiffy he warned horners got his watch in his hand still the virginian gasped for breath and seemed unable to lift a hand if ever a fellow seemed done up it was diamond just then roll ditson ground his teeth in despair oh merriwell will think he is cock of the walk now he muttered hell crow and strut hes laughing over it now whwhats that gasped diamond trying to sit up he is laughing at you hurriedly whispered ditson lying glibly i just heard him tell rattleton that he could have knocked the stuffing out of you in less than a quarter of a minute he says youll never dare face him again oh he does oh he does came huskily from diamonds lips well well see about that well see with ditsons aid he got upon his feet then his breath and his strength seemed to come to him in a twinkling with a backward snap of his arm he flung his second away then uttering a hoarse cry he rushed like a mad bull at the lad he hated chapter v the finish diamonds recovery and the manner in which he resumed the fight caused general astonishment even bruce browning had come to think that the virginian was out frank was taken by surprise before he could square away to meet his foe diamond struck him a terrific blow near the temple knocking him into rattletons arms foul cried harry excitedly horner hadnt given the word foul foul came from all sides there is no foul in this fight save when something is used besides fists declared merriwell as he staggered from his roommates arms its all right and it goes but he found that everything seemed swimming around him and dark spots were pursuing each other before his eyes the floor seemed to heave like the deck of a ship at sea he put out his hand to grasp something and then he was struck again once more rattletons arms kept frank from going down this is no square deal harry shouted by the poly hoker i mean the holy poker ill take a hand in this myself he would have released merriwell and jumped into the ring but franks strong fingers closed on his arm steady old man came sharply from merriwells lips i am in this yet awhile if diamond finishes me he is to be let alone the fellow that lays a hand on him is no friend of mine you give me cramps groaned harry instead of aiding in finishing frank diamonds second blow seemed to straighten him up as if it had cleared a fog from his brain the spots disappeared before his eyes and things ceased to swim around him into the ring to meet his foe sprang frank and to the astonishment of everybody he still smiled at the same time merriwell knew he had toyed with diamond too long he realized that the virginians first blow had come within a hair of knocking him out and he could still hear a faint ringing and roaring in his head frank saw that the only way he could end the fight was to finish his unrelenting and persistent foe diamond fought like an infuriated tiger again and again franks fist cracked on his face and still he did not falter but continued to stand up and take his medicine in less than a minute the virginian was bleeding at the nose and had received a blow in one of his eyes that was causing it to swell in a way that threatened to close it entirely the spectators were greatly excited and not a few of them declared it was the most gamey fight they had ever witnessed the front of diamonds shirt was stained with blood and he presented a sorry aspect his chest was heaving but his uninjured eye glared with unabated fury and determination will he never give up muttered harry rattleton hes a regular hog the fellow doesnt know when he has enough it was true southern grit it was the unyielding southern spirit the spirit that led the soldiers of the south to make one of the pluckiest struggles known in history while the fellows grit had won franks admiration still merriwell had learned that it would not do to let up the only way out of the fight was to end it and he set about trying to accomplish that with as little delay as possible once diamond succeeded in getting in another blow and it left a slight swelling over one of the other lads eyes but merriwell did not seem to know that he had been hit he soon cracked the virginian upon the uninjured eye and that began to swell in a few seconds it seemed that diamond must soon go blind finish him old man finish him urged harry frank was looking for the chance but it was some time before he found it it came at last and his left landed on the jaw beneath diamonds ear over went the southerner and he lay like a log where he fell at a glance it was evident to all that he was knocked out the boys crowded around merriwell eager to congratulate him but he thrust them back saying its the first time in my life i ever did a thing of which i was ashamed look after him im all right say exploded harry rattleton you make me sick didnt you have to do it i suppose so didnt he strike you foul twice he knows nothing of rules and we were fighting by no rules so there could be no foul oh no if hed soaked you with a brick youd said it was all right i say you make me sick wait till he gets a good chance to do you and see how quick he will take it hell not be to blame if he tries to get square oh go hoke your sed i mean soak your head ill catch you some time when you are asleep and try to pound a little sense into you well take care of diamond ordered merriwell that last one i gave him was a beastly thump let the other fellows take care of him said harry well rub you down you need it got any towels mr horner guess we can find one or two cheerfully answered tad come on merriwell well fix you up frank followed them into the room where the captured freshmen had been confined and there they found running water an old iron sink a tin wash basin and some towels the visitor was stripped and given a brisk and thorough rubbing and sponging by harry and tad bruce browning with his mask still over his face came loafing in and looked the stripped freshman over with a critical eye he inspected frank from all sides poked him with his fingers felt of his arms and legs surveyed the muscles of his back and chest and then stood off and took him all in at a glance humph he grunted franks delicate pink skin glowed and he looked a perfect apollo with a splendid head poised upon a white shapely neck never had he looked handsomer in all his life than he did at that moment stripped to the buff his brown hair frowsled his body glowing from the rubbing by jove cried tad horner who was sometimes called baby hes a jim hickey eh old man the interrogation was directed at browning humph grunted bruce and then with his hands in his pockets he loafed out of the room afterward it was reported that browning said the freshman was the finestputup chap he had ever seen but he didnt want to give him the swelled head by telling him so by the time merriwell was well rubbed down one of the freshmen came in and reported that diamond had come around all right theyre going to bring him in here and give him a rubbing said the freshman frank hastened to get into his clothes in order that diamond might have a chance rattleton had brushed the dirt and sawdust off those clothes so they looked pretty well and merriwell showed no traces of what he had passed through when he stepped out of the little room some of the boys were trying to induce diamond to be rubbed down but he objected declaring he was going directly to his room the blood had been washed from his face and one or two cuts had been patched up with courtplaster but his eyes were nearly closed and he presented a pitiful appearance frank hesitated a moment and then he stepped up to his foe saying in a manner most sincere old man i am sorry this affair took place i had the advantage because i have taken boxing lessons but you made a beautiful fight i hold no hard feelings lets call it quits and shake he held out his hand diamonds reply was to turn his back squarely on the proffered hand an additional flush arose to merriwells cheeks and he dropped his hand by his side turning away without another word a few moments later diamond left the building accompanied by a single companion and that companion was not roland ditson ditson remained behind and he was among those who crowded about frank merriwell and offered congratulations i was diamonds second said roll but i am satisfied that the best man won he is no match for you merriwell i shouldnt have been his second only he urged me to i was glad to see you do him up he got hold of franks hand and held on but received no friendly pressure in return when he said he was glad that merriwell did diamond up frank looked incredulous as for me said the victor i was sorry to have to do him up somewhere about the place rattleton had found an old floral decoration representing a harp he brought it forward and presented it to frank take it he said youll need it pretty soon your wings must be sprouting already what is it asked frank why cant you see its a harp it looks to me like a blasted lyre said merriwell youd better give it to ditson then everybody but ditson laughed chapter vi a fresh council diamond was in a wretched condition hunk collins his roommate procured two slices of fresh beefsteak and the virginian had them bound over his eyes while his face was bathed with soothing and healing lotions but nothing could soothe his bruised and battered spirit and collins said he was kept awake all night by hearing diamond grind his teeth at irregular intervals even when he slept near morning the southerner continued to grind his strong white teeth collins was dropping off to sleep from sheer weariness when he awoke to find his roommate astride him and clutching him by the throat this time ill fix you mumbled diamond thickly ill kill you merriwell ill kill you then he struck feeby at collins who rolled over and flung him off they grappled and it was a severe struggle before diamond was flung down on the bed and held what in thunder is the matter with you gasped collins whose hair was standing im not merriwell have you gone daft where are we why in our room of course where did you think we were i didnt know i was dreaming well if you are going to be this way often ill have to take out a life insurance policy or quit you dont mind ill be all right in the morning oh hang the luck then the passionate southerner turned over with his face toward the wall collins smoked a cigarette to quiet his nerves after which he got into bed once more at intervals he could feel the bed shake and he knew diamond was shivering as if he had a chill in the morning diamond was not all right he was ill in bed and it was necessary to call a physician although he protested against it his eyes were in wretched shape but when the doctor questioned him he persisted in saying he had injured them by falling downstairs of course he could not appear at chapel or recitations and he sent in an excuse then mr lovejoy came around to investigate now mr lovejoy was most mild and lamblike in appearance and one would have thought never in all his life had he indulged in anything that was not perfectly proper but appearances were deceptive in the case of mr lovejoy when a student at yale he had made a record but he had been fortunate and he was never detected in anything the faculty could not approve by those who knew him he was regarded as a terror and by the faculty he was looked on as one of the most quiet and docile students in college when cyrus lovejoy became an instructor he did not forget the days when he had been a leader in scrapes of all sorts and he was not inclined to be prying into the affairs of students under him not only that but he could be blind to some things he accidentally discovered so when mr lovejoy reported that john diamonds eyes being naturally weak were inflamed by too close application to his studies especially in the evening no one thought of investigating further the doctor it was said had forbidden diamond to attempt to study for several days and had ordered him to wear a bandage over his eyes two or three evenings after the fight a party of freshmen gathered in merriwells room for they were beginning to realize that frank was likely to be a leader among them i say fellows cried dan dorman who was sitting on the sill of the open window with a cigarette clinging to his lips do you know what diamond is doing hes doing his best to cure those beautiful eyes of his said bandy robinson im giving it to you straight that he was out today and went down to the nearest gun store declared dorman collins says he bought a winchester rifle a shotgun two revolvers a bowie knife a slungshot and a set of brass knuckles woooh groaned dismal jones why didnt he purchase a cannon and start for some battlefield look out merry laughed ned stover hes after your scalp hell have to get a bigger outfit than that before he takes it declared harry rattleton how about it merry asked bandy robinson ill tell you fellows said frank who was not smoking diamond is not the fellow to give up whipped very soon im dead sure to hear from him again hes a cad growled dismal jones i think you fellows judge him rather harshly said frank he is a southerner and he looks at many things differently than we do from his standpoint he seems to be right well hell have to get those notions out of his head if he wants to stay in college airily declared dan dorman now i came here with the idea of falling into the ways in vogue everything goes with me thats the way to get along i am not so sure of that merriwell returned a man must have some individuality if you do everything everybody wants you to it wont be long before theyll not want you to do anything oh well whats the use to be always hanging off and getting yourself disliked one extreme is as bad as the other now i make allowances for diamond and i am not inclined to believe him such a bad fellow harry rattleton flung a book across the room oh you give me the flubdubs he exploded why that fellow hates you and he means to do you some time still you are soft enough to say hes not such a bad fellow its disgusting time will tell smiled frank all of you fellows must admit that he has sand oh a kind of bulldog sticktoitiveness murmured stover ill tell you one thing said bandy robinson now that diamond has not blowed hes going to be backed by some of the leading sophs eh what makes you think so oh ive got it straight browning has been to see him no why browning is king of the sophs and he is jealous of merriwell jealous sure he says merry is altogether too soon for a fresh and he must be taken down i tell you ive got it straight hell put up some kind of a game to enable diamond to get square well this is rather interesting confessed frank showing that he was aroused ill have to look out for mr browning hes a hard fellow to go against solemnly said dismal jones hes a le boule man and they say he may take his choice of the other big societies next year oh whats that amount to it amounts to something here but then hes a fighter and he is authority on fighters and fighting he is too fat to fight they say he can train down in a week he was the greatest freshman halfback ever known at yale halfback browning a halfback oh say that fellow couldnt play football not a great deal now perhaps but he could last year hed be on the regular team now but his father swore to take him out of college if he didnt stop it you see browning is not entirely to blame for his laziness he inherits it from his father and the old man will not allow him to lead in athletics so whatever he does must be done secretly frank was interested he wondered how a fellow like bruce browning could come to be know as king of the sophomores unless such a title was applied to him in derision now he began to understand that browning was something more than the lazy mischief planner that he had seemed franks interest in browning grew and you say he is backing diamond thats the way it looks from the road well mr bruce browning may need some attention it is he who puts the sophs up to their jobs on us we ought to put up a big one on him thats right thats right merry said jones set the complicated machinery of your fertile brain to work and see what it will bring forth thats right thats right ill have to take time to think it over we have a few soph scalps grinned rattleton pointing to a number of caps with which the walls were decorated all of which had been snatched from the heads of sophomores have the rest of you fellows done as well i have lost two confessed dan dorman they seem to single me out as easy fruit and havent you made an attempt to get one in return asked bandy robinson i havent had a good chance if you wait for a good chance youll never get a scalp you must snatch em whenever you can by jove laughed frank this talk about scalps has given me an idea lets have it exclaimed several of the boys in unison not now he said wait till i have perfected it roll ditson strolled in smoking a cigarette and said hello merry hello fellows whats up council of war just that said dan dorman merry is perfecting a scheme to put a horse on browning eh browning great scott is that so hes a bad man to monkey with better let him alone merry ditson had a patronizing way that was offensive to frank who had given him numberless digs but he was too thick to tumble or he deliberately refused to take merriwells words as they were intended youll have to kick him before he knows hes not wanted rattleton had said thank you for your advice said frank with mild sarcasm thank you exceedingly perhaps you are right oh i know i am i dont want to get the king after me and i dont believe you care to have him on your trail he is the most influential soph in college why his name is on a table down at moreys ditson looked around as if his last statement had settled the question of brownings vast superiority over all sophomores moreys was the favorite resort of the students and no freshman could enter there it was an old frame house with lowposted rooms and there one could drink everything except beer no beer could be had at moreys moreys was headquarters for the society of the cup this cup had six handles and was kept in a locked closet on the cup was engraved in large letters the word velvet which is a wellknown yale drink composed of champagne and dublin stout a drink that is mild and soft but has a terrific kick besides the word velvet a number of students names were engraved on the cup and no one whose name was not there could ask the proprietor to show the cup the marked tables were two round tables on which names of the frequenters of the place had been cut in the hard wood one table had been filled with six hundred and seventyfive names and was suspended against the wall where it would revolve and the other tables were fast filling up merriwell laughed at ditsons statement i dont see as it is such a wonderful thing for a soph to get his name on one of those tables he said if you had said that brownings name was on the cup it would have seemed a matter of some consequence it may be for all i know sophs are not in the habit of telling us everything steer clear of browning merry old man thanks again you have made me so nervous that i think i will take your advice thats right my boy thats right nodded ditson swelling with importance always listen to your uncle my lad and you will never go wrong the other lads seemed rather disappointed but merriwell said nothing more of his scheme to get a horse on browning that is he said nothing more that night chapter vii a surprise it was singular how quickly browning learned that merriwell had contemplated working a job on him it seemed an absolute certainty that some one of the party in merriwells room had gone forth and blowed who had done so was a question as was the most natural thing considering his dislike for the fellow frank felt that roll ditson was the telltale of this he had no proof however and he was too just to openly condemn a man without proof it was certain that browning had learned all about it for he sent word to merriwell to go slow at the same time in all public places he avowed the utmost contempt and disregard for the freshman who had done up diamond the boy is altogether too new browning sneered what he needs is polishing off and he is bound to get it now frank had won admiration from the sophomores and there were one or two who did not like browning and would have given not a little to have seen him beaten at anything this being the case it is not surprising that merriwell received an anonymous note warning him to keep in his room on a certain evening and look out for squalls frank knew browning would not come alone and he determined to be prepared with this object in view he gathered ten stout freshmen and had them come to his room early on the evening mentioned the curtains were drawn closely and the arrivals were astonished to see a lot of indian toggery piled up on tables and chairs imitation buckskin suits feathered headdresses bows arrows tomahawks and so forth on merriwells table was a full supply of indian red grease paint oh say gasped ned stover his eyes bulging whats this a powwow outfit this is the result of the idea you fellows gave me when you spoke of capturing scalps the other evening laughed frank select your suits gentlemen and proceed to make up make up what for just you make up and i will tell you what for afterward merriwells influence was sufficient to induce them to obey and he aided them in the work blate grazes i mean great blazes chuckled rattleton as he rubbed the war paint on his face wont we make a bloodthirsty gang of roble ned men er noble red men the boys aided each other and frank assisted them all arent you going to make up merry asked bandy robinson not now i am to be the decoy the decoy whats in the wind anyway well i have it pretty straight that some sophs led by browning are coming to take me out for an airing tonight eh take you out yes and he means to take them in laughed rattleton arranging a war bonnet on his head thats just it nodded frank if they come here well be ready for them if they do not come well call on mr browning im afraid this is rather a serious matter said dismal jones oh dont begin to croak cried rattleton merriwell knows his business hurry up with your makeup cant tell how early the sophs will call so the boys hastened to complete their disguise and a decidedly savagelooking band they were when all was completed frank surveyed them with satisfaction ah my bold warriors he cried i am proud of you tonight tonight we deal the enemy a terrible and deadly blow were ready to hear what the layout is eagerly said ned stover well you are to retire to robinsons room which is exactly opposite this and wait i have two fellows outside to let me know when the enemy approaches and to take a hand in the game at the right time when i whistle you are to make your way into this room if you have to break down the door thats all the boys retired to robinsons room where they smoked and waited with great impatience frank sat down and coolly went at his studies nearly an hour passed and then there was a sound of wheels outside the sound stopped before the door a few moments later some one ascended the stairs and there came a knock on the door come in called frank the door opened and roll ditson sauntered in smoking the inevitable cigarette hello merry he cried looking around all alone all alone ditson yawned frank its beastly stupid but i am having a hard pull at my studies better come out with me and get a little air its stuffy here oh youll have to excuse me tonight i dont believe ill go out ditson urged but frank persisted in refusing roll stopped near a table and picked up a stick of grease paint hello whats this he exclaimed arent going into amateur theatricals are you merry oh i dont know smiled frank i may do a turn ditson looked at merriwell curiously as if in doubt concerning his sincerity but frank simply continued to smile indian red said roll reading the lettering on the stick you dont mean to become a big chief do you perhaps so well you are pretty sure to become a big chief here at yale old man said ditson with apparent earnestness you will be a leader here some day think so oh i am dead sure of it thank you merriwell yawned again oh come on ditson urged youre stupid from digging over those books come out and have a walk no you wont youll have to excuse me tonight ditson all right but say i came near forgetting something as i came in there was a fellow down to the door who said he wanted to see you a fellow who was it dont know some of the students i think oh if that is the case go down and bring him up ditson you can open the door and let him in without disturbing mrs harrington all right nodded roll sorry you wont come out old fel youll get grouchy goodnight goodnight ditson went out and frank heard him descending the stairs therell be music in the air muttered merriwell as he again lay back in his chair elevating his feet to the top of the table but the surprisers are liable to be surprised he heard the front door creak often he wondered why mrs harrington did not grease the hinges frank had good ears and it was not long before he was sure he could hear rustlings and whisperings in the hall then one person seemed to ascend the stairs very slowly but he made out that there were two or three others with that one the others stepping as softly as possible merriwell remained cool and apparently quite unaware that anything unusual was taking place the footsteps reached the head of the stairs and advanced to the door on which there was a distinct knock come in frank once more called the door was promptly flung open and into the room strode a person who was wrapped in a big overcoat and wore a widebrimmed hat slouched over his eyes his face nearly to his eyes was covered with bushy whiskers hello exclaimed frank as if surprised who are you sh hissed the stranger with a warning gesture are we alone yes where is your roommate out the fellow whistled sharply and the next minute four masked lads appeared at the door and leaped into the room one of them slammed the door shut and the others sprang at frank merriwell flung a book at the first one and it struck the fellows mask tearing it from his face the wellknown countenance of bruce browning was exposed goodevening browning cheerfully called the lively freshman as he darted behind the table i have been expecting a call from you grab him directed browning get hold of him frank was on the point of uttering a whistle but it was not required for the whistle that came from the lips of the disguised fellow had served as a signal to the painted braves there was a bang at the door which flew open as if assaulted by a catapault and into the room poured the disguised freshmen the indians leaped upon the masked sophomores and for a short time a very sharp struggle took place bruce browning did his best to escape from the room but three of the savages laid hold of him and he was finally subdued out of the house with them as soon as possible ordered frank come on two or three of you we must nail the hack and the fellows outside down to the door he led the way mrs harrington came out into the hall caught a glimpse of the painted faces uttered a wild shriek of terror and dodged back slamming the door all ready said frank as he prepared to fling open the front door all ready panted harry rattleton close behind him dont let anybody get away warned merriwell i will look after the driver go ahead creak open swung the door and out into the night leaped a youth who seemed to be hotly pursued by four painted and bloodthirstyappearing redskins the hack was standing exactly as frank expected it would be and he was on the box with the driver at two springs its all right he asserted weve got the fellow up there though he did kick up some a part of our gang was rigged up like indians and they nipped him all right its the divils own set ye shtudints are muttered the driver av ye hurry oill sthay to take him away but oill not remain here long fer its th cops will be down on us roight away well get away ahead of the cops dont fear that declared frank theyre bringing him downstairs now we had to take two or three others with him but well not bother with them long arrah th poor freshman said the driver oid not loike to be in his place this noight he was completely fooled thinking all the time that frank was one of the party he had brought there to capture the freshman as they rushed out frank had seen a fellow standing near the open door of the hack and that fellow had promptly taken to flight at sight of the indians two of whom pursued him hotly frank hoped they would be able to overtake the fugitive for if one of the party escaped he would report to the sophs who were bound to make a big hustle to rescue their captured comrades the disguised freshmen came downstairs bearing their captives who were swiftly thrust into the hack which was a big roomy oldfashioned affair as many of the freshmen as could do so piled inside and upon the hack and then frank gave the signal the driver whipped up his horse and away they went east rock said frank eh exclaimed the driver thots not pwhere ye wur goin in th firrust place we have changed the programme east rock is where we are bound for now all roight me by the triumphant freshmen felt like shouting and singing in jubilant mood indeed rattleton could not refrain from letting off steam as he called it and he gave one wild howl of triumph that made the streets echo umptyeight umptyeight break it off sharply commanded frank want to let the sophs know were up to something i dont care they might raise a rescue party and follow us but they wouldnt frop any chost i mean chop any frost with us pwhats thot came suspiciously from the driver an is it not softmores ye are yersilves of course we are returned harry instantly thin pwhat fer do ye yell fer umptyeight oh its a way we have dont mind it but keep on driving if you want to retain your scalp paleface we are mighty bad injuns the driver knew how to pick out the darkest and most deserted streets by the time the outskirts of the city were reached the freshmen were bubbling over frank merriwell improvised a stanza of a song and in a few moments the entire band caught the words and the tune as the hack rolled along toward east rock the freshmen sang we belong to good old umptyeight for shes a corker sure as fate sure as fate we have met the sophomores and theyre feeling awful sore so hurrah for good old umptyeight umptyeight begobs yere th quarest gang av softmores oi iver saw cried the driver an its not wan av yez oi remimber takin up to th freshmans boording house we have changed explained ned stover and its the first change i have seen for a week declared harry rattleton im waiting to hear from the governor howld on said the driver oi want to see the mon thot hired me he threatened to pull up but frank caught the whip and cracked it over the horses what do you want asked merriwell oi want me pay now frank knew well enough that the driver had received his pay in advance but he was beginning to suspect that the party that hired him had come to grief and so he was for exacting an extra payment from the victors look here driver said frank sternly i want your number pwhat fer in case it may appear later on that you have received money at two separate and distinct times for doing the same piece of work get oop yelled the driver its ownly foolin oi wur so the hack rolled on its way with the happy freshmen smoking and singing while the captive sophs ground their teeth and railed at the bitter luck inside the hack dismal jones most hideously bedaubed was smoking a cigarette and brandishing a wooden tomahawk at the same time while he sat astride of bruce browning who was on the floor this is a sad and solemn occasion paleface croaked dismal you have driven the noble red man from his ancestral halls which were the dim aisles of the mighty forests you have pushed him across the plains and you have tried to crowd him off the earth into the pacific ocean ugh you have pursued him with deadly firearms and still more deadly fire water you have been relentless in your hatred and your greed you have even been so unreasonable that whenever a poor red man has secured a few paleface scalps as trophies to hang in his wigwam you have taken your trusty rifles and gone forth with great fury and shot the poor indian full of hard bullets you have done heap many things that you would not have done if you had not done so but now poor shivering dog of a paleface the injured red man has arisen at last in his might if we are to perish we are to perish but before we perish we will enjoy the gentle pleasure of roasting a few white men at the stake ugh we have held a council of war we have excavated the hatchet we have smashed the pipe of peace to flinders or something of the sort and have struck out upon the war trail you act as if you had struck out growled one of the captives thats because he has had a few balls gurgled browning talk about being burned at the stake thats not torture after being obliged to inhale his breath my kingdom for some chloroform will somebody please hit me on the head with a trip hammer and put me out of my misery whither art thou bearing us great chief asked one of the captives we will bare you out yonder answered dismal at the stake you shall stand arrayed in the garments nature provided for you i dont care for tea murmured browning not even for repartee this is worse than being roasted at the stake muttered a soph in a corner it is severe punishment help cried dismal somebody take me out i cant get ahead of these miserable palefaces youll get a head if i ever find a good chance to give it to you declared the voice of puss parker from the darkness outside the painted savages were roaring farewell farewell farewell my fairy fay oh im off to louisiana for to see my susy anna singing pollywollywoodle all the day and thus the captured sophomores were borne in triumph out to east rock and as they were the ones who engaged the hack they paid for their own conveyance never before had anything like it happened at yale it was an event that was bound to go down in history as the most audacious and daring piece of work ever successfully carried through by freshmen in that college and frank merriwell was to receive the credit of being the originator of the scheme and the general who carried it out successfully chapter viii the roast at east rock a strange and remarkable scene was being enacted in the peaceable and civilized state of connecticut a scene which must have startled an accidental observer and caused him to fancy for a moment the hand of time had turned back two centuries near a bright fire that was burning on the ground squatted a band of hideouslypainted fellows who seemed to be redskins while close at hand bound and helpless were a number of palefaces plainly the captives of the savages that a council of war was taking place seemed apparent and still the savages seemed waiting for something at length out of the darkness advanced a tall wellbuilt warrior the trailing plumes of whose war bonnet reached quite to the ground if anything this fellow was more hideously painted than any of the others and there was an air of distinction about him that proclaimed him a great chief ugh he grunted i am here the savages arose and one of them said fellow warriors the mighty chief faleinhishoce i mean holeinhisface has arrived then a wild yell of greeting went up to the twinkling stars and every savage brandished a tomahawk scalping knife or some other kind of weapon brothers said holeinhisface i see that i am welcome in your midst as any uptodate country newspaper reporter would say you have received me with great йclat excuse my french i was educated abroad in new jersey go back to princeton cried one of the captives fellow warriors continued holeinhisface without noticing the interruption i am heap much proud to be with you on this momentous occasion yah yah yah yelled the savages and now the chief went on if you will proceed to squat on your haunches i will orate a trifle once more the redskins sat down on the ground and then the late arrival struck an attitude and began his oration warriors of my people why are we assembled together tonight because we couldnt assemble apart murmured a voice we are assembled to avenge our wrongs upon the hated paleface the chief declared it was long ago that the proud and haughty paleface got the bulge on the red man and we have not been in the game to any great extent since then every time we have held two pairs he has come in with one pair of sixes or a winchester and raked the pot he has not given us any kind of a show for our white alley whenever we seemed to be getting along fairly well and doing a little something he has wrung in a cold deck on us and then shot us full of air holes purely for the purpose of ventilation in case we objected warriors we have grown tired of being soaked in the neck thats right nodded a savage unless we are soaked in the neck with fire water at last shouted the orator at last we have arisen in our wrath and our war paint and we are out for scalps we have decided that the joy of the red man is fleeting tonight a flush mantles your dark cheeks but tomorrow it will be a bobtail flush what have we to live for but vengeance on the white man and a little booze now and then nothing our squaws once were beautiful as the wild flowers of the prairie but now the prize beauty of our tribe is malt extract maria whose nose is out of joint whose eyes are skewed whose teeth are covered with finecut tobacco and who lost one of her ears last week by accidentally getting it into the mouth of her husband my brothers we are not built to weep it is not the way of the noble red man a few more summers and we will be no more we will have kicked the stuffing out of the bucket and wended our way up the golden stair but before we cough up the ghost it behooves us to strike one last blow at the hated paleface when we get a chance at a paleface it is our duty to do him and do him bad are you on we have been successful in capturing a few of our hated foes and they are bound and helpless near at hand shall they be fricasseed broiled fried or made into a potpie that is the question before the meeting and i am ready to listen to others let us hear from squinteyed sausageface it doesnt make a dit of bifference i mean a bit of difference to me how i have my paleface cooked said the one indicated as squinteyed sausageface perhaps it would be well enough to cook them at the stake i think that would be the proper mode gravely declared another warrior for i have heard that they boast they are hot stuff they should not boast in vain warriors said holeinhisface you have heard what have you to say so mote it be came solemnly from one yah yah yah yelled the others that settles it as the sugar remarked to the egg dropped into the coffee prepare the torture stakes there was a great bustle and in a short time the stakes were prepared and driven into the ground one of the savages hammering them down with a huge stick of wood then the captives were bound to the stakes and a lot of brush was brought and piled about their feet some of the sophs actually looked scared but browning kept up a continual fire of sarcastic remarks ugh grunted holeinhisface this paleface talks heap much remove his outer garments so the fire may reach his flesh without delay then browning was held and his clothes were stripped off till he stood in his under garments barefooted bareheaded and still defiant oh say he muttered wont there be an awful hour of reckoning merriwell will regret the day he came to yale at this holeinhisface laughed heartily and browning cried oh i know you merriwell you cant fool me though you have got the best makeup of them all when everything was ready one of the savages actually touched a match to the various piles of brush about the feet of the unfortunate sophomores as the tiny flames leaped up the painted band joined in a wild war dance about the stakes flourishing their weapons and whooping as if they were real indians some of their postures and steps were exact imitations of the poses and steps taken by savages in a war dance say confound you fool freshmen howled one of the captives this fire is getting hot do you really mean to roast us yah yah yah hough hough hough round and round the stake circled the disguised freshmen and the fire kept getting higher and higher puss parker fell to coughing violently having sucked down a large quantity of smoke some of the others raved and some begged but still the wild dance went on merciful cats gasped tad horner i believe they actually mean to roast us sure as fate agreed another they wont think to put out the fires till we are well cooked if they do then this is awful gurgled parker browning cant you do something well i hardly think so confessed the king of the sophomores but i will do something if i ever get out of this alive you hear me murmur say cried tad horner i cant stand this much longer the fire is beginning to roast me its getting warm confessed parker but it seems to keep burning around the outside edge keep cool advised browning whats that yelled horner who said keep cool oh say thats too much just look at the wood directed the king of the sophomores you will notice that all the wood about our feet is water soaked and theres only a little dry wood out around the edges thats all that is burning this they soon saw was true and it gave them great relief for it had begun to seem that the crazy freshmen actually meant to roast them at the very moment when the uproar was at its height there came a sudden loud cry like a signal and out of the darkness rushed at least twenty lads they were sophomores who had somehow followed them out there to east rock having been aroused and told of the capture of browning and his mates by the soph who escaped one fellow on a bicycle had followed them till he felt sure of their destination and then he had turned back and told the others who hastily secured teams and flew to the rescue umptyseven umptyseven rah rah rah yelled the rescuers as they charged upon the freshmen umptyeight umptyeight rah rah rah howled the painted lads in return then for a few moments there was a pitched battle the battle did not last long for the freshmen saw they were outnumbered and at a signal from their leader they broke away and took to their heels by rare good luck every man was able to get away for not knowing anything about the watersoaked wood piled about the feet of the captives the rescuers nearly all stopped to scatter the burning brush oh say grated browning as he was released but this means gore and bloodshed well never rest till we have squared for this roast and we will square with interest merriwells life will be one long lingering torture from this night onward whats all this racket and cheering asked one of the rescuers listen fellows by jove it seems to come from the place where we left our carriages thats what it does and its the freshman yell cried another come on fellows if we dont get a move on we may have to walk back they started on a run but when they arrived at the place where the teams had been left not a team was there the freshmen had captured the teams drivers and all together with the hack and far along the road toward the city could be heard a cheering singing crowd as the disgusted and furious sophs stood and listened the singing and cheering grew fainter and fainter fellows said chop harding i am sorry to leave yale but i am certain to be hanged for murder after this whenever i see a freshman i shall kill him instantly it was a doleful and weary crowd of sophs that came filing back into town and sneaked to their rooms that night of course the sophs would have given a great deal could they have kept the story quiet but on the following morning it seemed that every student in the college knew all about it the juniors laughed and chaffed the sophomores who were sullen and sulky and who muttered much about getting even the freshmen were jubilant they were on top for the time and they all knew they might not have long to crow so they did all the crowing they could in a short time and still nobody seemed to know just who was concerned in the affair save that merriwell and browning must have been when browning was questioned he was so blankly ignorant of everything that it seemed as if he had slept through the whole affair he had a way of turning every question off with another question and it was soon discovered that no information could be obtained from him still it was passed from lip to lip that the great and nighty king had been found by the rescuers stripped to his underclothes and tied to a stake while the smoke arose thickly around him and nearly choked him some one suggested that brownings complexion seemed to have changed in a remarkable manner and then the students fell to asking him if he really enjoyed a smoke browning seemed subdued but those who knew him best were telling everybody to hold on and see what would happen this is just the beginning they said however several days passed and still nothing occurred it began to look as if the sophs had decided that they were outgeneraled and were willing to let the matter drop frank merriwell was not deceived he knew the sophs were keeping still in order to deceive the freshmen into a belief that there was no danger and he continued to warn all his friends to watch out in the meantime diamond had recovered and was in evidence among the freshmen it was said that he went down to billys a favorite freshman resort and spent money liberally there almost every night the result of this soon became apparent diamond was surrounded by a crowd of hangerson who seemed to regard him as a leader he was working for popularity and he was obtaining it in a certain way now frank merriwell was no less generous than jack diamond but he would not drink liquor of any kind he would not touch beer it did not take him long to discover that this peculiarity caused many of the students to regard him with scorn he was called the good templar and was often derisively addressed as worthy chief the very ones who were first to apply the name in derision afterward came to call him worthy chief in sincere admiration frank went around to billys occasionally and although he would not drink he treated frequently paying for anything his companions wanted to take from beer to champagne one evening frank harry and dismal jones went into billys and found diamond and a large crowd there jack had been drinking something stronger than lemonade and he was holding forth to a crowd of eager listeners one look at diamonds flushed face did merriwell take and then he knew the fellow was open for anything the high color in the cheeks of the virginian was a danger signal merriwell and his two friends ordered drinks frank taking ginger ale harry and jones lighted cigarettes frank examined the pictures around the walls there were ballet dancers who were standing on one toe famous trotters painted pictures of celebrated fighting cocks hunters in red coats leaping fivebarred fences and so forth as he looked over the pictures he became aware that diamond was saying something that was intended for his ears southerners never fight with their fists the virginian declared they consider it brutal and beastly and so they do not learn the socalled art they are able to fight with some other weapons though there is a man in this college who is trying to be a high cock of the walk but he will never succeed till he shows his right by meeting me face to face with weapons of which i have knowledge i have met him with his weapons and if he is not a coward he will give me a show but i think he is a coward and a sneak and i that was more than frank could stand he did not pause to think that diamond had been drinking and was utterly reckless but he whirled and advanced till he stood squarely in front of the virginian i presume mr diamond that you are referring to me he said coldly and steadily although he could feel the hot blood leaping in his veins diamond looked up insolently inhaled a whiff of his cigarette and then deliberately blew the smoke toward frank yes sir he said i presume i did refer to you what are you going to do about it you called me a coward and a sneak exactly sir if i had not already left the marks of my knuckles on you i would slap your face as it is i will simply pull your nose and frank did so giving diamonds nose a sharp tweak up to his feet leaped the virginian his face white with wrath he picked up a glass of champagne as he arose and then he dashed it into franks face in a twinkling friends were between them keeping them apart chapter ix the duel merriwell smiled and wiped the champagne from his face with a white silk handkerchief the proprietor bustled in and threatened diamond quivered with excitement there will be no further trouble here calmly said frank this matter must be settled between us i could see that plainly enough it wan just as well to bring it to a head at once lunder and thightning i mean thunder and lightning panted rattleton he wont fight you again with his fists i do not expect him to youll have to fight with rapiers sure said another merriwell youre a fool thank you you have fallen into his trap he was making that talk to drive you to do just what you did well he may congratulate himself on his success blamed if i understand you you seem cool enough and still you act as if you actually meant to meet him with deadly weapons i shall meet him with any kind of weapons he may name roll ditson came forward of course you understand that i have no feeling merry old man he said but diamond has chosen me as his second once more and so i cant refuse to serve him it is a most unfortunate affair but he insists that you fight him with rapiers very well i agree to that arrange the time and place with my second mr rattleton frank sat down picked up an illustrated paper and seemed deeply interested in the pictures ditson drew rattleton aside my principal said he swelling with importance demands that this meeting take place at once great scott exploded harry i object to this sort of business it is outrageous if one of them should be seriously wounded what excuse can be made well find some excuse that will go but what if one of them should be killed i hardly think anything as serious as that will occur but should it there would be an investigation and expulsion and disgrace if nothing worse would overtake us oh well if you are afraid just go back and tell mr merriwell to apologize here and now and i think mr diamond will let him off harry looked at merriwell and then shook his head hell never do that he said hoarsely well have to arrange this duel there is no other way for it between the ages of sixteen and twentythree blood runs hot and swift in the veins of a youth it is then that he will do many wild and reckless things things which will cause him to stand appalled when he considers them in after years frank believed that in order to retain his own self respect and the respect of his comrades he must meet diamond and give him satisfaction in any manner he might designate but there was another reason why frank was so willing to meet the virginian merriwell was an expert fencer at fardale he had been the champion of the school and he had taken some lessons while traveling he had thoroughly studied the trick of disarming his adversary a trick which is known to every french fencing master but is thought little of by them he believed that he could repeatedly disarm diamond his adventures in various parts of the world had made him somewhat less cautious than he naturally would have been and so he trusted everything to his ability to get the best of the virginian roland ditson longed to force merriwell to squeal he did not fancy frank knew anything of fencing and he thought merriwell would soon lose his nerve when he saw himself toyed with by diamond and diamond had promised not to seriously wound the fellow he hated the meeting was arranged as quietly as possible and the freshmen who were to witness it slipped out of billys by twos and threes and strode away thirty minutes later in a small stuffy room two lads with their coats and vests off and their sleeves turned back faced each other rapiers in hand ready gentlemen called ditson they made ready on guard the position was assumed then came the command that set them at it in less than twenty seconds the spectators who kept back as well as possible had seen something they never beheld before they saw two beardless lads fighting with deadly weapons and using skill that was marvelous it took jack diamond far less than twenty seconds to discover that frank merriwell was a swordsman of astonishing skill he had expected to toy with the northerner but he found himself engaged with one who met every stroke like a professional a great feeling of relief came over harry rattleton whee jiz he muttered merry is a cooler at it i believe hes diamonds match with diamond astonishment gave way to fury was it possible that this fellow was to get the best of him at everything he fought savagely and ditson turned white as a ghost when he saw the virginian making mad thrusts at the breast of the lad he hated hes forgotten his promise hes forgotten huskily whispered ditson what if he should run merriwell through the body then came a cry of anger from diamond and a cry of surprise and relief from the spectators frank merriwell with that peculiar twisting movement of his wrist had torn the rapier from the virginians hand the blade fell clanging to the floor and merriwell stepped back with the point of his rapier lowered snarling savagely diamond made a catlike spring and snatched up the weapon he had lost on guard he cried madly the end is not yet ill kill you or youll kill me there was a clash of steel and then the fight was on with more fury than before diamond was utterly reckless he left a dozen openings where frank could have run him through but merriwell was working to repeat the trick of a few seconds before the frightened spectators were beginning to think of intervening when once again diamond was disarmed at the same moment there came a heavy knocking at the door one fellow who had been on guard ran in from a corridor and cried its the faculty somebody has given them wind of this here here called a freshman follow me they did so and he led them to a back window out of which they clambered diamond was the last to get out and just as he touched the ground somebody came around the corner and grabbed him i have one of them shouted a voice which he recognized as belonging to one of the faculty he struggled to break away but could not then somebody dashed back to his side caught hold of him and with wonderful strength tore him from the grasp of the man run panted frank merriwells voice in his ear and they ran away together and in a short while were safe in their rooms it turned out that it was not the faculty that had tried to get in where the duel was taking place but some of the sophs at the time he turned back to rescue diamond however frank had believed the virginian was in the grasp of one of the professors merriwell was regarded as more of a wonder than ever when it became generally known that he had twice disarmed the virginian in a duel with rapiers or a fencing contest as the matter was openly spoken of by those who discussed it but bruce browning king of sophomores was awaiting an opportunity to get at frank chapter x at moreys say fellows this thing must stop puss parker banged his fist down upon the table as he made this emphatic declaration the blow causing the partly emptied glass of ale to dance and vibrate aw say yawned willis paulding you want to be a little cawful or you will slop the good stuff dont yer know willis affected a drawl had his clothes made in london and considered himself deucedly english although he sometimes forgot himself for a short time and dropped his mannerisms tad horner gave paulding a look of scorn come off your perch paul he invited you give me severe pains get onto yourself i dont wonder parker is excited over this matter who wouldnt be excited exclaimed puss these confounded freshmen have overthrown all the established customs of the college they have been running things with a high hand why they have really been cocks of the walk ever since that little affair out at east rock sh cautioned punch swallows a lad with fiery red hair dont speak of that for the love of goodness just think of a gang of sophs being captured by freshmen disguised as indians taken out into the country tied to stakes and nearly roasted while the freshmen dance a gleeful cancan around them its awful the mere thought of it gives me nervous prostration it was two weeks after the duel and the five sophomores had gathered in the little back room at moreys they looked at each other and were silent but their silence was very suggestive by jawve drawled paulding it is awful i wasnt in the crowd if i had been youd been roasted like the rest of us cut in parker but id made it warm faw some of the blooming cads havent we been doing our level best to make it warm for them cried horner but no matter what we do they see us and go us one better it all comes from merriwell asserted swallows hes king of the freshmen the same as browning is king of the sophomores and hes a terror nodded horner he can put up more jokes than one and they say he can fight they say why didnt you see him do diamond the fresh from virginia oh no i remember you were not with us that night yes he can fight and he doesnt seem to be easily scared i think he is a blawsted upstart said paulding lazily puffing at his cigarette he needs to be called down dont yer know some time when he is upstairs call him down suggested horner fists are not the only things that fellows can fight with said parker the matter has been kept quiet but it is said to be a fact that diamond forced him into a duel with rapiers and he disarmed the southerner twice having him completely at his mercy each time and diamond prides himself on being an expert with that kind of weapon nodded horner why doesnt browning do something asked paulding it is outrageous faw a lot of freshies to run things this way browning is in training said parker in training what faw why he is so lazy hes training to get some of the flesh off him it is my opinion that somebody must check merriwells wild career and he is getting in condition to do it you know that browning was one of the hardest men who ever entered yale he is a natural athlete but hes lazy and he has allowed himself to become soft why he knocked out kid lajoie the professional in a hardglove contest of three rounds lajoie was easy fruit for him i fancy he means to go up against this fresh duck merriwell and do him thats the only thing that will pull merriwell off his perch he doesnt mind being hazed doesnt mind it shouted horner confound him he always manages to turn the tables in some way and hazes the parties who try to haze him two youths came in from the front room hey browning hello king come join us you too emery to the other fellow whatll you have browning browning accepted a seat at the table but waved his hand languidly as he declined to drink im not taking anything now he said oh but you must have some ale old man excuse me gentlemen i tell you squarely that i am not taking anything just now by and by i will be with you again emery will go you one thats what he came in for thats right declared brownings companion i was out stargazing last night looked at the longhandled dipper a long time and it gave me an awful thirst ive had it with me all day yes mines ale so another round was ordered horner passed around the cigarettes and browning declined them the others lighted up fresh ones say broke out emery suddenly do you know that fresh ditson gives me that tired feeling tad horner grinned hes no good said tad he is crooked and hes a toucher touched me for a v once and i am looking for that fiver yet that was two years ago before i came here i knew him then he tried to touch us for a drink as we came along said browning i took him in here once but ive been sorry ever since he said he had his thirst with him just now i told him to go sit on the fence and let the wind blow him off and he is a big bluff asserted emery the other day he was telling how he once sat at the table with kings and queens i told him that i had and with jacks and ten spots here comes the amber my i wont do a thing to it the waiter placed the glasses of ale before them and emery eagerly grasped his heres more tomorrow was his toast and he seemed to toss it off at a single swallow by jawve drawled paulding you must be thirsty i am have been all day as i said before it was hard stuff last night and we went the rounds my head needed hooping when i arose from my downy couch this morning well you shouldnt have gotten intoxicated in the first place said parker i didnt it was in the last place if id gone home before we struck that joint id been all right wow whooped tad horner you seem full of em oh i am ive been eating nothing but red pepper lately and im hot stuff lets have another one all around more ale was ordered your neck must be dry enough to squeak old man said parker addressing browning it doesnt seem natural for you to go thirsty wont you have just one not one smiled bruce lazily ive got too much flesh on me now and im trying to get some of it off going to try for the football team or what nothing of that sort but i have a reason we know you do sure what is it youre laying for merriwell and you mean to do him i am right am i not the king of the sophomores smiled in a lazy way but did not reply that settles it laughed parker i knew i was right well somebody must curry that young colt down and it must be done right away browning showed sudden animation he looked around at the faces of his companions and then said this crowd is straight and i am going to make a few remarks right here and now i feel just like it drive ahead go on we are listening i am not inclined to talk this matter over publicly said bruce but i will say that the time is ripe to get after these confounded freshmen and we must do it i want to tell you what i found this morning open wide your ears and listen to this his companions were quite prepared to listen you know i am getting up every morning and taking a stiff walk i turn out at daybreak good gracious gasped tad horner how do you do it well ive got one of those electric alarm clocks and i put it just as far away from my bed as possible why is that so i wont get hold of it and smash thunder out of the thing when it gets to going you know it wont stop its racket till somebody stops it or it is run down and it takes an hour for it to run down after it starts in to ring you up by jawve drawled paulding i hawdly think id like to have one of the blooming things in my room i dont like to have one in my room but it is absolutely necessary that i do hartwick my roommate admires it the listeners laughed i should think he might said puss parker hes got a temper with an edge like a coldchisel oh yes he admires it ive got so i believe i should sleep right through the racket but he kicks me out of bed and howls for me to smother the thing so you see i am bound to get up at the proper time once i am out of bed i stay up the first morning after i bought the clock the thing went off just as it was beginning to break day i got up and stopped it and then went back to bed hartwick growled but we both went to sleep i had been snoozing about five minutes when the clock broke loose once more hartwick was mad you bet i opened my eyes just in time to see him sit up in bed with one of his shoes in his hand whiz before i could stop him he flung the shoe at the clock i made a wild grab just as he did so struck his arm and disconcerted his aim the shoe flew off sideways and smashed a mirror hartwick said several things then i got up and stopped the clock again i dressed and went out for my walk leaving hartwick in bed sleeping sweetly when i came back i found him about half dressed jumping wildly up and down in the middle of the bed upon which was heaped all the bedclothes all of hartwicks clothes except those he had on all of mine except those i was wearing and as i appeared he shrieked for me to tear down the window shades and pass them to him quick whats the matter i gasped are you mad yes i am mad he howled tearing his hair i am so blamed mad that i dont know where i am at but whats the matter matter matter hear it hear the daddly thing it has driven me to the verge of insanity i tried to stop it but i couldnt find how it works and now i am trying to stifle it hear it oh bring me a club bring me something deadly bring me a gun and i will shoot it full of holes then i found that i could hear my clock merrily rattling away under that heap of clothes it seemed to be defying hartwick or laughing at him i got him off the bed pawed around till i found the clock between the mattresses and then stopped it hartwick offered me three times what it was worth if id let him use his baseball bat on it i told him it seemed to be a very willing and industrious alarm clock and it was mine i warned him to injure it at his peril since then i have learned how to stop it so it will stay stopped but it barely commences to rattle at daybreak when i feel hartwicks feet strike me in the small of the back and i land sprawling on the floor that explains how i succeed in getting up at daybreak you started in to tell us what you found this morning said punch swallows to browning lighting a fresh cigarette so i did and the alarm clock ran me off the trail well i got up this morning as usual when hartwick kicked me out to stop the clock i went out for my walk and crossed the campus what do you think i found a diamond ring well all have ale oh no tad it wasnt a diamond ring i noticed something stuck up on one of the trees it was a big sheet of paper and on it was skillfully lettered these words bruce browning will wear a new set of false teeth to chapel tomorrow morning browning stopped and looked around he was very proud of his even regular white teeth they were so perfect that they might be taken for store teeth at first glance but a second look would show they were natural the sophs laughed and bruce looked indignant that caused me to look still further he went on and i soon found another sheet upon another tree this is what i read conundrum why is king browning a great electrician because all his clothes are charged by that time i felt like murdering somebody i did take a morning walk but it was in search of more stuff of the same order i found it everywhere in the vicinity of the college and some of the stuff was simply awful it made me shudder i knew who was back of it all merriwell put up the job but you outwitted him by getting around in time to tear down everything he had put up you matched him that time by accident but i must more than match him he must be suppressed thats right thats right cried the boys in chorus i know he put the advertisement for black and white cats and yellow dogs in the papers my name was signed to it and more than two hundred black and white cats and yellow dogs were brought me by parties anxious to sell them at any price one time there were seven women with cats in my room when two men came up leading dogs the first woman had managed to get into the room and while i was arguing with her trying to convince her that i did not want her blamed old cat the others found their way in they opened on me altogether hartwick shut himself in the clothespress and i could hear him laughing and gasping for breath i was nearly crazy when the men sauntered in with the dogs in tow oh say browning fell over limply in his chair as if the memory of what followed was too much for him you have had a real warm time of it grinned swallows warm warm my boy it was warm two of the women were showing me their cats the dogs saw the cats the cats saw the dogs one of the cats made a flying leap for a dog the other fled and the other dog pursued the seven women shrieked all together and the two men swore and tried to catch the dogs the other cats escaped from the baskets in which they were confined warm say the king of the sophomores mopped his face with his handkerchief he seemed on the verge of utter collapse the listening lads could not entirely restrain their laughter the picture browning presented and the incident he was relating were altogether too ludicrous talk about rackets he wearily continued we had one then and there the cats yowled and the dogs howled the women fell over each other and screamed blue murder the men chased the dogs and roared blue blazes and the wind blew hard one of the cats alighted on an old ladys head the cats mistress grabbed her and took her away the cat had socked her claws into the old ladys wig and it came off leaving her almost as bare as a billiard ball oh marmer two of the cats fell to tearing the fur out of each other some of them walked on the ceiling like flies in their endeavors to get away from the dogs one of them pounced on a dogs back and rode him around the room as if she were a circus performer the other dog chased a cat under the bed and they were having it there oh they didnt do a thing not a thing after a while one of the men captured one of the dogs and dragged him toward the door the other man saw him and made a rush for him drop that dawg he yelled its my dawg the other man yelled back and then the other man howled youre another its my dawg right away after that there was trouble between the owners of the dogs they tried to hurt each other and they succeeded very well one of them had both eyes blacked while the other lost two teeth had his lips split and his nose knocked out of plumb but they smashed the stuffing out of the furniture while they were doing it i climbed up on something in one corner and did my best to cheer them on i sincerely hoped both would be killed the dogs seemed to feel it their duty to enter into the spirit of the occasion and they chewed each other more or less then the police came in i came near landing in the station house along with the two men who were fighting but they concluded not to pinch me the women departed after having once more expressed their opinion all around concerning me when they were gone hartwick came out of the clothespress we sat down amid the ruins and said over some words that will not bear repetition thats the whole of the catanddog story ive never been able to prove that merriwell put the advertisement into the paper but it is all settled in my mind it was directly after this that i went into training some of the sophs laughed and some showed indignation it was a very nawsty thing to do declared paulding i cant help laughing over it chuckled tad horner but of course you ought to get back at merriwell well i shall do my best i dont think you need to train to do that trick said punch swallows a man who can knock out kid lajoie ought to polish off a freshman in a minute you havent seen merriwell fight no i have he is clever he is a corker of course i believe i can do him but i want to do him easy and that is why i am training another party of sophomores came in it is harrison and his crowd said parker and im blowed if they havent got roll ditson with them that cad of a freshman has succeeded in getting in here again ditson hates merriwell dont yer know said paulding he pretends to be friendly with merry but hes ready to do him any time chapter xi lambda chi ditson had fawned around browning a great deal since entering college with the result that the king of the sophomores came to entertain a feeling of absolute disgust for the fellow the very sight of ditson made the king feel as if he would enjoy giving him a good polishing off but bruce was no bully although he was a leader of the sophomores he had proved his ability to fight when it was necessary but no one could say that he ever showed any inclination to do bodily harm to one who was weak and peaceable during his freshman year browning had originated any number of wild projects for sport and he had always succeeded in carrying them through successfully thus it came about that he was called the king and his companions continued to call him that when he became a sophomore but now there was a man in college who had fairly outwitted browning on several occasions and so it came about that the king was aroused against frank merriwell browning keenly felt the sting of being beaten at his own game and he was obliged to confess to himself that merriwell had accomplished the trick but our hero was not inclined to let bruce alone he did not wait for the king to become aggressive he set about keeping bruce in hot water and he succeeded very well the other freshmen stimulated by the example of one who was distinctly a leader among them carried on such an energetic campaign against the sophomores that the latter found themselves almost continually on the defensive such a thing had never before been known at yale and the sophs were highly indignant they informed the freshmen that they were altogether too fresh they said the freshmen were breaking a timehonored custom and it must be stopped but the triumphant freshmen kept right on laughing in the faces of their angry foes it was expected that browning would not delay about getting back at merriwell and his friends and the admirers of the king were surprised when he seemed to remain inactive then it came out that bruce was in training and it was said that he was putting himself in condition to give merriwell the worst licking of his life frank heard about it but he did not seem disturbed in the least whenever any one spoke to him about it he merely smiled among the freshmen there were some who believed merriwell able to hold his own against browning they were harry rattleton jack diamond and one or two more diamond and merriwell were not friendly but they had ceased to be open enemies for the time being the hatchet was buried and there was peace between them but the two did not become friends merriwell continued to assert that diamond had sand and diamond was ready to back his judgment in saying that merriwell was a match for any man in yale moreys was a sophomore resort juniors and seniors patronized the place but a freshman was not allowed there unless invited to accompany some of the regular frequenters of the place ditson was ambitious he was not satisfied to associate with those of his own class but he wanted it thought he was such a fine fellow that the sophomores picked him up for his company thus it happened that he had succeeded in getting into moreys several times but he was killing his own chances of ever having any popularity although he did not know it browning was angry when he saw the fellow come in he called one of the sophs over and said say what are you bringing it in here again for my boy its been here too many times already who ditson sure were working him working him hes working you for the drinks thats all right hes telling us what he knows about merriwell if there is anything in that fellows history that we can use as a sore spot we may be able to suppress him all right scowled browning go ahead and pump the crooked sneak but dont swallow his lies i dont believe he knows anything at all about merriwell a few minutes later the soph returned and said i dont think he knows much about him myself but he says hes down at billys now or was an hour ago we might get a chance to lambda chi him a little browning seemed to arouse himself thats right he agreed well go down to billys the party filed out of moreys and browning took the lead ditson went along with them as if he was a sophomore he seemed to feel himself highly honored but browning had hard work to choke back his absolute contempt for the fellow as they went along it was arranged that ditson should go into billys and see if merriwell was there one of the sophomores should accompany him if merriwell was there and he should come out alone or in company with one or two others he was to be captured browning had a plan that should be carried out if the capture was made ditson seemed to think he was doing something very smart and cunning in betraying a fellow freshman into the hands of the sophomores he fancied he was making himself solid with brownings crowd billys was reached and one of the sophs went in with ditson while the others kept out of sight nearby after a little the soph came out and reported that merriwell and rattleton were in there he had treated the house but merriwell had absolutely declined to take anything oh yes nodded browning they say he never drinks thats how he keeps himself in such fine condition all the time he will not smoke either and he takes his exercise regularly he is really a remarkable freshie arrangements were then made that a cab should be brought to the corner near billys where the driver should remain apparently waiting for somebody it was known to be quite useless to attempt to decoy merriwell out so dependence must be placed on chance if he came out with no more than one or two companions his name was mud according to the assembled sophs arrangements were made to bind handkerchiefs over their faces to the eyes so they would be partly disguised some of them turned their coats wrong side out and some resorted to other means of disguising themselves then they waited patiently it was not so very long before ditson came out in a breathless hurry he signaled and they called him as he hastened up he panted merriwell is coming right out fellows be ready for him the sophomores knew which way frank was likely to go after leaving billys and they lay in wait at a convenient spot is he alone eagerly asked puss parker no who is with him rattleton any others not likely good take a tumble to yourself and skip ditson did so now fellows hurriedly said browning be ready for a struggle remember that merriwell is a scrapper and he is likely to resist we must take him completely by surprise get back and lay quiet till i give the signal they did as directed and as they were in a dark corner there was not much danger that they would be seen till they were ready to light on their game footsteps were heard here he comes browning peered out and two figures were seen approaching how many anxiously whispered tad horner quivering with anxiety two they are easy ready for the rush the sophomores crouched like savage warriors in ambush merriwells peculiar pleasant laugh was heard as the two unsuspecting freshmen approached rattleton was talking and as usual he was twisting his expression in his haste to say the things which flashed through his head it doesnt make a dit of bifference if we havent proved anything against him i say ditson cant be trusted hes got a mooked crug i mean a crooked mug oh dont be too hard on the fellow till you know something for sure advised merriwell i will confess that i do not like him but there was a sudden rush of dark figures out of the shadows and the two freshmen were clutched coats were flung over their heads and they were crashed to the ground although taken by surprise both lads struggled in the suddenness of the rush browning had made a mistake and flung himself on rattleton while he had intended to grasp merriwell the coat being cast over the head of the lad prevented him from discovering his mistake punch swallows and andy emery were devoting themselves to merriwell and it was their first impression that they had tackled rattleton for an instant it seemed that the trick had worked to perfection and the freshmen had been made captives easily then came a surprise swallows and emery were unable to hold their man down he tore off the smothering coat and rose with them despite all they could do they cried out for help give us a hand fellows hes like an eel quick some of the sophs had been unable to render much assistance and they now did their best to aid swallows and emery in their haste to do something they seemed to get in the way of each other well i dont know i dont know laughed a familiar voice and the freshman gave swallows a snap that lifted him off his feet and cast him into the stomach of another fellow who received such a blow from punchs head that the wind was knocked out of him in a moment well have to see about this said the freshman as he cracked emery on the jaw and broke his hold great smoke its merriwell gurgled emery as he reeled back onto him fellows urged a soph and frank suddenly found six or seven of the crowd were at him just how he did it no one could tell but he broke straight through the crowd and in another moment was rushing back toward billys shouting lambda chi lambda chi it was useless to try to follow him as all quickly saw in the meantime rattleton had been cornered and the disappointed sophs resolved to escape with him they lifted him and made a rush for the cab he was bundled in and away went the cab frank rushed into billys and gave the alarm he was out again in a very few seconds with a crowd of excited freshmen at his heels but when they came to look for the sophomores and rattleton they found nothing confound it exclaimed frank in dismay how could they get him away so quick i cant understand it the freshmen searched but they found nothing to reward them rattleton was in the toils of the enemy and the wouldbe rescuers were given no opportunity to rescue him then merriwell blamed himself for leaving his roommate at all but billys had been so near and his chance with his many assailants had seemed so slim that he had done what seemed the right thing to do on the spur of the moment he had not fancied that the sophomores would be able to get harry away before he could arouse the freshmen and bring them to the rescue poor harry i wonder what they will do with him frank speculated oh they wont do a thing with him gurgled bandy robinson how did it happen anyway asked roland ditson who had joined the freshmen after the affair was over he tried to appear innocent and filled with wonder and curiosity but his unpopularity was apparent from the fact that nobody paid enough attention to him to answer his question frank however found it necessary to tell his companions all about the assault and ditson pretended to listen with interest as if he had known nothing of the affair the freshmen went back to billys and held a council it was decided to divide into squads and make an attempt to find out where harry had been taken this was done but it proved without result and not far from midnight all the freshmen who had been there at the time of the capture and many others were again gathered at billys they were quite excited over the affair and it seemed that the beer they had absorbed had gone to the heads of some of them in the midst of an excited discussion the door burst open and a most grotesquelooking figure staggered into the room it was a person who was stripped to the waist and painted and adorned like a redskin his face striped with red and white and yellow his hair stuck full of feathers and his body decorated with what seemed to be tattooing bive me a gear i mean give me a beer gasped that fantastic individual i am nearly dead its rattleton shouted the freshmen they crowded around him well say you are a bird cried lucy little whose right name was lewis little a regular bird of paradise chuckled bandy robinson where are those fellows demanded frank merriwell where did they leave you tell me old man at the door faintly replied rattleton as he reached for a mug of beer which some one held toward him they took me right up to the door and made me come in here out shouted frank out and after them capture one of them if possible we want to even this thing up out they rushed but once more the crafty sophomores had vanished and not one of them was to be found the freshmen went back and listened to harrys story he told how he had been blindfolded and taken somewhere he did not know where there they had kept him while his friends were searching when there was no danger that the freshmen would discover them they set out to have fun with rattleton say merry old man said harry i know browning was the leader of this job although he was disguised they seemed to feel pretty bad because you got away they got twisted took me for you at first and by the time they discovered their mistake you were knocking them around like tenpins one chap insists you broke his jaw well i am glad i did that much i didnt mean to leave you harry billys was so near i thought i could get the boys out and rescue you before they could carry you off i couldnt rescue you alone so i ran here to stir up the fellows that was right i was glad you got away they were laying for you they told me so well come back and well wash this stuff off you i dont know as you can do it eh why not they said it was put on to stay a while they told me we were so fond of playing the noble red mans part that they would fix me so i could play it for a week or two some of them advised me to use sand to scrub myself with if i hoped to get the paint off oh that must be all a bluff it will come off easy enough if a little cocoa butter is used on it here somebody run out to a drug store and get some cocoa butter after they had worked about fifteen minutes they looked at each other in dismay for they had scarcely been able to start the paint and it become plain that cocoa butter soap and water would not take it off didnt i tell you murmured harry sorrowfully im done for ill never be able to get it off ill have to go out west and live with the sioux if i do ill take along the scalps of a few sophomores they continued to work on him for nearly an hour but were unable to get off more than a certain portion of the paint harry was still grotesquely decorated when the boys arrived at the conclusion that further scrubbing with the materials at hand was useless then frank went out and rang up a druggist who had gone to bed for it was after midnight he told the man the sort of scrape his friend was in and offered the druggist inducements to give him something to remove the paint the druggist said it could not be paint but must be some sort of staining and he gave frank a preparation frank went back and tried the stuff on harry it removed a certain amount of the stain but did not remove it all at last being thoroughly worn out rattleton said ill give it up for tonight fellows perhaps ill be able to get the rest off in the morning ill poultice my face and neck but youll have to watch out frank they say they will use you worse than this when they get hold of you for the time the sophomores seemed to have the best of the game chapter xii freshman against sophomore on the following morning a large piece of cardboard swung from the door of merriwell and rattletons room in mrs harringtons boarding house on the cardboard was this inscription goodmorning have you used soap harry was up at an early hour industriously scrubbing away he succeeded fairly well but despite his utmost efforts the coloring refused to come off entirely and it was absolutely necessary that he should attend chapel on their way to chapel frank and harry came face to face with professor such who peered at them sharply and said goodmorning gentlemen goodmorning professor returned the boys harry tried to keep behind frank so that his face would not be noticed the professor was nearsighted but he immediately noted rattletons queer actions and he placed himself in front of the boys adjusting his spectacles hang his curiosity muttered harry in disgust eh said the professor scratching his chin with one finger and peering keenly at harry did you speak sir yes sir i mean no sir spluttered harry while frank stepped aside and stood laughing silently to himself i thought you did er whats the matter with your face young man thats the result of my last attack of chilblains said harry desperately they hent to my wed i mean they went to my head eh the professor seemed to doubt if he had heard correctly while merriwell nearly exploded rattleton looked frightened when he came to think what he had said he felt like taking to his heels and running for his life chilblains sir came severely from professor such sir sir do not attempt to be facetious with me you will regret it if you do cold sweat started out on harrys forehead and he looked appealingly toward his companion but frank had turned away to conceal his merriment i i dont think i i understood your your question stammered harry im a little heard of haring i mean hard of hearing i asked you what was the matter with your face sir oh my face ha ha he he i thought you said something about my pace because i was walking so slowly that made me fancy you were interested to know what ails my feet excuse me i beg your pardon professor hum coughed the professor again scratching his chin with the tip of his finger while he peered through his spectacles plainly still somewhat suspicious it is rather remarkable that you should get things mixed in such a manner i am not feeling well professor not at all and it was apparent to frank that harry told the truth you are not looking well came somewhat sarcastically from professor suchs lips your countenance has a strangely mottled hue it comes from injun jestion explained merriwell coming to his roommates relief eh from what sir from indigestion said frank very soberly he is much troubled that way much troubled much troubled exclaimed the professor whose ear had been offended and who immediately turned his attention on frank i advise you to be somewhat more choice and careful of your language young man there is a right and a wrong use of words just then the chapel bell clanged and the professor exclaimed bless me well be late if were not careful away he hurried frank and harry followed him and as they went along harry expressed his feelings forcibly and violently how dare you howl before me laughed frank excuse me said rattleton i didnt know you wanted to howl first at chapel harry felt that the eyes of everybody were upon him he kept one hand up to his face as much as possible but he saw the sophomores smiling covertly and winking among themselves he longed to get even that was his one burning ambition and desire when the service was over the freshmen stood and bowed to the faculty as they passed out they were supposed to keep bowing to the seniors juniors and sophomores but that custom had long been a dead letter at yale the freshmen had become too independent for such a thing however they stood and saw the upper classmen go past and it seemed to poor harry that every fellow stared at him and grinned the sophs added to his misery and anger by winking at him and tad horner ventured to go through a swift pantomime of taking a scalp oh i am liable to have yours yet thought harry on their way back to their rooms harry and frank were greeted by all sorts of calls and persiflage from the sophomores who had gathered in knots to watch them pass this sort of chaffing gave rattleton that tired feeling as he expressed it and by the time they reached their room he was in a desperate mood ill get even he vowed fiercely ill do it go ahead you can do it laughed frank you can do anybody then harry flung a book at him which frank skillfully caught and returned with the utmost politeness at breakfast rattleton was chafed by the freshmen and he boiled more than ever somebody has my coat vest hat shirt and undershirt he said as he thought the affair over i had to go home in a linen duster which i got down to billys last night i dont care so much for the clothes i lost but id like to know who has em id sue him but after breakfast an expressman appeared with a bundle for rattleton and in the bundle were the missing articles the sophomores were jubilant and they taunted the freshmen they said the fate that had befallen rattleton was simply a warning it was nothing beside what might happen for the time the freshmen were forced to remain silent but they felt that the sophomores had not evened up matters by any means and the affair would not be dropped during the afternoon of that day it rained for at least two hours and it did not clear up and let the sun out so there was plenty of dirt and mud at nightfall then it was that rattleton some way found out that a number of sophomores who dined at a club on york street were going to attend a party that evening it was to be a swell affair on temple street and the sophs were certain to wear their dress suits theyll din for dresser i mean dress for dinner spluttered harry as he was telling frank its certain theyll go directly from dinner to the party well what has worked its way into your head a scheme give it to us well be ready for em when they come from dinner and well give em a rush theyre not likely to be in any condition to attend a party after we are through with them what do you say old man what do you think of it we are likely to get enough of rushing in the annual rush but im with you if you want to carry this job through all right then well do it well give those sophs a warm time i have been grouchy all day but i begin to feel better now so frank and harry communicated the plan to their friends and a party gathered in their room immediately after supper dismal jones was out as a scout and he had agreed to let them know when the sophomores left their club they were inclined to take much more time in dining than the freshmen pretty soon jones came racing up the stairs and burst into the room come on fellows he cried the sophs are leaving their club and theres lots of em wearing dress suits well have a picnic with em dismal seldom got excited but now he was quite aroused the freshmen caught up their caps and hurried downstairs they were soon on the street and they hastened to meet their natural enemies the sophomores had formed by twos with browning and emery in advance it was true that many of them were in dress suits and they were not a little disturbed when they saw the solid body of freshmen coming swiftly to meet them to pass on the right the sophomores were entitled to the inside of the sidewalk and although they would have given much to avoid the encounter they formed solidly and prepared to defend their rights the freshmen also formed in a compact mass and came on with a rush keeping hard up against the wall turn to the right turn to the right the sophomores uttered the cry as they hugged the wall on the inside sweep em off sweep em off that was the cry that came from the determined freshmen hold on hold on ordered browning there is a law for this then you will have to produce officers to enforce it laughed frank merriwell but there is a regular time for rushing this is not a regular rush so we dont mind but you fellows have no right to do it is that so was the derisive retort hear the sophs squeal fellows oh my but this is funny stop a minute and we will argue this matter freshies invited browning who was thoroughly disgusted over the prospect then the whole crowd of freshmen roared with laughter hear the baby cry they shouted he is begging ha ha ha brownings face was crimson with anger and confusion you are an insolent lot of young ruffians he snapped and merriwell is the biggest ruffian of you all back it up back it up i can why dont you i will when the right time comes whats the matter with this for the right time no no turn to the right and let us pass now we will see you again we see you now and we are going to raise you the limit the sophomores held a hurried consultation and then browning said if you fellows will wait till we go change our clothes well come out and give you as warm a time as you want all right we will wait then let us pass well do that but you will have to pass on the outside that was something the sophomores could not do without yielding to the freshmen and they felt that they had rather die than yield unless compelled to do so the sophomores stormed and scolded and the freshmen who outnumbered them laughed and flung back taunts then the sophomores determined on a quick sudden rush but it happened that the freshmen had decided on a rush at the same moment and the two bodies of lads plunged forward as if at one signal umptyeight umptyeight yelled the freshmen umptyseven umptyseven shouted the sophomores crash they met then there occurred one of the liveliest struggles of the season up to that date each side did its best to force the other off the sidewalk and for some moments they swayed and surged in one spot at last the superior weight of the freshmen began to tell and the sophomores were slowly swept backward contending every inch feeling that they must be crowded to the outside browning gave the signal for them to break and make it a handtohand affair then he grappled with merriwell frank was ready and he willingly left the line as the freshmen forged onward he was anxious for an opportunity of seeing just what sort of stuff the king of the sophomores was made of and this was his chance finding that they could not hold the freshmen back the sophs had each singled out a man and the contest became hand to hand in a few moments several parties were down and some of them rolled from the sidewalk into the street now that they had been forced to do battle the sophs were desperate and they sailed in like a lot of tigers rattleton found himself pitted against andy emery and emery had the reputation of being as full of grit as a bulldog he was on the varsity crew and he had a back and shoulders which were the admiration of those who had seen him strip to the buff emery had a quick temper and a strong arm he grappled with harry lifted him off his feet and tried to throw him but the freshman came down on his feet like a cat a second later emery was astonished to feel his own feet flung into the air and he could not help falling but he clung to his antagonist and they went down together over and over they rolled each striving to get on top they were soon off the sidewalk and into the street emery was furious for he felt that his dress suit was the same as ruined and he uttered some very savage language thats right chuckled harry cuss a little it may help you it seemed to for emery finally succeeded in getting astride rattleton and holding him down for a few moments he was soon pulled off by another freshman and the merry war went on little tad horner was right in the hottest scrimmage and he proved formidable for the freshmen despite his size he had a way of darting under them and tripping them up then getting away before he could be grappled dismal jones was quoting scripture and doing his best to make himself felt by the sophomores jones was a character his parents were shouting methodists and they intended him for the ministry he had a long sad face but he was full of deviltry and it was very seldom that the freshmen entered into any affair against the sophomores that he was not on hand and interested lay on and spare not he cried after the style of a campmeeting revivalist if the wicked entice thee consent thou not get behind me satan brothers oh my dear brothers it makes my heart sad and weary to see so much wicked strife and contention punch swallows the redheaded soph found himself pitted against lucy little despite his name little was not a sissy and he was no mean antagonist as punch found out it was nip and tuck between them and neither seemed to have the best of it some of the sophs were able to down their men but they were so outnumbered by the freshmen that they could not hold an advantage very long the struggle between browning and merriwell waxed furious the big sophomore exerted himself to his utmost and he found that it was necessary that he should do so if he had any thought of holding his own with the freshman leader frank knew all the time that he was pitted against a hard man and so his muscles were strained and his nerves were taut now fresh well see what we can do for you browning said as he made a mighty effort to land frank on his back you are very kind laughed merriwell i will not forget your kindness you are not the only one panted browning there are others are you going to the party this evening chuckled frank not till i have done you up my friend with the swelled head then you expect to be rather late well see frank resorted to all the tricks he knew but browning was familiar with every one of them they gave up trying to down each other by main strength and science cut quite a figure in their battle at length browning got frank foul and to his dismay the leader of the freshmen felt himself falling browning fell with him a cry of triumph coming to his lips that cry turned to an exclamation of dismay for merriwell seemed to twist about in the air and they fell side by side on the ground in a twinkling they were at it again and over and over they went till they finally stopped and got upon their feet together very good thus far laughed merriwell but i see your wind will not hold out i am bound to do you in the end that was the very thing browning feared well i dont know about that he said as he broke franks grip this may settle the whole business he struck hard and straight at merriwells face chapter xiii jubilant freshmen spat merriwell staggered down you go browning followed the freshman closely launching out again with the full expectation that the second blow would be a settler frank had been taken slightly off his guard so that he had failed in getting away from the first blow but he skillfully ducked the second countering as the kings fist passed over his shoulder browning reeled backward having received a terrific crack on the ear if frank had not been slightly dazed he might have followed the sophomore closely but he was a bit slow in getting after bruce for a few seconds the boys gave an exhibition of scientific sparring which would have proved very interesting to their comrades if all had not been too busy to watch them frank merriwell contiuued to laugh and it had been said at yale that he was most dangerous in an encounter when he laughed you came near doing it browning he admitted but it was rather tricky on your part i wasnt looking for a fight you will get many things you are not looking for before you have been at yale much longer returned the king think so dead sure the two lads seemed to be very evenly matched save that merriwell was the more catlike on his feet browning was solid and it took a terrific blow to stagger him merriwell was plainly the more scientific he could get in and away from his foe in a most successful manner but he saw that in the confined limits of a ring brownings rush would be difficult to escape what the result of this encounter might have been cannot be told for two freshmen suddenly appeared and gave the alarm that at least a hundred sophomores were coming in a body to aid their comrades a moment later the sophs appeared hurrying along the street toward the scene of the encounter umptyseven umptyseven rah rah rah then the signal was given for the freshmen to break away and take to flight which they promptly did oh soph oh my poor soph cried many taunting voices goodevening gentlemen called bandy robinson shall i toss you down soap and towels say fellows cried lucy little dont you think it is rather warm out this evening hello hello shouted rattleton has it been raining or did we have a small shower then merriwells beautiful baritone voice pitched the chorus of a familiar negro melody in which the triumphant and delighted freshmen joined git erway from de window mah love an mah dove git erway from de window dont yeh heah come eround some odder night for deres gwine ter be er fight an darll be razzers erflyin through de air the sophomores retired to a safe distance and then challenged the freshmen to come out and fight they called them cowards and other things but the freshmen laughed and taunted them in return is er king browning present yelled a freshman leaning out of a window if so id like to inquire if he means to attend the party this evening if he does said another freshman he will be able to obtain a dress suit down at cohens price von tollar ber efenin to shentlemen oh you wait till we get at you fresh ducks shouted back an angry sophomore well make you sweat for this go on youre only fooling sang the freshmen well show you were not fooling excitedly declared punch swallow well scalp a few of you ah cried bandy robinson he is a bad man methinks i can detect his cloven foot youre wrong laughed merriwell but you may have been near enough at some time to detect his cloven breath the three freshmen who were leaning out of one of the upper windows repeated in chorus punch brother punch with care punch in the presence of the passenjair another freshman shouted say swallows give us a lock of your hair itll save the expense of gas in my room id like a lock of it too declared another im troubled with rats and i havent any paris green handy oh rats yelled twenty voices hello parker cried little i hear you were held up last night is it true oh yes said rattleton hed been down to moreys and that was the way he got home but oh what a difference in the morning sang the freshmen ask rattleton if he means to join the indians called a soph or will he sioux for damages put in another oh say groaned dismal jones thats the worst i ever heard its enough to give one heart failure come out and fight come out and fight urged the sophomores you dont dare to come out and fight you will have to excuse us this evening gentlemen said merriwell suavely we have done our best to entertain you and we will see you again at some other date you are certain to see me again assented browning you ran away or we would have settled matters between us this evening as it is i am going to watch my opportunity to do you fairly and squarely when i am done with you one of us will be beautifully licked and that one will not be king bruce declared andy emery say say say spluttered rattleton ill go you a shot that it is ill stand you a supper for twenty at any place youll name that merriwell knocks the everlasting stuffing out of browning done returned emery you name plime and tace i mean time and place and well be there you bet declared harry all we want is a fair deal youll get that assured browning this little affair shall be arranged very soon the sooner the better dont delay on our account the sophomores seeing it was useless to linger there and be taunted by the freshmen began to stroll away one by one up in merriwells room rattleton got down his banjo and began to put it in tune a merry party gathered there one of the strings snapped and as he was putting on another harry fell to laughing what are you laughing at asked bandy robinson down at the table tonight explained harry merriwell was poking his finger into the butter i asked him what he was doing that for and he said he was only feeling its muscle the boys who dined in the house appreciated that and there was a general laugh then harry adjusted the string and placed the banjo in tune pretty soon the boys were singing bingo upidee nellie was a lady and other college songs every one of them seemed familiar with paddy duffys cart and its pretty chorus twinkling stars are laughing love laughing on you and me while your bright eyes look into mine peeping stars they seem to be such glorious days and such merry nights will never come again to those who have known them heres to good old yale chapter xiv the rush at last the sophomores were thoroughly aroused the freshmen had long been carrying things with a high hand but the rushing of a lot of them who were in dress suits and bound for a swell party was the straw that broke the camels back an indignation meeting was held and certain freshmen were placed under the ban of these merriwell was the leader and it was agreed that every effort must be made to take the starch out of him that browning intended to do merriwell was well known but some of the others proposed to get at him wait advised bruce wait till i have had it out with that fellow then you may do whatever you like with him but i feel it a solemn duty to settle our little affair before anybody else tackles him the freshmen were getting their ball team in condition for the coming season and they were practicing as often as possible frank was interested in the team and it was said by those who watched him that he seemed to have the making of a pitcher in him he had sharp curves and good control if he had a head they said he was all right but this was something that could not be decided till he had been tried in a game another freshman by the name of walter gordon seemed certain to be the regular pitcher of the team he had a record as he had shown while merriwell would say nothing about what he had done in the way of pitching the students had found it extremely difficult to find out much about merriwell as he persistently avoided talking about himself if he had been one of the kind of fellows who go around and brag about themselves and what they have done he would not have aroused so much interest but the very fact that he would not talk of himself made the students curious to know something of his history in a vague sort of way it became known that although he lived in simple style like any freshman whose parents were not wealthy he had a fortune in his own right and had traveled extensively in various parts of the world franks silence seemed to cast an air of mystery about him and that air of mystery made him all the more interesting for the human mind is ever curious to peer into anything that has the flavor of a secret the sophomores had been rushed by the freshmen and they resolved to retaliate in a similar manner on saturday afternoons the freshmen ball team practiced and saturday was at hand it would be an opportune time to meet the youngsters and make it warm for them the affair was carefully planned but wind of it reached the freshmen as a result the youngsters prepared for what they knew must take place there could be no such thing as avoiding it so when saturday noon came they dressed themselves in their old clothes and started for the park going out as much as possible in a body when the park was reached it was found that the sophomores were there ahead of them more than that the sophs had closed and fastened the gate and they proposed to hold it they taunted the freshmen and told them they would have to climb the fence if they hoped to get into the park then there was a consultation among the freshmen well have to make a rush was the universal decision frank looked the ground over and he decided that an ordinary rush would not be successful for that was the very thing the sophomores were expecting but there seemed no other way of getting into the park unless they climbed the fence and not a man thought of doing such a thing as that the sophomores formed in front of the gate five deep in the front rank of the sophs were browning and two varsity crew men bruce was in the middle with the rowers on either side the ends were two men from the football team thus the very first line of the sophomores made a formidable array and it is not surprising that some of the freshmen were chickenhearted with assistance frank marshaled the freshmen reserving a place in the first line for himself while that might be considered a position of honor it was the most dangerous and every fellow there knew this rush was to be no baby play for companions merriwell selected dismal jones jack diamond puss parker and a big broadshouldered fellow by the name of hovey rattleton and robinson together with a dozen others were appointed as scouts it was their duty to hook out men from the ranks of the sophs and break the force of the enemys rush as far as possible the sophomores had likewise appointed a dozen scouts strong active fellows every one of whom had shown ability as an athlete the sophs prepared quickly for the rush but it took more time to get the freshmen in order in this the seniors rendered not a little assistance when everything was ready the order was given and the freshmen started forward those in the front line leaned back at a slant and those behind pushed at the same time the sophomores moved toward the freshmen and then there were shouts taunts and jeers each side gave its own cheer this is the last of the freshmen cried the sophomores well wipe them off the earth goodby freshies umptyseven will never be heard of again returned the freshmen theyll be angels right away then the two bodies came together with a frightful impact they had locked their arms about each others waists and there they clung while they pressed upon each other with all their might for a little time they swayed and swayed there were screams and cries of pain they wavered and turned about but still the crush continued the scouts were getting in their work hooking their bent arms around the necks of their opponents and yanking them out of the line before long the rush turned into a general pushing and hauling freshman pitted himself again sophomore and a score of wrestling matches were in progress merriwell and browning had clinched at the outset but it was a long time before they could do anything but cling to each other when they did have an opportunity another soph a scout spoiled the match by making a low tackle on frank and flinging him to the ground browning came down heavily on the leader of the freshmen but he immediately jumped up crying that was not a square deal lets have it over but the breath had been knocked out of frank with the force of the fall and he fell back twice as he struggled to arise are you hurt asked browning no panted frank who could dimly see his opponent through a thick haze which seemed to hang before his eyes then why dont you get up i im going to setting his teeth he did so but rattleton caught browning by the collar and flung him aside as the big soph sprang at frank you are hurt old man insisted harry i saw the fellow when he tripped you it wasnt a fair thing you are in no condition to meet browning now wait till you get your wind i must meet him cried frank hell say he did me up if i do not then hell lie its all right you do as i say frank tried to resist but rattleton dragged him aside being able to do so because browning found himself occupied by a little freshman who stuffily blocked his way declaring that merriwell should have a show frank was more than disgusted by the result of the affair he felt that he must have it out with browning then and there and he made desperate attempts to break from harry ordinarily he would have succeeded with the greatest ease but the fall had robbed him of his strength then came the knowledge that the freshmen had been repulsed the sophomores were cheering wildly and the unfortunate freshmen were downcast theyve held us out muttered harry bitterly it begins to look as if well have to climb over the fence if we get inside whats that cried frank bracing up a little climb the fence not much then howll we get in will you tell me that well find a way wind a fay spluttered harry excitedly its easy enough to say that but i dont believe we can do it oh freshies oh you poor freshies tauntingly cried the victors dont you wish you could but you cant do it you know that remains to be seen muttered merriwell brushing the hair back from his eyes i didnt think we could do it in this way but there are others youll be a dandy if you devise a way declared little diamond with his coat off his vest ripped up the back and his shirt torn open at the throat was regarding the jeering sophomores with a fierce sullen look evidently he was ready for anything he glanced at merriwell but said nothing frank called the freshmen around him look here fellows he said we are bound to go into that park and were going through that gate that sounds well said dismal jones who wore an unusually long face but im inclined to believe were not in it with that crowd guess again exclaimed frank now listen to me and i dont want one of you to look around you might arouse suspicion if you did close to the wall there lies a long stick of timber well well use it how as a batteringram to batter down the gate why how are we to get to the gate the timber will take us there and it will open the gate when i give the word we will rush for it pick it up and sail right into the sophs ill bet anything they get out of the way when they see us coming with that it will take them by surprise rah rah rah yelled several of the enthusiastic freshmen the sophomores yelled back at them in derision they think we are beaten now said diamond whose face had lighted up somewhat as he listened to merriwells plan if we only can get the best of them that way we can and we will assured frank those who cant get hold of the timber may look out that they dont hook our men away from it that is all the freshmen became eager for the effort but frank held them back till he was certain they all understood just what was to be done are you ready he finally asked all ready was the eager reply then go the sophomores were astonished to see the freshmen suddenly whirl all together and rush toward the wall theyre going over theyre going over the sophomores shouted their satisfaction and delight fully convinced that they had forced the freshmen to abandon all hope of going through the gate then came a surprise for them the freshmen caught up the timber and merriwell cried charge like a tornado they bore down on the men near the gate toward which the timber was directed with cries of amazement the alarmed sophomores broke and scattered before the oncoming freshmen crash the timber struck the gate bursting it open instantly and the triumphant freshmen swarmed into the park cheering wildly hurrah for umptyeight yelled bandy robinson turning a handspring we are the boys to do em hurrah for frank merriwell shouted harry rattleton his face beaming with joy it was his scheme that did it hurrah hurrah hurrah roared the freshmen rah rah rah then frank felt himself lifted to the shoulders of his enthusiastic admirers and carried to the home plate of the ball ground where the freshmen cheered again and again the sophomores were filled with rage and chagrin that was the blamedest trick i ever heard of in all my life declared andy emery we werent looking for anything of the kind and we have merriwell to thank for it snapped evan hartwick hes full of tricks as an egg is full of meat by jawve said willis paulding who had managed to keep out of harms way during the entire affair i think somebody ought to do something to that fellaw i really do dont yer know suppose you try to see what you can do with him grinned tad horner you ought to be able to do something aw really you will hawve to excuse me exclaimed willis in alarm i hawdly think i could match his low cunning dont yer understand oh yes i understand nodded horner significantly it takes a man to go up against merriwell i hope you dont mean to insinuate oh no interrupted tad i have said it eh i hawdly think i understand dont yer know think it over advised the little soph as he turned away it is probable that bruce browning was more thoroughly disgusted than any of his friends confound it he thought if id stuck to that fellow and done him up anyway he wouldnt have been able to carry out this trick if he is given any kind of a show he is bound to take advantage of it bruce felt like fighting im going in there and lick him he declared i will settle this matter with merriwell right away but some of his friends were more cautious it wont do declared puss parker wont do no sir why not it might be done under cover of a rush but a single fight between a soph and a fresh under such public conditions would be sure to get them both in trouble i dont care a continental ive stood him just as long as i can if i can give him a good square licking ill stand expulsion should it come to that they saw that browning was too heated to pause for sober thought and so they gathered close around him and forced him to listen to reason it took no small amount of argument to induce the king to give over the idea of going onto the ball field and attacking merriwell but he was finally shown the folly of such a course however he vowed over and over that the settlement with merriwell should come very soon chapter xv on the ball field the sophomores went in to watch the freshmen practice and incidentally to have sport with them two nines had been selected one being the regular freshman team and the other picked up to give them practice as merriwell had been given a place on the team as reserve pitcher his services were not needed at first and so he went in to twirl for the scrub nine walter gordon went into the box for the regular team and he expected to fool the irregulars with ease he was a wellbuilt lad with a bang and it was plain to see at a glance that he was stuck on himself he had a trick of posing in the box and he delivered the ball with a flourish the scrub team did not have many batters and so it came about that the first three men up were disposed of in onetwothree order not one of them making a safe hit or reaching first rattleton had vainly endeavored to get upon the regular team he had played pretty fast ball on a country nine but he was somewhat out of practice and he had not made a firstclass showing so he had failed in his ambition he went into catch for merriwell and they had arranged a code of signals beforehand so that they were all prepared there was no affectation about franks delivery but the first man on the list of the regulars found merriwells slow drop was a hard ball to hit he went after two of them before he saw what he was getting then he made up his mind that he would get under the next one and knock the peeling off it he got under it all right for instead of being a drop it was a rise and the batter struck at least eighteen inches below it well say laughed gordon who had been placed second on the list at his own request ill go you something he doesnt work that on me he was full of confidence when he walked up to the plate the watching sophomores were doing their best to rattle merriwell and it seemed that he must soon get nervous even though he did not seem to hear any of the jolly that was being flung at him the very first ball seemed to be just where gordon wanted it and he swung at it with all his strength it twisted in toward him and passed within two inches of his fingers gordon looked mildly surprised but he was still confident that he would be able to hit the next one with ease he found out his mistake later on when he went after an out drop and failed to come within six inches of it then it was gordon who grew nervous he did not fancy the idea of being fanned out by his rival and he felt that he must make connections with the next one he resolved to wait for a good one and frank fooled him by putting two straight ones right over the center of the plate gordon felt sure that both would be curves and so he offered at neither of them the umpire however who was a particular friend of gordon called them both balls then gordon went after the next ball which was a raise but found nothing but empty air the third man was easy and he fanned also making three in succession parker punched browning in the ribs say he observed ill go you two to one that merriwell is on the varsity team before the end of next season if he is alive he may be returned the king grimly our heros pitching was a surprise to his friends for until that day he had not seemed to let himself out even then he did not appear to be doing his best work and one who watched him in a friendly way fancied he might do still better if forced to make the effort walter gordon was filled with disgust and dismay hes having great luck muttered gordon why i dont see how i missed a ball i struck at every one was a dead easy thing and i should have killed any of them he squirmed as he heard burn putnam familiarly called old put the manager of the team compliment merriwell on his skillful work i fancy ill be able to use you more than i thought i should at first merriwell said putnam we can tell more about that in the future ive got to strike that fellow out thought gordon as he went into the box but he did not merriwell came first to bat in the second inning and he sent a safe single into right field deliberately placing it as was evident to every ball player present gordon turned green with anger and then he became nervous to add to his nervousness merriwell obtained a lead from first and stole second on his delivery getting it easily but that was not the end of gordons woes for merriwell seemed in a reckless mood and he made for third on the next pitch getting it on a beautiful slide although the catcher made an attempt to throw him out the catcher came down scowling and gordon went to meet him asking as he did so whats the matter with you you ought to have stopped him at second and held him there i ought to have stopped him came derisively from the disgusted backstop i came down to ask you if this was the way you were going to pitch in a regular game why that fellow is getting a long start on your delivery and he does it every time youve got to stop that kind of business for some moments they talked and then gordon sulkily walked back to the box he tried to catch frank playing off third but simply wasted time then he made a snap delivery and hit the batter who went down to first by this time gordon was rattled and he sent the next ball over the heart of the plate the batter nailed it for two bags and two men came home gordon walked out of the box and up to the bench where old put was sitting i am sick he declared he looked as if he spoke the truth i thought something was the matter with you said the manager youre white as a sheet its folly for you to practice while you are in this condition gordon put on his sweater and then drew his coat over that he wandered off by himself and sat down hang that fellow merriwell he whispered to himself i never thought he would bother me so much i am beginning to hate him he is too cool and easy to suit me the practice was continued and merriwell showed up finely so that old put was pleased the sophomores quit trying to have sport with the freshmen as it happened that two of the professors had wandered into the park and were looking on from a distance browning saw them why are they out here he snapped never knew em to come before i wont even get a chance to talk to merriwell better keep away from him this afternoon cautioned hartwick he cant escape you and there is plenty of time thats so agreed bruce but i hate to think how he is crowing to himself over the way the freshies got into the park id like to take the starch out of him at once hartwick induced browning to leave the park and the departure of the king caused the sophomores to wander away in small groups as a general thing they were discussing merriwell his position with the freshmen and his pitching some insisted that he was not a pitcher and would never make one while others were equally confident that he was bound to become a great twirler some day some of the groups discussed the antagonism between merriwell and browning and all were confident that the king would do the freshman when he got himself into condition it was not strange that they believed so for they remembered how bruce had knocked out kid lajoie who was a professional browning himself proceeded directly to his rooms where he sat himself down and fell to thinking twice had he been up against merriwell and he had found out that the leader of the freshmen was no easy thing in neither struggle had he obtained an advantage through his own unaided efforts and in this last affair he had felt that he was losing his wind while merriwell seemed as fresh as ever till he was thrown by a third party thats where i am not yet his match bruce soberly decided if i were fortunate enough to land a knockout blow with my left at the outset id finish him easily but if he should play me and keep out of my reach he might get me winded so he could finally get the best of it i must work off more flesh having arrived at this conclusion browning was decidedly glad that his friends had kept him from closing in on merriwell and forcing a fight on the ball field another week will do it bruce thought no matter what is said ill not meet that fellow till i am his match till i am more than his match for i must do him if i do not my days as king of the sophs are numbered i can see now that some of the fellows sympathize secretly with merriwell although they do not dare do so openly it must be stopped he may be a firstclass fellow but when he treads on my corns i kick hartwick tried to talk to bruce but the latter would say very little and it was not long before he left the room browning stepped out briskly and a stranger who saw him could not have believed that he had the reputation of being the laziest lad in college in one line bruce was thoroughly aroused but he was neglecting his studies in a shameful manner and more than once a warning voice told him that while he was putting himself in condition to dispose of merriwell he was getting into trouble in another quarter he did not heed that warning however his one thought was to retain his position as king of the sophomores and in order to do that he must not let any freshman triumph over him in town he went directly to a certain saloon and stopped at the bar although he did not order a drink is the professor in he asked i think he is replied the barkeeper then browning passed through into a back room and climbed some dirty stairs finally rapping at a door come in called a harsh voice bruce pushed open the door and entered the room was quite large but was not very clean the walls were pasted over with sporting pictures taken from illustrated papers there was a bed some old chairs one of which had a broken back a center table a cracked mirror and two cuspidors a door opened into another room beyond lounging in a chair with his feet on the table beside an empty beer bottle and dirty glass was a ruffianlylooking chap who had a thick neck that ran straight up with the back of his head his hair was close cropped and his forehead low there was a bulldog look about his mouth and jaw and his forehead was strangely narrow the man was smoking a black foulsmelling pipe while the hands which held a pinktinted illustrated paper were enormous with huge knuckles and joints his hand when closed looked formidable enough to knock down an ox how do you do professor saluted bruce waryer growled the man still keeping his feet on the table so its you is it dis aint your day i know it but i decided to come around just the same i am not getting the flesh off as fast as i ought hey roared the man letting his feet fall with a crash wots dat dyer men ter say i aint doin a good job wid yer wot der blazes oh you are doing all right professor but i find i must be in condition sooner than i thought my gymnasium exercise doesnt seem to dat gymnasium work is no good see i knows wot im givin yer too i told yer in der first place ter stick ter me an id put yer in shape itll cost more but i dont mind that no matter what it costs i must be in condition to lick that fellow i was telling you about and i must be in condition one week from today dats business ill put yer dere an yer know wot i told yer ill show yer a trick datll finish him dead sure ef de mug is gittin de best of yer itll cost yer twentyfive extra ter learn dat trick but it never fails browning showed sudden interest i had forgotten about that he said what will it do itll do der bloke what yere after dats wot yes but how how tink im goin ter give der hull ting erway well i should say nit i tells yer itll fix him and itll fix him so dere wont be no more fight in him itll paralyze him der first ting an he wont be no better dan a stiff how bad will it hurt him the man paused a moment and then added well i dont mind sayin dat itll break his wrist yer can do it de first crack arter i shows yer how but itll cost twentyfive plunks ter learn der trick after a few moments of hesitation browning drew forth his pocketbook and counted out twentyfive dollars chapter xvi to break an enemys wrist buster kelley was a character professor kelley he called himself he claimed to be a great pugilist and he was forever telling of the men he had put to sleep but he couldnt produce the papers to show for it the public had to take his word if they took anything in fact he had never fought a battle in his life unless it was with a boy half his size he made a bluff and it went the youngsters who came to yale and desired to be instructed in the manly art were always recommended to kelley to give kelley his due he was really a fairly good boxer and he might have made a decent sort of a fight if he had possessed the courage to accept a match and the self denial and energy to go through a regular course of training but kelley was making an easy living catching suckers and there was no real reason why he should go through the hardships of training and actually fighting so long as he could fool the youngsters who regarded him as a onetime great and shining light of the prize ring he was too shrewd to stand up with any pupil who might get the best of him and permit that pupil to hammer away at him he kept them at work on certain kinds of blows so he always knew exactly what was coming in this manner of training them he never betrayed just how much he really knew about fighting some of the young fellows who became kelleys pupils were the sons of wealthy parents and then it happened that the professor worked his little game for all there was in it he sold them secrets and they paid dearly for what they learned some of the secrets were of no value at all and some were actually worth knowing it happened that he did know how to break a mans wrist in a very simple manner providing he could find just the right opportunity it was a simple trick but the opportunity to practice it could seldom be found in a fight kelleys eyes which were somewhat bleary bulged with greed as he saw browning count out the money its givin yer der trick dirt cheap see said the professor i never sold it less dan twice dat ermount before dats straight ill have ter make yer promise not ter tell it ter der odder chaps before i instructs yer if i buy it it is mine said bruce come off der roof you enters inter an agreement wid me dat yer dont blow dis ting ur i dont tell yer what if i want to tell a particular friend yer dont tell him dats all i had ter pay tree hunderd dollars ter learn dis an sign a greement dat i wouldnt give it erway jem mace tort me dis trick wen i sparred wid him in liverpool he says ter me says he buster yere a boid dats wot ye are if you knowed der trick of breakin a blokes wrist dere aint no duffer in der woild dat can do yer ill show yer der crack fer sixty pound he wouldnt come down a little bit an i paid him wot he asked since dat time ive knocked roun all over der woild an its saved me life fife times dat was a cheap trick wot i got from old jem dat were a dago pulled a knife on me oncet fer ter cut me wide open but i broke der dagos wrist quicker dan yer can spit well here is your money and now i want to know that trick yer grees not ter tell it ter anybody yes i agree dat settles it kelley took the money and carefully stowed it away in his clothes strip up an git inter yer trainin rig he directed bruce went into the back room and buster poked himself in the ribs with his thumb grinning and winking at his own reflection in the cracked mirror oh say but im a peach he told himself in a confidential whisper if der college perfessers dont git arter me ergin ill make me forchune right yere kelley had originally hung out a sign and advertised to instruct young gentlemen in boxing but the faculty had made it rather warm for him and it was generally supposed that he had been forced to leave new haven he had not left but he had changed his quarters to the rooms he now occupied one flight up at the back of a saloon in a short time bruce called that he was ready and the professor leisurely strolled into the back room where there was a punching bag a striking machine all kinds of boxing gloves and other paraphernalia such as a man in kelleys business might need at one side of the room were several small closets in which kelleys pupils kept their training suits while they were not wearing them the door of one closet was open and brownings street clothes were hanging on some hooks inside browning had got into trunks stockings and light softbottomed shoes he was stripped to the waist buster walked around the lad inspecting him with a critical eye punching here and there with his fingers feeling of certain muscles and some points where there seemed to be a superabundance of flesh well say cried the professor id like ter know wot yer kickin erbout i never seen a feller work off fat no faster dan wot youse has an dats on der dead why wen yer comes yere yer didnt have a muscle dat werent buried in fat an now deyre comin out hard all over yer youd kick ef yer wuz playin football thats all right said bruce rather impatiently i know what i want and i am paying you to give it to me go ahead dont be so touchy scowled kelley tackle der bag a while an lets see how yer work browning went at the punching bag while the professor stood by and called the changes he thumped it up against the ceiling and caught it on the rebound thirty times in succession first with his right and then with his left then he went at it with both hands and fairly made it hum then at the word with remarkable swiftness he gave it fist and elbow first right and then left then he did some fancy work at a combination hit and butt by the time buster called him off browning was streaming with perspiration and breathing heavily dats first rate complimented the professor yer does dat like yer wuz a perfessional great scott gasped bruce id never torture myself in this way if i didnt have to it is awful he looked around for a chair but buster grinned and said dats right set right down nit youse dont do dat no more in dis joint wen i gits yer yere yer works till yer trough see dats der way ter pull der meat off er man well whats next see if yer can raise yer record anoder pound on der striker bruce went at the striking machine which registered the exact number of pounds of force in each blow it received has any one beaten me yet he asked naw dere aint nobody come within ninety pound of yer bruce looked satisfied but he made up his mind to raise his record if possible and he succeeded in adding twelve pounds to it say exclaimed buster if dat cove wot yer arter does you hes a boid thats just what he is nodded bruce streaming with perspiration he is a bad man to go against if yer ever gits at him wid dat left yell knock him out sure he is like a panther on his feet and i shall be in great luck if i find him with my left yer dont want ter tink dat yer wants ter tink yer goin ter find him anyhow dats der way i have thought so before and i have discovered that he is a wonderfully hard man to find wen yer goin ter fight him i am going to try to make him meet me one week from today where i dont know yet is he a squealer i dont believe you could drag anything out of him with horses if dats right yer might make it yere an it could be kept quiet id charge a little someting fer der use of der room but dat wouldnt come out of eder of youse fer wed make der fellers pay wot come in ter see it well see about that said bruce but now i want to know that trick oh yes i near fergot dat well i didnt say if yer use dat on him i dont tink we can have der scrap here why not if one of dem freshies got injuries in dis place so bad it might git out an dat would fix me i dont intend to use it on him unless i have to go ahead and explain your trick if it isnt straight i want my money back dere wont be any money back fer der trick is all right all right now stan up here an ill show yer how its did kelley then showed bruce how to bring the edge of his open hand down on the upper side of an enemys wrist just back of the joint yer wants ter snap it like dis buster explained illustrating with a sharp rebounding motion if yer strikes him right dere wid der cushion meat on der lower edge of yer hand an snaps yer hand erway like dis its dead sure ter break der bone jes try it on yer own wrist but be careful not ter try it too hard bruce did as directed and he found that he hurt himself severely although he struck a very light blow dats ter trick said kelley an its a dandy dont yer ever use it less yer dead sure yer wants ter break der odder fellers wrist then the professor called up a colored boy who rubbed bruce down and the king of the sophomores finally departed as he walked back toward his room in the dusk of early evening browning began to feel sorry that he had learned the trick at all it would be a dirty game to play on merriwell he muttered but now that i know it i may get mad and do it in a huff especially if i see merriwell is getting the best of me the more browning thought the matter over the greater became his regret that he had learned the trick of breaking an opponents wrist for all that he had a strong feeling against merriwell he could see that the leader of the freshmen was square and manly and he did not believe frank would take an unfair advantage of a foe bruce became quite unlike his old jovial self he was strangely downcast and moody and he saw that he was fast losing prestige with those who had once regarded him as their leader hartwick brownings roommate was more bitter against merriwell the confounded upstart he would growl think of his coming here and carrying things on with such a high hand when we were freshmen the sophomores had everything their own way they lambda chied us till they became sick of it and all our attempts to get even proved failures now the freshmen who are following the lead of this fellow merriwell seem to think that they are cocks of the walk i tell you what it is bruce you must do that fellow and you must do him so he will stay done oh i dont believe he is such a bad fellow at heart it wouldnt be right to injure him permanently wouldnt it give me the chance and see if i dont fix him hartwick began to regard his roommate with disdain for goodness sake dont get soft he implored the fellows will say you are chickenhearted and that will settle your case youll never get back to your old position if you once lose it id rather be thought chickenhearted than hold my position by dirty play hartwick made no retort but it was plain to see that he entertained a different view of a case like the one in question browning worked like a beaver to get himself in shape for the coming struggle but he promised himself over and over that he would never do such a thing again it was pride and hope that sustained him through his severe course of training no fresh mug can do youse now buster kelley finally declared ill put me dough on you an ill win too bruce was really in very good form and he felt that he stood more than an even chance with merriwell he had seen the freshman fight however and he realized that he would not have a walkover the freshmen began to think that browning feared to meet merriwell and they openly told him as much they taunted him to such an extent that it was with the utmost difficulty he held himself in check till the expiration of the time he had set for getting himself in condition what if i should see the freshman getting the best of me and should break his wrist he thought i might make it appear to be an accident but i would know better myself id get the best of merriwell and the fellows would still hail me as king browning but i would be ashamed of myself all the while it was that thought which troubled him so much and made him appear so grouchy browning is in a blue funk whenever he thinks of stacking up against the freshman one sophomore confidentially told another i believe he has lost his nerve it looks that way admitted the other thus it came about that bruces appearance led his former admirers to misjudge him and he saw a growing coolness toward him ill meet merriwell on the level he finally decided and i will whip him on the level or ill not whip him at all then he instructed hartwick to carry a challenge to frank i will fight him with hard gloves said bruce he had decided that with a glove on his hand he could not easily perform the trick of breaking his enemys wrist in case he was seized by an impulse to do so gloves cried hartwick why man why dont you challenge him to meet you with bare fists because i have decided that gloves are all right the fellows will say you are afraid let them say so if they like returned bruce but he winced a bit as if a tender spot had been touched hartwick did his test to induce his friend to challenge merriwell to a fight with bare fists but bruce had made up his mind and he was obstinate so it came about that hartwick carried the challenge just as browning desired and it was promptly accepted merriwell was not a fellow who sought trouble but he knew he must meet browning or be called a coward and he did not dally he quietly told hartwick that any arrangements mr browning saw fit to make would be agreeable to him in that way he put browning on his honor to give him a square deal the matter was kept very quiet it was decided that the match should come off in kelleys back room and a few of merriwells and brownings friends should be invited bruce paid for the room and firmly sat on the professors scheme to charge admission this is no prize fight he rather warmly declared we are not putting ourselves on exhibition like two pugilists it is a matter of honor well if youse college chaps dont git der derndest ideas inter yer nuts muttered kelley who could not understand brownings view of an affair of honor youse takes der cream dats wot yer do on saturday afternoon one week after the rush at the park certain students might have been seen to stroll one at a time into the saloon over which were the headquarters of professor kelley it was three in the afternoon that about twenty lads were gathered in busters trainingroom to witness the meeting between merriwell and browning tad horner was chosen referee look here he said before the first round if any man here isnt satisfied with my decisions let him meet me after the match is over and i will satisfy him or fight him this was said in all earnestness and it brought a round of applause and laughter it was agreed that it should be a sixround contest not more and no less unless one side threw up the sponge or one of the men was knocked out rattleton was franks second and hartwick represented bruce a regular ring had been roped off and the men entered from opposite sides at a signal much to his disgust kelley was not allowed to take any part in the affair both lads were stripped to the waist merriwell was clean limbed but muscular while browning was stocky and solid the sophomore had gotten rid of his superfluous flesh in a wonderful manner and he looked to be a hard man to tackle the gloves were put on and then the rivals advanced and shook hands an instant later they were at it and the decisive struggle between them had begun their movements were so rapid that it was difficult for the eyes of the eager spectators to follow them both got in some sharp blows and the round ended with a clean knockdown for browning who planted a terrific blow between merriwells eyes and sent the freshman to the floor the sophs were jubilant and the freshmen were downcast merriwell simply laughed as he sat on rattletons knee whee jiz i mean jee whiz spluttered harry are you going to let that fellow do you the sophs will never get over it if you do hear em laugh dont worry smiled frank this is the beginning there must be an ending do him do him bruce fiercely whispered hartwick in the ear of his principal its plain enough that you can i think i can said bruce confidently the sophs offered three to two on browning and many bets were made then time was called and the rivals advanced once more the second round was hotter than the first if possible and merriwell drew first blood by giving browning a heavy one on the nose it ended with both sparring and neither seeming to have a decided advantage now the freshmen were encouraged and they expressed their confidence in their man more bets were made the sophomores still giving odds the third round filled the freshmen with delight for merriwell knocked browning off his feet twice while he seemed to get no heavy blows himself the sophs became quieter and no money at odds was in sight in fact the freshmen tried to get even money but could not the fourth and fifth rounds were filled with good sharp scientific work but toward the close of the fifth both men seemed a trifle groggy neither had a decided advantage dat merriwell is a boid declared buster kelley enthusiastically why dat chap could be der champeen of der woild if he went inter der business fer fair dats on der level too both lads were battered and bruised and there was blood on their faces when they retired to their corners at the command from horner hes a nut confessed frank he has given me some soakers and he takes his medicine as if he liked it youll finish him next round sure fluttered harry i shall buck the kickit i mean kick the bucket if you dont how is it hartwick eagerly asked as he wiped the blood from brownings face can you finish him next round i shall try but i dont believe the fellow can be licked unless he is killed thats what i think of him didnt i hear you say you knew a trick that would do him yes but it is not a square deal although no referee could call it foul if this were a fight with bare fists as it is id have to get my glove off do it do it youre a fool if you dont then im a fool that man has trusted this entire affair to our honor and if i cant whip him fair i wont whip him at all you make me sick sneered hartwick at the call the two men promptly faced each other for the final round at first they were a bit wary but then as if by mutual agreement they went at each other like tigers blow followed blow but it was plain that one man was getting quite as much as the other browning got in one of his terrific drives but it was not a knockout and merriwell had the sophomore up up against the rope three times time break away yelled tad horner forcing himself over between the combatants its all over whats the decision shouted a dozen voices a draw was the distinct answer i declare it an even thing between them there was a moment of silence and then bruised and smiling frank merriwell tore off his glove and extended his hand off came brownings glove and he accepted the hand of the freshman chapter xvii talking it over before night nearly every student knew that merriwell and browning had fought a sixround hardglove contest to a draw and it was generally said that the decision was fair evan hartwick seemed to be the only witness of the fight who was dissatisfied roland ditson had not been invited to see it but he expressed a belief that browning would prove the better man in a fight to a finish several weeks slipped by after the glove contest browning had very little to say about the freshman leader whenever he did say anything it was exactly what he thought and it was noted that he admitted merriwell to be a comer evan hartwick could not crush down his powerful dislike for merriwell he admitted to bruce that he felt an almost irresistible desire to strike the cool freshman whenever they met i wouldnt advise you to do it my boy lazily smiled browning who was growing fat again now that he was no longer in training he is a bad man to hit it depends on what he is hit with returned hartwick grimly you made a fool of yourself when you failed to break his wrist after paying twentyfive toadskins to learn the trick that would have made you the victor and it would have made me feel like a contemptible sneak i have been well satisfied with myself that i did not try the trick it is a good thing to know but it should be used on no one but a ruffian its surprising to me how soft youre getting this merriwell is dangerous in many directions and his career would have been stopped short if you had broken his wrist he has shown that he is a baseball pitcher but no man can pitch with a broken wrist he is one of the best freshmen halfbacks ever seen at yale according to the general acknowledgment and now he is pulling an oar and coaching the freshmen crew at the same time something never attempted before something said to be impossible where would he be if you had broken his wrist he could coach the freshmen just the same and the very fact that he can do all these things makes me well satisfied that i did not fix him so he couldnt wait wait what if the freshmen beat us out at lake saltonstall what if they come out ahead of us they wont i know the fellows are saying they will not but i tell you this merriwell is full of tricks and there is no telling what he may do with the fresh crew he is working them secretly and our spies report that he seems to know his business well if he makes them winners he will deserve the credit he will receive but he cant do it no man can coach a crew and pull an oar at the same time the very fact that he is attempting such a thing shows he isnt in the game dont be so sure they say he has a substitute who takes his place in the boat sometimes and that gives him a chance to see just how the crew is working rats who ever heard of such a thing merriwell is all right but he doesnt know anything about rowing he may think he knows but he is fooling himself well we will have to wait and see about that i really believe you are afraid of merriwell why ha ha ha you are the only one who has an idea the freshmen will be in the race at all i know it but few have had any idea that the freshmen could do any of the things they have done they have fooled us right along and oh say give me a cigarette and lets drop it from the way you talk i should say you would make a good sporting editor for a sundayschool paper thats all right muttered hartwick sulkily as he tossed bruce a package of turkish cigarettes wait and see if i am not right after this bruce went about telling all the sophomores what hartwick thought and urging them to jolly him whenever they could get a chance as a result evan was kept in hot water the most of the time but he persisted in claiming that the freshmen were bound to give them a surprise one evening a jolly party gathered in browning and hartwicks rooms cigarettes were passed around and soon the smoke was thick enough to cut with a knife how are the eggs down where you are taking your meals now horner asked puss parker oh they are birds chirped little tad who was perched on the back of a chair with his cap on the side of his head this produced a general laugh and parker said speaking of birds makes me think that riches hath wings i dropped seventyfive in that little game last night punch swallows groaned in a heartrending way thats nothing he said dolefully i lost a hundred and ten last week and ive been broke ever since wired home for money but the gov didnt respond after that game all i could think of was two pairs three of a kind bobtail flushes and so on i made a dead flunk at recitations for two days the evening after i lost my roll i was to attend a swell affair up on temple street i was in a rocky condition and i took something to brace me up for i knew there would be pretty girls there and i wouldnt have missed it for anything the memory of that horrible game was still with me and whenever my mind wandered i was thinking of jack pots and kindred things well i went to the party and there were plenty of queens there but i didnt seem to enjoy myself for some reason i fancied it possible they might smell my breath and that worried me i thought i would go off by myself and so i wandered into a little room where i imagined i would be alone but hanged if i didnt run into the hostess and a stack of ladies then with my mind confused i made a fool of myself er er excuse me i stammered what room is this this is the anteroom sir replied the hostess whats the limit says i as i fumbled in my pocket then i took a tumble to myself and chased out in a hurry i saw the girls staring after me as if they thought me crazy it was awful oh well you mustnt mind the loss of a few dollars said andy emery a man can make a fortune in this country picking up chips if he puts them on the right card put a little perfumery on that before you use it again emery grinned tad horner its got whiskers i think swallows all right but he reminds me of a man i knew once on a time i havent seen swallows when he had over twentyfive at a time since hes been here and still he says he dropped a hundred and ten in one game how about this man you knew asked parker he was a great fellow to stretch the long bow and it became such a habit that he could not break it he seemed to prefer a falsehood to the truth even when the truth would have served him better well he died and was buried one day i visited the cemetery and gazed on his tombstone on the top of the stone was his name and on the bottom were these words i am not dead but sleeping now that man was lying in his grave for his habit parker flung a slipper at emery who dodged it the slipper struck tad horner and knocked him off the back of the chair thats all right said swallows nodding at emery who was laughing ill square that the first chance i get do but when you get a roll remember there are others who are looking for you drop this persiflage and come down to business said browning winking at the others and nodding toward hartwick who did not seem to be taking any interest in what was going on lets talk about the races yas by jawve drawled willis paulding who tried to be deucedly english in everything lets talk about the races deah boys thats what interests me dont yer know hartwick squirmed he knew what was coming and still his disposition was such that he could not resist a jolly in case the jolliers expressed opinions that did not agree with his own browning enjoyed seeing the gang get hartwick on a string and he was ever ready to aid anything of the kind along by nature the king of sophomores was a practical joker he had put up more jobs than any man who ever entered yale that was what had given him his reputation i understand the freshmen are rapidly coming to the front observed hod chadwick with apparent seriousness is that right asked parker heard anything new why they say this merriwell has the genuine oxford system whered he get it he has been abroad it is even reported that he has studied at oxford he has watched the work of the oxford coach and he is working the freshmen eight on the same lines thats right thats right nodded hartwick and the boys winked at each other how do you know it is right asked emery what do you know about merriwell i know he has been abroad and i have it straight that he spent considerable time at oxford thats nothing any lubber might watch the work at oxford but what would that amount to merriwell is no lubber as you fellows should know by this time we dont seem to know much of anything about him who are his parents what about them i hear his father was drowned in bed murmured tad horner by jawve exclaimed willis paulding how could that happen there was a hole in the mattress and he fell through into the spring gravely assured tad willis nearly lost his breath thats all wrong said browning its true merriwell is no lubber why should he be his father was a skipper what a sea captain asked hartwick no a bank cashier he skipped to canada wow whooped tad horner how that hurt dont do it again you fellows have things twisted asserted parker with apparent seriousness i have private advices that merriwells father is a poor dentist a poor dentist eh yes rather poor but he manages to pull out tad horner fell off the back of his chair and struck sprawling on the floor water he gasped you wouldnt know it if you saw it grinned parker without a doubt and without any fooling merriwells father is dead said hod chadwick do you know this for a fact asked swallows yes it is said that he died on the field then he was a soldier no a baseball umpire this is a very dry crowd laughed browning i should think you would say something hinted chadwick it isnt in the house well go down to moreys after supper settles and ill blow to fizz not this evening ale is good enough for this crowd oh i dont suppose we can kick at that but we were speaking about merriwell and the freshman crew how are we to escape death at their hands have another cigarette all around invited parker as he passed them thats too slow but ill take a cigarette just the same hartwick got up and walked about in a corner showing nervousness they urged him to sit down and take things easy he felt like making a break and getting out but he knew they would roar with laughter if he did you fellows are a lot of chumps he exclaimed suddenly getting angry you treat this matter lightly now but you are likely to change your tune after the race the boys were well satisfied for they saw he was getting aroused oh i dont know as we treat it so very lightly said emery weve got to have our fun no matter what we may think but every one of you is of the opinion that we are going to have a cinch with the freshmen it does look easy have they been easy thus far oh thats different you will find this is different when it is all over now see here hartwick said parker you are the only soph who does not think we have a soft thing with the freshmen whats the matter with you why he wants to disagree with us thats all said browning why he wouldnt eat anything if he thought it would agree with him thats the kind of a man he is hartwick looked disgusted keep it up keep it up he cried but youll find out now see here man said parker once more are you stuck on merriwell hartwick showed still greater disgust his eyes flashing stuck on him he cried well not any you fellows ought to know that stuck on him that gives me pains well i couldnt see what ailed you unless you were it is because i am not stuck on him that i am so anxious to beat him as you fellows ought to be able to see oh thats it excuse me well now how is he going to make a lot of lubberly freshies beat us hes found some men who can pull oars all right and he has introduced a few innovations that will be surprises how do you know so much about it i have been investigating and i am not the only one well what are his innovations the oxford oar in the first place what is that two to four inches longer than our oar with a blade five and onehalf inches wide instead of seven inches for goodness sake what is the advantage of such an oar ill tell you with a short course and high stroke no set of men are strong enough to use the old oar and go the distance without weakening you must admit that well with the narrow blades a longer oar can be used and the leverage increased that is plain enough the boys were silent for some moments here was a matter they had not considered and they were forced to confess that it was a point for discussion but that is not enough to enable the freshmen to win even admitting the english oar to be better which has not been proven said emery by jawve i am rather inclined to believe the english oar is superior dont yer know put in willis paulding thats not surprising in your case said emery thats not all merriwell has done declared hartwick what else has he done he has introduced the oxford style of catch finish and length of strokes which means a longer swing with more leg and body work well that will cook em cried tad horner if he has done that well make a show of those greenies what reason have you for thinking anything of the sort every reason the regular yale stroke cannot be improved upon that is beyond question hartwick smiled wearily thats what i call conceit he said you dont know whether it can be improved upon or not there was an outburst of protests by the boys who believed as almost every yale man believes that yale methods are correct and cannot be improved upon hartwick was regarded as disloyal and all felt like giving it to him hot a longer body swing is certain to make a difficult recovery said browning that is plain enough not if the men are worked right and put in proper form declared hartwick i have been told that the english long stroke and recovery is very graceful and easy and that it does not wear on a man like the american stroke by jawve i think thats right dont yer know said paulding what you think doesnt count muttered tad horner with such a stroke and swing the men are bound to recover on their toes asserted browning oh rats said punch swallows what does that amount to anyway in a case like this we are talking of this tub load of freshmen as if they were the varsity crew whats the use it wont make any difference what kind of a stroke they use they are mighty liable to use several different kinds and they wont be in it at all my children lets go down to moreys and oil up go ahead said hartwick grimly but you will think over what i have said after the race comes off the boys put on their caps and trooped out laughing and talking as they went chapter xviii merriwell and rattleton harry hello youve got to stop smoking those confounded cigarettes harry rattleton let his feet fall with a thump from the table on which they had been comfortably resting and turned about to stare at merriwell his roommate his face expressed astonishment not unmingled with anger will you be good enough to repeat that remark he said exhaling a cloud of smoke and holding his roll daintily poised in his fingers i said that you must stop smoking cigarettes well what did you mean i am in the habit of saying what i mean was the quiet answer as frank scanned the paper over which he had been pondering for some time harry got upon his feet shoved one hand into his trousers pocket and stared in silence for some seconds at merriwell that stare was most expressive well may i be jotally tiggered i mean totally jiggered he finally exclaimed youll be worse than that if you keep on with those things asserted frank youll be totally wrecked this is the first time you have had the crust to deliberately tell me that i must do anything growled harry resentfully and i feel free to say that i dont like it much it is carrying the thing altogether too far i have never told you that you must do this thing or you mustnt do that i should have considered that i was beddling with something that was none of my misness er meddling with something that was none of my business frank perceived that his roommate was quite heated so he dropped the paper and said dont fly off the handle so quick old man i am speaking for your own good and you should know it thank you sarcastically but i am in earnest really and rattleton elevated his eyebrows come now said frank sit down and we will talk it over talk it over eh i dont know why we should talk over a matter that concerns me alone your dinner did not set well i never saw you so touchy in all my life you know i am your friend old man and there is no reason why you should show such a spirit toward me i dont like to be told what i must do and what i mustnt by anybody thats all there is about it harry did sit down but he lighted a fresh cigarette well i suppose you will have your own way but i want to explain why i said what i did you know we are out to beat the sophs in the boat race sure well in order to do it every man of us must be in the pink of condition you are not drinking and old put doesnt know how much you are smoking if he did he would call you down or drop you it is pretty certain that gordon would take your place well i suppose you are going to tell old put all about it is that what you mean not exactly but you know i have as much interest in the makeup of our crew as old put although he is the man who really has charge of us well if i were to say so you would be taken out and some one else would fill your place and would you do that not unless forced to do so you should know harry that i am ready to stick by you in anything if i can if you can i dont understand that hang me if i do if i have a friend i am going to stick to him through anything right or wrong thats first rate and it is all right if you get into any trouble i fancy you will not find anybody who will stand by you any longer but this matter is different you are in training and you are not supposed to smoke at all but you get here in this room and puff away by the hour what harm does it do a great deal get out it doesnt make a dit of bifference thats what you think but i know better at fardale i had a chum who smoked cigarettes by the stack he was a naturalborn athlete but he never seemed quite able to take the lead in anything it was his wind i talked to him but he thought i didnt know finally i induced him to leave off smoking entirely he did it though it was like taking his teeth it was not long before he showed an improvement in his work the improvement continued and he went up to the very top he acknowledged that he could not have accomplished it if he had kept on with his cigarettes now old man continued frank coming over and putting a hand on harrys shoulder in a friendly way i am interested in you and i want to see you stay on our crew you must know that i am giving it to you straight harry was silent gazing down at the floor while his cigarette was going out still held between his fingers i am going to tell you something that you do not know frank went on old put has been asking me to give gordon more of a show he thinks gordon is a better man than you but i know better if you will leave cigarettes alone you are the man for the place gordon has a beautiful back and splendid shoulders but he lacks heart or i am much mistaken it takes nerve to pull an oar in a race a man has got to keep at it for all there is in him till he drops and he mustnt drop till the race is over thats why i want you i am confident that you will pull your arms out before you give up but you wont have the wind for the race unless you quit cigarettes and quit them immediately harry was still silent but his head was lower and he was biting his lips the cigarette in his fingers had quite gone out come now harry came earnestly from frank just cut clear from the things they never did any man any good and they have taken the wind and nerve out of hundreds you dont want me to keep you on the crew and lose the race by doing so you dont want it said that i have been partial to you because you are my roommate and particular friend thats what will be said if things go wrong the fellows will declare i was prejudiced against gordon and they will not be to blame unless you can prove yourself the best man i have nothing against gordon and i am bound to use him as white as i can i have explained why i dont want him on the crew and i have tried to make it clear why ill have to let him come on at once unless you drop cigarettes how is it my boy what do you say harry got up and went into the bedroom a moment later he came out with a big package of cigarettes in his hands he opened the window and flung them as far as possible there he cried by the mumping joses i mean the jumping moses im done with em im not going to smoke them any more good boy laughed frank his face full of satisfaction shake they clasped hands rattattat a knock at the door come in the door opened and dismal jones his face longer and sadder than usual came slouching into the room hello jones old boy cried frank cheerfully what is troubling you now you look like a funeral im mad said dismal in a spiritless way is that what ails you id never suspected it from your appearance appearances are oftentimes deceitful croaked jones whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise well sit down and tell us all about it invited frank offering a chair my boy it must be that you are studying too hard you have the outward appearance of a greasy grind whats that i just told you about appearances you are too hasty in your judgments the trouble with me this evening is that i have found out something i never supposed it would trouble you like this wait you do not know what it is thats right what is it frank was familiar with dismals queer ways and he knew it was not easy to tell when this son of a shouting methodist was jollying and when he was in earnest but now he was convinced that jones was really serious and he felt that there must be some cause for it harry strangely sobered and silent sat listening he could not understand jones and he was on his guard knowing how often the fellow turned into a farce what seemed a serious matter dismal locked his fingers and twiddled his thumbs he cleared his throat and then said merry what would you say if i were to tell everything i could find out about our crew to the sophs i should say you were a confounded sneak hum i kinder thought youd say something like that but you do not know too much about the crew i know something and i could know more if i had a mind to all i would have to do would be to play the spy a little well i suppose that is right what about it somebody is playing the spy how do you know ive got it straight enough for the sophs know all about what our crew is doing they are laughing over the oxford stroke and the english oars how do you know this heard em when tonight where on the street browning and a party were going down to moreys and they were having a high old time with hartwick who was explaining the advantages of the stroke and the oars our crew has adopted thats not proof that somebody has played the spy it may have slipped out through the carelessness of some of our men it may but i dont think so i heard emery ask hartwick how he knew so much about us what did hartwick say frank eagerly asked he said he had a nice fresh flat who thought it a fine thing to play the spy and blab all he found out blay bluses i mean blue blazes cried harry banging his fist down on the table thats what makes me cot under the hollar a man who would do a thing like that will steal a sheep id like to have the pleasure of thumping him a few times just a few merriwell was silent a dark look on his face it will not be healthy for the spy if i catch him he finally declared ill make it pretty hot for him around here which would be a highly commendable action bowed dismal have you any idea who would do such a lowdown thing asked harry sometimes we have ideas which we do not care to express thats right but in a case like this confidentially to us you know well if i say anything it is to be strictly confidential sure cried frank and harry in a breath you both give me your word for it we do if i knew i would not hesitate to come out openly and accuse the fellow said dismal but this is merely a case of suspicion and i will tell you who i suspect go ahead well there is a certain fellow who has not been above playing into the hands of the sophs in the past and it is natural for me to suspect him his name is the door opened and roland ditson came in without knocking chapter xix who is the traitor hello fellows cried ditson how are yer jones i am surprised to see you here is it possible you have let up cramming long enough to make a call why i have even heard that you had your eye on some classical scholarship prize as soon as this everybody who knows you says youre a regular hardworking old dig there are fools who know other peoples business a great deal better than their own said dismal stiffly thats right nodded ditson who made a great effort to be rakish in his appearance but always appeared rather foxy instead but i tell you this matter of burning the midnight oil and grinding is not what its cracked up to be it makes a man old before his time and it doesnt amount to much after he has been all through it goodness knows we freshmen have to cram hard enough to get through i am tired of it already and then we have to live outside the pale as it were when we become sophs well be able to give up boarding houses and live in the dormitories thats what i am anxious for it strikes me that you are very partial to sophs said dismal giving roll a piercing look ditson was not fazed theyre a rather clever gang of fellows he said freshmen are very new as a rule of course there are exceptions and i suppose you consider yourself one oh i cant tell about that but supposing i am by the time i become a soph some of the newness will have worn off i am not particularly impressed with any freshman who seems to think so much of sophomores you ought to stay with them all the time oh i dont know they have treated me rather well and i have found the most of them easy people they seem to have found some freshman easy fruit somebody has been blowing to them about our crew i know it was ditsons surprising confession and thats why i dropped in here i wanted to tell merriwell about it jones gasped for breath he was too surprised to speak for some minutes ditson took out a package of cigarettes offering them first to harry who shook his head what cried roll amazed you wont smoke no whats that mean i have left off said harry with an effort left off oh say thats too good you leave off a bit of color came to rattletons face and he gave ditson a look that was not exactly pleasant but roll was too occupied with his merriment to observe it frank was studying ditson he watched the fellows every movement and expression roll knew it was useless to offer cigarettes to merriwell or jones so he selected one from the package kneaded it daintily pulled a little tobacco from the ends moistened the paper with his lips and then lighted it with a wax match say harry old man i pity you he said with a taunting laugh looking at harry ive tried it its no use youll break over before two days are up yes before one day is up its no use rattleton bit his lips why you are dying for a whiff now chuckled ditson i know you are i got along a whole day but it was a day of the most intense torture there may be others with more stamina than you ditson snapped rattleton just because you couldnt leave off a bad habit its no sign that nobody can oh i suppose not but whats the use dont get hot old man you ought to know my way by this time i do what is it that you came to tell me asked frank eh oh about the sophs those fellows seem to know more about our crew than i do what do they know why they know our men are using english oars have adopted a new stroke and have done several other things now those are matters on which i was not informed myself how do you know the sophs know so much ive just come from moreys went in there with cressy fine fellow he is while i was in there browning and his crowd wandered in they were drinking ale and discussing the race i heard what they were saying couldnt help hearing you know they were talking about our crew and the new methods you had introduced it was mighty interesting to me as i didnt know about those new methods myself how innocent muttered jones ditson elevated his eyebrows whats that he demanded why shouldnt i be innocent i am not on the crew and the men are training and practicing secretly i have had no way of finding out what they were doing but some sneak has cried rattleton fiercely and hes been and blowed all he found out unless somebody on the crew has done the blowing suggested roll exhaling a great puff of smoke that is barely possible you understand possible no cried frank theres not a man on the crew who would do such a thing oh well i suppose you know but i understand there are two who are kept in form as substitutes one of them thinks he should be on the crew he is rather jealous of somebody who fills his place he might be the one who has talked too much you dont mean rattleton ought to be able to guess who i mean craftily said ditson as he arose im not calling names for i dont know anything certain if i had proof but i havent never mind you ought to know enough to watch a certain fellow who thinks his place is filled by a person not his equal he says there is favoritism in the matter i rather think i have spoken plainly enough wish you success merry old man evening fellows ditson departed our hero rattleton and jones sat and looked at each other in grim silence for several minutes well frank broke the spell looking keenly at jones as he spoke i dunno mumbled dismal falling into the manner of speaking that had been habitual with him from his childhood i dunno hanged if i do you thought you knew when you came in my boy thats right but i dunno but i was off my trolley and still still what i dont like the man i suspected but i never thought the fellow shrewd enough to play a double game perhaps it is because you do not like him that you suspected him oh it may be it may be and i dont suppose that is a square deal i didnt have absolute proof you were going to name him when ditson came in i was but i will not call any names now i propose to look into this matter somewhat likely its too late to prevent the traitor from completing the damage but he can be exposed it will be some satisfaction to see him held up to public scorn that is true dismal and i want you to do your best to find out who the man is make a sure thing of it get positive proof if possible whoever he is his sin is sure to find him out there were footsteps on the stairs and the sound of laughing voices the door burst open and several freshmen came trooping in as if they felt quite at home there lucy little was at their head and his face showed excitement i say merriwell he cried are you out for a little sport tonight that depends on what sort of sport it is sh said little mysteriously close the door uncle a fellow by the name of silas blossom who was familiarly called uncle obeyed little looked at rattleton and then stared hard at jones who had the face of a parson i dont know about you he said but i think you are all right even if you have scruples i dont believe you will blow very kind grunted dismal the rest of the gang is all right said little then give us your scheme spluttered harry whose curiosity was thoroughly aroused dont bush around the beat i mean beat around the bush what do you fellows say to a turkey chase asked little a turkey chase yes out around west rock way there are plenty of old farmers who have good fat turkeys out that way it is a good cool night and we can capture two turkeys without trouble then well take em in here and have a roast are you wid us those who are not wid us are agin us fiercely declared bandy robinson and that is dead right me bhoys nodded arthur street who was known at yale as easy street on account of his freeandeasy way merriwell hesitated he was in for any kind of honest sport but he did not quite fancy the idea of stealing turkeys why dont we buy our turkeys at the markets he asked the other lads stared at him in astonishment buy them they shouted say are you dafty man where would the fun come in you know better than to propose such a thing stolen fruit is ever the sweetest quoth uncle blossom its not many fellows we would take into such a scheme but you were just the man we wanted merriwell if we bought a turkey we wouldnt have any appetite for it now the run out into the country and back will give us an appetite one fellow will have to stay here and get the fire ready while the rest of us chase turks come on man its what you need to start your blood circulating merriwell seemed to suddenly make up his mind i am with you he said as he arose who stays and looks after the fire we dont want anybody along that cant run well im no sprinter confessed dismal id like to go along but im afraid id peg out ill have things ready when you show up but what time will you be back frank looked at his watch and then made a mental calculation it will be about eleven he said all right say jones said street just go down to billys and get a few bottles of beer well need it to wash the turk down and cigars cried blossom dont forget cigars what would a turkey feast be without a smoke afterward matters were soon arranged and it was not long before five freshmen left mrs harringtons quiet house for freshmen and started along york street at a brisk steady jog merriwell took the lead and the others came after him at regular distances the night air was rather sharp and there was a bright moon along the streets of new haven the five freshmen ran and those who observed them supposed they were some crew in training merriwell set a moderate pace for he knew it was likely they would need all their wind on the return there was no telling what sort of a scrape they might get into rattleton was behind taking things as easy as possible he filled his lungs with the crisp clear air and it made him feel like a young race horse but he held himself in check street actually loafed along although he managed to keep his place if one of us is caught hell be like the gangplank of a steamer called harry as they left the main part of the city and entered the suburbs hows that asked blossom pulled in chirped rattleton dont stop to throw anything this way keep right on they say browning was caught swiping turks in his freshman year said lewis and it cost his old man a round sum to settle and keep the thing quiet so bruce wouldnt be expelled dad browning has got money to burn well his sons a good match for him merriwell tossed over his shoulder a good match for him oh say gasped robinson exhibiting signs of sudden weakness away they went laughing and jesting finally leaving the city behind and getting out into the country up hill and down dale they steadily jogged covering mile after mile in a rather surprising manner at length merriwell called a halt and they held a council of war blossom said he knew where they were certain to find turkeys and so they gave him the lead he confessed that there was a chance of getting into trouble as the owner of the turkeys had been robbed before and he might be on the watch that simply added zest to the adventure and there was not one of the party who would have consented to look elsewhere for their turkeys they finally came in sight of a farmhouse that sat on the side of a hill near the house was a stable and sheds a large orchard lay back of the sheds there said blossom that is where old baldwin lives and his turks are in one of those sheds crumping jickets i mean jumping crickets exclaimed harry how bright the moon shines if hes on the watch we cant get anywhere near those sheds without being seen the boys began to realize that they were engaged in a decidedly perilous adventure if one of them should be caught it would mean almost certain expulsion from college besides a heavy fine if the case were carried to court well have to approach by way of the orchard said frank does baldwin keep a dog sure a big halfblood bull thats nice we are liable to find plenty of fun here every man must provide himself with a stout and heavy club to use on that dog in case of emergency that is important the lights are out and it looks as if the farmer and his family were sleeping soundly but as jones says appearances are sometimes deceptive well have to take our chances three of us will go through the orchard the other two must get near the house in front and be ready to create a diversion in case we are discovered harry you and bandy take the front you are both good runners if mr baldwin and his dog get after us attract his attention in some manner and get him after us thats the idea jupiter i wish i had brought a gun for that dog bandy you are liable to have to use those crooked legs of yours in a decidedly lively manner before the night is over when everything was arranged harry and bandy advanced along the road going forward slowly while frank blossom and little made a detour and came into the orchard the hearts of the boys were in their throats and still there was something about the adventure that filled them with the keenest delight each one had secured a club and they were ready to give the dog a warm reception if he came for them little watched beneath a tree while merriwell and blossom slipped up to one of the sheds which had a favorable look in the meantime rattleton and robinson had got near the front of the house and were hiding in a ditch waiting and listening i am surprised that merriwell should agree to take a hand in this whispered harry he is a queer chap has scruples about doing certain things i thought he would object to hooking out a turk oh such a thing as this isnt really stealing protested robinson it is different in our minds but not in the mind of farmer baldwin by a long shot if were caught it will be called stealing oh well a fellow who wont do anything like this is too good for this world hes got wings sprouting you know well enough that merriwell is no softie returned harry rather warmly hes proved that any man has a right to his ideas and if he thinks a thing wrong hes justified in refusing to have anything to do with it perhaps so but merriwell is right on the limit now how he will not drink he does not smoke and i never have heard him cuss does it make a fellow a man to drink and smoke and swear i tell you youll go a long distance before you find a fellow who is any more of a man than frank merriwell i was dead lucky when i got him for a roommate youre stuck on him i say he is all right but he is on the limit i believe the fellows would like him better if he would break over once in a while i doubt it but it is awful still around here i wonder where that dog can be it would be a surprise if the fellows got away with the turks without making any noise at there was a sudden hubbub a terrible squalling and squawking the barking of a dog and the report of a gun chapter xx a hot chase my stars gasped harry theres trouble sure enough i should remark palpitated robinson ill bet a dollar one of the fellows is full of shot and somebody is in danger of being full of teeth directly come this is our time to create a diversion then harry let himself out he whooped like a wild indian and pranced right up toward the house robinson followed the good example but they did not seem very successful in attracting attention to themselves two dark figures were seen scudding through the orchard and then a man came out of the house slamming the door and shouting sick em tige sick the pesky rascals chaw em up dont let em git erway take em dorg the dog was doing his duty in the vicinity of one of the sheds but his barking suddenly turned to howls of pain and several blows were distinctly heard despite the two yelling and dancing lads in the road the old farmer made for the shed and it was seen that he had a gun in his hands hes going to shoot somebody cried harry wildly we must hake a tand er take a hand in this come on with all the speed he could command rattleton dashed after the farmer the barking of the dog had suddenly ceased and a third dark figure was seen scudding through the orchard stop you pesky thief yelled the farmer if you dont stop ill shoot ill fire ye full of lead then he halted and raised his gun to his shoulder he was quite unaware that harry was now quite close upon him when rattleton saw the man raise the gun he swung back the hand that held the heavy stick with all his strength he hurled the stick at the farmer whiz it sped through the air and struck the man fairly between the shoulders at the same instant the gun spoke but the farmer went down in a heap and his aim was spoiled had to do it to save some one of the fellows from carrying off a load of buckshot muttered rattleton who was desperate i dont want to see anybody shot tonight he did not stop running but he dashed straight up to the man snatched up the gun and fled onward hey hey cried the man as he scrambled to his feet consarn you drop that gun bring it back come get it invited harry with a defiant laugh the farmer started after the boy who led him a merry chase across the fields and over the fences harry kept just far enough ahead to lure the panting man on if i ever git my hands on ye youll go to jail declared the farmer ill learn you pesky rascals a lesson teach not learn uncle harry flung back you should be more careful about your grammar i believe you are one of them consarned student fellers you are a wonderful guesser if i cant ketch ye ill report ye when he had lead the man far enough so that he was sure the other fellows had plenty of start harry tossed aside the gun which was an old muzzleloading singlebarreled affair the panting farmer stopped and picked up the gun then he stood and shook his fist at rattleton who was speeding away like a deer oh ill report ye i will by jee he vowed over and over in the meantime merriwell had had a most exciting adventure he had found the turkey roost and had selected the biggest old gobbler of them all but the gobbler was a hard customer and he showed fight whereupon there was a general squawking and squalling clinging to his capture frank made a dash for the door he tripped and fell and it is certain that by falling he saved himself from carrying off a charge of shot if not from death he had tripped over a rope that connected with a spring gun which was discharged and some of the shot tore through his coat sleeve then he heard the dog and he knew he was in for a hot time he gave the old gobblers neck a fierce wring then dropped the turkey just in time to meet the dog the creature sprang for franks throat and the boy struck him with the club which he had brought along the dog dropped to the ground but immediately made another dash frank was fortunate in getting in a lick that stretched the animal quivering on the ground he could hear rattleton and robinson whooping wildly but he knew no time was to be lost in getting away so he caugh up the gobbler and ran frank heard the farmer calling for him to stop but with mr gobbler dangling on his back he fled the faster the gun spoke but he was not touched and he did not stop to look around so he did not know how harry had saved him threequarters of an hour later the five fellows who had started out on the turkey chase met on the outskirts of new haven they came up one at a time rattleton being the last to appear there was a general feeling of relief when it was found that all were there safe and sound it was decided that they should go into the city one at a time taking different routes frank believed he could reach the house without being stopped although it would be no very easy job he was remarkably successful until he was on york street and close to mrs harringtons the street seemed clear and he wondered where all the fellows could be when of a sudden a tall form in dark clothes stepped right out before him he gave a gasp for at a glance he seemed to recognize one of the professors young man sternly said a familiar voice what have you there its professor grant thought frank aghast the professor blocked his way what could he do quick as a flash he swung the gobbler around and struck his challenger a smashing blow with it knocking him sprawling then he took to his heels still holding fast to his capture in a moment he heard the sound of feet in pursuit and he knew the outraged professor was after him franks heart was in his mouth and he felt scared for the first time that night he was certain it would mean expulsion to be caught for all of the running he had done that night he fled like a frightened deer occasionally glancing over his shoulder he had never dreamed that professor grant was a sprinter but the man was running at great speed seemed to be gaining stop sir cried the pursuer i tell you to stop not much thought frank i wont stop if you catch me your wind is better than i think it is he did not dare go into his house so he dashed past cut into another street turned corner after corner and still he found himself pursued it seemed marvelous that professor grant could keep up such a pace finally the pursuer called merriwell is that you no answer i know you declared the pursuer and now frank perceived that that voice did not sound like professor grant you are a crackajack runner i wanted to give you a try to see what you could do ill see you tomorrow goodnight the pursuer gave up the chase as i live i believe it was pierson manager of the ball team muttered frank when he was sure it was no trick and he was no longer followed he looks something like professor grant and he is a great mimic thats just who it was a short time later he was in his room where a jovial party of freshmen was gathered chapter xxi roast turkey franks appearance with the turkey still in his possession was hailed with shouts of delight we didnt know as you would get in said jones i invited some more of the fellows up here as you see and we found out that some of the sophs seemed to know something unusual was going on thats right nodded rattleton they were laying for us two of them stopped me when i reached york street they told me to give up what i had but i didnt have anything to give up so they let me go then frank told of his adventure with a person who looked like professor grant thats it cried little that was their game they were after our turkey but how did they know we were after turkey asked robinson they must have been told by somebody said street and that means we have a tattler among us declared burnham putnam old put looking keenly around the boys looked at each other suspiciously wondering if there was one of the number who would carry to the sophs to franks surprise he saw that walter gordon was there jack diamond was also present frank found an opportunity to get close to dismal and whisper in his ear great caesar old man why did you invite gordon here i did not then how does he happen to be here he didnt come without an invitation i am sure of that he was in billys when i asked put to come up i knew you would like to have put here thats all right well put asked gordon to come along before i could prevent it of course i didnt have the crust to make any objection after that i should say not its all right but you want to remember that the sophs found out something was going on did gordon come right along with you no he said hed have to go to his room but he showed up a few minutes after we arrived here lots of mischief can be done in a few minutes did he know just what was going on here well he knew somebody had gone out into the country to swipe something for a feast and it is pretty plain that the sophs became aware of the same fact here is food for reflection dismal you are right the foragers told of their adventures in capturing the turkey and there was a great deal of laughter over it merriwell showed how near he came to getting shot and it was universally agreed that he was remarkably lucky harry told how he had bowled the old farmer over just as the man was about to shoot at frank and then he convulsed them with laughter by relating the capture of the gun and the chase he had led the hayseed robinson said he thought harry was crazy when he rushed after the farmer in the way he did i couldnt understand what sort of a game he was up to said bandy and i didnt feel like following him into the jaws of the lion so i held aloof i saw him fling his club at the old duffer and saw it knock him down then when i was sure harry was all right i legged it farmer baldwins dog will have a sore head in the morning smiled frank the last crack i gave him stretched him quivering on the ground hope it didnt kill the brute hope it didnt shouted little i hope it did but i dont want to pay for his old dog pay for it are you dopy daft or whats the matter with you why that man had a spring gun set and it would have filled you full of shot if you hadnt tripped he had a right to set a spring gun in his own shed to protect his turkey roost from marauders the boys stared at frank in amazement say merriwell said uncle blossom gravely youre an enigma great poker the idea of calling us marauders what else were we boys it is our duty to take him out and hold him under under the hose gentlemen said jack diamond who was present you will have a real lively time if you try to do it i fully agree with mr merriwell that the farmer had a right to protect his property wheeew whistled several lads and then they all cried together goodness how the wind blows the boys had come to understand in a measure diamonds chivalric nature and sentiments and it did not seem strange that he should see something improper in stealing turkeys from a farmer but it did appear rather remarkable that merriwell should maintain such an idea after he had taken a hand in the game it must be that you chaps intend to become parsons after you leave college said walter gordon rather derisively and merriwell would pay for the dog if he killed the beast exclaimed uncle blossom how about the turkey i should have thought youd paid for that i did what that word was a roar and it seemed to leap from the lips of every lad in the room with the exception of diamond and merriwell the boys were all on their feet and they stared at frank with bulging eyes as if they beheld a great curiosity merriwell simply smiled he was quite cool and unruffled you you paid for the turkey gasped lucy little as if it cost him a mighty effort to get the words out exactly bowed frank how when where i pinned a fivedollar bill to the roost before i laid violent hands on the old gobbler baldwin will find it there in the morning water panted robinson as he flopped down on a chair i think i am going to faint oh think of the beautiful beers that v would have paid for sighed robinson with a doleful shake of his head this is a disgrace on the famous class of umptyeight shouted lewis little we can never wipe it out i fear not said easy street it is really awful and to think merriwell should have done it it would have served him right if that spring gun had filled him with shot excuse these few tears exclaimed blossom who had secretly opened a bottle of beer and saturated his handkerchief with the contents he now proceeded to wring the handkerchief in a highly dramatic manner go ahead laughed frank have all the sport you like over it but i feel easy in my mind some one proposed not to eat the turkey at all but there was a dissenting shout at that then the bird was taken down into the cellar by three of them and stripped of its feathers a pan and necessary dishes had been borrowed of mrs harrington and there was a roaring hardwood fire in the open grate harry officiated as cook and set about his duties in a manner that showed he was not a novice while the other lads looked on with great interest telling stories and cracking jokes merriwell offered to bet robinson that woman was created before man but bandy was shy scenting a sell however frank kept at him finally offering to let robinson himself decide at length robinson bit and a small wager was made now cried bandy go ahead and prove that woman was made before man you cant do it thats dead easy smiled frank i know you will readily acknowledge that eve was the first maid no ill be hanged if then robinson stopped short for he saw the point and the others were laughing heartily and applauding the first maid he muttered oh thunder what a soft thing i am you have won merriwell the turkey began to give out a most delicious odor and the boys snuffed the air with the keenest delight how hungry they were how jolly everything seemed there was not one of the party who did not feel very grateful to think he was living that night at last the turkey was done harry pronounced it done and it was certainly browned and basted in beautiful style it was a monster but there would be none too much for that famished crowd frank and blossom assisted harry in serving there were not enough plates for all but that did not matter they managed to get along all right some were forced to drink their beer out of the bottle but nobody murmured the turkey was white and tender and it was certainly very well cooked it had a most delicious flavor and how good the beer was with it how those fellows jollied merriwell because he would not even taste the beer and still they secretly admired him for it he had the nerve to say no and stick to it which they could not help admiring when the turkey was all gone cigars were passed and nearly every one fired up then harry and frank got out a banjo and mandolin and gave the party some lively music it was long after two oclock but who cared for that nobody thought of the hour if mrs harrington complained in the morning she must be pacified with a peace offering they sang old man moses solomon levi bingo and a dozen more there were some fine voices among them finally a quartet was formed consisting of merriwell rattleton diamond and blossom it positively was a treat to hear them sing goodby my little lady the boats are pushing from the shore goodby my little lady with brawny arm and trusty oar each man is up and ready i see our colors dancing where sunlit waves are glancing a fond adieu ill say to you my lady true and fair goodby goodby my lady sweet goodby my little lady goodby goodby again well meet so heres farewell my lady oh those old college songs how they linger in the memory how the sound of them in after years stirs the blood and quickens the pulse and never can other songs seem half so beautiful as those it was after two when the party broke up but it was a night long to be remembered chapter xxii a surprise for frank on the following morning merriwell arose with a headache the smoke was too much for me last night he said it was thick enough to chop in this room and you dont know how i wanted to have a whiff with the fellows said harry dolefully it was awful to see them enjoying cigars and cigarettes and not touch one myself but you didnt smiled frank good boy stick to that just as long as you wish to keep a place in athletics i dont know which is the worst smoking or midnight suppers midnight suppers are bad things and you will observe that i seldom indulge in them if i was on one of the regular teams i could not indulge at all ill not have any part in another affair like that of last night till after the race from now till it is over i am going to live right well ill do my best to stick with you if you see me up to anything improper just call me down agreed there was no time for a cold bath before chapel although frank would have given something to indulge in one as it was he dipped his head in cold water opened the window wide and filled his lungs with fresh air then hustled into his clothes and rushed away with the chapel bell clanging and his temples still throbbing the whole forenoon was a drag but he managed to get through the recitations fairly well over and over he promised himself that he would not indulge in another midnight feast until the time came when such dissipation was not likely to do him any particular harm physically at noon as he was crossing the campus he was astonished to see paul pierson a junior and the manager of the regular ball team stop and bow unless it was pierson who had pursued him on the previous night frank had never spoken a word to the fellow in his life and this public recognition of a freshman on the campus by a man like pierson was almost unprecedented ah mr merriwell i would like to speak with you said pierson in a manner that was not exactly unfriendly frank remembered that the fellow who chased him the night before had promised to see him again but he had thought at the time that the man did not mean it now he wondered what in the world pierson could want yes sir said merriwell stopping and bowing respectfully i understand that you are something of a sprinter said pierson as he surveyed the freshman critically a ah friend of mine told me so well i dont know but i believe i can run fairly well replied frank with an air of modesty my friend is a very good judge of runners and he says youre all right in doing so he settled a point in my mind i have been watching your ball playing in practice this fall and i have arrived at the conclusion that you have good stuff in you if you do not get the swelled head young man the swelled head is one of the worst things with which a youth can be afflicted when he gets it for fair it is likely to be his ruin pierson addressed frank as if he were a father speaking to a boy frank felt that the junior was patronizing to a certain extent but the fellows manner of stopping him on the campus was so remarkable that it more than overbalanced his air of superiority wondering what pierson could be driving at frank kept silent and listened now i have a fancy said the baseball magnate that you are rather level headed still the best of them get it sometimes and that is why i am warning you pierson spoke deliberately still looking hard at the freshman who waited quietly hell come to the point if he is given time thought frank i have seen you pitch said pierson and i have watched your delivery and your curves you are very good more than that you bat properly and your judgment is excellent he paused again as if to note what impression this praise made upon the other frank felt his cheeks grow warm but his voice was perfectly steady as he said thank you sir i did not know just what you would do when it came to running till my friend saw you run pierson went on he says you are all right now if you will look out for yourself and keep yourself in condition it is quite possible that you may be given a trial on the regular ball team in the spring frank felt his heart give a great jump on the regular team why he had not dreamed of getting there the very first season was pierson giving him a jolly are you serious sir he asked most certainly mr merriwell answered the junior i can assure you that you stand an excellent chance of having a trial what the result of the trial is will depend entirely upon yourself what position mr pierson well there is but one position that is not well filled weve got men to burn for every other place if you are tried at all it will be in the box heffiner is the only man we have and he cant do all the work there will come times when he will be out of condition to pitch on the regular ball team to be given an opportunity when the great heffiner proved out of condition that was glory indeed no wonder frank merriwell tingled with excitement in every part of his body but it was a wonder that he appeared so cool and self contained pierson was surprised by the freshmans manner for he had expected frank to show excitement and delight what sort of a fellow is this he thought does he really understand me or is he a little thick then he saw by franks fine and highly sensitive face that he could not be thick and he began to perceive that the freshman had nerve that was one of the great requirements for a successful pitcher i have spoken of this to you mr merriwell so you may be keeping yourself in condition through the winter as you will then stand all the better show of making a favorable impression when you are given a trial thank you sir if i were in your place i would not make any talk about it for something may happen that you will not be given a trial in which case it would be very humiliating if you had publicly stated that you were to have a show you may be sure i will say nothing about it mr pierson that is all goodday sir goodday sir pierson passed on quite aware that a number of students were regarding him with the utmost amazement plainly wondering that he should have stopped to talk with a freshman on the campus walter gordon had seen the two speaking together and he hastened to call the attention of some friends to it look there he cried as i live merriwell is talking with pierson whatll you bet the fellows not making a try to get on the regular ball team ha ha ha hes got crust enough for it and i am not sure he hasnt the ability for it said easy street oh rats snapped walter hed go to pieces in the first inning hell never make a pitcher in his life there are others murmured lucy little chapter xxiii the yale spirit frank went to his room with his head in a whirl he had dreamed of working hard to secure a place on the freshman team but he had not dreamed there was a possibility that he would be given a trial in the regular yale nine during his first year in college merriwell knew well enough that phillips men were given the preference in everything at yale as a rule for they had friends to pull them through while the fellows who had been prepared by private tutors lacked such an advantage but frank had likewise discovered that in most cases a man was judged fairly at yale and he could become whatever he chose to make himself in case he had the ability the phillips man might have the advantage at the start but he could not hold the advantage unless he proved himself worthy if the unknown student had nerve and determination he could win his way for all of the wire pulling of the friends of some rival who was not so capable frank had heard the cry which had been raised at that time that the old spirit of democracy was dying out at yale and that great changes had taken place there he had heard that yale was getting to be more like another college where the swell set are strongly in evidence and the senior likely to be very exclusive having but a small circle of speaking acquaintances it was said that in the old days the yale junior or senior knew everybody worth knowing but this had changed the blueblooded aristocrat had appeared at yale and he had chosen his circle of acquaintances with great care to all outward appearances this man believed that outside his limited circle there was nobody at yale worth knowing professor scotch franks guardian had read this in certain newspaper articles relating to yale and had expressed his regret that such should be the case after coming to yale frank kept his eyes open to see to what extent such a state of affairs obtained at first it had seemed that the newspapers were right but he came to see that his position as freshman did not give him the proper opportunity to judge in the course of time frank came to believe that the old spirit was still powerful at yale there were a limited number of young gentlemen who plainly considered themselves superior beings and who positively refused to make acquaintances outside a certain limit but those men held no positions in athletics were seldom of prominence in the societies and were regarded as cads by the men most worth knowing they were to be pitied not envied at yale the old democratic spirit still prevailed the young men were drawn from different social conditions and in their homes they kept to their own set but they seemed to leave this aside and they mingled and submerged their natural differences under that one broad generalization the yale man and merriwell was to find that this extended even to their social life their dances their secret societies where all who showed themselves to have the proper dispositions and qualifications were admitted without distinction of previous condition or rank in their own homes each class associated with itself it is true the members making no close friendships with members of other classes with the possible exception of the juniors and seniors where class feeling did not seem to run so high a man might know men of other classes but he never took them for chums the democratic spirit at yale came mainly from athletics as frank soon discovered every class had half a dozen teams tennis baseball football the crew and so on everybody even the greasy grinds seemed interested in the something and so one or more of these organization had some sort of a claim on everybody besides this there was the general work in the gymnasium almost every member of every class appearing there at some time or other taking exercise as a pastime or a necessity the varsity athletic organization drew men from every class not excepting the professional and graduate schools and counting the trials and everything brought together hundreds of men in athletics strength and skill win regardless of money or family so it happened that the poorest man in the university stood a show of becoming the lion and idol of the whole body of young men compulsory chapel every morning brought together the entire college and had its effect in making everybody acquainted with everybody else a great fosterer of the democratic spirit was the old yale fence over the departure of which old grads are forever shedding bitter tears the student who had not known the old fence was inclined to smile wearily over the expressions of regret at its loss but still the old grad continued to insist that the fence was one of the crowning beauties of yale and that nothing can ever replace it on the old fence men read the newspapers crammed for recitation gossiped told stories talked athletics sung songs flirted with passing girls and got acquainted oh yes it was a great fosterer of the democratic spirit in the promotion of this spirit the drinking places at yale are important factors at harvard the men drink in their clubs the most of which are very expensive places and in the boston cafйs the yale men drink at moreys and traegers and billys traegers where from a score to fifty students may be seen any afternoon or evening is furnished in exact imitation of german students drinking places in the back room is heavy furniture quaint paintings and woodwork and carvings it had a sort of subdued cathedral light which fell softly on the mugs which decorated the shelves and mantel frank had proven that it was not necessary for a man to drink at yale in order to be esteemed as a good fellow frank was a total abstainer and his friends had found that nothing would induce him to drink or smoke at first they ridiculed him but they came to secretly admire him and it is certain that his example was productive of no small amount of good franks acquaintances declared he had a mighty nerve for he was able to travel with a crowd that drank and smoked and still refrained from doing either that was something difficult for them to understand it was apparent to everybody that merriwells popularity did not depend on his ability to absorb beer or his generosity in opening fizz it came from his sterling qualities his ability as an athlete his natural magnetism and his genial sunny nature although he was refined and gentlemanly there was not the least suggestion of anything soft or effeminate about him it is not strange that merriwell could scarcely believe it possible that paul pierson had been in earnest such a thing seemed altogether too good to be true if its a jolly hell not have the satisfaction of knowing that i spread it frank decided mum is the word with me and ill keep right on working for a place with the freshmen oh if we can win the race at saltonstall frank knew that he stood well with old put who was to manage the freshman team in the spring if the freshman crew could defeat the sophs put would have more confidence than ever in merriwell frank was thinking these things over when harry came in with a rush slamming the door and tripping over a rug in his haste say say say he spluttered staring at frank well what is it is it true is what true i heard paul pierson was seen talking to you on the campus well what of that then it is true yes gracious pierson was never known to thing a do er do a thing like that before is that so is it so why you know it is so think of pierson the great and only pierson talking to a freshman on the campus in the middle of the day wow you are excited harry sit down and cool off ill sit down but you must tell me what he was saying to you must i must you i should say yes i am dying to know what he could be saying to a freshman frank was troubled for he saw his roommates curiosity was aroused to the highest notch and he knew it would be no easy thing to satisfy harry without telling the truth go ahead urged rattleton what did pierson say to you oh he said a number of things replied frank awkwardly harry lifted his eyebrows havent a doubt of it he returned but what are they frank hesitated and a cloud came to his friends face you see it is a private matter merriwell explained oh there was infinite sarcasm in that ejaculation you know i would tell you if i could harry said frank rising but this is a matter which i oh you neednt trouble yourself rattleton cut in sharply ill live just as long and be just as happy now dont be angry old man that is foolish you know i would tell you if i could do so without oh i dont know about that you are getting so you have secrets lately and you dont seem to trust me say if you think i am a sneak and a tattler say so for i want to know it i dont care to room with any fellow who doesnt trust me harry was angry and frank felt very sorry old man said merriwell meeting rattletons sullen glance with a frank open look i do trust you and you should know it there is no fellow in college i would as soon room with still you should know there are some things a man cannot honorably tell even his chum harry was silent perhaps there are some things about yourself or some friend that you would not care to tell me frank went on i am not going to be offended at that it is your right to tell what you like and keep what you like to yourself a thing like that should not create feeling between us but this seems different does it well i will explain that i told pierson i would say nothing of the matter to anybody i do not believe in lying do you want me to break my word in this case no cried harry you are all right again frank you are always right dont you mind me when i get cranky im a fundering thool i mean a thundering fool but i do hope pierson is not working a jolly on you he may have tried to work a jolly on me but he is not succeeding smiled frank whose face had cleared and the quieter i keep the smaller will be the chance of success if that is his little game chapter xxiv gordon expresses himself at the first opportunity frank had a talk with burnham putnam who had charge of the freshman crew he told put all that had been learned about the traitor and burn listened with interest and growing anger who do you think the traitor is he asked at last well there is a doubt in my mind and i do not want to accuse anybody we have conducted our work with great secrecy we have that and i have repeatedly cautioned the men about talking yes i have warned them that it might mean the ruin of our plans you have and still everything we have done seems to be known thats right the man who has spread this matter has the very best means for obtaining information as he has made no mistake well what do you think the traitor may be the last man we would suspect he must have some cause for playing crooked though that is the way i regarded it old put thought the matter over for a few moments he finally said i dont want to do any man injustice but the turn affairs have taken leads me to think it would be a good plan to drop our spare men entirely and put full dependence on a settled crew frank was silent and so putnam asked what do you think of that i think it is a very good plan and i approve of it then it is settled they shall be dropped at once although it seems that the mischief is done now there may be no mischief in it for the sophs ridicule the innovations introduced and they are surer than ever that they will have a soft thing of it they have been fooled several times this fall i am sorry we shall not be able to spring our innovations as a surprise but we may give them a warm time just the same that day putnam informed the spare men that he did not think they would be needed any more in training but asked them to keep in condition till after the race in case anything might happen that they were wanted gordon was enraged immediately for he had held on and worked through everything with the belief that he would finally be given a place on the crew so i am dropped am i he said bitterly well i rather think i understand how it comes about putnam did not like this and a dark look came to his rugged face what do you mean he demanded sharply never mind returned walter with a toss of his head its no use to talk it over but i know a few things he turned as if he would go away but put put out a hand and stopped him whirling him sharply about see here said the sturdy manager of the freshman ball team and crew i want to know just what you mean gordon oh you do walter flung to the winds all hope of getting on the crew he sneered in putnams face yes sir i do you talk as if you had not been treated right have i i think you have sir i know i have not putnam was angry and his face betrayed it you must prove that gordon i can do so i may not prove it to your satisfaction but i can prove it just as hard you have told me that i am in fine form and i know that you have said i have as fine back and shoulders as may be found in the whole college i did say that calmly acknowledged old put well that counts for something but it does not make you suitable for the crew there is something more needed as you should know you must be able to row is there a man on the crew who pulls a prettier stroke than i just answer me that burn putnam you do pull a pretty stroke but i have been convinced that the men on the crew now will hold out and it is not best to take you in place of any of them who convinced you i know it was merriwell he is holding rattleton on the crew simply because they are chums and you are letting him twist you around his finger ha ha ha gordons laugh was sarcastic and cutting and it brought a hot flush to the face of old put you are insolent gordon he said this is an open insult is it well i notice you do not deny that merriwell has held rattleton on the crew in my place i deny that he has held any one on the crew that is not fully capable of remaining there on his own merit that sounds first rate oh well i dont care anyway your crew is bound to make a show of itself and it will be beaten hands down by the sophs so that is the opinion you hold is it it is and i suppose you have held it all along i have then i have made no mistake in dropping you from the crew you have quite satisfied me on that point gordon no man is suitable to hold a place on any kind of a crew or team if he holds it in contempt and has no confidence in it he will not work and his feeling of contempt will communicate itself to others thus demoralizing the whole lot of them even if he kept his contempt to himself he is not the man to work his heart out in the effort to win he thinks it is no use to kill himself and he will not make his best effort at any time it is my policy to drop such a man in case i find him out and drop him hard yes i am quite satisfied gordon walter bit his tongue to keep back the fierce words which arose to his lips he felt himself quivering with anger all right all right he said his voice unsteady i am glad you are satisfied but wait till the race is over rattletons glory will be gone then dont think that he will pull his heart out a man who smokes as much as he does cant pull smokes rattleton does not smoke at all i observed him at the turkey roast he absolutely refused to smoke because you were present but i know for a fact that he smokes behind your back and he smokes almost constantly i cannot believe it merriwell would tell me would he ha ha ha you dont know frank merriwell yet but you will find him out that fellow will go to any extreme to injure me and so it is not likely he would tell anything on his chum that would cause you to give me his place i am sure you do merriwell an injustice he is a man who does not smoke himself and he would not allow his roommate to injure himself smoking however i will find out about this do so but i have found out about it already i have certain means of obtaining information so have the sophs and they have obtained a great deal putnam shot at walter as he turned away putnam collared merriwell at the first opportunity and demanded to know the truth about rattletons smoking i know you will tell me the truth merry said burnham and it is important that you should some one has been telling you he is smoking yes well he is not smoking now i had a talk with him and he swore off he is not touching tobacco in any form and i give you my word on that thats all i want said putnam quite satisfied after this the freshman crew took to practicing nights and it was said that they worked as no crew of freshies every worked before one night they ran up against the regular varsity crew and gave it a hot pull but finally seemed to be beaten the report of this brush spread abroad and the men on the regular crew were rather complimentary toward the freshmen they said the youngsters worked together in a most surprising way and it was predicted that they would give their rivals a hard pull the sophs were inclined to regard this as a jolly and they continued confident of winning over the freshmen with the greatest ease chapter xxv the traitor discovered i say merry said rattleton the day before the race was to come off you cant guess who gordon is chumming with lately i dont know as i can who is it ditson get out thats on the level but ditson the same as suggested outright that gordon was the traitor who had told the sophs so much that is true but gordon doesnt know it well he ought to what do you think ditson is doing oh he is working gordon who has been drinking like a fish since old put dropped him frank was troubled he did not approve of ditson and he feared that gordon had a weak nature so that he could be easily influenced walter had greatly taken to heart being dropped by putnam and he seemed utterly reckless and careless about himself if he did not look out he was almost sure to get into trouble and find himself rusticated or sent home for good merriwell could not help thinking it possible that gordon had been innocent and that a mistake had been made in dropping him as it might discourage him so that he would go to the bad this worried frank not a little ill have to make ditson call a halt he said to harry he must be told to let up on gordon now that is dead right nodded harry who was inclined to be generous and kindly toward the fellow who might have filled his place on the freshman crew i tell you that ditson is a bad man and i would not trust him as far as i can fling a cow by the tail ill get after him at the first opportunity promised frank harry went out and had a talk with bandy robinson about the matter robinson admitted that he did not have much use for either gordon or ditson but he was inclined to think gordon the better fellow of the two that night merriwell and rattleton retired early but they were not allowed to go to sleep barely were they in bed before there was a knock on the door and they found robinson and one of the fellows who lived in the house were there say said bandy ditson and gordon are down at billys and gordon has a great load on i have told ditson to let him alone but was advised to mind my own business ditson is deliberately getting gordon stiff is that so cried frank as he made a jump for his clothes well i think i will have a talk with mr ditson frank and harry dressed quickly and away they went with robinson and his companion toward billys on arriving at billys they were told that ditson and gordon were in the little corner behind the screen gordon was opening champagne and both fellows were pretty well intoxicated harry slipped up behind the screen stood on a chair and peered over as he did so he heard ditson say thats right walter merriwell rubbed dirt all over you he is trying to become another king like browning but you can bet i dont lose any opportunity to throw him down throw him down throw him down echoed gordon thickly thats right but you cant throw him down hard enough to keep him down i dont know about that declared roll with drunken sobriety if we were to work together gordon old man we could hurt him as it is youve helped me out wonderfully in what ive done have i how harry looked around and saw merriwell preparing to go into the corner behind the screen then rattleton made a few violent gestures which plainly told his roommate to refrain frank looked astonished what could harry be up to that he appeared so excited he was motioning for frank to come forward cautiously and join him now merriwell did not believe in playing the eavesdropper on any one but he fancied harry saw something he wished to show him so he went forward lightly placed another chair got upon it and looked over the screen in the meantime ditson was saying yes youve helped me you know merriwell is coaching the freshman crew or has been for the race tomorrow well i dont let any chance go to get a jab at him i dont see what that has to do with my helping you mumbled gordon vainly trying to light a cigarette with a broken match on which no brimstone was left course yer dont laughed ditson who was almost as full as his companion this isnt the first time we have been out together eh old boy no only we had to be quiet about it when you were on the crew or when you thought you were on it thats right we have been pretty full once or twice i thought so when we got up the next morning well you have told me lots of things about merriwell and what he was doing with the crew youre a great talker when youre loaded gordon stiffened up a bit and tried to give his companion a sober stare but the effort was a ludicrous failure wazzyer mean he asked fi told you anything it was in strictest confidence cert but then you know anything to knife merriwell gordon braced off his hands on the table before him ditson laughed and went on now if we make a combine against him we can do him bad wazzyer mean gordon again demanded mean that you repeated anything i tol you in confidence when i was full not publicly grinned ditson i may have used it to injure merriwell but i was careful how i used it walter thumped the table with his fist growing angry suddenly youre a hanged twofaced fraud he huskily cried thats jusht what you are ditson somebodys been telling things to the sophs they found out everything it was you and you pumped your points out of me when i was full that didnt hurt you ditson hastened to declare it was entirely to hurt merriwell and he is our common enemy dont care a continental if he is cried walter i dont like him but you have hurt me bet anything merriwell and old put thought i had blowed i didnt have any confidence in merriwells methods but i didnt blow to the sophs still i was to blame for lettin you get me full and pump me and the fellows think im a tattler well ill be hanged if i dont even up with you by hammering the face off you right now walter stood up and attempted to grasp ditsons arm but he was so full that he made a miscalculation and caught nothing but empty air then he struck across the table at roll oh you would hit me would you grated ditson who saw that his companion was much the drunker you would hammer my face well perhaps ill do some hammering myself then he caught up an empty champagne bottle and swung it over his head as if to strike gordon like a flash merriwells hand darted down over the top of the screen and snatched the bottle from rolls grasp a moment later frank went around the screen and confronted the two lads still holding the bottle in his hand i saved you from having a cracked head that time gordon he said as he collared ditson and i have found out who the traitor is i am glad you are not the man as for this thing he gave ditson a shake that caused the fellows teeth to click together he has shown tonight that he is a most contemptible cur i hated to think him as dirty as he has shown himself to be franks face was full of unutterable disgust for ditson other freshmen came crowding into the corner and ditson saw himself regarded with scorn and contempt by everybody he cowed like a whipped cur and whined i was simply fooling it was all a jolly i never did anything of the sort i was simply trying to get gordon on the string by telling him so well you got yourself on a string and pretty well tangled up gentlemen turning to the freshmen present here is the traitor who has been giving our secrets away to the sophs both rattleton and myself heard him acknowledge it take a good look at him so you will know him in the future oh well know him cried many voices its a mistake roll began thats right agreed frank the worst mistake you ever made at last you have shown just what you are and everybody is dead onto you get out of this tar and feather him shouted a voice let him go advised merriwell he is covered with a coating of disgrace that will not come off as easily as tar and feathers ditson sneaked away the hisses of his classmates sounding in his ears the look on his face as he rolled his eyes toward merriwell before leaving the room was malicious in the extreme frank turned to walter who did not seem to know what to do gordon you have found that fellow out which is a lucky thing for you he said he would have ruined you at the same time i have found out that you had no hand in the sneaking work that has been going on of late you were simply an unconscious and unwilling tool and it did me good to see you resent it when you found out what ditson had been doing walter tried to say something but he choked and stammered then he muttered something about having a drink all around but frank assured him that he had taken quite enough rattleton and robinson led the crowd away from the corner and merriwell had a brief talk with gordon then harry and frank took gordon out and did not leave him till he was safely in his room as they were going away walter thickly said merriwell what is it i want to pologize what for things ive said bout you i dont know about them cause ive said em behind your back sneakin thing to do merriwell im shamed i am by thunder i guess youre all right dont blieve you ever done me dirt is it all right old man yes its all right say that makes me feel better it does by thunder youre a good fellow merriwell and im im a fool i talk too much drink too much too you dont talk and you dont drink youre all right goodnight merriwell goodnight gordon when frank retired the second time that night it was with a feeling of intense relief for the perplexing problem as to the identity of the traitor had been settled and he felt that he had done gordon a good turn by getting him away from ditson and ditson well he deserved to pass a wretched night and he did he felt that he was forever disgraced at yale but he did not seem to consider it his own fault he blamed merriwell for it all and his heart was hot with almost murderous rage over and over he swore that he would get square some way any way chapter xxvi the race the day for the race came at last a sunny day with the air clear and cold just the right sort of a day for the best of work everybody seemed bound for lake saltonstall they were going out in carriages hacks coaches on foot by train and in many other ways the road to the lake was lined with people the students were shouting singing and blowing horns one crowd of freshmen had a big banner on which was lettered umptyeight she is great she will win sure as fate evidently the sophomores had been informed about this banner in advance for they carried one which declared umptyeight isnt in it shell be beaten in a minute how they shouted and taunted each other how they raced along the road how sure everybody was that he could pick the winner the scene at the lake was beautiful and inspiring for the shore was lined with people and there were flags and bright colors everywhere on the point there was a great mob composed mostly of students who were yelling and cheering and flaunting their flags the boats on the lake were well filled and gay with colors new haven swell society was fairly represented and it certainly was an occasion to stir youthful blood the freshmansophomorejunior race came fourth on the list and it was to be the event of the day strangely enough the juniors were not reckoned as dangerous by either freshmen or sophomores between the last two classes was to come the real tug of war in the boathouse the great bob collingwood of the varsity crew gave the freshmen some advice and they listened to him with positive awe he had heard of merriwells attempt to introduce the english stroke and he did not approve of it after he had got through merriwell took his men aside into another part of the boathouse and warned them against thinking of anything collingwood had said he is all right when he is talking to men who use his style of oar and the regular american stroke but you will be broke up sure as fate if you think of what he has said that disagrees with my instructions it is too late now to make any change and we must win or lose as we have practiced thats right agreed every man well win said rattleton resolutely they could hear the cheering as the other races took place and at last it came their turn how their hearts thumped and it was merriwell that quieted their unsteady nerves with a few low calm words which seemed to give them the bracer which they needed before going into the race umptyeight yelled like a whole tribe of indians wildly waving flags hats and handkerchiefs as the freshman boat shot out upon the lake with merriwell at the stroke they did not row in the buff as the weather was too cold but all wore thin white shirts with umptyeight lettered in blue on the breast old rowers looked the freshmen over with astonishment for they gave the appearance of welldrilled amateurs and not greenhorns there were a few expressions of approval the novel stroke was watched and criticised and an old grad who was regarded as authority declared that the man who set the stroke for that crew was a comer providing he was built of the right kind of stuff then came the sophs and juniors both pulling prettily and gracefully and both being cheered by their classes the juniors were light but they expected to walk away from the freshmen as they had an expert at the stroke and had been coached by collingwood soon the three crews lined up and the voice of the referee was heard are you ready dead silence go away shot the boats and the sophs took the lead directly their short snappy stroke giving the boat the required impetus in short order the juniors held close on to them while the freshmen seemed to take altogether too much time to get away striking a regular long swinging stroke that seemed to be overdone as a jubilant sophomore spectator characterized it the sophs along the shore and on the point were wild with delight they danced and howled confident of victory at the very outset the juniors were enthusiastic but not so demonstrative as the sophomores the freshmen cheered but there seemed to be disappointment in the sound whoop er up for umptyseven howled the sophs whoop er up rah rah rah this is a cinch umptyeight is in it she will catch em in a minute sang the freshmen she is crawling on them all she can do is crawl yelled a soph but his remark was drowned in the wild tumult of noise umptysix is up to tricks shouted the juniors umptysix they are bricks whoop er up rah rah rah the yelling of the freshmen became louder for their crew was holding its own was beginning to gain that is the best freshman crew that ever appeared at saltonstall declared a spectator every man seems to be a worker theres no one shirking and look at the stroke oar urged another that fellow is the winner he is working like a veteran and he is setting a stroke that is bound to tell before the race is over this was true enough the strong long stroke of the freshmen kept their boat going steadily at high speed once it was in motion and they steadily overhauled the juniors who had fallen away from the sophs at the stake the freshman crew passed the juniors and the freshmen witnesses had fits but that was not the end of the excitement the speed of the freshman boat was something wonderful and it was overhauling the sophs despite the fact that they were pulling for dear life to hold the lead and now the shouting for umptyeight was heard on every side the sophs were encouraging their men to hold the advantage to the finish but still the freshmen were gaining the nose of the freshman boat crept alongside the sophs whose faces wore a doordie look the suspense was awful the excitement was intense then rattleton was heard talking well this is the greatest snap we ever struck i wonder how the sophs like the oxford stroke oh my what guys we are making of them it dont make a dit of bifference how hard they pull theyre not in the race at all poor sophs why dont they get out and walk they could get along faster that seemed to break the sophs up and then a great shout went up as the freshman boat forged into the lead they soon led the sophs by a length and crossed the line thirty feet in advance then rattleton keeled over completely done up but supremely happy how the freshmen spectators did cheer umptyeight umptyeight whoop er up rah rah rah it was another great victory for the freshmen and frank merriwell and that night a great bonfire blazed on the campus and the students made merry they blew horns sang cheered and had a high old time the freshmen made the most noise and they were very proud and aggressive never had yale college freshmen seemed happier where is merriwell was the question that went around a committee was sent to search for him and they returned with him on their shoulders he tried to get down but he could not uncle blossom climbed on a box and shouted three cheers for umptyeight the winners the cheers were given easy street leaped on another box and yelled three cheers for frank merriwell the winning oar it seemed that the freshmen were trying to split their throats and not a few juniors joined with them showing how much admiration merriwell had won outside his own class walter gordon cheered with the others but roland ditson stood at a distance beating his heart out with rage and jealousy he was all alone for at yale not one man was left who cared to acknowledge ditson as a friend chapter xxvii a change of pitchers the game is lost sure yale has not scored since the second inning thats right she made one in the first and three in the second and then comes four beautiful whitewashes harvard hasnt missed a trick and the score is eleven to four in her favor lewis this is awful right you are jones hear those harvard rooters whoop up it gives me nervous prostration the yale freshmen were playing the harvard freshmen on the grounds of the latter team and quite a large delegation had come on from new haven to witness the game which was the second of the series of three arranged between the freshmen teams of the two colleges the first had been played at new haven and the third was to be played on neutral ground yale had won the first game by heavy batting the final score being twelve to eleven as the regular varsity nine had likewise won the first of their series with harvard the sons of eli began to think they had a sure thing and those who came on from new haven were dead sure in their minds that they would bring back the scalps of the harvard freshmen they said over and over that there would be no need of a third game to settle the matter yale would settle it in the second walter gordon had pitched the whole of the first harvard game he had been hammered for thirteen singles two twobaggers and a threebagger and still yale had pulled out which was rather remarkable but walter had managed to keep harvards hits scattered while yale bunched their hits in two innings which was just enough to give them the winning score it was said that frank merriwell was to be given a show in the second game and a large number of yale men who were not freshmen had come on to see what he would do pierson had been particularly anxious to see merriwell work and he had taken a great deal of trouble to come on the great and only bob collingwood of the varsity crew had accompanied pierson and both were much disappointed not to say disgusted when old put put in gordon and kept him in the box despite the fact that he was being freely batted whats the matter with putnam growled pierson has he got a grudge against merriwell or does he intend to lose this game anyway hes asleep said collingwood wearily hes stuck on gordon he must be thick if he cant see gordon is rapidly losing his nerve why the fellow is liable to go to pieces at any minute and let those willies run in a score that will be an absolute disgrace go down and talk to him pierson not much i am too well known to the harvard gang they wouldnt do a thing to me not a thing then lets get out of here it makes me sick to hear that harvard yell i cant stand it pierson wait i want to see merriwell go into the box if they will let him at all thats what i came for but he cant save the game now the yale crowd is not doing any batting all harvard has to do is to hold them down and they scarcely have touched coulter since the second inning thats right but the fellow is easy coll if they ever should get onto him how can they they are not batters pierson nodded that is true he admitted they are weak with the stick diamond is the only man who seems to know how to go after a ball properly he is raw but there is mighty good stuff in that fellow if he sticks to baseball he will be on the regular team before he finishes his course i believe merriwell has shown up well as a batter in practice he certainly has well i should think old put would use him for his hitting if for nothing else he is needed it seems to me that there is a nigger in the woodpile you think merriwell is held back for reasons not known i do say by jingoes i am going down and talk to putnam if he doesnt give merriwell a trial hes a chump hold on what for if i wait it will be too late for merriwell to go in on the first of the seventh perhaps merriwell may stand on his dignity and refuse to go in at all at this late stage of the game he wouldnt be to blame if he did for he cant win out something is up hello merriwell is getting out of his sweater i believe putnam is going to send him out there was a great satisfaction in piersons voice at last it seemed that he would get a chance to see merriwell work somebody ought to go down and rap putnam on the coco with a big heavy club growled collingwood he should have made the change long ago the harvard willies have been piling up something every inning down on the visitors bench merriwell was seen to peel off while gordon was talking rather excitedly to burnham putnam it seemed evident by his manner that he was speaking of something that did not please him very much merriwell was pulled out of his sweater and then somebody tossed him a practice ball little danny griswold the yale shortstop put on a catchers mitt and prepared to catch for frank yale was making a last desperate struggle for a score in the sixth inning with one man out and a man on first a weak batter came up if the batter tried to get a hit it looked like a great opportunity for a double play by harvard old put who was in uniform ran down to first and sent in the coacher whose place he took on the line then he signaled the batter to take one his signal being obeyed and it proved to be a ball put was a great coacher and now he opened up in a lively way with robinson rattling away over by third put was not talking simply to rattle the pitcher he was giving signals at the same time and he signed for the man on first to go down on the next pitch at the same time giving the batter the tip to make a fake swing at the ball to bother the catcher this programme was carried out and it worked for the runner got second on a slide and a close decision then the yale rooters opened their throats and blue banners fluttered in a bunch over on the bleachers where the new haven gang was packed together yell you suckers yell cried dickson harvards first baseman its the only chance youll get his words were drowned in the tumult and noise up in the grand stand there was a waving of blue flags and white handkerchiefs telling that there were not a few of the fair spectators who sympathized with the boys from new haven then the man at the bat reached first on a scratch hit and a fumble and there seemed to be a small rift in the clouds which had lowered over the heads of the yale freshmen so long but the next man up promptly fouled out and the clouds seemed to close in again as dark as ever in the meantime frank was warming up with the aid of danny griswold and walter gordon sat on the bench looking sulky and downcast gordon is a regular pig said one of the freshman players to a companion he doesnt know when he has enough well we know we have had enough of him this game said the other sourly if we had played a rotten fielding game harvard would have a hundred now well nearly that grinned the first speaker gordon hasnt struck out a man and still he is sore because putnam is going to put merriwell in i suppose that is natural but hi there look a that great scott what sloppy work did you see newton get caught playing off second well that gives me cramps come on hes the last man and well have to go out so to the delight of the harvard crowd yale was whitewashed again and there seemed no show for the new haven boys to win walter gordon remained on the bench and frank walked down into the box then came positive proof of merriwells popularity for the new haven spectators arose as one man wildly waving hats and flags and gave three cheers and a tiger for frank thats what kills him exclaimed pierson in disgust it is sure to rattle any green man thats right yawned collingwood its plain we have wasted our time in coming here today it looks that way from the road why couldnt the blamed chumps keep still so he could show what he is made of its ten to one he wont be able to find the plate for five minutes i believe i can see him shaking from here the harvard crowd had never heard of merriwell and they regarded him with no little interest as he walked into the box when the yale spectators were through cheering harvard took it up in a derisive way and it certainly was enough to rattle any fellow with ordinary nerves but frank did not seem to hear all the howling he paid no attention to the cheers of his friends or the jeers of the other party he seemed in no great hurry he made sure that every man was in position felt of the pitchers plate with his foot kicked aside a small pebble and then took any amount of time in preparing to deliver collingwood began to show some interest he punched pierson in the ribs with his elbow and observed hanged if he acts as if he is badly rattled thats so he doesnt seem to be in a hurry admitted paul he is using his head at the very start for he is giving himself time to become cool and steady he has gibson the best batter on the harvard team facing him gibson is bound to get a safe hit he is pretty sure to and that is right merriwell knew that nort gibson was the heaviest and surest batter on the harvard team but he had been watching the fellow all through the game trying to get his alley he had seen gibson light on a drop and smash it fiercely and then he had seen him get a safe hit off a rise while an outcurve did not fool him at all as he would bang it if it came over the plate or let it alone when it went outside franks mind was made up and he had resolved to give gibson everything in close to his fingers then if he did hit it he was not liable to knock it very far the first ball merriwell delivered looked like a pretty one and gibson went after it it was an inshoot and the batter afterward declared it grazed his knuckles as it passed one strike called the umpire whats this whats this exclaimed collingwood sitting up and rubbing his eyes what did he do anyway fooled the batter with a high inshoot replied pierson well he doesnt seem to be so very rattled after all cant tell yet he did all right that time but gibson has two more chances if he gets a drop or an outcurve that is within reach he will kill it ben halliday was catching for yale rattleton the change catcher and first baseman was laid off with a bad finger he was rooting with the new haven gang halliday returned the ball and signaled for a rise but merriwell shook his head and took a position that meant that he wished to try the same thing over again halliday accepted and then frank sent the ball like a shot this time it seemed a certain thing that frank had depended on a high straight ball and gibson could not let it pass he came near breaking his back trying to start the cover on the ball but once more he fanned the air great jupiter gasped collingwood who was now aroused what did he do then pierson fooled the fellow on the same thing exactly chuckled paul gibson wasnt looking for two in the same place now the freshmen spectators from yale let themselves out they couldnt wait for the third strike but they cheered blew horns and whistles and waved flags and hats merriwell had a trick of taking up lots of time in a busy way without pitching the ball while the excitement was too high and his appearance seemed to indicate that he was totally deaf to all the tumult thats right merry old boy yelled an enthusiastic new haven lad trim his whiskers with them wind them around his neck frank cried harry rattleton you can do it rattleton had the utmost confidence in his chum and he had offered to bet that not one of the first three men up would get a safe hit off him sport harris who was always looking for a chance to risk something promptly took harry up and each placed a sawbuck in the hands of deacon dunning i am sorry for you harris laughed rattleton after gibson had missed the second time but hes going to use them all that way wait my boy returned sport coolly i am inclined to think this man will get a hit yet ill go you ten to five he doesnt done they had no time to put up the money for merriwell was at work again and they were eager to watch him the very next ball was an outcurve but it was beyond gibsons reach and he calmly let it pass then followed a straight one that was on the level with the top of the batters head and gibson afterward expressed regret that he did not try it the third one was low and close to gibsons knees three balls had been called in succession and the next one settled the matter for it stood three to two has he gone to pieces anxiously asked collingwood i dont think so answered pierson but he has wasted good opportunities trying to pull gibson he is in a bad place now you have him in a hole gibson cried a voice the next one must be right over and he cant put it there it looks as if you would win rattleton said harris in mild disgust merriwell is going to give the batter his base and so of course he will not get a hit harry was nettled and quick as a flash returned four balls hits for a go i mean goes for a hit in this case harris laughed now i have you sure he chuckled in your mind sport old boy merriwell seemed to be examining the pitchers plate then he looked up like a flash his eyes seeming to sparkle and with wonderful quickness delivered the ball its an outcurve was the thought which flashed through gibsons mind as he saw the sphere had been started almost directly at him if it was an outcurve it seemed certain to pass over the center of the plate and it would not do to let it pass it was speedy and the batter was forced to make up his mind in a fraction of a second he struck at it and missed three strikes batter out called the umpire sharply gibson dropped his stick in a dazed way muttering great scott it was a straight ball and close to my fingers he might have shouted the words and not been heard for the yale rooters were getting in their work for fair they gave one great roar of delight and then came the college yell followed by the freshman cheer at last they were given an opportunity to use their lungs after having been comparatively silent for several innings whoop er up for umptyeight howled a fellow with a heavy voice whats the matter with umptyeight shes all right went up the hoarse roar whats the matter with merriwell hes all right again came that roar when the shouting had subsided rattleton touched harris on the shoulder and laughingly asked do i win not yet there are two more coming but i win just as hard my boy hope you do the next harvard batter came up determined to do something although he was a trifle uncertain he let the first one pass and heard a strike called which did not please him much the second one was a coaxer and he let that ball go by the umpire called a ball the third was a high one but it looked good and he tried for it it proved to be a rise and he struck under it at least a foot bob collingwood was growing enthusiastic that merriwell is full of tricks he declared think how he secretly coached the freshman crew up on the oxford stroke last fall and won the race at saltonstall if it hadnt been for a traitor nobody would have known what he was doing with the crew for he wouldnt let them practice at the machines i have had my eye on him ever since he entered yale confessed pierson i have seen that he is destined to come to the front the batter seemed angry because he had been deceived so easily and this gave frank satisfaction for an angry man can be deceived much easier than one who keeps cool merriwell held them close in on the batter who made four fouls in succession getting angrier each moment by this time an outdrop was the thing to fool him and it worked nicely three strikes and out called the umpire frank had struck out two men and the yale crowd could not cheer loud enough to express their delight old put was delighted beyond measure but he was keeping pretty still for he knew what he was sure to hear if yale did not pull the game out some way he knew everybody would be asking him why he did not put merriwell in the box before lewis little was hugging himself with satisfaction while dismal jones long face actually wore something suggestive of a smile rattleton felt like standing on his head and kicking up his heels with the delight he could not express oh perhaps they will give frank a show after this he thought didnt i tell put the blooming idiot it took him a long time to get out of his trance sport harris coolly puffed away at a black cigar seemingly perfectly unconcerned like a born gambler he had black hair and a faint line of a mustache he was rather handsome in a way but he had a pronounced taste for loud neckties the next batter to come up was nervous as could be seen at a glance he did not wish to strike out but he was far too eager to hit the ball and he went after a bad one at the very start which led him to get a mild call down from the bench then the fellow let a good one pass which rattled him worse than ever the next looked good and he swung at it he hit it and it went up into the air dropping into merriwells hands who did not have to step out of his tracks to get it yale had whitewashed harvard for the first time in that game chapter xxviii the game grows hotter by the noise the yale crowd made one might have fancied the game was theirs beyond a doubt poor fellows said one languid harvardite to an equally languid companion its the only chawnce they have had to cheer do let them make a little noise yas said his companion do it isnt at all likely they will get another opportunity during this game there were cheers for merriwell but frank walked to the bench and put on his sweater as if utterly unconscious of the excitement he had created his unconcerned manner won fresh admiration for him old put congratulated frank as soon as the bench was reached that was great work merriwell keep it up keep it up that kind of work will not win the game as the score stands returned frank some batting must be done and there must be some score getting you are right and you are the second man up this inning see what you can do if i had known i came so soon i wouldnt have put on my sweater keep it on you must not get chilly we cant tell what may happen harder games than this have been pulled out they lead us but five scores blossom bats ahead of me does he well he never got a hit when one was wanted in all his life but hes got a trick that is just as good if he will try to work it getting hit by the ball he is clever at that tell him to work the dodge this time if he can get him onto first some way we must have some scores if we steal them i wish we might steal a few if i get first and blossom is ahead of me on second let us try the double steal i may be caught at second or he may be caught at third and there is a bare possibility that well both make our bags at any rate but one of us is liable to be caught and if it is blossom it will leave us scarcely any worse off than before if it is myself why blossom will be on third well have one man out and stand a good show of scoring once at least merriwell said this in a quiet manner not at all as if he were trying to dictate and putnam made no reply however he spoke to blossom who was picking out his bat look here uncle he said i want you to get first base in some way do you understand in some way if you cant make a hit or get it on balls get hit blossom made a wry face coulters got speed to burn he said but ill try to get hit if he gives me an in even though it kills me thats what i want returned old put grimly never mind if it does kill you we are after scores and a life or two is of small consequence thats a pleasant way of looking at it muttered blossom as he advanced to the plate here goes nothing the very first ball was an inshoot and blossom pretended to dodge and slip the ball took him in the side and keeled him over instantly he was given a little water whereupon he got up and trotted down to first his hand clinging to his side but grinning a bit in a sly way there was a brief discussion about giving blossom a runner but when one was chosen who could not run as well as he could himself he suddenly found himself in condition to get along all right merriwell took his place at the bat having selected a bat that was a trifle over regulation length if anything frank saw a hole in right field and he hoped to be able to place a hit right there if he could do it there was a chance for blossom to get around to third on a single coulter knew nothing of merriwells batting so he was forced to experiment on the man he tried a drop that almost hit the plate but frank did not bite then coulter sent over a high one and still merriwell refused to swing and two balls had been called coulter had a trick of holding a man close on first and so blossom had not obtained lead enough to attempt to steal second frank felt that coulter would make an attempt to get the next one over the outside or inside corner of the plate as it would not do to have three balls in succession called without a single strike merriwell was right coulter sent one over the inside corner using a straight ball still merriwell did not offer at it for he could not have placed it in the right field if he had tried one strike called the umpire although he seemed quite unconcerned sport harris had been nettled when rattleton won the tendollar bet and he now said i will go you even money rattleton that merriwell does not get a hit if he goes down on four balls the bet is off ill stand you nodded harry laughingly why harris i never dreamed you were such an easy mark merriwell is bound to get a hit ha ha mocked harris is that so and he just let a good one pass without wiggling his bat it wasnt where he wanted it and coulter will not give him one where he wants it coulter doesnt know anything about merriwells batting and so he is liable to make a break at any moment this proved right for coulter tried to fool frank with an outcurve on the next delivery he started the ball exactly as he had the one before it to all appearances as if he meant to send another straight one over the inside corner he believed merriwell would bite at it and he was right but right there coulter received a shock for merriwell leaned forward as he swung assuming such a position that the ball must have hit him if it had been a straight one it had a sharp wide curve and passed at least ten inches beyond the plate passed not much merriwell hit it and sent a daisy cutter down into right field exactly where he wished to place it down on the coach line near first little danny griswold had convulsions he whooped like a wild indian spring ye snails tear up the dust ye sons of eli two make it two blos old boy why this game is easy now weve just got started whoop whoopee in going over second blossom tripped and fell heavily when he scrambled to his feet he was somewhat dazed and it was too late for him to try for third he saw halliday down by third motioning wildly for him to get back and hold second but there was such a roar of voices that he could not hear a word the coachers were saying however the signals were enough and he got back now the sons of eli were all on their feet and they were making the air quiver it was enough to inspire any man to do or die and it is doubtful if there was not a man on the yale team who did not feel at that moment that he was willing to lay down his life if necessary to win that game when the shouting had subsided in a measure rattleton was heard to shout from his perch on the shoulders of a companion to which position he had shinned in his excitement right here is where we trick our little do gentlemen er i mean we do our little trick ready to the air of oh give us a drink bartender let her go then the yale crowd broke into an original song the words of which were oh hammer it out old eli old eli as you always have you know for its sure that were all behind you behind you and we will cheer you as you go were in the game to stay my lads my lads we will win it easily too so give three cheers for old umptyeight three cheers for the boys in blue breka co ax co ax co ax breka co ax co ax co ax o up o up parabaloo yale yale yale rah rah rah yale the enthusiasm which this created was immense and the next man walked up to the plate filled with determination however old put was shrewd enough to know the man might be too eager and so he gave the signal for him to take one anyway coulter was decidedly nervous as was apparent to everybody and it seemed that there was a chance of getting him badly rattled that was exactly what the yale crowd was doing its best to accomplish merriwell crept away from first for a long lead but it was not easy to get as coulter drove him back with sharp throws each time then blossom came near being caught napping off second but was given safe on a close decision suddenly coulter delivered and the batter obeyed old put and did not offer although it was right over the heart of the plate one strike was called now came the time for the attempted double steal that frank had suggested putnam decided to try it on and he signaled for it at the same time he signaled the batter to make a swing to bother the catcher but not to touch the ball frank pretended to cling close to first but he was watching for coulters slightest preliminary motion in the way of delivery it came and old put yelled from the coach line where he had replaced griswold gear frank got a beautiful start and blossom made a break for third if blossom had secured a lead equal to merriwells he would have made third easily as it was the catcher snapped the ball down with a shortarm throw and blossom was caught by a foot then it was harvards turn and the cambridge lads made the most of it a great roar went up and the crimson seemed to be fluttering everywhere harvard harvard harvard rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah harvard one strike and one ball had been called on the batter and merriwell was on second with one man out yale was still longing vainly for scores it began to look as if they would still be held down and coulter was regaining his confidence frank was aware that something sensational must be done to keep coulter on the string he longed for an opportunity to steal third but knew he would receive a severe call down from old put if he failed still he was ready to try if he found the opportunity frank took all the lead he could secure going up with the shortstop every time the second baseman played off to fill the right field gap he was so lively on his feet that he could go back ahead of the baseman every time and coulter gave up trying to catch him after two attempts frank took all the ground he could and seeing the next ball was an outdrop he legged it for third slide slide slide howled the astonished halliday who was still on the coach line at third frank obeyed and he went over the ground as if he had been greased for the occasion he made the steal with safety having a second to spare rattleton lost his breath yelling and the entire yale crowd howled as one man the excitement was at fever pitch bob collingwood was gasping for breath and he caught hold of paul pierson shouting in his ear what do you think of that think of it returned pierson it was a reckless piece of work and merriwell would have got fits if hed failed but he didnt fail no that lets him out he is working to rattle coulter but he took desperate chances i dont know but its the only way to win this game of course it is merriwell is a wonderful runner i found that out last fall when i made up as professor grant and attempted to relieve him of a turkey he had captured somewhere out in the country i blocked his road at the start but he slugged me with the turk and then skipped i got after him and you know i can run some thought i was going to run him down easily or make him drop the bird but i didnt do either and he got away oh he is a sprinter and it is plain he knows how to steal bases i believe he is the best base runner on the freshman team if he is not too reckless he is a dandy exclaimed collingwood i have thought the fellow was given too much credit but ive changed my mind pierson i believe he is swift enough for the regular team what do you think of it i want to see more of his work before i express myself merriwells steal had indeed rattled coulter who became so nervous that he sent the batter down to first on four balls then with the first ball delivered to the next man up the fellow on first struck out for second merriwell was playing off third and pretended to make a break for home as the catcher made a short throw to the shortstop who ran in behind coulter took the ball and lined it back to the plate but frank had whirled about and returned to third so the play was wasted and the runner reached second safely then there was more yale enthusiasm and coulter was so broken up that he gave little danny griswold a shoulder ball right over the heart of the plate griswold ate high balls as the harvard pitcher very well knew he did not fail to make connection with this one and drove it to deep left for two bags bringing in two runs chapter xxix the end of the game now the new haven crowd took their turn and took it in earnest rattleton stood upon the shoulders of a friend and fell off upon the heads of the crowd as he was cheering he didnt mind that for he kept right on cheering merriwell i believe you have broken the streak cried old put with inexpressible satisfaction well i sincerely hope so returned frank i rather think we are all right now but weve got a hard pull ahead of us harvard is still five in the lead you know if you can hold them down i am going to do my best if you save this game the boys wont do a thing when we get back to new haven not a thing the next batter flied out to shortstop and griswold remained on second now there was suspense for yale had two men out a sudden hush fell on the field broken only by the voices of the two coachers coulter had not recovered his nerve and the next batter got a safe hit into right field while danny griswolds short legs fairly twinkled as he scudded down to third and then tore up the dust in a mighty effort to get home on a single every yale man was on his feet cheering again and danny certainly covered ground in a remarkable manner head first he went for the plate the right fielder secured the ball and tried to stop danny at the plate by a long throw the throw was all right but griswold was making too much speed to be caught the instant old put who had returned to the coach line saw that the fielder meant to throw home he howled for the batter to keep right on for second griswold scored safely and the catcher lost little time in throwing to second slide howled a hundred voices the runner obeyed and he got in under the baseman who had been forced to take a high throw it is impossible to describe what followed the most of the yale spectators acted as if they had gone crazy and those in sympathy with harvard showed positive alarm two or three men got around the captain of the harvard team and asked him to take out coulter put in peck they urged theyve got coulter going and he will lose the game right here if you do not change at this the captain got angry and told them to get out when he got ready to change he would do it without anybodys advice coulter continued to pitch and the next batter got first on an error by the shortstop the whole team is going to pieces laughed paul pierson i wouldnt be surprised to see old puts boys pull the game out in this inning for all that two men are out if they do so merriwell is the man who will deserve the credit said collingwood that is dead right yes it is right for he restored confidence and started the work of rattling coulter paul said the great man of the varsity crew that fellow is fast enough for the regular team you said so before and i say so again now it became evident to everybody that coulter was in a pitiful state for he could not find the plate at all and the next man went down on four balls filling the bases but that was not the end of it the next batter got four balls and a score was forced in then it was seen that peck harvards change pitcher was warming up and it became evident that the captain had decided to put him into the box if the next yale man had not been altogether too eager to get a hit there is no telling when the inning would have stopped he sent a highfly foul straight into the air and the catcher succeeded in gathering it in the inning closed with quite a change in the score harvard having a lead of but three where it had been seven in the lead at the end of the sixth i am afraid they will get on to merriwell this time said sport harris with a shake of his head hey squealed rattleton who was quivering all over ill give you a chance to even up with me ill bet you twenty that harvard doesnt score oh well ill have to stand you just for fun murmured harris as he extracted a twentydollar bill from the roll it was said he always carried and handed it to deacon dunning shove up your dough rattle harry covered the money promptly and then he laughed this cakes the take i mean takes the cake i never struck such an easy way of making money i say fellows well open something after the game and ill pay for it with what i win off harris that will be nice smiled harris but you may not be loaded with my money after the game the very first batter up got first on an error by the second baseman who let an easy one go through him the money is beginning to look my way as soon as this said harris it is looking your way to bid you goodby chuckled harry not in the least disturbed or anxious merriwell had a way of snapping his left foot out of the box for a throw to first and it kept the runner hugging the bag all the time frank also had another trick of holding the ball in his hand and appearing to give his trousers a hitch upon which he would deliver the ball when neither runner nor batter was expecting him to do so and yet his delivery was perfectly proper he struck the next man out and the batter to follow hit a weak one to third who stopped the runner at second two men were out and still there was a man on first now it looked dark for harvard that inning and not a safe hit had been made off merriwell thus far the harvard crowd was getting anxious was it possible that merriwell would hold them down so they could not score and yale would yet pull out by good work at the bat the captain said a few words to the next batter before the man went up to the plate and frank felt sure the fellow had been advised to take his time having made up his mind to this frank sent a swift straight one directly over and as he had expected the batter let it pass which caused the umpire to call a strike still keeping the runner hugging first frank seemed to start another ball in exactly the same manner it was not a straight one but it was a very slow drop as the batter discovered after he had commenced to swing finding he could not recover the fellow went after the ball with a scooping movement and then did not come within several inches of it greatly to the delight of the yale crowd oh merry has every blooming one of them on a string cried rattleton he thont do a wing to em i mean he wont do a thing to em the yale men were singing songs of victory already and the harvard crowd was doing its best to keep up the courage of its team by rooting hard it was a most exciting game the hottest game i ever saw played by freshmen commented collingwood it is a corker confessed pierson we werent looking for anything of the sort a short time ago i should say not up to the time merriwell went in it looked as if harvard had a walkover gordon feels bad enough about it that is plain he is trying to appear cheerful on the bench but he cant stand it any longer hes leaving that was right gordon had left the players bench and was walking away he tried to look pleased at the way things were going but the attempt was a failure merriwell is the luckiest fellow alive he thought if i had stayed in another inning the game might have changed he is pitching good ball but im hanged if i can understand why they do not hit him it looks easy neither could the harvard lads thoroughly understand it although there were some who realized that merriwell was using his head as well as speed and curves and he did not use speed all the time he had a fine change of pace sandwiching in his slow balls at irregular intervals but delivering them with what seemed to be exactly the same motion that he used on the speedy ones the fourth batter up struck out and again harvard was retired without a score which caused the yale crowd to cheer so that some of the lads got almost black in the face well well well laughed rattleton as deacon dunning passed over the money he had been holding this is like chicking perries i mean picking cherries all i have to do is to reach out and take what i want if the boys will capture the game ill be perfectly satisfied to lose declared harris who did not tell the truth however for he was chagrined although he showed not a sign of it how can we lose how can we lose chuckled harry things are coming our way as the country editor said when he was rottenegged by the mob it really seemed that yale was out for the game at last for they kept up their work at the bat although peck replaced coulter in the box for harvard merriwell had his turn with the first batter up one man was out and there was a man on second coulter had warned peck against giving merriwell an outcurve at the same time knowing frank had batted to right field before the fielders played over toward right so you are on to that are you thought frank well it comes full easier for me to crack em into left field if i am given an inshoot two strikes were called on him before he found anything that suited him harris was on the point of betting rattleton odds that merriwell did not get a hit when frank found what he was looking for and sent it sailing into left it was not a rainbow so it did not give the fielder time to get under it although he made a sharp run for it then it was that merriwell seemed to fly around the bases while the man ahead of him came in and scored at first the hit had looked like a twobagger but there seemed to be a chance of making three out of it as frank reached second and the coachers sent him along he reached third ahead of the ball and then the yale crowd on the bleachers did their duty how do you harvard chaps like merriwells style yelled a yale enthusiast as the cheering subsided then there was more cheering and the freshmen of umptyeight were entirely happy the man who followed frank promptly flied out to first which quenched the enthusiasm of the yale gang somewhat and gave harvards admirers an opportunity to make a noise frank longed to get in his score which would leave harvard with a lead of but one he felt that he must get home some way danny griswold came to the bat get me home some way danny urged frank the little shortstop said not a word but there was determination in his eyes he grasped his stick firmly and prayed for one of his favorite high balls but peck kept them low on danny who took a strike and then was pulled on a bad one with two strikes on him and only one ball the case looked desperate for danny still he did not lose his nerve he did not think he could not hit the ball but he made himself believe that he was bound to hit it to himself he kept saying ill meet it next time ill meet it sure he knew the folly of trying to kill the ball in such a case and so when he did swing his only attempt was to meet it squarely in this he succeeded and he sent it over the second basemans head but it fell short of the fielder merriwell came home while griswold was going down to first and now it needed but one score for yale to tie harvard the man who followed griswold dashed all their hopes by hitting a weak one to short and forcing danny out at second harvard cheered their men as they came in from the field we must make some scores this time boys said the harvard captain a margin of one will never do with those fellows hitting anything and everything thats exactly what they are doing said peck they are getting hits off balls they have no business to strike at oh you are having your troubles grinned a friend any one is bound to have when batters are picking them off the clouds or out of the dirt it doesnt make much difference where they are this man merriwell cant hold us down as he has done asserted dickson harvards first baseman i dont know he is pretty cagey admitted nort gibson i believe he is the best pitcher well strike this season said another here here you fellows broke in the captain you are getting downhearted and that wont do weve got this game and we are going to hold it but we want to go in to clinch it right here they didnt do much clinching for although the first man up hit the ball he got to first on an error by the third baseman who fumbled in trying to pick it up blossom was the third baseman and he was confused by his awkwardness expecting to get a call down steady blos old boy said frank gently you are all right the best of us do those things occasionally it is nothing at all these words relieved blossoms feelings and made him vow that he would not let another ball play chase around his feet frank struck the next man out and held the runner on first while he was doing it the third man sent an easy popfly to blossom who got hold of it and clung to it for dear life then the runner got second on a passed ball but he advanced no farther for the following batter rolled a weak one down to frank who gathered it in and threw the man out at first in three innings not a safe hit had been made off merriwell and he had struck out five men no wonder his admirers cheered him wildly as he went to the bench yale started in to make some scores the very first man up got a hit and stole second the next man went to the bat with the determination to slug the ball but old put signaled for a sacrifice as the man was a good bunt hitter the sacrifice was tried and it worked for the man on second got third although the batter was thrown out at first now we need a hit cried put it takes one to tie and two to win a hit ties the game rattleton offered to bet harris two to one that yale would win but sport declined the offer its our game fast enough he said you are welcome to what you have won off me i am satisfied but the game was not won amid the most intense excitement the next man fouled out then peck seemed to gather himself to save the game for harvard he got some queer quirks into his delivery and almost before the yale crowd could realize it two strikes were called on the batter the yale rooters tried to rattle peck but they succeeded in rattling the batter instead and to their unutterable dismay and horror he fanned at a third one missed it and batter is out cried the umpire then a great roar for harvard went up and the dazed freshmen from new haven realized they were defeated after all chapter xxx rattleton is excited it wasnt merriwells fault that the freshies didnt win said bob collingwood to paul pierson as they were riding back to new haven on the train that night not a bit of it agreed pierson i was expecting a great deal of merriwell but i believe he is a better man than i thought he could be then you have arrived at the conclusion that he is fast enough for the regular team i rather think he is will you give him a trial we may it is a bad thing for any freshman to get an exalted opinion of himself and his abilities for it is likely to spoil him i dont want to spoil merriwell look here interrupted collingwood impulsively i am inclined to doubt if it is an easy thing to spoil that fellow he hasnt put on airs since coming to yale has he no instead of that he has lived rather simply far more so than most fellows would if they could afford anything better he has made friends with everybody who appeared to be white no matter whether their parents possessed boodle or were poor that is one secret of merriwells popularity he hasnt shown signs of thinking himself too good to be living yet i have it straight that he has a fortune in his own right and he may live as swell as he likes while he is here what do you think of that it may be true admitted pierson he is an original sort of chap but they say there isnt anything small or mean about him put in collingwood swiftly he isnt living cheap for economys sake you know he doesnt drink yes i have made inquiries about his habits still they say he opens wine for his friends now and then drinking ginger ale or something of that sort while they are surrounding fizz for which he settles and he is liberal in other ways he is an enigma in some ways i have heard a wild sort of story about him but i dont take much stock in it it is the invention of some fertile brain what is it oh a lot of trash about his having traveled all over the world been captured by pirates and cannibals fought gorillas and tigers shot elephants and so forth of course thats all rot of course what does he say about it oh he simply laughs at the stories if a fellow asks him pointblank if they are true he tells him not to let anybody string him he seems to regard the whole business as a weak sort of joke that some fellow is trying to work without doubt thats what it is for hes too young to have had such adventures besides that theres no fellow modest enough to deny it if he had had them of course there isnt in this way that point was settled in their minds for the time at least there was no band to welcome umptyeight back to new haven no crowd of cheering freshmen was at the station and those who had gone on to cambridge to play and to see the game got off quietly very quietly and hurried to their rooms merriwell was in his room ahead of rattleton harry finally appeared wearing a sad and doleful countenance whats the matter old man asked frank as harry came in and flung his hat on the floor after which he dropped upon a chair you do not seem to feel well i should think you would eel felegant i mean feel elegant snapped harry glaring at frank oh whats the use to be all broken up over a little thing wow little thing whooped harry id like to know what you call a little thing i would by jee you are excited my boy calm down somewhat oh i am calm shouted harry as he jumped up and kicked the chair flying into a corner i am perfectly calm he roared tearing up and down the room i never was calmer in all my life you look it came in an amused manner from franks lips you are so very calm that it is absolutely soothing and restful to the nerves to observe you harry stopped short before frank thrust his hands deep into his pockets hunched his shoulders thrust his head forward and glared fiercely into merriwells face there are times when it positively is a crime not to swear he hoarsely said it seems to me that this is one of the times if you will cuss a little it will relieve my feelings immensely why dont you swear laughed frank why dont i poly hoker no holy poker i have been swearing all the way from cambridge to new haven and i have completely run out of profanity well i think you have done enough for both of us oh indeed well that is hard of me i came in here expecting to find you breaking the furniture and you are as calm and serene as a summers morning i tell you frank it is an awful shock and you are the one who should do the most swearing i cant understand you hanged if i can well you know there is an old saw that says it is useless to cry over spilled milk confound your old saws crying and swearing are two different things dont you ever cuss frank never well id like to know how you can help it on an occasion like this that is what gets me never having acquired the habit it is very easy to get along without swearing which is beyond a doubt the most foolish habit a man can get into rattleton held up both hands with a look of absolute horror on his face dont dont preach now he protested i think the habit of swearing is a blessing sometimes an absolute blessing a man can relieve his feelings that way when he cant any other you dont seem to have succeeded in relieving your feelings much i dont well you should have seen me when i got aboard the train i was at high pressure and there was absolute danger of an explosion i just had to open the safety valve and blow off and i find you as calm as a clock oh frank it is too much too much and harry pretended to weep go it old man he smiled you will feel better pretty soon i dont know whether i will or not snapped harry it was a sheastly bame i mean a beastly shame that game was ours not quite it came very near being ours it was why you actually had it pulled out you held those fellows down and never gave them a single safe hit that was wonderful work oh i dont know they are not such great batters gordon found them pretty fast i tell you some of those fellows are batters good ones too well they didnt happen to get onto my delivery happen happen happen there was no happen about it they couldnt get onto you you had them at your mercy it was wonderful pitching and i can lick the gun of a son er son of a gun that says it wasnt i had a chance to size every man up while gordon was pitching and that gave me the advantage that makes me tired of course you had time to size them up but you couldnt have kept them without a hit if you hadnt been a dandy pitcher your modesty is simply sickening sometimes then harry pranced up and down the room like am infuriated tiger almost gnashing his teeth and foaming at the mouth if i didnt think i could pitch some i wouldnt try it said frank quietly but i am not fool enough to think i am the only one there are others well they are not freshmen and ill tell you that i dont know about that i do all right have it as you like it and you batted like a fiend twice at bat and two hits a twobagger and a threebagger a single and a threebagger if you please well whats the matter with that whee jiz mean jee whiz could anybody ask for anything more you got the threebagger just when it was needed most and you would have saved the game if you had come to the bat in the last inning you think so but it is all guesswork i might have struck out you might but you wouldnt oh merry thunder to think that a little single would have tied that game and we couldnt get it it actually makes me ill at the pit of my stomach the expression on harrys face seemed to indicate that he told the truth for he certainly looked ill dont take it to heart so my boy said frank the poor chaps earned that game and they ought to have it well win the last one of the series and thats all we want do you want to bury poor old harvard you cant bury her so deep that she wont crawl out and you know that those fellows are decidedly soon up at cambridge and yale does well to get all she can from them you cant tell what will happen next game they have seen you and they may have a surprise to spring on us if we pulled this game off the whole thing would be settled now dont think for a moment that i underestimate harvard she is yales greatest rival and is bound to do us when she can we made a good bid for the game today but it wasnt our luck to win and so we may as well swallow our medicine and keep still it wasnt a case of luck at all spluttered harry it was sheer bullheadedness thats what it was if put had put you in long before he did the game might have been saved he didnt like to pull gordon out you see well if hes running this team on sentiment the sooner he quits the better it will be for the team frank said nothing but he could not help feeling that harry was right managing a ball team is purely a matter of business and if a manager is afraid to hurt anybodys feelings he is a poor man for the position why didnt he put you in in the first place asked harry i dont know i suppose he had reasons oh yes he had reasons and i rather think i know what they were i am sure i do what were they didnt you expect to pitch the game from the start today yes i did i thought so harry nodded as if fully satisfied that he understood the whole matter well said frank a bit sharply you have not explained yourself i am curious to know why i was not put into the box at the start well i am glad to see you show some emotion if it is nothing more than curiosity i had begun to think you would not show as much as that naturally i am curious do you know that paul pierson manager of the varsity team went on to see this game yes why do you suppose he did so oh he is acquainted with several harvard fellows and i presume he went to see them as much as to see the game he wasnt with any harvard fellows at the game well what are you trying to get at dont be in a hurry said harry who was now speaking with unusual calmness you regard old put as your friend i always have but you think he didnt use you just right today i will confess that i dont like to be used to fall back on with the hope that i may pull out a game somebody else has lost harry nodded his satisfaction i knew you would feel that way unless you had suddenly grown foolish its natural and its right there is no reason why you shouldnt be the regular pitcher for our team but still gordon is regarded as the pitcher while you are the change pitcher frank there is a nigger in the woodpile you will have to make yourself clearer than that putnam knew that pierson was going to be present at the game well pierson didnt go on to see any harvard friends he couldnt afford the time just at this season with all he has on his hands go on putnam knew pierson was not there to see any harvard men oh take your time harry grinned he was speaking with such deliberation that he did not once twist his words or expressions about as he often did when excited and in a hurry thats why you wasnt put in at the startoff he declared what is why you will have to make the whole matter plainer than you have so far it is hazy putnam did not want pierson to see you pitch he didnt why not because pierson was there for that very purpose get out i know what i am talking about you have kept still about it but pierson himself has let the cat out of the bag what cat he has told confidentially you know that he has thoughts of giving you a trial on the regular team the parties he told repeated it confidentially you know to others it finally came to my ears old put heard of it now while old put seems to be your friend he doesnt want to lose you and he had taken every precaution to keep you in the background he has made gordon more prominent and he has not let you do much pitching for pierson to see he permitted you to go in today because he was afraid gordon would go all to pieces and he knew what a howl would go up if he didnt do something frank walked up and down the room he did not permit himself to show any great amount of excitement but there was a dark look on his handsome face that told he was aroused harry saw that his roommate was stirred up at last as i have said observed frank halting and speaking grimly i have regarded burnham putnam as my friend but if he has done as you claim for the reasons you give he has not shown himself to be very friendly there is likely to be an understanding between us rattleton nodded thats right he said he may deny it but i know i am not off my trolley he didnt want piersan to see you work because he was afraid you would show up so well that pierson would nail you for the regular team and you think that is why i have been kept in the background so much since the season opened i am dead sure of it putnam must have a grudge against me no frank but he has displayed selfishness in the matter i believe he has considered you a better man than gordon all along and he wanted you on the team to use in case he got into a tight corner thats why he didnt want pierson to see you work he didnt want to lose you but he was forced to use you today and you must have satisfied pierson that you know your business well harry you have thrown light on dark places tomorrow i will have a little talk with put about this matter thats right grinned harry and pierson is liable to have a little talk with you youll be on the regular team inside of a week chapter xxxi what ditson wanted on the following day the great topic of conversation for the class of umptyeight was the recent ball game wherever the freshmen gathered they discussed the game and the work of gordon and merriwell gordon was a freeandeasy sort of fellow and he had his friends and admirers some of whom were set in their belief that he was far superior to merriwell as a pitcher roland ditson attempted to argue on two or three occasions in favor of gordon but nobody paid attention to what he said for it was known that he had tried by every possible means to injure merriwell and had been exposed in a contemptible piece of treachery so that no one cared to be known as his friend and associate whenever ditson would approach a group of lads and try to get in a few words he would be listened to in stony silence for some moments and then the entire crowd would turn and walk away without replying to his remarks or speaking to him at all this would have driven a fellow less sensitive than ditson to abandon all hope of going through yale of course it cut ditson but he would grind his teeth and mutter merriwell is to blame for it all curse him i wont let him triumph the time will come when ill get square with him ill have to stay here in order to get square and stay here i will no matter how i am treated since his duplicity had been made known and his classmates had turned against him ditson had taken to grinding in a fierce manner and as a result he had made good progress in his studies he was determined to stand ahead of merriwell in that line at least and it really seemed that he might succeed unless frank gave more time to his studies and less to athletics this was not easy for a fellow in merriwells position and with his ardent love for all sorts of manly sports to do he gave all the time he could to studies without becoming a greasy grind but that was not as much as he would have liked to ditsons disappointment and chagrin merriwell seemed quite unaware that his enemy stood ahead of him in his classes frank seemed to have quite forgotten that such a person as roll ditson existed ditson was an outcast the fellow with whom he had roomed had left him shortly after his treachery was made public and he was forced to room alone as he could get no one to come in with him roll did not mind this so much however he pretended that he was far more exclusive than the average freshman and he tried to imitate the ways of the juniors and seniors some of whom had swell apartments ditsons parents were wealthy and they furnished him with plenty of loose change so that he could cut quite a dash he had fancied that his money would buy plenty of friends for him at first before his real character was known he had picked up quite a following but he posed as a superior which made him disliked by the very ones who helped him spend his money he had hoped to be a leader at yale but to his dismay he found that he did not cut much of a figure after all and frank merriwell a fellow who never drank or smoked was far more popular then it was that ditson conceived a plot to bring merriwell into ridicule and at the same time to get in with the enemies of the freshmen the sophomores himself at last he had learned that at yale a man is not judged so much by the money he spends and the wealth of his parents as by his own manly qualities but ditson was a sneak by nature and he could not get over it if he started out to accomplish anything in a square way he was likely to fancy that it could be done with less trouble in a crooked manner and his natural instinct would switch him off from the course he should have followed he was not at all fond of walter gordon but he liked him better than he did merriwell and it was gall and wormwood for him when he heard how merriwell had replaced gordon in the box at cambridge and had pitched a marvelous game for three innings oh its just that fellows luck roll muttered to himself he seems to be lucky in everything he does the next thing ill hear is that he is going to pitch on the varsity team he little thought that this was true but it proved to be that very day he heard some sophomores talking on the campus and he lingered near enough to catch their words is it actually true parker that pierson has publicly stated that merriwell is fast enough for the varsity nine asked tad horner thats what it is nodded puss parker and i dont know but pierson is right i am inclined to think so rot exclaimed evan hartwick sharply i dont take stock in anything of the sort merriwell may make a pitcher some day but he is raw why he would get his eye batted out if he were to go up against harvard on the regular team oh i dont know about that said andy emery he is pretty smooth people is there anybody knows pierson made such an observation concerning him yes there is answered parker who knows it i do did you hear him i did that settles it yes that settles it grated roland ditson as he walked away parker didnt lie and pierson has intimated that merriwell may be given a trial on the varsity nine if he is given a trial it will be his luck to succeed he must not be given a trial how can that be prevented then ditson set himself to devise some scheme to prevent frank from obtaining a trial on the regular nine it was not an easy thing to think of a plan that would not involve himself in some way and he felt that it must never be known that he had anything to do with such a plot that night ditson might have been seen entering a certain saloon in new haven calling one of the barkeepers aside and holding a brief whispered conversation with him is professor kelley in asked roll he is sir replied the barkeeper do you wish to see him well ahem yes if he is alone i think he is alone i do not think any of his pupils are with him at present sir will you be kind enough to see asked ditson this is a personal matter something i want kept quiet the barkeeper disappeared into a back room was gone a few minutes and then returned and said the professor is quite alone will you go up sir yes said roll glancing around and then motioning for the barkeeper to lead the way he was taken into a back room and shown a flight of stairs knock at the door at the head of the flight instructed the barkeeper and after giving the man some money ditson went up the stairs come in called a harsh voice when he knocked at the door ditson found kelley sitting with his feet on a table while he smoked a strongsmelling cigar there were illustrated sporting papers on the table crumpled and ragged well young feller watcher want demanded the man withont removing his feet from the table or his hat from his head ditson closed the door he was very pale and somewhat agitated are we all alone he asked choking a bit over the question dats wot we are nodded the professor is it a sure thing that our conversation cannot be overheard dead sure ditson hesitated he seemed to find it difficult to express himself just as he desired speak right out chummy said kelley in a manner intended to be reassuring i rudder tinks yer wants ter lick some cove an yerve come ter me ter put yer in shape ter do der job well you bet yer dough im der man ter do dat how many lessons will yer have it is not

but i want his right arm broken hey down came buster kelleys feet from the table upon which his knuckles fell and then he arose from the chair standing in a crouching position with his hands resting on the table across which he glared at roland ditson hey he squawked just say dat agin cully roll was startled and looked as if he longed to take to his heels and get away as quickly as possible but he did not run and he forced himself to say this is a case of business professor i will pay liberally to have the job done as i want it an youse wants a blokes arm bruck yes well dis is a quare deal if yer wanted his head bruck it wouldnt sprise me but ter want his arm bruck jee i dont care if he gets a rap on the head at the same time but i dont want him killed i want his right arm broken and that is the job i am ready to pay for kelley straightened up somewhat placed one hand on his hip while the other rested on the table crossed his legs and regarded ditson steadily with a stare that made roll very nervous i might a knowed yer didnt want ter fight him yerself the professor finally said and ditson did not fail to detect the contempt in his face and voice no i do not declared ditson an angry flush coming to his face he is a scrapper and i do not think i am his match in a brutal fight brutal is good an yer wants his arm bruck dont propose to give him no show at all eh i dont care

feller yer wants where can i find him ill give yer his address kelley took a stub of a pencil out of his vest pocket and wrote with great labor on the margin of one of the papers this writing he tore off and handed to ditson then without another word he once more restored his feet to the top of the table and resumed reading as if there was no one in the room ditson went out without a word when he was gone kelley looked over the top of the paper toward the door and growled dat fellers no good if hed wanted ter fit der odder feller hisself id tole him how ter bruck der odder chaps wrist but he aint got der sand ter fight a baby he makes me sad id like ter tump him a soaker on de jaw meself that evening frank went out to call on some friends he was returning to his rooms between ten and eleven when as he came to a dark corner a man suddenly stepped out and said give us a light young feller i have none said frank attempting to pass den give us a match demanded the man blocking the road as i do not smoke i never carry matches well den i spose ill have ter go witout er light but youll take dat like a flash the man struck straight and hard at the youths face it was a wicked blow delivered with marvelous swiftness and must have knocked frank down if it had landed but merriwell had suspected all along that it was not a light the man was after and he had been on the watch for just such a move as was made for all of the mans swiftness frank dodged and the blow passed over his shoulder when frank ducked he also struck out with his left which he planted in the pit of the assailants stomach it was a heavy blow and for a moment it rounded the man up before the ruffian could recover he received a thump under the ear that made him see stars and sent him sprawling but the man had a hard head and he hastily got upon his feet uttering fierce words he expected to see the youth in full flight and was astonished to perceive that frank had not taken to his heels with a snarl of fury the wretch rushed at merriwell frank dodged again and came up under the mans arm giving him another heavy blow then the man turned and they sparred for a moment durned if youse aint der liveliest kid i ever seen muttered the astonished ruffian youse kin fight well i can fight enough to take care of myself returned the lad with something like a laugh smack smack smash three blows in rapid succession caused the ruffian to reel and gasp then for a few moments the fight was savage and swift it did not last long the ruffian had been drinking and frank soon had the best of it he ended the encounter by striking the man a regular knockout blow and the fellow went down in a heap when the ruffian recovered he was astonished to find frank had not departed but was bending over him how do you feel the boy calmly inquired say im all broke up was the feeble reply are youse der feller wot done me i presume i am well wot yer waitin fer to see how badly you are hurt your head struck the stones with frightful force when you fell did it well it feels dat way heres a lump as big as yer fist but wot dyouse care i didnt know but your skull was fractured wot difference did dat make i didnt

he give me the ruffian fumbled in his pocket and took out a card which he passed to frank who eagerly grasped it heres a match me boy said the man i had a pocketful wen i braced yer for one he passed a match to frank who hastily struck it on a stone and then held it so that he could read the name that was engraved on the card in his fingers a cry of astonishment broke from merriwells lips and both card and match fell from his fingers to the ground this is the name he had read upon the card mr burnham putnam chapter xxxii ditson is trapped it dont make a dit of bifference frank spluttered harry rattleton i dont care if you have got his card that thug lied like blazes putnam may be selfish he may have other faults but he never hired anybody to break your arm i cannot think he would do such a thing myself said frank but this plug kirby as he is called seemed honest and in earnest he stands ready to identify the fellow at any time then why not settle it by bringing him before putnam this very afternoon thats the way to mix the fatter i mean fix the matter it is a good idea harry and we will have to carry it out ill need your assistance you shall have it old man so frank and harry arranged to bring putnam and his accuser together that afternoon it being the day after the assault on merriwell frank was to look out for kirby while harry brought putnam along to the saloon over which buster kelley had rooms frank and kirby were there in advance and they sat down in a corner where they were not likely to be observed by anybody who entered kirbys face was cut and scarred where he had felt franks hard fists and the tough looked on the cool lad with genuine respect and admiration i wants yer ter understan dat id never gone inter dat game if i hadnt been hard up an in a bad way he said trying to apologize for himself tings have been runnin agin me an ive been on de rocks fer a long time an i didnt know how i was ter make a haul any easier dan by breakin a kids arm it

any kind of a job im goin ter try it once more i dont know wy it is but jes bein wid youse makes me want ter do der square ting frank might well have felt pleased that he exercised such an influence over a man like plug kirby the door opened and rattleton came into the saloon followed by old put and dismal jones come on kirby said frank quietly here is the man we are waiting for putnam had halted near the bar a puzzled look on his face and frank heard him say to harry what in the world did you drag me in here for old man you know i am not drinking anything now and as i told you interrupted harry grimly i brought you in to see a man here he is frank and the rough had come up behind putnam who now turned and with still greater astonishment cried what merriwell what in the world are you doing in this place permit me to introduce you to mr plug kirby mr burnham putnam have you ever met the man before old put drew back staring at the ruffian in astonishment what in blazes is this he gasped is it a joke no joke returned frank sternly it is a matter of business mr kirby have you ever met mr putnam before naw cried the man dis aint der cove wot come ter me ter do der job dis is anodder feller you are sure demanded frank with an expression of positive relief his name was on the card you gave me i dont care if it was dis aint der feller wot give der card ter me not by a great big lot well i am glad of that cried frank and he grasped putnams hand it is a great relief didnt i tell you almost shouted harry well now i want to know what all this is about said old put who was greatly puzzled i am all at sea without hesitation frank explained how a person had hired plug kirby to break his arm and what the result had been how the person who made the bargain had given a card on which putnams name was engraved frank took the card from his pocket and putnam said it was one of his regular visiting cards some fellow has been working on my name in order to hide his own identity cried put who was greatly angered oh id like to get hold of the skunk at this moment the door which led to the back room opened and roland ditson who had again visited buster kelley came into the saloon he started back when he saw the little group of students but plug kirby saw his face and hoarsely exclaimed deres der mug now dats der feller wot hired me an give me der card ill swear ter dat seeing there was no way out of it roll came forward he was rather pale but he succeeded in putting on a front hello fellows he cried what are you doing in here merriwell had him by the collar in a twinkling looking for you he said and we have found you so you are the chap who hired this man to break my arm in order to fix me so i couldnt pitch any more well i declare i didnt think anything quite as low as that even of you ditson protested his innocence he even called kirby a liar and frank was forced to keep the ruffian from hammering him he swore it was some kind of a plot to injure him and he called on the boys to know if they would take the word of a wretch like kirby in preference to his oh get out exclaimed putnam in disgust take my advice and leave yale at once if you do not ill publish the whole story and you will find yourself run out go ditson sneaked away chapter xxxiii play ball before night merriwell received an appealing letter from ditson in which the young scapegrace protested his sorrow and entreated frank to do what he could to keep the matter quiet so he would not be forced to leave yale ditson declared it would break his mothers heart if he failed to complete his course at yale over and over he entreated forgiveness telling how sorry he was that he had ever tried to injure merriwell in any way and declaring that if frank would forgive and forget he would never cause him any further trouble frank pondered over the letter so long and with sach a serious look on his face that harry asked him what he had struck then merriwell read it to his roommate oh what a snizerable meak i mean miserable sneak that fellow is exclaimed harry he goes into a dirty piece of business like this and then he gets down and crawls actually crawls i have no doubt but his mother is proud of him said frank he says he is an only son it is his mother not ditson i am thinking about i do not wish to cause her so much pain oh come off if a fellow is such a snake as ditson he must get it from his parents on one side or the other perhaps his mother is not so good i do not wish to think that of any fellows mother i much prefer to think that he takes all his bad qualities from the other side of the house i remember my own mother the dearest gentlest sweetest woman in all the world how she loved me how proud she was of me all the better part of my nature i owe to her god bless her frank spoke with deep feeling and rattleton was touched and silenced merriwell arose and walked the floor and there was an expression of the utmost tenderness and adoration on his face a look that brought something like a mist to harrys eyes frank seemed to have forgotten his companion and he gently murmured my angel mother that was too much for harry and he coughed huskily in an attempt to break the spell without being rude frank immediately turned and said i beg your pardon old man i forgot myself for a moment oh dont pard my begoner that is begon my pard no i mean peg my bardon hang it all im all twisted i dont know what i am trying to say in confusion harry got up and went to look out of the window jeewhittaker im glad merry dont get this way often he thought never knew him to do it before after some moments frank declared i am going to try to hush this ditson matter up harry you are yes for the sake of ditsons mother i want you to help me well go see putnam and jones if they have told anybody well see the others i am the one who has the greatest cause for complaint and if i am willing to drop it i am sure putnam should be come on old man lets not lose any time well i suppose you are right admitted harry as he reached for his cap but theres not another person on top of the earth who could induce me to keep still in such a case it is a second offense too so they went out together and searched for putnam and jones at first putnam was obstinate and utterly refused to let ditson off but frank took him aside and talked earnestly to him for fifteen minutes finally securing his promise to keep silent it was not difficult to silence jones and so the matter was hushed up for the time nothing was said to ditson who was left in suspense as to what course would be pursued a day or two later came the very thing that had been anticipated and discussed since the freshman game at cambridge merriwell was selected as one of the pitchers on the varsity nine and the freshmen lost him from their team putnam came out frankly and confessed that he had feared something of the kind all along and frank was in no mood to kick over his past treatment so nothing was said on that point in the first game against a weaker team than harvard merriwell was tried in the box and pitched a superb game which yale won in a walk big hugh heffiner the regular pitcher whose arm was in a bad way complimented merriwell on his work which he said was simply great of course frank felt well as for him there was no sport he admired so much as baseball but he remained the same old merriwell and his freshmen comrades could not see the least change in his manner the second game of the series with harvard came off within a week but frank got cold in his arm and he was not in the best possible condition to go into the box this he told pierson and as heffiner had almost entirely recovered frank was left on the bench the varsity team had another pitcher who was known as dad hicks he was a man about twentyeight years old and looked even older hence the nickname of dad this man was most erratic and could not be relied upon sometimes he would do brilliant work and at other time children could have batted him all over the lot he was used only in desperate emergencies and could not be counted on in a pinch during the whole of the second game with harvard frank sat on the bench ready to go into the box if called on at first it looked as if he would have to go in for the harvard boys fell upon heffiner and pounded him severely for two innings then hugh braced up and pitched the game through to the end in brilliant style yale winning by a score of ten to seven heffiner however was forced to bathe his arm in witch hazel frequently and as he went toward the box for the last time he said to frank with a rueful smile youll have to get into shape to pitch the last game of the series with these chaps my arm is the same as gone now and ill finish it this inning we must win this game anyway regardless of arms so here goes he could barely get the balls over the plate but he used his head in a wonderful manner and the slow ball proved a complete puzzle for harvard after they had been batting speed all through the game so they got but one safe hit off heffiner that inning and no scores there was a wild jubilee at yale that night a bonfire was built on the campus and the students blew horns sang songs cheered for good old yale and had a real lively time one or two of the envious ones asked about merriwell why he was not allowed to pitch even hartwick a sophomore who had disliked frank from the first more than hinted that the freshman pitcher was being made sport of and that he would not be allowed to go into the box when yale was playing a team of any consequence jack diamond overheard the remark and he promptly offered to bet hartwick any sum that merriwell would pitch the next game against harvard diamond was a freshman and so he received a calling down from hartwick who told him he was altogether too new but as hartwick strolled away diamond quietly said i may be new sir but i back up any talk i make there are others who do not sir hartwick made no reply as the third and final game of the series was to be played on neutral ground there had been some disagreement about the location but springfield had finally been decided upon and accepted by yale and harvard frank did his best to keep his arm in good condition for that game something which pierson approved hicks was used as much as possible in all other games but frank found it necessary to pull one or two off the coals for him heffiner had indeed used his arm up in the grand struggle to win the second game from harvard the game that it was absolutely necessary for yale to secure he tended that arm as if it were a baby but it had been strained severely and it came into shape very slowly as soon as possible he tried to do a little throwing every day but it was some time before he could get a ball more than ten or fifteen feet it became generally known that merriwell would have to pitch at springfield beyond a doubt and the greatest anxiety was felt at yale every man had confidence in heffiner but it was believed by the majority that the freshman was still raw and therefore was liable to make a wretched fizzle of it heffiner did not think so he coached merriwell almost every day and his confidence in frank increased the boy is all right was all he would say about it but that did not satisfy the anxious ones during the week before the deciding game was to come off heffiners arm improved more rapidly than it had at any time before and scores of men urged pierson to put old reliable as hugh was sometimes called into the box a big crowd went up to springfield on the day of the great game but the sons of old eli were far from confident although they were determined to root for their team to the last gasp the most disquieting rumors had been afloat concerning harvard it was said her team was in a third better condition than at the opening of the season when she took the first game from yale and it could not be claimed with honesty that the yale team was apparently in any better shape although she had won the second game of the series with harvard her progress had not been satisfactory a monster crowd had gathered to witness the deciding game blue and crimson were the prevailing colors on the bleachers at one side of the grandstand sat hundreds upon hundreds of harvard men cheering all together and being answered by the hundreds of yale men on the other side of the grand stand there were plenty of ladies and citizens present and the scene was inspiring a band of music served to quicken the blood in the veins which were already throbbing there was short preliminary practice and then at exactly three oclock the umpire walked down behind the home plate and called play ball chapter xxxiv a hot finish yale took the field and as the boys in blue trotted out the familiar yale yell broke from hundreds of throats blue pennants were wildly fluttering the band was playing a lively air and for the moment it seemed as if the sympathy of the majority of the spectators was with yale but when hinkley harvards great single hitter who always headed the batting list walked out with his pet wagon tongue a different sound swept over the multitude and the air seemed filled with crimson pennants merriwell went into the box and the umpire broke open a pasteboard box brought out a ball that was wrapped in tin foil removed the covering and tossed the snowy sphere to the freshman pitcher yale had so audaciously stacked up against harvard frank looked the box over examined the rubber plate and seemed to make himself familiar with every inch of the ground in his vicinity then he faced hinkley and a moment later delivered the first ball hinkley smashed it on the nose and it was past merriwell in a second skipping along the ground and passing over second base just beyond the basemans reach although he made a good run for it the center fielder secured the ball and returned it to second but hinkley had made a safe single off the very first ball delivered harvard roared while the yale crowd was silent a great mob of freshmen was up from new haven to see the game and watch merriwells work and some of them immediately expressed disappointment and dismay here is where merriwell meets his waterloo said sport harris hell be batted out before the game is fairly begun that was quite enough to arouse rattleton who heard the remark ill bet you ten dollars he isnt batted out at all spluttered harry fiercely heres my money too make it twentyfive and i will go you drawled harris all right ill make it twentyfive the money was staked derry also a heavy hitter was second on harvards list derry had a bat that was as long and as large as the regulations would permit and as heavy as lead yet despite the weight of the stick the strapping vermonter handled it as if it were a feather frank sent up a coaxer but derry refused to be coaxed the second ball was high but derry cracked it for two bags and hinkley got around to third it began to seem as if merriwell would be batted out in the first inning and the yale crowd looked weary and disgusted at the start the next batter fouled out however and the next one sent a redhot liner directly at merriwell there was no time to get out of the way so frank caught it snapped the ball to third found hinkley off the bag and retired the side without a score this termination of the first half of the inning was so swift and unexpected that it took some seconds for the spectators to realize what had happened when they did however yale was wildly cheered what do you think about it now harris demanded harry exultantly i think merriwell saved his neck by a dead lucky catch was the answer if he had missed that ball he would have been removed within five minutes pierson who was sitting on the bench was looking doubtful and he held a consultation with costigan captain of the team as soon as the latter came in from third base costigan asked frank how he felt and merriwell replied that he had never felt better in his life so it was decided to let him see what he could do in the box the next inning yedding who was in the box for harvard could not have been in better condition and the first three yale men to face him went out in onetwothree order making the first inning a whitewash for both sides as merriwell went into the box the second time there were cries for heffiner who was on the bench ready to pitch if forced to do so for all of the fact that it might ruin his arm forever so far as ball playing was concerned in trying to deceive the first man up merriwell gave him three balls in succession then he was forced to put them over he knew the batter would take one or two and so he sent two straight swift ones directly over and two strikes were called then came the critical moment for the next ball pitched would settle the matter frank sent in a rise and the batter struck at it missed it and was declared out the ball having landed with a plunk in the hands of the catcher the next batter got first on a single but the third man sent an easy one to frank who gathered it in threw the runner out at second and the second baseman sent the ball to first in time to retire the side on a double play you are all right merriwell old man enthusiastically declared heffiner as frank came in to the bench they havent been able to score off you yet and they wont be able to touch you at all after you get into gear pierson was relieved and costigan looked well satisfied now we must have some scores boys said the captain but yedding showed that he was out for blood for he allowed but one safe hit and again retired yale without a score surely it was a hot game and excitement was running high would harvard be able to score the next time that was the question everybody was asking yedding came to the bat in this inning and merriwell struck him out with ease while not another man got a safe hit although one got first on the shortstops error the yale crowd cheered like indians when harvard was shut out for the third time the freshmen seeming to yell louder than all the others they originated a cry which was like this he is doing very well who why merriwell merriwell was the first man up and yedding did his best to get square by striking the freshman out in this he was successful much to his satisfaction but no man got a hit and the third inning ended as had the others neither side having made a run the fourth opened in breathless suspense but it was quickly over neither side getting a man beyond second it did not seem possible that this thing could continue much longer but the fifth inning brought the same result although yale succeeded in getting a man to third with only one out an attempt to sacrifice him home failed and a double play was made retiring the side harvard opened the sixth by batting a ball straight at yales shortstop who played tag with it chasing it around his feet long enough to allow the batter to reach first it was not a hit but an error for short this seemed to break the yale team up somewhat the runner tried for second on the first ball pitched and yales catcher overthrew although he had plenty of time to catch the man the runner kept on to third and got it on a slide now harvard rejoiced although he had not obtained a hit the man had reached third on two errors and there was every prospect of scoring merriwell did not seem to lose his temper or his coolness he took plenty of time to let everybody get quieted down and then he quickly struck out the next man the third man however managed to hit the ball fairly and knocked a fly into left field it was gathered in easily but the man on third held the bag till the fly was caught and made a desperate dash for home the left fielder threw well and the ball struck in the catchers mitt it did not stick however and the catcher lost the only opportunity to stop the score harvard had scored at last the harvard cheer rent the air and crimson fluttered on all sides frank struck out the next man and then yale came to bat resolved to do or die but they did not do much yedding was as good as ever and the fielders gathered in anything that came their way at the end of the eighth inning the score remained one to nothing in harvards favor it looked as if yale would receive a shut out and that was something awful to contemplate the sons of old eli were ready to do anything to win a score or two in the first half of the ninth harvard went at it to make some more runs one man got a hit stole second and went to third on an error that allowed the batter to reach first sport harris had been disappointed when merriwell continued to remain in the box but now he said hes rattled heres where they kill him but frank proved that he was not rattled he tricked the man on third into getting off the bag and then threw him out in a way that brought a yell of delight from yale men that fixed it so the next batter could not sacrifice with the object of letting the man on third home then he got down to business and harvard was whitewashed for the last time oh if yale can score now muttered hundreds the first man up flied out to center and the next man was thrown out at first that seemed to settle it the spectators were making preparations to leave the yale battender with his face long and doleful was gathering up the sticks whats that the next man got a safe hit a single that placed him on first then frank merriwell was seen carefully selecting a bat oh if he were a heavy hitter groaned many voices yedding was confident much too confident he laughed in franks face he did not think it necessary to watch the man on first closely and so that man found an opportunity to steal second two strikes and two balls had been called then yedding sent in a swift one to cut the inside corner merriwell swung at it crack bat and ball met fairly and away sailed the sphere over the head of the shortstop run that word was a roar no need to tell frank to run in a moment he was scudding down to first while the left fielder was going back for the ball which had passed beyond his reach frank kept on for second there was so much noise he could not hear the coachers but he saw the fielder had not secured the ball he made third and the excited coacher sent him home with a furious gesture every man woman and child was standing it seemed as if every one was shouting and waving flags hats or handkerchiefs it was a moment of such thrilling nervetingling excitement as is seldom experienced if merriwell reached home yale won if he failed the score was tied for the man in advance had scored the fielder had secured the ball he drove it to the shortstop and shortstop whirled and sent it whistling home the catcher was ready to stop merriwell slide that word frank heard above all the commotion he did slide forward he scooted in a cloud of dust the catcher got the ball and put it onto frank an instant too late a sudden silence safe home rang the voice of the umpire then another roar louder wilder full of unbounded joy the yale cheer the band drowned by all the uproar the sight of sturdy lads in blue delirious with delight hugging a dustcovered youth lifting him to their shoulders and bearing him away in triumph merriwell had won his own game and his record was made it was a glorious finish never saw anything better declared harry frank you are a wonder he is that declared several others old yale cant get along without him the end
