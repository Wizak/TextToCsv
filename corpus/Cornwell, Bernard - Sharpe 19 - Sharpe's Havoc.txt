 sharpes havoc bernard cornwell sharpes havoc richard sharpe and the campaign in northern portugal spring sharpes havoc is for william t oughtred who knows why chapter miss savage was missing and the french were coming the approach of the french was the more urgent crisis the splintering noise of sustained musket fire was sounding just outside the city and in the last ten minutes five or six cannonballs had battered through the roofs of the houses high on the rivers northern bank the savage house was a few yards down the slope and for the moment was protected from errant french cannon fire but already the warm spring air hummed with spent musket balls that sometimes struck the thick roof tiles with a loud crack or else ripped through the dark glossy pines to shower needles over the garden it was a large house built of whitepainted stone and with darkgreen shutters closed over the windows the front porch was crowned with a wooden board on which were gilded letters spelling out the name house beautiful in english it seemed an odd name for a building high on the steep hillside where the city of oporto overlooked the river douro in northern portugal especially as the big square house was not beautiful at all but quite stark and ugly and angular even if its harsh lines were softened by dark cedars which would offer welcome shade in summer a bird was making a nest in one of the cedars and whenever a musket ball tore through the branches it would squawk in alarm and fly a small loop before returning to its work scores of fugitives were fleeing past the house beautiful running down the hill toward the ferries and the pontoon bridge that would take them safe across the douro some of the refugees drove pigs goats and cattle others pushed handcarts precariously loaded with furniture and more than one carried a grandparent on his back richard sharpe lieutenant in the second battalion of his majestys th rifles unbuttoned his breeches and pissed on the narcissi in the house beautifuls front flower bed the ground was soaked because there had been a storm the previous night lightning had flickered above the city thunder had billowed across the sky and the heavens had opened so that the flower beds now steamed gently as the hot sun drew out the nights moisture a howitzer shell arched overhead sounding like a ponderous barrel rolling swiftly over attic floorboards it left a small gray trace of smoke from its burning fuse sharpe looked up at the smoke tendril judging from its curve where the howitzer had to be emplaced theyre getting too bloody close he said to no one in particular youll be drowning those poor bloody flowers so you will sergeant harper said then added a hasty sir when he saw sharpes face the howitzer shell exploded somewhere above the tangle of alleys close to the river and a heartbeat later the french cannonade rose to a sustained thunder but the thunder had a crisp clear staccato timbre suggesting that some of the guns were very close a new battery sharpe thought it must have unlimbered just outside the city maybe half a mile away from sharpe and was probably whacking the big northern redoubt in the flank and the musketry that had been sounding like the burning of a dry thorn bush now faded to an intermittent crackle suggesting that the defending infantry was retreating some indeed were running and sharpe could hardly blame them a large and disorganized portuguese force led by the bishop of oporto was trying to stop marshal soults army from capturing the city the second largest in portugal and the french were winning the portuguese road to safety led past the front garden of the house beautiful and the bishops bluecoated soldiers were skedaddling down the hill as fast as their legs could take them except that when they saw the greenjacketed british riflemen they slowed to a walk as if to prove that they were not panicking and that sharpe reckoned was a good sign the portuguese evidently had pride and troops with pride would fight well given another chance though not all the portuguese troops showed such spirit the men from the ordenanqa kept running but that was hardly surprising the ordenanqa was an enthusiastic but unskilled army of volunteers raised to defend the homeland and the battlehardened french troops were tearing them to shreds meanwhile miss savage was still missing captain hogan appeared on the front porch of the house beautiful he carefully closed the door behind him and then looked up to heaven and swore fluently and impressively sharpe buttoned his breeches and his two dozen riflemen inspected their weapons as though they had never seen such things before captain hogan added a few more carefully chosen words then spat as a french round shot trundled overhead what it is richard he said when the cannon shot had passed is a shambles a bloody goddamned miserable poxed bollocks of an agglomerated halfwitted shambles the round shot landed somewhere in the lower town and precipitated the splintering crash of a collapsing roof captain hogan took out his snuffbox and inhaled a mighty pinch bless you sergeant harper said captain hogan sneezed and harper smiled her name hogan said ignoring harper is catherine or rather kate kate savage nineteen years old and in need my god how she is in need of a thrashing a hiding a damned good smacking thats what she needs richard a coppersheathed goddamned bloody good walloping so where the hell is she sharpe asked her mother thinks she might have gone to vila real de zedes captain hogan said wherever in gods holy hell that might be but the family has an estate there a place where they go to escape the summer heat he rolled his eyes in exasperation so why would she go there sir sergeant harper asked because shes a fatherless nineteenyearold girl hogan said who insists on having her own way because shes fallen out with her mother because shes a bloody idiot who deserves a ruddy good hiding because oh i dont know why because shes young and knows everything thats why hogan was a stocky middleaged irishman a royal engineer with a shrewd face a soft brogue graying hair and a charitable disposition because shes a bloody halfwit thats why he finished this vila real de whatever sharpe said is it far why dont we just fetch her which is precisely what ive told the mother you will do richard you will go to vila real de zedes you will find the wretched girl and you will get her across the river well wait for you in vila nova and if the damned french capture vila nova then well wait for you in coimbra he paused as he penciled these instructions on a scrap of paper and if the frogs take coimbra well wait for you in lisbon and if the bastards take lisbon well be pissing our breeches in london and youll be god knows where dont fall in love with her he went on handing sharpe the piece of paper dont get the silly girl pregnant dont give her the thrashing she bloody well deserves and dont for the love of christ lose her and dont lose colonel christopher either am i plain colonel christopher is coming with us sharpe asked appalled didnt i just tell you that hogan inquired innocently then turned as a clatter of hooves announced the appearance of the widow savages traveling coach from the stable yard at the rear of the house the coach was heaped with baggage and there was even some furniture and two rolled carpets lashed onto the rear rack where a coachman precariously poised between a halfdozen gilded chairs was leading hogans black mare by the reins the captain took the horse and used the coachs mounting step to hoist himself into the saddle youll be back with us in a couple of days he assured sharpe say six seven hours to vila real de zedes the same back to the ferry at barca davintas and then a quiet stroll home you know where barca davintas is no sir that way hogan pointed eastward four country miles he pushed his right boot into its stirrup then lifted his body to flick out the tails of his blue coat with luck you may even rejoin us tomorrow night what i dont understand sharpe began then paused because the front door of the house had been thrown open and mrs savage widow and mother of the missing daughter came into the sunlight she was a goodlooking woman in her forties darkhaired tall and slender with a pale face and high arched eyebrows she hurried down the steps as a cannonball rumbled overhead and then there was a smattering of musket fire alarmingly close so close that sharpe climbed the porch steps to stare at the crest of the hill where the braga road disappeared between a large tavern and a handsome church a portuguese sixpounder gun had just deployed by the church and was now firing at the invisible enemy the bishops forces had dug new redoubts on the crest and patched the old medieval wall with hastily erected palisades and earthworks but the sight of the small gun firing from its makeshift position in the center of the road suggested that those defenses were crumbling fast mrs savage sobbed that her baby daughter was lost then captain hogan managed to persuade the widow into the carriage two servants laden with bags stuffed with clothes followed their mistress into the vehicle you will find kate mrs savage pushed open the door and inquired of captain hogan the precious darling will be with you very soon hogan said reassuringly mister sharpe will see to that he added then used his foot to close the coach door on mrs savage who was the widow of one of the many british wine merchants who lived and worked in the city of oporto she was rich sharpe presumed certainly rich enough to own a fine carriage and the lavish house beautiful but she was also foolish for she should have left the city two or three days before but she had stayed because she had evidently believed the bishops assurance that he could repel marshal soults army colonel christopher who had once lodged m the strangely named house beautiful had appealed to the british forces south of the river to send men to escort mrs savage safely away and captain hogan had been the closest officer and sharpe with his riflemen had been protecting hogan while the engineer mapped northern portugal and so sharpe had come north across the douro with twentyfour of his men to escort mrs savage and any other threatened british inhabitants of oporto to safety which should have been a simple enough task except that at dawn the widow savage had discovered that her daughter had fled from the house what i dont understand sharpe persevered is why she ran away shes probably in love hogan explained airily nineteenyearold girls of respectable families are dangerously susceptible to love because of all the novels they read see you in two days richard or maybe even tomorrow just wait for colonel christopher hell be with you directly and listen he bent down from the saddle and lowered his voice so that no one but sharpe could hear him keep a close eye on the colonel richard i worry about him i do you should worry about me sir i do that too richard i do indeed hogan said then straightened up waved farewell and spurred his horse after mrs savages carriage which had swung out of the front gate and joined the stream of fugitives going toward the douro the sound of the carriage wheels faded the sun came from behind a cloud just as a french cannonball struck a tree on the hills crest and exploded a cloud of reddish blossoms which drifted above the citys steep slope daniel hagman stared at the airborne blossoms looks like a wedding he said and then glancing up as a musket ball ricocheted off a roof tile brought a pair of scissors from his pocket finish your hair sir why not dan sharpe said he sat on the porch steps and took off his shako sergeant harper checked that the sentinels were watching the north a troop of portuguese cavalry had appeared on the crest where the single cannon was firing bravely a rattle of musketry proved that some infantry was still fighting but more and more troops were retreating past the house and sharpe knew it could only be a matter of minutes before the citys defenses collapsed entirely hagman began slicing away at sharpes hair you dont like it over the ears aint that right i like it short dan short like a good sermon sir hagman said now keep still sir just keep still there was a sudden stab of pain as hagman speared a louse with the scissors blade he spat on the drop of blood that showed on sharpes scalp then wiped it away so the crapauds will get the city sir looks like it sharpe said and theyll march on lisbon next hagman asked cutting away long way to lisbon sharpe said maybe sir but theres an awful lot of them sir and precious few of us but they say wellesleys coming here sharpe said as you keep telling us sir hagman said but is he really a miracle worker you fought at copenhagen dan sharpe said and down the coast here he meant the battles at rolica and vimeiro you could see for yourself from the skirmish line sir all generals are the same hagman said and who knows if sir arthurs really coming it was after all only a rumor that sir arthur wellesley was taking over from general cradock and not everyone believed it many thought the british would withdraw ought to withdraw that they should give up the game and let the french have portugal turn your head to the right hagman said the scissors clicked busily not even pausing as a round shot buried itself in the church at the hills top a mist of dust showed beside the whitewashed bell tower down which a crack had suddenly appeared the portuguese cavalry had been swallowed by the gun smoke and a trumpet called far away there was a burst of musketry then silence a building must have been burning beyond the crest for there was a great smear of smoke drifting westward why would someone call their home the house beautiful hagman wondered didnt know you could read dan sharpe said i cant sir but isaiah read it to me tongue sharpe called why would someone call their home house beautiful isaiah tongue long and thin and dark and educated who had joined the army because he was a drunk and thereby lost his respectable job grinned because hes a good protestant sir because hes a bloody what its from a book by john bunyan tongue explained called pilgrims progress ive heard of that sharpe said some folk consider it essential reading tongue said airily the story of a souls journey from sin to salvation sir just the thing to keep you burning the candles at night sharpe said and the hero christian calls at the house beautiful sirtongue ignored sharpes sarcasmwhere he talks with four virgins hagman laughed lets get inside now sir youre too old for a virgin dan sharpe said discretion tongue said piety prudence and charity what about them sharpe asked those were the names of the virgins sir tongue said bloody hell sharpe said charitys mine hagman said pull your collar down sir thats the way he snipped at the black hair he sounds like he was a tedious old man mister savage if it was him what named the house hagman stooped to maneuver the scissors over sharpes high collar so why did the captain leave us here sir he asked he wants us to look after colonel christopher sharpe said to look after colonel christopher hagman repeated making his disapproval evident by the slowness with which he said the words hagman was the oldest man in sharpes troop of riflemen a poacher from cheshire who was a deadly shot with his baker rifle so colonel christopher cant look after himself now captain hogan left us here dan sharpe said so he must think the colonel needs us and the captains a good man sir hagman said you can let the collar go almost done but why had captain hogan left sharpe and his riflemen behind sharpe wondered about that as hagman tidied up his work and had there been any significance in hogans final injunction to keep a close eye on the colonel sharpe had only met the colonel once hogan had been mapping the upper reaches of the river cavado and the colonel and his servant had ridden out of the hills and shared a bivouac with the riflemen sharpe had not liked christopher who had been supercilious and even scornful of hogans work you map the country hogan the colonel had said but i map their minds a very complicated thing the human mind not simple like hills and rivers and bridges beyond that statement he had not explained his presence but just ridden on next morning he had revealed that he was based in oporto which presumably was how he had met mrs savage and her daughter and sharpe wondered why colonel christopher had not persuaded the widow to leave oporto much sooner youre done sir hagman said wrapping his scissors in a piece of calfskin and youll be feeling the cold wind now sir like a newly shorn sheep you should get your own hair cut dan sharpe said weakens a man sir weakens him something dreadful hagman frowned up the hill as two round shots bounced on the crest of the road one of them taking off the leg of a portuguese gunner sharpes men watched expressionless as the round shot bounded on spraying blood like a catherine wheel to finally bang and stop against a garden wall across the road hagman chuckled fancy calling a girl discretion it aint a natural name sir aint kind to call a girl discretion its in a book dan sharpe said so it isnt supposed to be natural he climbed to the porch and shoved hard on the front door but found it locked so where the hell was colonel christopher more portuguese retreated down the slope and these men were so frightened that they did not pause when they saw the british troops but just kept running the portuguese cannon was being attached to its limber and spent musket balls were tearing at the cedars and rattling against the tiles shutters and stones of the house beautiful sharpe hammered on the locked door but there was no answer sir sergeant patrick harper called a warning to him sir harper jerked his head toward the side of the house and sharpe backed away from the door to see lieutenant colonel christopher riding from the stable yard the colonel who was armed with a saber and a brace of pistols was cleaning his teeth with a wooden pick something he did frequently evidently because he was proud of his even white smile he was accompanied by his portuguese servant who mounted on his masters spare horse was carrying an enormous valise that was so stuffed with lace silk and satins that the bag could not be closed colonel christopher curbed his horse took the toothpick from his mouth and stared in astonishment at sharpe what on earth are you doing here lieutenant ordered to stay with you sir sharpe answered he glanced again at the valise had christopher been looting the house beautiful the colonel saw where sharpe was looking and snarled at his servant close it damn you close it christopher even though his servant spoke good english used his own fluent portuguese then looked back to sharpe captain hogan ordered you to stay with me is that what youre trying to convey yes sir and how the devil are you supposed to do that eh i have a horse sharpe and you do not you and your men intend to run perhaps captain hogan gave me an order sir sharpe answered woodenly he had learned as a sergeant how to deal with difficult senior officers say little say it tonelessly then say it all again if necessary an order to do what christopher inquired patiently stay with you sir help you find miss savage colonel christopher sighed he was a blackhaired man in his forties but still youthfully handsome with just a distinguished touch of gray at his temples he wore black boots plain black riding breeches a black cocked hat and a red coat with black facings those black facings had prompted sharpe on his previous meeting with the colonel to ask whether christopher served in the dirty half hundred the th regiment but the colonel had treated the question as an impertinence all you need to know lieutenant is that i serve on general cradocks staff you have heard of the general cradock was the general in command of the british forces in southern portugal and if soult kept marching then cradock must face him sharpe had stayed silent after christophers response but hogan had later suggested that the colonel was probably a political soldier meaning he was no soldier at all but rather a man who found life more convenient if he was in uniform ive no doubt he was a soldier once hogan had said but now i think cradock got him from whitehall whitehall the horse guards dear me no hogan had said the horse guards were the headquarters of the army and it was plain hogan believed christopher came from somewhere altogether more sinister the world is a convoluted place richard he had explained and the foreign office believes that we soldiers are clumsy fellows so they like to have their own people on the ground to patch up our mistakes and of course to find things out which was what lieutenant colonel christopher appeared to be doing finding things out he says hes mapping their minds hogan had mused and what i think he means by that is discovering whether portugal is worth defending whether theyll fight and when he knows hell tell the foreign office before he tells general cradock of course its worth defending sharpe had protested is it if you look carefully richard you might notice that portugal is m a state of collapse there was a lamentable truth in hogans grim words the portuguese royal family had fled to brazil leaving the country leaderless and after their departure there had been riots in lisbon and many of portugals aristocrats were now more concerned with protecting themselves from the mob than defending their country against the french scores of the armys officers had already defected joining the portuguese legion that fought for the enemy and what officers remained were largely untrained their men were a rabble and armed with ancient weapons if they possessed weapons at all in some places like oporto itself all civil rule had collapsed and the streets were governed by the whims of the ordenanqa who lacking proper weapons patrolled the streets with pikes spears axes and mattocks before the french had come the ordenanqa had massacred half of oportos gentry and forced the other half to flee or barricade their houses though they had left the english residents alone so portugal was in a state of collapse but sharpe had also seen how the common people hated the french and how the soldiers had slowed as they passed the gate of the house beautiful oporto might be falling to the enemy but there was plenty of fight left in portugal though it was hard to believe that as yet more soldiers followed the retreating sixpounder gun down to the river lieutenant colonel christopher glanced at the fugitives then looked back at sharpe what on earth was captain hogan thinking of he asked evidently expecting no answer what possible use could you be to me your presence can only slow me down i suppose hogan was being chivalrous christopher went on but the man plainly has no more common sense than a pickled onion you can go back to him sharpe and tell him that i dont need assistance in rescuing one damned silly little girl the colonel had to raise his voice because the sound of cannons and musketry was suddenly loud he gave me an order sir sharpe said stubbornly and im giving you another christopher said in the indulgent tone he might have used to address a very small child the pommel of his saddle was broad and flat to make a small writing surface and now he laid a notebook on that makeshift desk and took out a pencil and just then another of the redblossomed trees on the crest was struck by a cannonball so that the air was filled with drifting petals the french are at war with the cherries christopher said lightly with judas sharpe said christopher gave him a look of astonishment and outrage what did you say its a judas tree sharpe said christopher still looked outraged then sergeant harper chimed in its not a cherry sir its a judas tree the same kind that iscariot used to hang himself on sir after he betrayed our lord christopher still gazed at sharpe then seemed to realize that no slur had been intended so its not a cherry tree eh he said then licked the point of his pencil you are hereby orderedhe spoke as he wroteto return south of the river forthwithnote that sharpe forthwithand report for duty to captain hogan of the royal engineers signed lieutenant colonel james christopher on the forenoon of wednesday march the th in the year of our lord he signed the order with a flourish tore the page from the book folded it in half and handed it to sharpe i always thought thirty pieces of silver was a remarkably cheap price for the most famous betrayal in history he probably hanged himself out of shame now go he said grandly and stand not upon the order of your going he saw sharpes puzzlement macbeth lieutenant he explained as he spurred his horse toward the gate a play by shakespeare and i really would urge haste upon you lieutenant christopher called back for the enemy will be here any moment in that at least he was right a great spume of dust and smoke was boiling out from the central redoubts of the citys northern defenses that was where the portuguese had been putting up the strongest resistance but the french artillery had managed to throw down the parapets and now their infantry assaulted the bastions and the majority of the citys defenders were fleeing sharpe watched christopher and his servant gallop through the fugitives and turn into a street that led eastward christopher was not retreating south but going to the rescue of the missing savage girl though it would be a closerun thing if he were to escape the city before the french entered it all right lads sharpe called time to bloody scarper sergeant at the double down to the bridge about bloody time williamson grumbled sharpe pretended not to have heard he tended to ignore a lot of williamsons comments thinking the man might improve but knowing that the longer he did nothing the more violent would be the solution he just hoped williamson knew the same thing two files harper shouted stay together a cannonball rumbled above them as they ran out of the front garden and turned down the steep road that led to the douro the road was crowded with refugees both civilian and military all fleeing for the safety of the rivers southern bank though sharpe guessed the french would also be crossing the river within a day or two so the safety was probably illusory the portuguese army was falling back toward coimbra or even all the way to lisbon where cradock had sixteen thousand british troops that some politicians in london wanted brought home what use they asked was such a small british force against the mighty armies of france marshal soult was conquering portugal and two more french armies were just across the eastern frontier in spain fight or flee no one knew what the british would do but the rumor that sir arthur wellesley was being sent back to take over from cradock suggested to sharpe that the british meant to fight and sharpe prayed the rumor was true he had fought across india under sir arthurs command had been with him in copenhagen and then at rolica and vimeiro and sharpe reckoned there was no finer general in europe sharpe was halfway down the hill now his pack haversack rifle cartridge box and sword scabbard bounced and banged as he ran few officers carried a longarm but sharpe had once served in the ranks and he felt uncomfortable without the rifle on his shoulder harper lost his balance nailing wildly because the new nails on his boot soles kept slipping on patches of stone the river was visible between the buildings the douro sliding toward the nearby sea was as wide as the thames at london but unlike london the river here ran between great hills the city of oporto was on the steep northern hill while vila nova de gaia was on the southern and it was in vila nova that most of the british had their houses only the very oldest families like the savages lived on the northern bank and all the port was made on the southern side in the lodges owned by croft savages taylor fladgate burmester smith woodhouse and gould nearly all of which were british owned and their exports contributed hugely to portugals treasury but now the french were coming and on the heights of vila nova overlooking the river the portuguese army had lined a dozen cannon on a convents terrace the gunners saw the french appear on the opposite hill and the cannon slammed back their trails gouging up the terraces flagstones the round shots banged overhead their sound as loud and hollow as thunder powder smoke drifted slowly inland obscuring the whitepainted convent as the cannonballs smashed into the higher houses harper lost his footing again this time falling bloody boots he said picking up his rifle the other riflemen had been slowed by the press of fugitives jesus rifleman pendleton the youngest in the company was the first to see what was happening at the river and his eyes widened as he stared at the throng of men women children and livestock that was crammed onto the narrow pontoon bridge when captain hogan had led sharpe and his men north across the bridge at dawn there had been only a few people going the other way but now the bridges roadway was filled and the crowd could only go at the pace of the slowest and still more people and animals were trying to force their way onto the northern end how the hell do we get across sir pendleton asked sharpe had no answer for that just keep going he said and led his men down an alley that ran like a narrow stone staircase toward a lower street a goat clattered ahead of him on sharp hooves trailing a broken rope from around its neck a portuguese soldier was lying drunk at the bottom of the alley his musket beside him and a wineskin on his chest sharpe knowing his men would stop to drink the wine kicked the skin onto the cobbles and stamped on it so that the leather burst the streets became narrower and more crowded as they neared the river the houses here were taller and mingled with workshops and warehouses a wheelwright was nailing boards over his doorway a precaution that would only annoy the french who would doubtless repay the man by destroying his tools a red painted shutter banged in the west wind abandoned washing was strung to dry between the high houses a round shot crashed through tiles splintering rafters and cascading shards into the street a dog its hip cut to the bone by a falling tile limped downhill and whined pitifully a woman shrieked for a lost child a line of orphans all in dull white jerkins like farm laborers smocks were crying in terror as two nuns tried to make a passage for them a priest ran from a church with a massive silver cross on one shoulder and a pile of embroidered vestments on the other it would be easter in four days sharpe thought use your rifle butts harper shouted encouraging the riflemen to force their way through the crowd that blocked the narrow arched gateway leading onto the wharf a cart loaded with furniture had spilled in the roadway and sharpe ordered his men to pull it aside to make more space a spinet or perhaps it was a harpsichord was being trampled underfoot the delicate inlay of its cabinet shattering into scraps some of sharpes men were pushing the orphans toward the bridge using their rifles to hold back the adults a pile of baskets tumbled and dozens of live eels slithered across the cobbles french gunners had got their artillery into the upper city and now unlimbered to return the fire of the big portuguese battery arrayed on the convents terrace across the valley hagman shouted a warning as three bluecoated soldiers appeared from an alley and a dozen rifles swung toward the threat but sharpe yelled at the men to lower their guns theyre portuguese he shouted recognizing the highfronted shakoes and lower your flints he ordered not wanting one of the rifles to accidentally fire in the press of refugees a drunk woman reeled from a tavern door and tried to embrace one of the portuguese soldiers and sharpe glancing back because of the soldiers protest saw two of his men williamson and tarrant vanish through the tavern door it would be bloody williamson he thought and shouted to harper to keep going then followed the two men into the tavern tarrant turned to defy him but he was much too slow and sharpe banged him in the belly with a fist cracked both mens heads together punched williamson in the throat and slapped tarrants face before dragging both men back to the street he had not said a word and still did not speak to them as he booted them toward the arch and once through the arch the press of refugees was even greater as the crews of some thirty british merchant ships trapped in the city by an obstinate west wind tried to escape the sailors had waited until the last moment praying that the winds would change but now they abandoned their craft the lucky ones used their ships tenders to row across the douro the unlucky joined the chaotic struggle to get onto the bridge this way sharpe led his men along the arched facade of warehouses struggling along the back of the crowd hoping to get closer to the bridge cannonballs rumbled high overhead the portuguese battery was wreathed in smoke and every few seconds that smoke became thicker as a gun fired and there would be a glow of sudden red inside the cloud a jet of dirty smoke would billow far across the rivers high chasm and the thunderous sound of a cannonball would boom overhead as the shot or shell streaked toward the french a pile of empty fish crates gave sharpe a platform from which he could see the bridge and judge how long before his men could cross safely he knew there was not much time more and more portuguese soldiers were flooding down the steep streets and the french could not be far behind them he could hear the crackle of musketry like a descant to the big guns thunder he stared over the crowds head and saw that mrs savages coach had made it to the south bank but she had not used the bridge instead crossing the river on a cumbrous wine barge other barges still crossed the river but they were manned by armed men who only took passengers willing to pay sharpe knew he could force a passage on one of those boats if he could only get near the quayside but to do that he would need to fight through a throng of women and children he reckoned the bridge might make an easier escape route it consisted of a plank roadway laid across eighteen big wine barges that were nrmly anchored against the rivers current and against the big surge of tides from the nearby ocean but the roadway was now crammed with panicked refugees who became even more frantic as the first french cannonballs splashed into the river sharpe turning to look up the hill saw the green coats of french cavalry appearing beneath the great smoke of the french guns while the blue jackets of french infantry showed in the alleyways lower down the hill god save ireland patrick harper said and sharpe knowing that the irish sergeant only used that prayer when things were desperate looked back to the river to see what had caused the three words he looked and he stared and he knew they were not going to cross the river by the bridge no one was not now because a disaster was happening sweet jesus sharpe said softly sweet jesus in the middle of the river halfway across the bridge the portuguese engineers had inserted a drawbridge so that wine barges and other small craft could go upriver the drawbridge spanned the widest gap between any of the pontoons and it was built of heavy oak beams overlaid with oak planks and it was drawn upward by a pair of windlasses that hauled on ropes through pulleys mounted on a pair of thick timber posts stoutly buttressed with iron struts the whole mechanism was ponderously heavy and the drawbridge span was wide and the engineers mindful of the contraptions weight had posted notices at either end of the bridge decreeing that only one wagon carriage or gun team could use the drawbridge at any one time but now the roadway was so crowded with refugees that the two pontoons supporting the drawbridges heavy span were sinking under the weight the pontoons like all ships leaked and there should have been men aboard to pump out their bilges but those men had fled with the rest and the weight of the crowd and the slow leaking of the barges meant that the bridge inched lower and lower until the central pontoons both of them massive barges were entirely under water and the fastflowing river began to break and fret against the roadways edge the people there screamed and some of them froze and still more folk pushed on from the northern bank and then the central part of the roadway slowly dipped beneath the gray water as the people behind forced more fugitives onto the vanished drawbridge which sank even lower oh jesus sharpe said he could see the first people being swept away he could hear the shrieks god save ireland harper said again and made the sign of the cross the central hundred feet of the bridge were now under water those hundred feet had been swept clear of people but more were being forced into the gap that suddenly churned white as the drawbridge was sheared away from the rest of the bridge by the rivers pressure the great span of the bridge reared up black turned over and was swept seawards and now there was no bridge across the douro but the people on the northern bank still did not know the roadway was cut and so they kept pushing and bullying their way onto the sagging bridge and those in front could not hold them back and instead were inexorably pushed into the broken gap where the white water seethed on the bridges shattered ends the cries of the crowd grew louder and the sound only increased the panic so that more and more people struggled toward the place where the refugees drowned gun smoke driven by an errant gust of wind dipped into the gorge and whirled above the bridges broken center where desperate people thrashed at the water as they were swept downstream gulls screamed and wheeled some portuguese troops were now trying to hold the french in the streets of the city but it was a hopeless endeavor they were outnumbered the enemy had the high ground and more and more french forces were coming down the hill the screams of the fugitives on the bridge were like the sound of the doomed on the day of judgment the cannonballs were booming overhead the streets of the city were ringing with musket shots hooves were echoing from house walls and flames were crackling in buildings broken apart by cannon fire those wee children harper said god help them the orphans in their dun uniforms were being pushed into the river theres got to be a bloody boat but the men manning the barges had rowed themselves to the south bank and abandoned their craft and so there were no boats to rescue the drowning just horror in a cold gray river and a line of small heads being swept downstream in the fretting waves and there was nothing sharpe could do he could not reach the bridge and though he shouted at folk to abandon the crossing they did not understand english musket balls were necking the river now and some were striking the fugitives on the broken bridge what the hell can we do harper asked nothing sharpe said harshly except get out of here he turned his back on the dying crowd and led his men eastward down the river wharf scores of other people were doing the same thing gambling that the french would not yet have captured the citys inland suburbs the sound of musketry was constant in the streets and the portuguese guns across the river were now firing at the french in the lower streets so that the hammering of the big guns was punctuated by the noise of breaking masonry and splintering rafters sharpe paused where the wharf ended to make sure all his men were there and he looked back at the bridge to see that so many folk had been forced off its end that the bodies were now jammed in the gap and the water was piling up behind them and foaming white across their heads he saw a bluecoated portuguese soldier step on those heads to reach the barge on which the drawbridge had been mounted others followed him skipping over the drowning and the dead sharpe was far enough away that he could no longer hear the screams what happened dodd usually the quietest of sharpes men asked god was looking the other way sharpe said and looked at harper all here all present sir harper said the big ulsterman looked as if he had been weeping those poor wee children he said resentfully there was nothing we could do sharpe said curtly and that was true though the truth of it did not make him feel any better williamson and tarrant are on a charge he told harper again again sharpe said and wondered at the idiocy of the two men who would rather have snatched a drink than escape from the city even if that drink had meant imprisonment in france now come on he followed the civilian fugitives who arriving at the place where the rivers wharf was blocked by the ancient city wall had turned up an alleyway the old wall had been built when men fought in armor and shot at each other with crossbows and the lichencovered stones would not have stood two minutes against a modern cannon and as if to mark that redundancy the city had knocked great holes in the old ramparts sharpe led his men through one such gap crossed the remnants of a ditch and then hurried into the wider streets of the new town beyond the walls crapauds hagman warned sharpe sir up the hill sharpe looked to his left and saw a troop of french cavalry riding to cut off the fugitives they were dragoons fifty or more of them in their green coats and all carrying straight swords and short carbines they wore brass helmets that in wartime were covered by cloth so the polished metal would not reflect the sunlight keep running sharpe shouted the dragoons had not spotted the riflemen or if they had were not seeking a confrontation but instead spurred on to where the road skirted a great hill that was topped with a huge white flatroofed building a school perhaps or a hospital the main road ran north of the hill but another went to the south between the hill and the river and the dragoons were on the bigger road so sharpe kept to his right hoping to escape by the smaller track on the douros bank but the dragoons at last saw him and drove their horses across the shoulder of the hill to block the lesser road where it bordered the river sharpe looked back and saw french infantry following the cavalry damn them then he saw that still more french troops were pursuing him from the broken city wall he could probably outrun the infantry but the dragoons were already ahead of him and the first of them were dismounting and making a barricade across the road the folk fleeing the city were being headed off and some were climbing to the big white building while others in despair were going back to their houses the cannon were fighting their own battle above the river the french guns trying to match the bombardment from the big portuguese battery which had started dozens of fires in the fallen city as the round shot smashed ovens hearths and forges the dark smoke of the burning buildings mingled with the graywhite smoke of the guns and beneath that smoke in the valley of drowning children richard sharpe was trapped liutenant colonel james christopher was neither a lieutenant nor a colonel though he had once served as a captain in the lincolnshire fencibles and still held that commission he had been christened james augustus meredith christopher and throughout his schooldays had been known as jam his father had been a doctor in the small town of saxilby a profession and a place that james christopher liked to ignore preferring to remember that his mother was second cousin to the earl of rochford and it was rochfords influence that had taken christopher from cambridge university to the foreign office where his command of languages his natural suavity and his quick intelligence had ensured a swift rise he had been given early responsibilities introduced to great men and entrusted with confidences he was reckoned to be a good prospect a sound young man whose judgment was usually reliable which meant as often as not that he merely agreed with his superiors but the reputation had led to his present appointment which was a position as lonely as it was secret james christophers task was to advise the government whether it would be prudent to keep british troops in portugal the decision of course would not rest with james christopher he might be a coming man in the foreign office but the decision to stay or withdraw would be taken by the prime minister though what mattered was the quality of advice being given to the prime minister the soldiers of course would want to stay because war brought promotion and the foreign secretary wanted the troops to remain because he detested the french but other men in whitehall took a more sanguine view and had sent james christopher to take portugals temperature the whigs enemies of the administration feared another debacle like that which had led to corunna better they said to recognize reality and come to an understanding with the french now and the whigs had enough influence in the foreign office to have james christopher posted to portugal the army which had not been told what his true business was nevertheless agreed to brevet him as a lieutenant colonel and appoint him as an aide to general cradock and christopher used the armys couriers to send military intelligence to the general and political dispatches to the embassy in lisbon whence though they were addressed to the ambassador the messages were sent unopened to london the prime minister needed sound advice and james christopher was supposed to supply the facts that would frame the advice though of late he had been busy making new facts he had seen beyond the wars messy realities to the golden future james christopher in short had seen the light none of which occupied his thoughts as he rode out of oporto less than a cannons range ahead of the french troops a couple of musket shots were sent in his direction but christopher and his servant were superbly mounted on fine irish horses and they quickly outran the halfhearted pursuit they took to the hills galloping along the terrace of a vineyard and then climbing into a forest of pine and oak where they stopped to rest the horses christopher gazed back westward the sun had dried the roads after the nights heavy rain and a smear of dust on the horizon showed where the french armys baggage train was advancing toward the newly captured city of oporto the city itself hidden now by hills was marked by a great plume of dirty smoke spewing up from burning houses and from the busy batteries of cannons that though muted by distance sounded like an unceasing thunder no french troops had bothered to pursue christopher this far a dozen laborers were deepening a ditch in the valley and ignored the fugitives on the nearby road as if to suggest that the war was the citys business not theirs there were no british riflemen among the fugitives christopher noted but he would have been surprised to see sharpe and his men this far from the city doubtless by now they were dead or captured what had hogan been thinking of in asking sharpe to accompany him was it because the shrewd irishman suspected something but how could hogan know christopher worried at the problem for a few moments then dismissed it hogan could know nothing he was just trying to be helpful the french did well today christopher remarked to his portuguese servant a young man with receding hair and a thin earnest face the devil will get them in the end senhor the servant answered sometimes mere men have to do the devils business christopher said he drew a small telescope from his pocket and trained it on the far hills in the next few days he said still gazing through the glass you will see some things that will surprise you if you say so senhor the servant answered but there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy if you say so senhor the servant repeated wondering why the english officer called him horatio when his name was luis but he thought it was probably better not to ask luis had been a barber in lisbon where he had sometimes cut the hair of men from the british embassy and it had been those men who had recommended him as a reliable servant to christopher who paid him good wages in real gold english gold and if the english were mad and got names wrong they still made the best coinage in the world which meant that colonel christopher could call luis whatever he wanted so long as he went on paying him thick guineas embossed with the figure of saint george slaying the dragon christopher was looking for any sign of a french pursuit but his telescope was small old and had a scratched lens and he could see very little better with it than without it he was meaning to buy another but he never had the opportunity he collapsed the glass put it in his saddle pouch and took out a fresh toothpick that he thrust between his teeth onwards he said brusquely and he led the servant through the wood across the hills crest and down to a large farmhouse it was plain that christopher knew the route well for he did not hesitate on the way nor was he apprehensive as he curbed his horse beside the farm gate stables are in there he told luis pointing to an archway kitchen is beyond the blue door and the folks here are expecting us well spend the night here not at vila real de zedes senhor luis asked i heard you say we would look for miss savage your english is getting too good if it lets you eavesdrop christopher said sourly tomorrow luis we shall look for miss savage tomorrow christopher slid out of the saddle and threw the reins to luis cool the horses unsaddle them find me something to eat and bring it to my room one of the servants will let you know where i am luis walked the two horses to cool them down then stabled watered and fed them afterward he went to the kitchen where a cook and two maids showed no surprise at his arrival luis had become accustomed to being taken to some remote village or house where his master was known but he had never been to this farmhouse before he would have felt happier if christopher had retreated across the river but the farm was well hidden in the hills and it was possible the french would never come here the servants told luis that the house and lands belonged to a lisbon merchant who had instructed them to do all they could to accommodate colonel christophers wishes hes been here often then luis asked the cook giggled he used to come with his woman that explained why luis had not been brought here before and he wondered who the woman was he wants food now luis said what woman the pretty widow the cook said then sighed but we have not seen her in a month a pity he should have married her she had a chickpea soup on the stove and she ladled some into a bowl cut some cold mutton and put it on a tray with the soup red wine and a small loaf of newly baked bread tell the colonel the meal will be ready for his guest this afternoon his guest luis asked bemused one guest for dinner he told us now hurry dont let that soup get cold you go up the stairs and turn right luis carried the tray upstairs it was a fine house well built and handsome with some ancient paintings on the walls he found the door to his masters bedroom ajar and christopher must have heard the footsteps for he called out that luis should come in without knocking put the food by the window he ordered christopher had changed his clothes and now instead of wearing the black breeches black boots and red tailcoat of an english officer he was in skyblue breeches that had black leather reinforcements wherever they might touch a saddle the breeches were skin tight made so by the laces that ran up both flanks from the ankles to the waist the colonels new jacket was of the same sky blue as the breeches but decorated with lavish silver piping that climbed to curl around the stiff high red collar over his left shoulder was a pelisse a fake jacket trimmed with fur while on a side table was a cavalry saber and a tall black hat that bore a short silver cockade held in place by an enamelled badge and the enamelled badge displayed the tricolor of france i said you would be surprised christopher remarked to luis who was indeed gaping at his master luis found his voice you are he faltered i am an english officer luis as you very well know but the uniform is that of a french hussar ah chickpea soup i do so like chickpea soup peasant food but good he crossed to the table and grimacing because his breeches were so tightly laced lowered himself into the chair we shall be sitting a guest to dinner this afternoon so i was told luis said coldly you will serve luis and you will not be deterred by the fact that my guest is a french officer french luis sounded disgusted french christopher confirmed and he will be coming here with an escort probably a large escort and it would not do would it if that escort were to return to their army and say that their officer met with an englishman which is why i wear this he gestured at the french uniform then smiled at luis war is like chess christopher went on there are two sides and if the one wins then the other must lose france must not win luis said harshly there are black and white pieces christopher continued ignoring his servants protest and both obey rules but who makes those rules luis that is where the power lies not with the players certainly not with the pieces but with the man who makes the rules france must not win luis said again i am a good portuguese christopher sighed at his servants stupidity and decided to make things simpler for luis to understand you want to rid portugal of the french you know i do then serve dinner this afternoon be courteous hide your thoughts and have faith in me because christopher had seen the light and now he would rewrite the rules sharpe stared ahead to where the dragoons had lifted four skiffs from the river and used them to make a barricade across the road there was no way around the barricade which stretched between two houses for beyond the righthand house was the river and beyond the left was the steep hill where the french infantry approached and there were more french infantry behind sharpe which meant the only way out of the trap was to go straight through the barricade what do we do sir harper asked sharpe swore that bad eh harper unslung his rifle we could pick some of those boys off the barricade there we could sharpe agreed but it would only annoy the french not defeat them he could defeat them he was sure because his riflemen were good and the enemys barricade was low but sharpe was also sure he would lose half his men in the fight and the other half would still have to escape the pursuit of vengeful horsemen he could fight he could win but he could not survive the victory there really was only one thing to do but sharpe was reluctant to say it aloud he had never surrendered the very thought was horrid fix swords he shouted his men looked surprised but they obeyed they took the long sword bayonets from their scabbards and slotted them onto the rifle muzzles sharpe drew his own sword a heavy cavalry blade that was a yard of slaughtering steel all right lads four files sir harper was puzzled you heard me sergeant four files smartly now harper shouted the men into line the french infantry who had come from the city were only a hundred paces behind now too far for an accurate musket shot though one frenchman did try and his ball cracked into the whitewashed wall of a cottage beside the road the sound seemed to irritate sharpe on the double now he snapped advance they trotted down the road toward the newly erected barricade which was two hundred paces ahead the river slid gray and swirling to their right while on their left was a field dotted with the remnants of last years haystacks which were small and pointed so that they looked like bedraggled witches hats a hobbled cow with a broken horn watched them pass some fugitives despairing of passing the dragoons roadblock had settled in the field to await their fate sir harper managed to catch up with sharpe who was a dozen paces ahead of his men sergeant it was always sergeant harper noted when things were grim never patrick or pat what are we doing sir were charging that barricade sergeant theyll fillet our guts if youll pardon me saying so sir the buggers will turn us inside out i know that sharpe said and you know that but do they know that harper stared at the dragoons who were leveling their carbines across the keels of the upturned skiffs the carbine like a musket and unlike a rifle was smoothbore and thus inaccurate which meant the dragoons would wait until the last moment to unleash their volley and that volley promised to be heavy for still more of the greencoated enemy were squeezing onto the road behind the barricade and aiming their weapons i think they do know that sir harper observed sharpe agreed though he would not say so he had ordered his men to fix swords because the sight of fixed bayonets was more frightening than the threat of rifles alone but the dragoons did not seem to be worried by the menace of the steel blades they were crowding together so that every carbine could join the opening volley and sharpe knew he would have to surrender but he was unwilling to do it without a single shot being fired he quickened his pace reckoning that one of the dragoons would fire at him too soon and that one shot would be sharpes signal to halt throw down his sword and so save his mens lives the decision hurt but it was the only option he had unless god sent a miracle sir harper struggled to keep up with sharpe theyll kill you get back sergeant sharpe said thats an order he wanted the dragoons to fire at him not at his men theyll bloody kill you harper said maybe theyll turn and run sharpe called back god save ireland harper said and why would they do that because god wears a green jacket sharpe snarled of course and just then the french turned and ran chapter sharpe had always been lucky maybe not in the greater things of life certainly not in the nature of his birth to a cat lane whore who had died without giving her only son a single caress nor in the manner of his upbringing in a london orphanage that cared not a jot for the children within its grim walls but in the smaller things in those moments when success and failure had been a bullets width apart he had been lucky it had been good fortune that took him to the tunnel where the tippoo sultan was trapped and even better fortune that had decapitated an orderly at assaye so that richard sharpe was riding behind sir arthur wellesley when that generals horse was killed by a pike thrust and sir arthur was thrown down among the enemy all luck outrageous luck sometimes but even sharpe doubted his good fortune when he saw the dragoons twisting away from the barricade was he dead dreaming concussed and imagining things but then he heard the roar of triumph from his men and he knew he was not dreaming the enemy really had turned away and sharpe was going to live and his men would not have to march as prisoners to france he heard the firing then the stuttering chatter of muskets and realized that the dragoons had been attacked from their rear there was powder smoke hanging thick between the houses that edged the road and more coming from an orchard halfway up the hill on which the great white flattopped block of a building stood and then sharpe was at the barricade and he leaped up onto the first skiff his foot half sticking in some new tar that had been smeared on its lower hull the dragoons were facing away from him shooting up at the windows but then a greencoated man turned and saw sharpe and shouted a warning an officer came from the door of the house beside the river and sharpe jumping down from the boat skewered the mans shoulder with his big sword then shoved him hard against the limewashed wall as the dragoon who had shouted the warning fired at him the ball plucked at sharpes heavy pack then sharpe kneed the officer in the groin and turned on the man who had fired at him that man was going backward mouthing non non and sharpe slammed the sword against his head drawing blood but doing more damage with the blades sheer weight so that the dazed dragoon fell and was trampled by riflemen swarming over the low barricade they were screaming slaughter deaf to harpers shout to give the dragoons a volley maybe three rifles fired but the rest of the men kept charging to take their sword bayonets to an enemy that could not stand against an attack from front and back the dragoons had been ambushed by troops coming from a building some fifty yards down the road troops who had been hidden in the building and in the garden behind and the french were now being attacked from both sides the small space between the houses was veiled in powder smoke loud with screams and the echo of shots stinking of blood and sharpes men were fighting with a ferocity that both astonished and appalled the french they were dragoons schooled to fight with big swords from horseback and they were not ready for this bloody brawl on foot with riflemen hardened by years of tavern fights and barrackroom conflicts the men in riflegreen jackets were murderous in close combat and the surviving dragoons fled back to a grassy space on the river bank where their horses were picketed and sharpe roared at his men to keep going eastward let them go he shouted drop em drop em the last four words were those used in the rat pit the instruction shouted to a terrier trying to kill a rat that was already dead drop em keep going there was french infantry close behind there were more cavalrymen in oporto and sharpes priority now was to get as far away from the city as he possibly could sergeant i hear you sir harper shouted and he waded down the alley and hauled rifleman tongue away from a frenchman come on isaiah move your bloody bones im killing the bastard sergeant im killing the bastard the bastards already dead now move a brace of carbine bullets rattled in the alleyway a woman screamed incessantly in one of the nearby houses a fleeing dragoon stumbled over a pile of woven wicker fish traps and sprawled in the houses backyard where another frenchman was lying among a pile of drying washing that he had pulled from a line as he died the white sheets were red with his blood gataker aimed at a dragoon officer who had managed to mount his horse but harper pulled him away keep running keep running then there was a swarm of blue uniforms to sharpes left and he turned sword raised and saw they were portuguese friends he shouted for the benefit of his riflemen watch out for the portuguese the portuguese soldiers were the ones who had saved him from an ignominious surrender and now having ambushed the french from behind they joined sharpes men in their headlong flight to the east keep going harper bawled some of the riflemen were panting and they slowed to a walk until a flurry of carbine shots from the surviving dragoons made them hurry again most of the shots went high one banged into the road beside sharpe and ricocheted up into a poplar and another struck tarrant in the hip the rifleman went down screaming and sharpe grabbed his collar and kept running dragging tarrant with him the road and river curved leftwards and there were trees and bushes on its bank that woodland was not far away too close to the city for comfort but it would provide cover while sharpe reorganized his men get to the trees sharpe yelled get to the trees tarrant was in pain shouting protests and leaving a trail of blood on the road sharpe pulled him into the trees and let him drop then stood beside the road and shouted at his men to form a line at the woods edge count them sergeant he called to harper count them the portuguese infantry mingled with the riflemen and began reloading their muskets sharpe unslung his rifle and fired at a cavalryman who was wheeling his horse on the river bank ready to pursue the horse reared throwing its rider other dragoons had drawn their long straight swords evidently intent on a vengeful pursuit but then a french officer shouted at the cavalrymen to stay where they were he at least understood that a charge into thick trees where infantry was loaded and ready was tantamount to suicide he would wait for his own infantry to catch up daniel hagman took out the scissors that had cut sharpes hair and sliced tarrants breeches away from the wounded hip blood spilled down as hagman cut then the old man grimaced reckon hes lost the joint sir he cant walk he wont walk never again hagman said tarrant swore viciously he was one of sharpes troublemakers a sullen man from hertfordshire who never lost a chance to become drunk and vicious but when he was sober he was a good marksman who did not lose his head in battle youll be all right ned hagman told him youll live carry me tarrant appealed to his friend williamson leave him sharpe snapped take his rifle ammunition and sword you cant just leave him here williamson said and obstructed hagman so that he could not unbuckle his friends cartridge box sharpe seized williamson by the shoulder and hauled him away i said leave him he did not like it but he could not be slowed down by the weight of a wounded man and the french would tend for tarrant better than any of sharpes men could the rifleman would go to a french army hospital be treated by french doctors and if he did not die from gangrene would probably be exchanged for a wounded french prisoner tarrant would go home a cripple and most likely end in the parish workhouse sharpe pushed through the trees to find harper carbine bullets pattered through the branches leaving shreds of leaf sifting down the shafts of sunlight behind them anyone missing sharpe asked harper no sir what happened to tarrant bullet in the hip sharpe said hell have to stay here wont miss him harper said though before sharpe had made the irishman into a sergeant harper had been a crony of the troublemakers among whom tarrant had been a ringleader now harper was the troublemakers scourge it was strange sharpe reflected what three stripes could do sharpe reloaded his rifle knelt by a laurel tree cocked the weapon and stared at the french most of the dragoons were mounted though a handful were on foot and trying their luck with their carbines but at too long a range but in a minute or two sharpe thought they would have a hundred infantrymen ready to charge it was time to go senhor a very young portuguese officer appeared beside the tree and bowed to sharpe later sharpe didnt like to be so rude but there was no time to waste on courtesies dan he pushed past the portuguese officer and shouted at hagman have we got tarrants kit here sir hagman had the wounded mans rifle on his shoulder and his cartridge box dangling from his belt sharpe would have hated the french to collect a baker rifle they were trouble enough already without being given the best weapon ever issued to a skirmisher this way sharpe ordered going north away from the river he deliberately left the road it followed the river and the open pastures on the douros bank offered few obstacles to pursuing cavalry but a smaller track twisted north through the trees and sharpe took it using the woodland to cover his escape as the ground became higher the trees thinned out becoming groves of squat oaks that were cultivated because their thick bark provided the corks for oportos wine sharpe led a gruelling pace only stopping after half an hour when they came to the edge of the oaks and were staring at a great valley of vineyards the city was still in sight to the west the smoke from its many fires drifting over the oaks and vines the men rested sharpe had feared a pursuit but the french evidently wanted to plunder oportos houses and find the prettiest women and had no mind to pursue a handful of soldiers fleeing into the hills the portuguese soldiers had kept pace with sharpes riflemen and their officer who had tried to talk to sharpe before now approached again he was very young and very slender and very tall and wearing what looked like a brandnew uniform his officers sword hung from a white shoulder sash edged with silver piping and at his belt was a bolstered pistol that looked so clean sharpe suspected it had never been fired he was goodlooking except for a black mustache that was too thin and something about his demeanor suggested he was a gentleman and a decent one at that for his dark and intelligent eyes were oddly mournful but perhaps that was no surprise for he had just seen oporto fall to invaders he bowed to sharpe senhor i dont speak portuguese sharpe said i am lieutenant vicente the officer said in good english his darkblue uniform had white piping at its hems and was decorated with silver buttons and red cuffs and a high red collar he wore a barretina a shako with a false front that added six inches to his already considerable height the number was emblazoned on the barretinds brass front plate he was out of breath and sweat was glistening on his face but he was determined to remember his manners i congratulate you senhor congratulate me sharpe did not understand i watched you senhor on the road beneath the seminary i thought you must surrender but instead you attacked it wasvicente paused frowning as he searched for the right wordit was great bravery he went on and then embarrassed sharpe by removing the barretina and bowing again and i brought my men to attack the french because your bravery deserved it i wasnt being brave sharpe said just bloody stupid you were brave vicente insisted and we salute you he looked for a moment as though he planned to step smartly back draw his sword and whip the blade up into a formal salute but sharpe managed to head off the flourish with a question about vicentes men there are thirtyseven of us senhor the young portuguese answered gravely and we are from the eighteenth regiment the second of porto he gave oporto its proper portuguese name the regiment he said had been defending the makeshift palisades on the citys northern edge and had retreated toward the bridge where it had dissolved into panic vicente had gone eastward in the company of these thirtyseven men only ten of whom were from his own company there were more of us he confessed many more but most kept running one of my sergeants said i was a fool to try and rescue you and i had to shoot him to stop him from spreading what is the word desesperanga ah despair and then i led these volunteers to your assistance for a few seconds sharpe just stared at the portuguese lieutenant you did what he finally asked i led these men back to give you aid i am the only officer of my company left so who else could make the decision captain rocha was killed by a cannonball up on the redoubt and the others i do not know what happened to them no sharpe said before that you shot your sergeant vicente nodded i shall stand trial of course i shall plead necessity there were tears in his eyes but the sergeant said you were all dead men and that we were beaten ones he was urging the men to shed their uniforms and desert you did the right thing sharpe said astonished vicente bowed again you flatter me senhor and stop calling me senhor sharpe said im a lieutenant like you vicente took a half step back unable to hide his surprise you are a he began to ask then understood that the question was rude sharpe was older than he was maybe by ten years and if sharpe was still a lieutenant then presumably he was not a good soldier for a good soldier by the age of thirty must have been promoted but i am sure senhor vicente went on that you are senior to me i might not be sharpe said i have been a lieutenant for two weeks vicente said it was sharpes turn to look surprised two weeks i had some training before that of course vicente said and during my studies i read the exploits of the great soldiers your studies i am a lawyer senhor a lawyer sharpe could not hide his instinctive disgust he came from the gutters of england and anyone born and raised in those gutters knew that most persecution and oppression was inflicted by lawyers lawyers were the devils servants who ushered men and women to the gallows they were the vermin who gave orders to the bailiffs they made their snares from statutes and became wealthy on their victims and when they were rich enough they became politicians so they could devise even more laws to make themselves even wealthier i hate bloody lawyers sharpe growled with a genuine intensity for he was remembering lady grace and what had happened after she died and how the lawyers had stripped him of every penny he had ever made and the memory of grace and her dead baby brought all the old misery back and he thrust it out of mind i do hate lawyers he said vicente was so dumbfounded by sharpes hostility that he seemed to simply blank it out of his mind i was a lawyer he said before i took up my countrys sword i worked for the real companhia velha which is responsible for the regulation of the trade of port wine if a child of mine wanted to become a lawyer sharpe said id strangle it with my own hands and then piss on its grave so you are married then senhor vicente asked politely no im bloody not married i misunderstood vicente said then gestured toward his tired troops so here we are senhor and i thought we might join forces maybe sharpe said grudgingly but make one thing clear lawyer if your commission is two weeks old then im the senior man im in charge no bloody lawyer weaselling around that of course senhor vicente said frowning as though he was offended by sharpes stating of the obvious bloody lawyer sharpe thought of all the bloody ill fortune he knew he had behaved boorishly especially as this courtly young lawyer had possessed the courage to kill a sergeant and lead his men to sharpes rescue and he knew he should apologize for his rudeness but instead he stared south and west trying to make sense of the landscape looking for any pursuit and wondering where in hell he was he took out his fine telescope which had been a gift from sir arthur wellesley and trained it back the way they had come staring over the trees and at last he saw what he expected to see dust a lot of dust being kicked up by hooves boots or wheels it could have been fugitives streaming eastward on the road beside the river or it could have been the french sharpe could not tell you will be trying to get south of the douro vicente asked aye i am but theres no bridges on this part of the river is that right not till you reach amarante vicente said and that is on the river tamega it is a how do you say a side river tributary thank you of the douro but once across the tamega there is a bridge over the douro at peso da regua and are the frogs on the far side of the tamega vicente shook his head we were told general silveira is there being told that a portuguese general was waiting across a river was not the same as knowing it sharpe thought and theres a ferry over the douro he asked not far from here vicente nodded at barca davintas how close is it vicente thought for a heartbeat maybe a halfhours walk less probably that close but if the ferry was close to oporto then the french could already be there and how far is amarante we could be there tomorrow tomorrow sharpe echoed then collapsed the telescope he stared south was that dust thrown up by the french were they on their way to barca davintas he wanted to use the ferry because it was so much nearer but also riskier would the french be expecting fugitives to use the ferry or perhaps the invaders did not even know it existed there was only one way to find out how do we get to barca davintas he asked vicente gesturing back down the track that led through the cork oaks the same way we came there is a quicker path vicente said then lead on some of the men were sleeping but harper kicked them awake and they all followed vicente off the road and down into a gentle valley where vines grew in neatly tended rows from there they climbed another hill and walked through meadows dotted with the small haystacks left from the previous year flowers studded the grass and twined about the witchhat haystacks while blossoms filled the hedgerows there was no path though vicente led the men confidently enough you know where youre going sharpe asked suspiciously after a while i know this landscape vicente assured the rifleman i know it well you grew up here then vicente shook his head i was raised in coimbra thats far to the south senhor but i know this landscape because i belonghe checked and corrected himselfbelonged to a society that walks here a society that walks in the countryside sharpe asked amused vicente blushed we are philosophers senhor and poets sharpe was too astonished to respond immediately but finally managed a question you were what philosophers and poets senhor jesus bloody christ sharpe said we believe senhor vicente went on that there is inspiration in the countryside the country you see is natural while towns are made by man and so harbor all mens wickedness if we wish to discover our natural goodness then it must be sought in the country he was having trouble finding the right english words to express what he meant there is i think he tried again a natural goodness in the world and we seek it so you come here for inspiration we do yes vicente nodded eagerly giving inspiration to a lawyer sharpe thought sourly was like feeding fine brandy to a rat and let me guess he said barely hiding his derision that the members of your society of rhyming philosophers are all men not a woman among you eh how did you know vicente asked in amazement i told you i guessed vicente nodded it is not of course that we do not like women you must not think that we do not want their company but they are reluctant to join our discussions they would be most welcome of course but his voice tailed away women are like that sharpe said women he had found preferred the company of rogues to the joys of conversation with sober and earnest young men like lieutenant vicente who harbored romantic dreams about the world and whose thin black mustache had patently been grown in an attempt to make himself look older and more sophisticated and only succeeded in making him look younger tell me something lieutenant he said jorge vicente interrupted him my name is jorge like your saint so tell me something jorge you said you had some training as a soldier what kind of training was it we had lectures in porto lectures on the history of warfare on hannibal alexander and caesar book learning sharpe asked not hiding his derision book learning vicente said bravely comes naturally to a lawyer and a lawyer moreover who saved your life lieutenant sharpe grunted knowing he had deserved that mild reproof what did happen back there he asked when you rescued me i know you shot one of your sergeants but why didnt the french hear you do that ah vicente frowned thinking i shall be honest lieutenant and tell you it is not all to my credit i had shot the sergeant before i saw you he was telling the men to strip off their uniforms and run away some did and the others would not listen to me so i shot him it was very sad and most of the men were in the tavern by the river close to where the french made their barricade sharpe had seen no tavern he had been too busy trying to extricate his men from the dragoons to notice one it was then i saw you coming sergeant macedovicente gestured toward a squat darkfaced man stumping along behindwanted to stay hidden in the tavern and i told the men that it was time to fight for portugal most did not seem to listen so i drew my pistol senhor and i went into the road i thought i would die but i also thought i must set an example but your men followed you they did vicente said warmly and sergeant macedo fought very bravely i think sharpe said that despite being a bloody lawyer youre a remarkable bloody soldier i am the young portuguese sounded amazed but sharpe knew it must have taken a natural leader to bring men out of a tavern to ambush a party of dragoons so did all your philosophers and poets join the army sharpe asked vicente looked embarrassed some joined the french alas the french the lieutenant shrugged there is a belief senhor that the future of mankind is prophesied in french thought in french ideas in portugal i think we are oldfashioned and in response many of us are inspired by the french philosophers they reject the church and the old ways they dislike the monarchy and despise unearned privilege their ideas are very exciting you have read them no sharpe said but i love my country more than i love monsieur rousseau vicente said sadly so i shall be a soldier before i am a poet quite right sharpe said best choose something useful to do with your life they crossed a small rise in the ground and sharpe saw the river ahead and a small village beside it and he checked vicente with an upraised hand is that barca davintas it is vicente said god damn it sharpe said bitterly because the french were there already the river curled gently at the foot of some bluetinged hills and between sharpe and the river were meadows vineyards the small village a stream flowing to the river and the goddamned bloody french more dragoons the greencoated cavalrymen had dismounted and now strolled about the village as if they did not have a care in the world and sharpe dropping back behind some gorse bushes waved his men down sergeant skirmish order along the crest he left harper to get on with deploying the rifles while he took out his telescope and stared at the enemy what do i do vicente asked just wait sharpe said he focused the glass marveling at the clarity of its magnified image he could see the buckle holes in the girth straps on the dragoons horses which were picketed in a small field just to the west of the village he counted the horses fortysix maybe fortyeight it was hard to tell because some of the beasts were bunched together call it fifty men he edged the telescope left and saw smoke rising from beyond the village maybe from the river bank a small stone bridge crossed the stream which flowed from the north he could see no villagers had they fled he looked to the west back down the road which led to oporto and he could see no more frenchmen which suggested the dragoons were a patrol sent to harry fugitives pat sir harper came and crouched beside him we can take these bastards harper borrowed sharpes telescope and stared south for a good minute forty of them fifty about that make sure our boys are loaded sharpe left the telescope with harper and scrambled back from the crest to find vicente call your men here i want to talk to them youll translate sharpe waited till the thirtyseven portuguese were assembled most looked uncomfortable doubtless wondering why they were being commanded by a foreigner my name is sharpe he told the bluecoated troops lieutenant sharpe and ive been a soldier for sixteen years he waited for vicente to interpret then pointed at the youngestlooking portuguese soldier a lad who could not have been a day over seventeen and might well have been three years younger i was carrying a musket before you were born and i mean carrying a musket i was a soldier like you i marched in the ranks vicente as he translated gave sharpe a surprised look the rifleman ignored it ive fought in flanders sharpe went on ive fought in india ive fought in spain and ive fought in portugal and ive never lost a fight never the portuguese had just been run out of the great northern redoubt in front of oporto and that defeat was still sore yet here was a man telling them he was invincible and some of them looked at the scar on his face and the hardness in his eyes and they believed him now you and i are going to fight together sharpe went on and that means were going to win were going to run these damned frenchmen out of portugal some of them smiled at that dont take any notice of what happened today that wasnt your fault you were led by a bishop what bloody use is a bishop to anyone you might as well go into battle with a lawyer vicente gave sharpe a swift and reproving glance before translating the last sentence but he must have done it correctly for the men grinned at sharpe were going to run the bastards back to france sharpe continued and for every portuguese and briton they kill were going to slaughter a score some of the portuguese thumped their musket butts on the ground in approbation but before we fight sharpe went on youd better know i have three rules and you had all better get used to those rules now because if you break these three rules then god help me ill goddamn break you vicente sounded nervous as he interpreted the last few words sharpe waited then held up one finger you dont get drunk without my permission a second finger you dont thieve from anyone unless youre starving and i dont count taking things off the enemy as thieving that got a smile he held up the third finger and you fight as if the devil himself was on your tail thats it you dont get drunk you dont thieve and you fight like demons you understand they nodded after the translation and right now sharpe went on youre going to start fighting youre going to make three ranks and youll fire a volley at some french cavalry he would have preferred two ranks but only the british fought in two ranks every other army used three and so for the moment he would too even though thirtyseven men in three ranks offered a very small frontage and you wont pull your trigger until lieutenant vicente gives the order you can trust him hes a good soldier your lieutenant vicente blushed and perhaps made some modest changes to his interpretation but the grins on his mens faces suggested the lawyer had conveyed the gist of sharpes words make sure your muskets are loaded sharpe said but not cocked i dont want the enemy knowing were here because some careless halfwit lets off a cocked musket now enjoy killing the bastards he left them on that bloodthirsty note and walked back to the crest where he knelt beside harper are they doing anything he asked nodding toward the dragoons getting drunk harper said gave them the talk did you is that what it is dont get drunk dont thieve and fight like the devil mister sharpes sermon sharpe smiled then took the telescope from the sergeant and trained it at the village where a score of dragoons their green coats unbuttoned were squirting wineskins into their mouths others were searching the small houses a woman with a torn black dress ran from one house was seized by a cavalryman and dragged back indoors i thought the villagers were gone sharpe said ive seen a couple of women harper said and doubtless there are plenty more we cant see he ran a huge hand over the lock of his rifle so what are we going to do with them were going to piss up their noses sharpe said till they decide to swat us away and then were going to kill them he collapsed the glass and told harper exactly how he planned to defeat the dragoons the vineyards gave sharpe the opportunity the vines grew in close thick rows that stretched from the stream on their left to some woodland off to the west and the rows were broken only by a footpath that gave laborers access to the plants which offered dense cover for sharpes men as they crawled closer to barca davintas two careless french sentries watched from the villages edge but neither saw anything threatening in the spring countryside and one of them even laid his carbine down so he could pack a small pipe with tobacco sharpe put vicentes men close to the footpath and sent his riflemen off to the west so that they were closer to the paddock in which the dragoons horses were picketed then he cocked his own rifle lay down so that the barrel protruded between two gnarled vine roots and aimed at the nearest sentry he fired and the butt slammed back into his shoulder and the sound was still echoing from the villages walls when his riflemen began shooting at the horses their first volley brought down six or seven of the beasts wounded as many again and started a panic among the other tethered animals two managed to pull their picketing pins out of the turf and jumped the fence in an attempt to escape but then circled back toward their companions just as the rifles were reloaded and fired again more horses screamed and fell a halfdozen of the riflemen were watching the village and began shooting at the first dragoons to run toward the paddock vicentes infantry remained hidden crouching among the vines sharpe saw that the sentry he had shot was crawling up the street leaving a bloody trail and as the smoke from that shot faded he fired again this time at an officer running toward the paddock more dragoons fearing they were losing their precious horses ran to unpicket the beasts and the rifle bullets began to kill men as well as horses an injured mare whinnied pitifully and then the dragoons commanding officer realized he could not rescue the horses until he had driven away the men who were slaughtering them and so he shouted at his cavalrymen to advance into the vines and drive the attackers off keep shooting the horses sharpe shouted it was not a pleasant job the screams of the wounded beasts tore at mens souls and the sight of an injured gelding trying to drag itself along by its front legs was heartbreaking but sharpe kept his men firing the dragoons spared the rifle fire now ran toward the vineyard in the confident belief that they were dealing with a mere handful of partisans dragoons were supposed to be mounted infantry and so they were issued with carbines shortbarrelled muskets with which they could fight on foot and some carried the carbines while others preferred to attack with their long straight swords but all of them instinctively ran toward the track which climbed among the vines sharpe had guessed they would follow the track rather than clamber over the entangling vines and that was why he had put vicente and his men close by the path the dragoons were bunching together as they entered the vines and sharpe had an urge to run across to the portuguese and take command of them but just then vicente ordered his men to stand the portuguese soldiers appeared as if by magic in front of the disorganized dragoons sharpe watched approvingly as vicente let his men settle then ordered them to fire the french had tried to check their desperate charge and swerve aside but the vines obstructed them and vicentes volley hammered into the thickest press of cavalrymen bunched on the narrow track harper off on the right flank had the riflemen add their own volley so that the dragoons were assailed from both sides powder smoke drifted over the vines fix swords sharpe shouted a dozen dragoons were dead and the ones at the back were already running away they had been convinced they fought against a few undisciplined peasants and instead they were outnumbered by real soldiers and the center of their makeshift line had been gutted half their horses were dead and now the infantry was coming from the smoke with fixed bayonets the portuguese stepped over the dead and injured dragoons one of the frenchmen shot in the thigh rolled over with a pistol in his hand and vicente knocked it away with his sword and then kicked the gun into the stream the unwounded dragoons were running toward the horses and sharpe ordered his riflemen to drive them off with bullets rather than blades just keep them running he shouted panic them lieutenant he looked for vicente take your men into the village cooper tongue slattery make these bastards safe he knew he had to keep the frenchmen in front moving but he dared not leave any lightly wounded dragoons in his rear and so he ordered the three riflemen to disarm the cavalrymen injured by vicentes volley the portuguese were in the village now banging open doors and converging on a church that stood next to the bridge that crossed the small stream sharpe ran toward the field where the horses were dead dying or terrified a few dragoons had tried to untie their mounts but the rifle fire had chased them off so now sharpe was the possessor of a score of horses dan he called to hagman put the wounded ones out of their misery pendleton harris cresacre over there he pointed the three men toward the wall on the paddocks western side the dragoons had fled that way and sharpe guessed they had taken refuge in some trees that stood thick just a hundred paces away three picquets were not enough to cope with even a halfhearted counterattack by the french so sharpe knew he would have to strengthen those picquets soon but first he wanted to make sure there were no dragoons skulking in the houses gardens and orchards of the village barca davintas was a small place a straggle of houses built about the road that ran down to the river where a short jetty should have accommodated the ferry but some of the smoke sharpe had seen earlier was coming from a bargelike vessel with a blunt bow and a dozen rowlocks now it was smoking in the water its upper works burned almost to the waterline and its lower hull holed and sunken sharpe stared at the useless boat looked across the river that was over a hundred yards broad and then swore harper appeared beside him his rifle slung jesus he said staring at the ferry thats not a lot of good to man or beast is it now any of our boys hurt not a one sir not even a scratch the portuguese are the same all alive they did well didnt they he looked at the burning boat again sweet jesus was that the ferry it was noahs bloody ark sharpe snapped what do you goddamned think it was he was angry because he had hoped to use the ferry to get all his men safe across the douro but now it seemed he was stranded he stalked away then turned back just in time to see harper making a face at him have you found the taverns he asked ignoring the grimace not yet sir harper said then find them put a guard on them then send a dozen more men to the far side of the paddock yes sir the french had set more fires among sheds on the river bank and sharpe now ducked beneath the billowing smoke to kick open halfburned doors there was a pile of tarred nets smoldering in one shed but in the next there was a blackpainted skiff with a fine spiked bow that curved up like a hook the shed had been fired but the flames had not reached the skiff and sharpe managed to drag it halfway out of the door before lieutenant vicente arrived and helped him pull the boat all the way out of the smoke the other sheds were too well alight but at least this one boat was saved and sharpe reckoned it could hold about half a dozen men safely which meant that it would take the rest of the day to ferry everyone across the wide river sharpe was about to ask vicente to look for oars or paddles when he saw that the young mans face was white and shaken almost as if the lieutenant was on the point of tears what is it sharpe asked vicente did not answer but merely pointed back to the village the french were having games with the ladies eh sharpe asked setting off for the houses i would not call it games vicente said bitterly and there is also a prisoner only one there are two others vicente said frowning but this one is a lieutenant he had no breeches which is why he was slow to run sharpe did not ask why the captured dragoon had no breeches he knew why what have you done with him he must go on trial vicente said sharpe stopped and stared at the lieutenant he must what he asked astonished go on trial of course in my country sharpe said they hang a man for rape not without a trial vicente protested and sharpe guessed that the portuguese soldiers had wanted to kill the prisoner straight away and that vicente had stopped them out of some highminded idea that a trial was necessary bloody hell sharpe said youre a soldier now not a lawyer you dont give them a trial you chop their hearts out most of barca davintass inhabitants had fled the dragoons but some had stayed and most of them were now crowded about a house guarded by a halfdozen of vicentes men a dead dragoon stripped of shirt coat boots and breeches lay face down in front of the church he must have been leaning against the church wall when he was shot for he had left a smear of blood down the limewashed stones now a dog sniffed at his toes the soldiers and villagers parted to let sharpe and vicente into the house where the young dragoon officer fairhaired thin and sullenfaced was being guarded by sergeant macedo and another portuguese soldier the lieutenant had managed to pull on his breeches but had not had time to button them and he was now holding them up by the waist as soon as he saw sharpe he began gabbling in french you speak french sharpe asked vicente of course vicente said but vicente sharpe reflected wanted to give this fairhaired frenchman a trial and sharpe suspected that if vicente interrogated the man he would not learn the real truth merely hear the excuses so sharpe went to the house door harper he waited till the sergeant appeared get me tongue or harris he ordered i will talk to the man vicente protested i need you to talk to someone else sharpe said and he went to the back room where a girlshe could not have been a day over fourteenwas weeping her face was red eyes swollen and her breath came in fitful jerks interspersed with grizzling moans and cries of despair she was wrapped in a blanket and had a bruise on her left cheek an older woman dressed all in black was trying to comfort the girl who began to cry even louder the moment she saw sharpe making him back out of the room in embarrassment find out from her what happened he told vicente then turned as harris came through the door harris and tongue were sharpes two educated men tongue had been doomed to the army by drink while the redhaired ever cheerful harris claimed to be a volunteer who wanted adventure he was getting plenty now sharpe reflected this piece of shit sharpe told harris jerking his head at the fairhaired frenchman was caught with his knickers round his ankles and a young girl under him find out what his excuse is before we kill the bastard he went back to the street and took a long drink from his canteen the water was warm and brackish harper was waiting by a horse trough in the center of the street and sharpe joined him all well theres two more frogs in there harper flicked a thumb toward the church behind him live ones i mean the church door was guarded by four of vicentes men what are they doing in there sharpe asked praying the tall ulsterman shrugged looking for sanctuary id guess we cant take the bastards with us sharpe said so why dont we just shoot them because mister vicente says we mustnt harper said hes very particular about prisoners is mister vicente hes a lawyer isnt he he seems halfway decent for a lawyer sharpe admitted grudgingly the best lawyers are six feet under the daisies so they are harper said and this one wont let me go and shoot those two bastards he says theyre just drunks which is true they are skewed to the skies they are we cant cope with prisoners sharpe said he wiped the sweat from his forehead then pulled his shako back on the visor was coming away from the crown but there was nothing he could do about that here get tongue he suggested and see if he can find out what these two were up to if theyre just drunk on communion wine then march them out west strip them of anything valuable and boot them back where they came from but if they raped anyone i know what to do sir harper said grimly then do it sharpe said he nodded to harper then walked on past the church to where the stream joined the river the small stone bridge carried the road eastward through a vineyard past a walled cemetery and then twisted through pastureland beside the douro it was all open land and if more french came and he had to retreat from the village then he dared not use that road and he hoped to god he had time to ferry his men over the douro and that thought made him go back up the street to look for oars or maybe he could find a rope if the rope were long enough he could rig a line across the river and haul the boat back and forth and that would surely be quicker than rowing he was wondering if there were bell ropes in the small church that might stretch that far when harris came out of the house and said that the prisoners name was lieutenant olivier and he was in the th dragoons and that the lieutenant despite being caught with his breeches round his ankles had denied raping the girl he said french officers dont behave like that harris said but lieutenant vicente says the girl swears he did so did he or didnt he sharpe asked irritably of course he did sir he admitted as much after i thumped him harris said happily but he still insists she wanted him to he says she wanted comforting after a sergeant raped her wanted comforting sharpe said scathingly he was just second in line wasnt he fifth in line harris said tonelessly or so the girl says jesus sharpe swore why dont i just give the bugger a smacking then well string him up he walked back to the house where the civilans were screaming at the frenchman who gazed at them with a disdain hat would have been admirable on a battlefield vicente was protecting he dragoon and now appealed to sharpe for help to escort lieutenant dlivier to safety he must stand trial vicente insisted he just had a trial sharpe said and i found him guilty so now ill thump him and then ill hang him vicente looked nervous but he did not back down we cannot lower ourselves to their level of barbarity he claimed i didnt rape her sharpe said so dont place me with them we fight for a better world vicente declared for a second sharpe just stared at the young portuguese officer scarce believing what he had heard what happens if we leave him here eh we cant vicente said knowing that the villagers would take a far worse revenge than anything sharpe was proposing and i cant take prisoners sharpe insisted we cant kill himvicente was blushing with indignation as he confronted sharpe and he would not back downand we cant leave him here it would be murder oh for christs sake sharpe said in exasperation lieutenant olivier did not speak english but he seemed to understand that his fate was in the balance and he watched sharpe and vicente like a hawk and whos going to be the judge and jury sharpe demanded but vicente got no opportunity to answer for just then a rifle fired from the western edge of the village and then another sounded and then there was a whole rattle of shots the french had come back colonel james christopher liked wearing the hussar uniform he decided it suited him and he spent a long time admiring himself in the pier glass in the farmhouses largest bedroom turning left and right and marveling at the feeling of power conveyed by the uniform he deduced it came from the long tasseled boots and from the jackets high stiff collar that forced a man to stand upright with his head back and from the fit of the jacket that was so tight that christopher who was lean and fit still had to suck in his belly to fasten the hooks and eyes down its silverlaced front the uniform made him feel encased in authority and the elegance of the outfit was enhanced by the furedged pelisse that was draped from his left shoulder and by the silverchained saber scabbard that chinked as he went downstairs and as he paced up and down the terrace where he waited for his guest he put a sliver of wood into his mouth obsessively working it between his teeth as he gazed at the distant smear of smoke which showed where buildings burned in the captured city a handful of fugitives had stopped at the farm to beg for food and luis had talked with them and then told christopher that hundreds if not thousands of people had drowned when the pontoon bridge broke the refugees claimed that the french had wrecked the bridge with cannon fire and luis his hatred of the enemy fueled by the false rumor eyed his master with a surly expression until christopher had finally lost his patience it is only a uniform luis it is not a sign of a changed allegiance a french uniform luis had complained you wish portugal to be free of the french christopher snapped then behave respectfully and forget this uniform now christopher paced the terrace picking at his teeth and constantly watching the road that led across the hill the clock in the farms elegant parlor struck three and no sooner had the last chime faded than a large column of cavalry appeared across the far crest they were dragoons and they came in force to make sure that no partisans or fugitive portuguese troops gave trouble to the officer who rode to meet christopher the dragoons all from the th regiment wheeled away into the ields beneath the farmhouse where a stream offered water for their lorses the cavalrymens rosefronted green coats were white with dust some seeing christopher in his french hussars uniform offered a hasty salute but most ignored him and just led their horses toward the stream is the englishman turned to greet his visitor his name was argenton and he was a captain and the adjutant of the th dragoons and it was plain from his smile that he knew and liked colonel christopher the uniform becomes you argenton said i found it in oporto christopher said it belonged to a poor fellow who was a prisoner and died of the fever and a tailor trimmed it to size for me he did well argenton said admiringly now all you need are the cadenettes the cadenettes the pigtails argenton explained touching his temples where the french hussars grew their hair long to mark themselves as elite cavalrymen some men go bald and have wigmakers attach false cadenettes to their shakoes or colbacks im not sure i want to grow pigtails christopher said amused but perhaps i can find some girl with black hair and cut off a pair of tails eh a good idea argenton said he watched approvingly as his escort set picquets then smiled his thanks as a very sullenlooking luis brought him and christopher glasses of vinho verde the golden white wine of the douro valley argenton sipped the wine cautiously and was surprised that it was so good he was a slight man with a frank open face and red hair that was damp with sweat and marked where his helmet had been he smiled easily a reflection of his trusting nature christopher rather despised the frenchman but knew he would be useful argenton drained the wine did you hear about the drownings in oporto he asked my servant says you broke the bridge they would say that argenton said regretfully the bridge collapsed under the weight of the refugees it was an accident a sad accident but if the people had stayed in their homes and given our men a decent welcome then there wouldnt have been any panic at the bridge theyd all be alive now as it is were being blamed but it had nothing to do with us the bridge wasnt strong enough and who built the bridge the portuguese a sad accident as you say christopher said but all the same i must congratulate you on your swift capture of oporto it was a notable feat of arms it would have been still more notable argenton observed if the opposition had been better soldiers i trust your losses were not extravagant a handful argenton said dismissively but half of our regiment was sent eastward and they lost a good few men in an ambush by the river an ambushhe looked accusingly at christopherin which some british riflemen took part i didnt think there were any british troops in oporto there shouldnt have been christopher said i ordered them south of the river then they disobeyed you argenton said did any of the riflemen die christopher asked mildly hoping that argenton would have news of sharpes death i wasnt there im posted to oporto where i find billets look for rations and do the errands of war which i am sure you discharge admirably christopher said smoothly then led his guest into the farmhouse where argenton admired the tiles about the dining room hearth and the simple iron chandelier that hung above the table the meal itself was commonplace enough chicken beans bread cheese and a good country red wine but captain argenton was complimentary weve been on short rations he explained but that should change now weve found plenty of food in oporto and a warehouse stuffed to the rafters with good british powder and shot you were short of those too christopher asked we have plenty argenton said but the british powder is better than our own we have no source of saltpeter except what we scrape from cesspit walls christopher grimaced at the thought the best saltpeter an essential dement of gunpowder came from india and he had never considered that there might be a shortage in france i assume he said that the powder was a british gift to the portuguese who have now given it to us argenton said much to marshal soults delight then it is time perhaps christopher suggested that we made the marshal unhappy indeed argenton said indeed and then fell silent because they had reached the purpose of their meeting it was a strange purpose but an exciting one the two men were plotting mutiny or rebellion or a coup against marshal soults army but however it was described it was a ploy that might end the war there was argenton now explained a great deal of dissatisfaction in marshal soults army christopher had heard all this before from his guest but he did not interrupt as argenton rehearsed the arguments that would justify his disloyalty he described how some officers all devout catholics were mortally offended by their armys behavior in spain and portugal churches had been desecrated nuns raped even the holy sacraments have been defiled argenton said in a horrified tone i can hardly believe it christopher said other officers a few were simply opposed to bonaparte argenton was a catholic monarchist but he was willing to make common cause with those men who still held jacobin sympathies and believed that bonaparte had betrayed the revolution they cannot be trusted of course argenton said not in the long run but they will join us in resisting bonapartes tyranny i pray they do christopher said the british government had long known that there was a shadowy league of french officers who opposed bonaparte they called themselves the philadelphes and london had once sent agents in search of their elusive brotherhood but had finally concluded that their numbers were too few their ideals too vague and their supporters too ideologically divided for the philadelphes ever to succeed yet here in remote northern portugal the various opponents of bonaparte had found a common cause christopher had first got wind of that cause when he talked with a french officer who had been taken prisoner on portugals northern border and who had been living in braga where having given his parole his only restriction was to remain within the barracks for his own protection christopher had drunk with the unhappy officer and heard a tale of french unrest that sprang from one mans absurd ambition nicolas jean de dieu soult duke of dalmatia marshal of france and commander of the army that was now invading portugal had seen other men who served the emperor become princes even kings and he reckoned his own dukedom was a poor reward for a career that outshone almost all the emperors other marshals soult had been a soldier for twentyfour years a general for fifteen and a marshal for five at austerlitz the greatest of all the emperors victories so far marshal soult had covered himself with glory far outfighting marshal bernadotte who nevertheless was now prince of ponte corvo jerome bonaparte the emperors youngest brother was an idle extravagant wastrel yet he was king of westphalia while marshal murat a hotheaded braggart was king of naples louis napoleon another of the emperors brothers was king of holland and all those men were nonentities while soult who knew his own high worth was a mere duke and it was not enough but now the ancient throne of portugal was empty the royal family fearing the french invasion had fled to brazil and soult wanted to occupy the vacant chair colonel christopher at first had not believed the tale but the prisoner had sworn its truth and christopher had talked with some of the other few prisoners who had been captured in skirmishes on the northern frontier and all claimed to have heard much the same story it was no secret they said that soult had royal pretensions but the paroled officers also told christopher that the marshals ambitions had soured many of his own officers who disliked the idea that they should fight and suffer so far from home only to put nicolas soult on an empty chair there was talk of mutiny and christopher had been wondering how he could discover whether that mutinous talk was serious when captain argenton approached him argenton with great daring had been traveling in northern portugal dressed in civilian clothes and claiming to be a wine merchant from upper canada if he had been caught he would have been shot as a spy for argenton was not exploring the land ahead of the french armies but rather trying to discover pliable portuguese aristocrats who would encourage soult in his ambitions for if the marshal was to declare himself king of portugal or more modestly king of northern lusitania then he first needed to be persuaded that there were men of influence in portugal who would support that usurpation of the vacant throne argenton had been talking with such men and christopher to his surprise discovered there were plenty of aristocrats churchmen and scholars in northern portugal who hated their own monarchy and believed that a foreign king from an enlightened france would be of benefit to their country so letters were being collected that would encourage soult to declare himself king and when that happened argenton had promised christopher the army would mutiny the war had to be stopped argenton said or else like a great fire it would consume all europe it was a madness he said a madness of the emperor who seemed intent on conquering the whole world he believes he is alexander the great the frenchman said gloomily and if he doesnt stop then there will be nothing left of france who are we to fight everyone austria prussia britain spain portugal russia never russia christopher said even bonaparte is not that mad he is mad argenton insisted and we must rid france of him and the start of the process he believed would be the mutiny that would surely erupt when soult declared himself a king your army is unhappy christopher allowed but will they follow you into mutiny i would not lead it argenton said but there are men who will and those men want to take the army back to france and that i assure you is what most of the soldiers want they will follow who are these leaders christopher asked swiftly argenton hesitated any mutiny was a dangerous business and if the identities of the leaders became known then there could be an orgy of firing squads christopher saw his hesitation if we are to persuade the british authorities that your plans are worth supporting he said then we must give them names we must and you must trust us my friend christopher placed a hand over his heart i swear to you upon my honor that i shall never betray those names never argenton reassured listed the men who would lead the revolt against soult there was colonel lafitte the commanding officer of his own regiment and the colonels brother and they were supported by colonel donadieu of the th regiment of the line they are respected argenton said earnestly and the men will follow them he gave more names that christopher jotted down in his notebook but he observed that none of the mutineers was above the rank of colonel an impressive list christopher lied then he smiled now give me another name tell me who in your army would be your most dangerous opponent our most dangerous opponent argenton was puzzled by the question other than marshal soult of course christopher went on i want to know who we should watch who perhaps we might want to how can i put it render safe ah argenton understood now and he thought for a short while probably brigadier vuillard he said ive not heard of him a bonapartiste through and through argenton said disapprovingly spell his name for me will you christopher asked then wrote it down brigadier henri vuillard i assume he knows nothing of your scheme he continued of course not argenton said but it is a scheme colonel that cannot work without british support general cradock is sympathetic is he not cradock is sympathetic christopher said confidently he had reported his earlier conversations to the british general who had seen in the proposed mutiny an alternative to fighting the french and so had encouraged christopher to pursue the matter but alas christopher went on its rumored he will soon be replaced and the new man argenton inquired wellesley christopher said flatly sir arthur wellesley is he a good general christopher shrugged hes well connected younger son of an earl eton of course he wasnt thought clever enough for anything except the army but most people think he did well near lisbon last year against laborde and junot argenton said scathingly and he had some successes in india before that christopher added in warning oh in india argenton said smiling reputations made in india rarely stand up to a volley in europe but will this wellesley want to fight soult christopher thought about that question i think he said eventually that he would prefer not to lose i think he went on that if he knows the strength of your sentiments then he will cooperate christopher was not nearly as certain as he sounded indeed he had heard that general wellesley was a cold man who might not look kindly on an escapade that depended for its success on so many assumptions but christopher had other fish to fry in this unholy tangle he doubted whether the mutiny could ever succeed and did not much care what cradock or wellesley thought of it but knew his knowledge of it could be used to great advantage and for the moment anyway it was important that argenton saw christopher as an ally tell me he said to the frenchman exactly what you want of us britains influence argenton said we want britain to persuade the portuguese leaders to accept soult as their king i thought youd found plenty of support already christopher said ive found support argenton confirmed but most wont declare themselves for fear of the mobs vengeance but if britain encourages them theyll find their courage they dont even have to make their support public merely write letters to soult and then there are the intellectualsargentons sneer as he said the last word would have soured milkmost of whom will back anyone other than their own government but again they need encouragement before theyll find the bravery to express support for marshal soult im sure we would be happy to provide encouragement christopher said he was not sure at all and we need an assurance argenton said firmly that if we lead a rebellion the british will not take advantage of the situation by attacking us i shall want your generals word on that christopher nodded and i think he will give it he said but before he commits himself to any such promise he will want to judge for himself the likelihood of your success and that my friend means he will want to hear from you directly christopher unstoppered a decanter of wine then paused before pouring and i think you need to hear his personal assurances i think you must travel south to see him argenton looked rather surprised by this suggestion but he thought about it for a moment and then nodded you can give me a pass that will see me safe through the british lines i will do better my friend i shall come with you so long as you provide me with a pass for the french lines then we shall go argenton said happily my colonel will give me permission once he understands what we are doing but when soon i think dont you tomorrow the day after tomorrow christopher said firmly i have an engagement tomorrow that i cannot avoid but if you join me in vila real ie zedes tomorrow afternoon then we can travel the next day will that suit argenton nodded you must tell me how to reach vila real de zedes i shall give you directions christopher said then raised his glass and i shall drink to the success of our endeavors amen to that argenton said and raised his glass to the toast and colonel christopher smiled because he was rewriting the rules chapter sharpe ran across the paddock where the dead horses lay with flies crawling in their nostrils and across their eyeballs he tripped on a metal picketing pin and as he stumbled forward a carbine bullet fluttered past him the sound suggesting it was almost spent but even a spent bullet in the wrong place could kill a man his riflemen were shooting from the fields far side the smoke of their baker rifles thickening along the wall sharpe dropped beside hagman whats happening dan dragoons are back sir hagman said laconically and theres some infantry there too you sure shot one blue bastard hagman said and two greens so far sharpe wiped sweat from his face then crawled a few paces along the wall to a place where the powder smoke was not so thick the dragoons had dismounted and were shooting from the edge of a wood some hundred paces away too long a range for their carbines sharpe thought but then he saw some blue uniforms where the road ran through the trees and he reckoned the infantry was forming for an attack there was an odd clicking noise coming from somewhere nearby and he could not place it but it seemed to offer no threat so he ignored it pendleton sir find lieutenant vicente hes in the village tell him to get his men out on the northern path now sharpe pointed to the track through the vineyards the same track by which they had entered barca davintas and where the dead dragoons of the first fight still lay and pendleton tell him to hurry but be polite though pendleton a pickpocket and purse snatcher from bristol was the youngest of sharpes men and now looked puzzled polite sir call him sir damn you and salute him but hurry goddamn it sharpe thought but there would be no escape across the douro today no slow shuttling back and forth with the small boat and no marching back to captain hogan and the army instead they would have to get the hell out northwards and get out fast sergeant he looked left and right for patrick harper through the misty patches of rifle smoke along the wall harper im with you sir harper came running from behind i was dealing with those two frogs in the church the moment the portuguese are into the vineyard we get out of here are any of our men left in the village harris is there sir and pendleton of course send someone to make sure the two of them get out sharpe leveled his rifle across the wall and sent a bullet spinning toward the infantry who were forming up on the road among the trees and pat what did you do with those two frogs theyd robbed the poor box harper said so i sent them to hell he patted his sheathed sword bayonet sharpe grinned and if you get the chance pat do the same to that bastard french officer pleasure sir harper said then ran back across the paddock sharpe reloaded the french he thought were being too cautious they should have attacked already but they must have believed there was a larger force in barca davintas than two stranded half companies and the rifle fire must have been disconcerting to the dragoons who were not used to such accuracy there were bodies lying on the grass at the edge of the wood evidence that the dismounted french horsemen had been taught about the baker rifle the hard way the french did not use rifles reckoning that the spiraling grooves and lands that spun the bullet in the barrel and so gave the weapon its accuracy also made it much too slow to reload and so the french like most british battalions relied on the quickerfiring but much less accurate musket a man could stand fifty yards from a musket and stand a good chance of living but standing a hundred paces in front of a baker in the hands of a good man was a death warrant and so the dragoons had pulled back into the trees there was infantry in the wood as well but what were the bastards doing sharpe propped his loaded rifle against the wall and took out his telescope the fine instrument made by matthew berge of london which had been a gift from sir arthur wellesely after sharpe had saved the generals life at assaye he rested the telescope on the walls mossy coping and stared at the leading company of french infantry which was well back in the trees but sharpe could see they were formed in three ranks he was looking for some sign that they were ready to advance but the men were slouching musket butts grounded without even fixed bayonets he whipped the glass right suddenly fearing that perhaps the french would try to cut off his retreat by infiltrating the vineyard but he saw nothing to worry him he looked back at the trees and saw a flash of light a distinct white circle and realized there was an officer kneeling in the leafy shadows staring at the village through a telescope the man was undoubtedly trying to work out how many enemy were in barca davintas and how to attack them sharpe put his own telescope away picked up the rifle and leveled it on the wall careful now he thought careful kill that one officer and any french attack is slowed because that officer is the man who makes the decisions and sharpe pulled back the flint lowered his head so that his right eye was gazing down the sights found the patch of dark shadow that was the frenchmans blue coat and then raised the rifles foresight a blade of metal so that the barrel hid the target and so allowed the bullet to drop there was little wind not enough to drift the bullet left or right a splintering of noise sounded from the other rifles and a drop of sweat trickled past sharpes left eye as he pulled the trigger and the rifle hammered back into his shoulder and the puff of bitter smoke from the pan made his right eye smart and the specks of burning powder stung his cheek as the cloud of barrel smoke billowed in front of the wall to hide the target sharpe twisted to see lieutenant vicentes troops streaming into the vineyard accompanied by thirty or forty civilians harper was coming back across the paddock the odd clicking noise was louder suddenly and sharpe registered that it was the sound of french carbine bullets striking the other side of the stone wall were all clear of the village sir harper said we can go sharpe said and he marveled that the enemy had been so slow thus giving him time to extricate his force he sent harper with most of the greenjackets to join vicente and they took a dozen french horses with them each horse worth a small fortune in prize money if they could ever rejoin the army sharpe kept hagman and six other men and they spread along the wall and fired as fast as their rifles would load which meant they did not wrap the bullets in leather patches which gripped the rifling but just tapped the balls down the barrels because sharpe did not care about accuracy he just wanted the french to see a thick rill of smoke and hear the shots and thus not know that their enemy was withdrawing he pulled the trigger and the flint broke into useless scraps so he slung the rifle and backed out of the smoke to see that vicente and harper were both well into the vineyard and so he shouted at his remaining men to hurry back across the paddock hagman paused to fire a last bullet then he ran and sharpe went with him the last man to leave and he could not believe it had been that easy to disengage that the french had been so supine and just then hagman went down at first sharpe thought hagman had tripped on one of the metal pegs with which the dragoons had picketed their horses then he saw blood on the grass and saw hagman let go of his rifle and his right hand slowly clench and unclench dan sharpe knelt and saw a tiny wound high up beside hagmans left shoulder blade just an unlucky carbine bullet that had flicked through the smoke and found its target go on sir hagmans voice was hoarse im done for youre bloody not sharpe snarled and he turned hagman over onto his back and saw no wound in front which meant the carbine ball was somewhere inside then hagman choked and spat up frothy blood and sharpe heard harper yelling at him the bastards are coming sir just one minute before sharpe thought he had been congratulating himself on how easy it had been and now it was all collapsing he pulled hagmans rifle to him slung it beside his own and picked up the old poacher who gave a gasp and a whimper and shook his head leave me sir im not leaving you dan hurts sir it hurts hagman whimpered again his face was deathly pale and there was a trickle of blood spilling from his mouth and then harper was at sharpes side and took hagman out of his arms leave me here hagman said softly take him pat sharpe said and then some rifles fired from the vineyard and muskets banged behind him and the air was whistling with balls as sharpe pushed harper on he followed walking backward watching the blue french uniforms appear in the mist of smoke left by their own ragged volley come on sir harper shouted letting sharpe know he had hagman in the scanty shelter of the vines carry him north sharpe said when he reached the vineyard hes hurting bad sir carry him get him out of here sharpe watched the french three companies of infantry had attacked the pasture but they made no effort to follow sharpe north they must have seen the column of portuguese and british troops winding through the vineyards accompanied by the dozen captured horses and a crowd of frightened villagers but they did not follow it seemed they wanted barca davintas more than they wanted sharpes men dead even when sharpe established himself on a knoll a halfmile north of the village and stared at the french through his telescope they did not come near to threaten him they could easily have chased him away with dragoons but instead they chopped up the skiff that sharpe had rescued and then set the fragments alight theyre closing off the river sharpe said to vicente closing the river vicente did not understand making sure theyve got the only boats they dont want british or portuguese troops crossing the river attacking them in the rear which means its going to be bloody hard for us to go the other way sharpe turned as harper came near and saw that the big irish sergeants hands were bloody how is he harper shook his head hes in a terrible bad way sir he said gloomily i think the bloody balls in his lung coughing red bubbles he is when he can cough at all poor dan im not leaving him sharpe said obstinately he knew he had left tarrant behind and there were men like williamson who had been friends of tarrant who would resent that sharpe was not doing the same with hagman but tarrant had been a drunk and a troublemaker while dan hagman was valuable he was the oldest man among sharpes riflemen and he had a wealth of common sense that made him a steadying influence besides sharpe liked the old poacher make a stretcher pat he said and carry him they made a stretcher out of jackets that had their sleeves threaded onto two poles cut from an ash tree and while it was being fashioned sharpe and vicente watched the french and discussed how they were to escape them what we must do the portuguese lieutenant said is go east to amarante he smoothed a patch of bare earth and scratched a crude map with a splinter of wood this is the douro he said and here is porto we are herehe tapped the river very close to the cityand the nearest bridge is at amarante he made a cross mark well to the east we could be there tomorrow or perhaps the day after so can they sharpe said grimly and he nodded toward the village a gun had just appeared from among the trees where the french had waited so long before attacking sharpes men the cannon was drawn by six horses three of which were ridden by gunners in their darkblue uniforms the gun itself a twelvepounder was attached to its limber which was a light twowheeled cart that served as a ready magazine and as an axle for the heavy guns trail behind the gun was another team of four horses these pulling a coffinlike caisson that carried a spare gun wheel on its stern the caisson which was being ridden by a halfdozen gunners held the cannons ammunition even from half a mile away sharpe could hear the clink of the chains and thump of the wheels he watched in silence as a howitzer came into sight than a second twelvepounder and after that a troop of hussars do you think theyre coming here vicente asked with alarm no sharpe said theyre not interested in fugitives theyre going to amarante this is not the good road to amarante in fact it goes nowhere theyll have to strike north to the main road they dont know that yet sharpe guessed theyre taking any road east that they can find infantry had now appeared from the trees then another battery of artillery sharpe was watching a small army march eastward and there was only one reason to send so many men and guns to the east and that was to capture the bridge at amarante and so protect the french left flank amarante sharpe said thats where the bastards are going then we cant vicente said we can go sharpe said we just cant go on that road you say theres a main road up here vicente said and scratched the earth to show another road to the north of them that is the high road vicente said the french are probably on that as well do you really have to go to amarante ive got to cross the river sharpe said and theres a bridge there and theres a portuguese army there and just because the bloody frogs are going there doesnt mean that theyll capture the bridge and if they did he thought then he could go north from amarante until he found a crossing place then follow the tamegas far bank south until he reached a stretch of the douro unguarded by the french so how do we reach amarante if we dont go by road can we go across country vicente nodded we go north to a village herehe pointed to an empty space on his mapand then turn east the village is on the edge of the hills the beginning of thewhat do you call it the wilderness we used to go there we sharpe asked the poets and philosophers we would walk there vicente said spend the night in the tavern and walk back i doubt there will be frenchmen there it is not on the road to amarante not on any road so we go to the village at the edge of the wilderness sharpe said whats it called vila real de zedes vicente said it is called that because the vineyards there once belonged to the king but that was long ago now they are the property of vila real de what sharpe asked zedes vicente said puzzled by sharpes tone and even more puzzled by the smile on sharpes face you know the place i dont know it sharpe said but theres a girl i want to meet there a girl vicente sounded disapproving a nineteenyearold girl sharpe said and believe it or not its a duty he turned to see if the stretcher was finished and suddenly stiffened in anger what the hell is he doing here he asked he was staring at the french dragoon lieutenant olivier who was watching as harper carefully rolled hagman onto the stretcher he is to stand trial vicente said stubbornly so he is here under arrest and under my personal protection bloody hell sharpe exploded it is a matter of principle vicente insisted principle sharpe shouted its a matter of bloody stupidity lawyers bloody stupidity were in the middle of a bloody war not in a bloody assizes town in england he saw vicentes incomprehension oh never mind he growled how long will it take us to reach vila real de zedes we should be there tomorrow morning vicente said coldly then looked at hagman so long as he doesnt slow us down too much well be there tomorrow morning sharpe said and then he would rescue miss savage and find out just why she had run away and after that god help him he would slaughter the bloody dragoon officer lawyer or no lawyer the savage country house which was called the quinta do zedes was not in vila real de zedes itself but high on a hill spur to the south of the village it was a beautiful place its whitewashed walls edged with masonry to trace out the elegant lines of a small manor house which looked across the once royal vineyards the shutters were painted blue and the high windows of the ground floor were decorated with stained glass which showed the coats of arms of the family which had once owned the quinta do zedes mister savage had bought the quinta along with the vineyards and because the house was high possessed a thick tiled roof and was surrounded by trees hung with wisteria it proved blessedly cool in summer and so the savage family would move there each june and stay till october when they took themselves back to the house beautiful high on oportos slope then mister savage had died of a seizure and the house had stayed empty ever since except for the halfdozen servants who lived at the back and tended the small vegetable garden and walked down the long curving drive to the village church for mass there was a chapel in the quinta do zedes and in the old days when the owners of the coats of arms had lived in the long cool rooms the servants had been allowed to attend mass in the family chapel but mister savage had been a staunch protestant and he had ordered the altar taken away the statues removed and the chapel whitewashed for use is a food store the servants had been surprised when miss kate came to the house nit they curtsied or bowed and then set about making the great rooms comfortable the dust sheets were pulled from pieces of furniture the ats were knocked off the beams and the paleblue shutters were thrown open to let in the spring sun fires were lit to take away the lingering winter chill though on that first evening kate did not stay indoors beside the fires but instead sat on a balcony built on top of the quintas porch and stared down the drive which was edged with wisteria hanging from the cedar trees the evening shadows stretched but no one came kate almost cried herself to sleep that night but next morning her spirits were restored and over the shocked protests of the servants she swept out the entrance hall which was a glorious space of checkered black and white marble with a white marble staircase curving up to the bedrooms then she insisted on dusting the fireplace in the great parlor which was decorated with painted tiles showing the battle of aljubarrota where joao i had humiliated the castilians she ordered a second bedroom to be aired its bed made and the fire lit then she went back to the balcony above the porch and watched the driveway until just after the morning bell had rung in vila real de zedes she saw two horsemen appear beneath the cedars and her soul soared for joy the leading horseman was so tall so straightbacked so darkly handsome and at the same time there was a touching tragedy about him because his wife had died giving birth to their first baby and the baby had died as well and the thought of that fine man enduring such sadness almost brought tears to kates eyes but then the man stood in his stirrups and waved to her and kate felt her happiness flood back as she ran down the stairs to greet her lover on the house steps colonel christopher slid from his horse luis his servant was riding the spare horse and carrying the great valise filled with kates clothes that christopher had removed from the house beautiful once her mother was gone christopher threw luis the reins then ran to the house leaped up the front steps and took kate into his arms he kissed her and ran his hand from the nape of her neck to the small of her back and felt a tremor go through her i could not get here last night my love he told her duty called i knew it would be duty kate said her face shining as she looked up at him nothing else would keep me from you christopher said nothing and he bowed to kiss her forehead then took a pace back still holding both her hands to look into her face she was he thought the most beautiful girl in creation and charmingly modest for she blushed and laughed with embarrassment when he stared at her kate kate he said chidingly i shall spend all my years looking at you her hair was black and she wore it drawn back from her high forehead but with a pair of deep curls hanging where the french hussars wore their cadenettes she had a full mouth a small nose and eyes that were touchingly serious at one moment and sparkling with amusement the next she was nineteen years old leggy as a colt full of life and trust and at this moment full of love for her handsome man who was dressed in a plain black coat white riding breeches and a cocked hat from which hung two golden tassels did you see my mother she asked i left her promising that i would search for you kate looked guilty i should have told her your mother will want you to marry some man of property who is safe in england christopher said not some adventurer like me the real reason kates mother would disapprove was because she had hoped to marry christopher herself but then the colonel had discovered the terms of mr savages will and had turned his attention to the daughter it would do no good to ask her blessing he went on and if you had told her what we planned then she would most certainly have stopped us she might not kate suggested in a small voice but this way christopher said your mothers disapproval does not matter and when she knows we are married then i am persuaded she will learn to like me married of course christopher said you think i do not care for your honor he laughed at the shy look on her face there is a priest in the village he went on who i am sure can be persuaded to marry us i am not kate said then she brushed at her hair and tugged at her dress and blushed deeper you are ready christopher anticipated her protest and you look enchantingly beautiful kate blushed more deeply and plucked at the neckline of her dress which she had chosen very carefully from among the summer frocks stored in the quinta it was an english dress of white linen embroidered with bluebells entwined with acanthus leaves and she knew it suited her my mother will forgive me she asked christopher very much doubted it of course she will he promised her ive known such situations before your dear mother wants only the best for you but once she has come to know me she will surely recognize that i will care for you as no other i am sure she will kate said warmly she had never been quite certain why colonel christopher was so sure her mother would disapprove of him he said it was because he was twentyone years older than kate but he looked much less and she was sure he loved her and there were many men married to wives much younger and kate did not think her mother could possibly object on grounds of age but christopher also claimed to be a relatively poor man and that he said would most definitely offend her mother and kate thought that more than likely but christophers poverty did not offend her indeed it only seemed to make their love more romantic and now she would marry him he led her down the quintas steps is there a carriage here theres an old gig in the stables then we can walk to the village and luis can fetch the gig for our return now yesterday christopher said solemnly could not be too soon for me my love he sent luis to harness the gig then laughed i almost came with inconvenient company inconvenient some damn fool engineerforgive my soldiers vocabularywanted to send a brokendown rifle lieutenant to rescue you him and his ragamuffins i had to order him away be gone i said and stand not upon the order of your going poor fellow why poor dear me thirtysomething years old and still a lieutenant no money no prospects and a chip on his shoulder as big as the rock of gibraltar he put her hand under his elbow and walked her beneath the avenue of wisteria oddly enough i know the rifle lieutenant by reputation have you ever heard of lady grace hale the widow of lord william hale ive never heard of either of them kate said what a sheltered life you do lead in oporto christopher said lightly lord william was a very sound man i worked closely with him in the foreign office for a time but then he went to india on government business and had the misfortune to return on a naval ship that got tangled up in trafalgar he must have been an uncommonly brave fellow for he died in the battle but then there was an almighty scandal because his widow set up house with a rifle officer and this is the very same man ye gods what can lady grace have been thinking of hes not a gentleman certainly not born one christopher said god knows where the army fetch some of their officers these days but they dredged this fellow up from beneath a rock and the lady grace set up an establishment with him quite extraordinary but some wellbred women like to go fishing in the dirty end of the lake and i fear she must have been one of them he shook his head in disapproval it gets worse he went on because she became pregnant and then died giving birth poor woman kate said and marveled that her lover could tell this tale so calmly for it would surely remind him of his own first wifes death and what happened to the baby she asked i believe the child died too but it was probably for the best it ended the scandal and what future could such an infant have faced whatever the father of the child was this same wretched rifleman who was supposed to whisk you away across the river i sent him packing i can tell you christopher laughed at the recollection he scowled at me he looked grim and claimed he had his orders but i wouldnt stand his nonsense and told him to make himself scarce i hardly wanted such a disreputable rogue glowering at my wedding indeed not kate agreed of course i didnt tell him i knew his reputation there was no call to embarrass the fellow quite right kate said and squeezed her lovers arm luis appeared behind them driving a small dusty gig that had been stored in the quintas stables and to which he had harnessed his own horse christopher stopped halfway to the village and picked some of the small delicate wild narcissi that grew on the roads verge and he insisted on threading the yellow blossoms into kates black hair and then he kissed her again and told her she was beautiful and kate thought this had to be the happiest day of her life the sun shone a small wind stirred the flowerbright meadows and her man was beside her father josefa was waiting at the church having been summoned by christopher on his way to the quinta but before any ceremony could be performed the priest took the englishman aside i have been worrying the priest said that what you propose is irregular irregular father you are protestants the priest asked and when christopher nodded he sighed the church says that only those who take our sacraments can be married and your church is right christopher said emolliently he looked at kate standing alone in the whitepainted chancel and he thought she looked like an angel with the yellow flowers in her hair tell me father he went on do you look after the poor in your parish it is a christian duty father josefa said christopher took some golden english guineas from his pocket they were not his but from the funds supplied by the foreign office to smooth his way and now he folded the priests hand around the coins let me give you that as a contribution to your charitable work he said and let me beg you to give us a blessing that is all a blessing in latin father that will enjoin gods protection on us in these troubled times and later when the fighting is over i shall do my best to persuade kate to take instruction from you as i will too of course father josefa son of a laborer looked at the coins and thought he had never seen so much money at one time and he thought of all the difficulties the gold could allay i cannot say a mass for you he insisted i do not want a mass christopher said and i do not deserve a mass i just want a blessing in latin he wanted kate to believe she was married and so far as christopher was concerned the priest could gabble the words of the funeral rite if he wanted just a blessing from you father is all i want a blessing from you from god and from the saints he took another few coins from his pocket and gave them to the priest who decided a prayer of blessing could not possibly hurt and you will take instruction father josefa asked i have felt god pulling me toward your church for some time christopher said and i believe i must heed his call and then father you may marry us properly so father josefa kissed his scapular and then draped it about his shoulders and he went to the altar where he knelt made the sign of the cross and then stood and turned to smile at kate and the tall handsome man at her side the priest did not know kate well for the savage family had never been familiar with the villagers and certainly did not attend the church but the servants at the quinta spoke approvingly of her and father josefa though he was celibate could appreciate that this girl was a rare beauty and so his voice was full of warmth as he enjoined god and the holy saints to look with kindness on these two souls he felt guilty that they would behave as married people even though they were not married but such things were common and in wartime a good priest knew when to close his eyes kate listened to the latin that she did not understand and she looked past the priest at the altar where the gently shining silver cross was hung with a black diaphanous veil because easter had not yet come and she felt her heart beating and felt her lovers hand strongly entwined in hers and she wanted to cry with happiness her future seemed golden stretching sunlit and warm and flowerstrewn ahead of her it was not quite the wedding she had envisaged she had thought to sail back to england which she and her mother still considered home there to walk up the aisle of a country church filled with her rubicund relatives and be showered with rose petals and wheat grains and afterward go in a chaise and four to some beamed tavern for a dinner of beef beer and good red wine yet she could not have been happier or maybe she could have been happier if only her mother had been in the church but she consoled herself that they would be reconciled she was sure of that and suddenly christopher squeezed her hand so hard that it hurt say i do my dearest he ordered her kate blushed oh i do she said i truly do father josefa smiled at her the sun streamed through the churchs small high windows there were flowers in her hair and father josefa raised his hand to bless james and katherine with the sign of the cross and just then the church door creaked open to let in a wash of more sunlight and the stench of a manure heap just outside kate turned to see soldiers in the door the men were outlined against the light so she could not see them properly but she could see the guns on their shoulders and she supposed they were french and she gasped in fear but colonel christopher seemed quite unworried as he tilted her face to his and kissed her on the lips we are married my darling he said softly james she said my dear dear kate the colonel responded with a smile my dear dear wife then he turned as harsh steps sounded in the small nave they were slow steps heavy steps the nailed boots unfittingly loud on the ancient stones an officer was walking toward the altar he had left his men at the church door and came alone his long sword clinking inside its metal scabbard as he walked closer then he stopped and stared into kates pale face and kate shuddered because the officer was a scarred shabby greencoated soldier with a tanned face harder than iron and a gaze that could only be described as impudent are you kate savage he asked surprising her because he put the question in english and she had assumed the newcomer was french kate said nothing her husband was beside her and he would protect her from this horrid frightening and insolent man is that you sharpe colonel christopher demanded by god it is he was oddly nervous and his voice was too highpitched and he had a struggle to bring it under control what the devil are you doing here i ordered you south of the river damn you got cut off sir sharpe said not looking at christopher but still staring at kates face which was framed by the narcissi in her hair i got cut off by frogs sir a lot of frogs so i fought them off sir and came to look for miss savage who no longer exists the colonel said coldly but allow me to introduce you to my wife sharpe mrs james christopher and kate hearing her new name thought her heart would burst with happiness because she believed she was married the newly united colonel and mrs christopher rode back to the quinta in the dusty gig leaving luis and the soldiers to trail after them hagman still alive was now in a handcart though the jolting of the unsprung vehicle seemed to give him more pain than the old stretcher lieutenant vicente was also looking ill indeed he was so pale that sharpe feared the erstwhile lawyer had caught some disease in the last couple of days you should see the doctor when he comes to have another look at hagman sharpe said there was a doctor in the village who had already examined hagman pronounced him a dying man but promised he would come to the quinta that afternoon to look at the patient again you look as if youve got an upset belly sharpe said it is not an illness vicente said not something a doctor can cure then what is it it is miss katherine vicente said forlornly kate sharpe stared at vicente you know her vicente nodded every young man in porto knows kate savage when she was sent to school in england we pined for her and when she sailed back it was as if the sun had come out shes pretty enough sharpe allowed then looked again at vicente as the full force of the lawyers words registered oh bloody hell he said what vicente asked offended i dont need you to be in love sharpe said i am not in love vicente said still offended but it was obvious that he was besotted with kate christopher in the last two or three years he had gazed at her from afar and he had dreamed of her when he was writing his poetry and had been distracted by her memory when he was studying his philosophy and he had woven fantasies about her as he delved through the dusty law books she was the beatrice to his dante the unapproachable english girl from the big house on the hill and now she was married to colonel christopher and that sharpe thought explained the silly bitchs disappearance she had eloped but what sharpe still did not understand was why she would need to conceal such a love from her mother who would surely approve of her choice christopher so far as sharpe could tell was well born affluent properly educated and a gentleman all the things indeed that sharpe was not christopher was also very annoyed and when sharpe reached the quinta the colonel faced him from the front steps and again demanded an explanation for the riflemans presence in vila real de zedes i told you sharpe said we were cut off we couldnt cross the river sir christopher snapped then waited for sharpe to repeat the word but sharpe just stared past the colonel into the quintas hallway where he could see kate unpacking clothes from the big leather valise i gave you orders christopher said we couldnt cross the river sharpe said because there wasnt a bridge it broke so we went to the ferry but the damned frogs had burned it so now were going to amarante but we cant use the main roads because the frogs are swarming over them like lice and i cant go fast because ive got a wounded man and is there a room here where we can put him tonight christopher said nothing for a moment he was waiting for sharpe to call him sir but the rifleman stubbornly stayed silent christopher sighed and glanced across the valley to where a buzzard circled you expect to stay here tonight he asked distantly weve marched since three this morning sharpe said he was not sure they had left at three oclock because he had no watch but it sounded about right well rest now he said then march again before tomorrows dawn the french christopher said will be at amarante no doubt they will sharpe said but what else am i to do christopher flinched at sharpes surly tone then shuddered as hagman moaned theres a stable block behind the house he said coldly put your wounded man there and who the devil is that he had noticed vicentes prisoner lieutenant olivier sharpe turned to see where the colonel was looking a frog he answered whose throat im going to cut christopher stared in horror at sharpe a frog whose he began to repeat but just then kate came from the house to stand beside him he put an arm about her shoulder and with an irritable look at sharpe raised his voice to call to lieutenant olivier monsieur venez id sil vous plait hes a prisoner sharpe said hes an officer christopher asked as olivier threaded his way through sharpes sullen men hes a lieutenant sharpe said of the th dragoons christopher gave sharpe a rather startled look it is customary he said coldly to allow officers to give their parole where is the lieutenants sword i wasnt keeping him prisoner sharpe said lieutenant vicente was the lieutenants a lawyer you see and he seems to have the strange idea that the man should stand trial but i was just planning on hanging him kate gave a small cry of horror perhaps you should go inside my dear christopher suggested but she did not move and he did not insist why were you going to hang him he asked sharpe instead because hes a rapist sharpe said flatly and the word prompted kate to give another small cry and this time christopher bodily pushed her into the tiled hallway you will mind your language christopher said icily when my wife is present there was a lady present when this bastard raped her sharpe said we caught him with his breeches round his ankles and his equipment hanging out what was i supposed to do with him give him a brandy and offer him a game of whist he is an officer and a gentleman christopher said more concerned that olivier was from the th dragoons which meant he served with captain argenton where is his sword lieutenant vicente was introduced he carried oliviers sword and christopher insisted it be returned to the frenchman vicente tried to explain that olivier was accused of a crime and must be tried for it but colonel christopher speaking his impeccable portuguese dismissed the idea the conventions of war lieutenant he said do not allow for the trial of military officers as though they were civilians you should know that if as sharpe claims you are a lawyer to allow the civil trial of prisoners of war would open up the possibilities of reciprocity try this man and execute him and the french will do the same to every portuguese officer they take captive you understand that surely vicente saw the force of the argument but would not give in he is a rapist he insisted he is a prisoner of war christopher contradicted him and you will give him over to my custody vicente still tried to resist christopher after all was in civilian clothes he is a prisoner of my army vicente said stubbornly and i christopher said disdainfully am a lieutenant colonel in his britannic majestys army and that i think means that i outrank you lieutenant and you will obey my orders or else you will face the military consequences vicente outranked and overwhelmed stepped back and christopher with a small bow presented olivier with his sword perhaps you will do me the honor of waiting inside he suggested to the frenchman and when a much relieved olivier had gone into the quinta christopher strode to the edge of the front steps and stared over sharpes head to where a white cloud of dust was being generated on a track coming from the distant main road a large body of horsemen was approaching the village and christopher reckoned it had to be captain argenton and his escort a look of alarm crossed his face and his gaze flickered to sharpe then back to the approaching cavalry he dared not let the two meet sharpe he said you are under orders again if you say so sir sharpe sounded reluctant then you will stay here and guard my wife christopher said are those your horses he pointed to the dozen cavalry horses captured at barca davintas most of which were still saddled ill take two of them he ran into the entrance hall and beckoned to olivier monsieur you will accompany me and we go at once dearest one he took kates hand you will stay here till i return i shall not be long an hour at the most he bent to give her knuckles a kiss then hurried outside and hauled himself into the nearest saddle watched olivier mount then both men spurred down the track you will stay here sharpe christopher shouted as he left right here that is an order vicente watched christopher and the dragoon lieutenant ride away why has he taken the frenchman god knows sharpe said and while dodd and three other riflemen took hagman to the stable block he climbed to the top step and took out his superb telescope which he rested on a finely carved stone urn that decorated the small terrace he trained the glass on the approaching horsemen and saw they were french dragoons a hundred of them maybe more sharpe could see the green coats and the pink facings and the straight swords and the brown cloth covers on their polished helmets then he saw the horsemen curbing their mounts as christopher and olivier emerged from vila real de zedes sharpe gave the telescope to harper why would that greasy bugger be talking to the crapauds god knows sir harper said so watch em pat watch em sharpe said and if they come any closer let me know he walked into the quinta giving the huge front door a perfunctory knock lieutenant vicente was already in the entrance hall staring with doglike devotion at kate savage who was now evidently kate christopher sharpe took off his shako and ran a hand through his newly cut hair your husband has gone to talk to the french he said and saw the frown of disapproval on kates face and wondered if that was because christopher was talking to the french or because she was being addressed by sharpe why he asked you must ask him lieutenant she said my names sharpe i know your name kate said coldly richard to my friends it is good to know you possess some friends mister sharpe kate said she looked at him boldly and sharpe thought what a beauty she was she had the sort efface that painters immortalized in oils and it was no wonder that vicentes band of earnest poets and philosophers had worshipped her from afar so why is colonel christopher talking to the frogs maam kate blinked in surprise not because her husband was talking with the enemy but because for the first time she had been called maam i told you lieutenant she said with some asperity you must ask him sharpe walked around the hall he admired the curving marble stairway gazed up at a fine tapestry that showed huntresses pursuing a stag then looked at two busts in opposing niches the busts had evidently been imported by the late mister savage for one portrayed john milton and the other was labeled john bunyan i was sent to fetch you he said to kate still staring at bunyan to fetch me mister sharpe a captain hogan ordered me to find you he told her and take you back to your mother she was worried about you kate blushed my mother has no cause to worry i have a husband now now sharpe said you were married this morning thats what we saw in the church is it any of your business kate demanded fiercely vicente looked crestfallen because he believed sharpe was bullying the woman he so silently adored if youre married maam then its none of my business sharpe said because i cant take a married woman away from her husband can i no you cannot kate said and we were indeed married this morning my congratulations maam sharpe said then stopped to admire an old grandfather clock its face was decorated with smiling moons and bore the legend thomas tompion london he opened the polished case and pulled down the weights so that the mechanism began ticking i expect your mother will be delighted maam it is none of your business lieutenant kate said bridling pity she couldnt be here eh your mother was in tears when i left her he turned on her is he really a colonel the question took kate by surprise especially after the disconcerting news that her mother had been crying she blushed then tried to look dignified and offended of course hes a colonel she said indignantly and you are impudent mister sharpe sharpe laughed his face was grim in repose made so by the scar on his cheek but when he smiled or laughed the grimness went and kate to her astonishment felt her heart skip a beat she had been remembering the story christopher had told her of how the lady grace had destroyed her reputation by living with this man what had christopher said fishing in the dirty end of the lake but suddenly kate envied lady grace and then remembered she had been married less than an hour and was very properly ashamed of herself but all the same she thought this rogue was horribly attractive when he smiled and he was smiling at her now youre right sharpe said i am impudent always have been and probably always will be and i apologize for it maam he looked around the hall again this is your mothers house it is my house kate said since my father died and now i suppose it is my husbands property ive got a wounded man and your husband said he should be put in the stables i dont like putting wounded men into stables when there are better rooms kate blushed though sharpe was not sure why then she pointed toward a door at the back of the hall the servants have quarters by the kitchens she said and im sure there is a comfortable room there she stepped aside and gestured again at the door why dont you look i will maam sharpe said but instead of exploring the back parts of the house he just stared at her what is it kate asked unsettled by his dark gaze i was merely going to offer you felicitations maam for your marriage sharpe said thank you lieutenant kate said marry in haste sharpe said and paused and he saw the anger flare in her eyes and he smiled at her again is something folks often do in wartime he finished ill go round the outside of the house maam he left her to vicentes admiration and joined harper on the terrace is the bastard still talking he asked the colonels still talking to the crapauds sir harper said gazing through the telescope and theyre not coming any closer the colonels full of surprises isnt he stuffed as full of them sharpe said as a plum pudding so what do we do sir we move dan into a servants room by the kitchen let the doctor see him if the doctor thinks he can travel then well go to amarante do we take the girl not if shes married pat we cant do a bloody thing with her if shes married she belongs to him now lock stock and barrel sharpe scratched under his collar where a louse had bitten pretty girl is she now i hadnt noticed you lying irish bastard sharpe said harper grinned aye well shes smooth on the eye sir smooth as they come but shes also a married woman off bounds eh a colonels wife i wouldnt dream of it harper said not if i were you im not dreaming patrick sharpe said just wondering how to get the hell out of here how do we go back home back to the army harper asked or back to england god knows which would you want they should have been in england they all belonged to the second battalion of the th rifles and that battalion was in the shorncliffe barracks but sharpe and his men had been separated from the rest of the greenjackets during the scrambling retreat to vigo and somehow they had never managed to rejoin captain hogan had seen to that hogan needed men to protect him while he mapped the wild frontier country between spain and portugal and a squad of prime riflemen were heavensent and he had cleverly managed to confuse the paperwork reroute letters scratch pay from the military chest and so keep sharpe and his men close to the war england holds nothing for me harper said im happier here and the men most like it here the irishman said but a few want to go home cresacre sims the usual grumblers john williamson is the worst he keeps telling the others that youre only here because you want promotion and that youll sacrifice us all to get it he says that and worse sounds a good idea sharpe said lightly but i dont think anyone believes him other than the usual bastards most of us know were here by accident harper stared at the distant french dragoons then shook his head ill have to give williamson a thumping sooner or later you or me sharpe agreed harper put the telescope to his eye again the bastards coming back he said and hes left that other bastard with them he handed sharpe the telescope olivier hes bloody given him back harper was indignant through the telescope sharpe could see christopher riding back toward vila real de zedes accompanied by a single man a civilian judging by his clothes and certainly not lieutenant olivier who was evidently riding northwards with the dragoons those crapauds must have seen us sharpe said clear as daylight harper agreed and lieutenant olivier will have told them were here sharpe said so why the devil are they leaving us alone because your mans made an agreement with the bastards harper said nodding toward the distant christopher sharpe wondered why an english officer would be making agreements with the enemy we should give him a smacking he said not if hes a colonel then we should give the bastard two smackings sharpe said savagely then wed find the bloody truth quickly enough the two men fell silent as christopher cantered up the drive to the house the man accompanying him was young redhaired and in plain civilian clothes yet the horse he rode had a french mark on its rump and the saddle was military issue christopher looked at the telescope in sharpes hand you must be curious sharpe he said with unusual geniality im curious sharpe said why our prisoner was given back because i decided to give him back of course christopher said sliding down from the horse and hes promised not to fight us until the french return a british prisoner of equal rank all quite normal sharpe and no occasion for indignation this is monsieur argenton who will be going with me to visit general cradock in lisbon the frenchman hearing his name spoken gave sharpe a nervous nod well come with you sharpe said ignoring the frenchman christopher shook his head i think not sharpe monsieur argenton will arrange for the two of us to use the pontoon bridge at oporto if its been repaired and if not hell arrange passage on a ferry and i hardly think our french friends will allow a half company of riflemen to cross the river under their noses do you if you talk to them maybe sharpe said you seem friendly enough with them christopher threw his reins to luis then gestured that argenton should dismount and follow him into the house there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy christopher said going past sharpe then he turned i have different plans for you you have plans for me sharpe asked truculently i believe a lieutenant colonel outranks a lieutenant in his britannic majestys army sharpe christopher said sarcastically it always was so which means does it not that you are under my command so you will come to the house in half an hour and i shall give you your new orders come monsieur he beckoned to argenton glanced coldly at sharpe and went up the steps it rained next morning it was colder too gray veils of showers swept out of the west brought from the atlantic by a chill wind that blew the wisteria blossoms from the thrashing trees banged the quintas shutters and sent chill drafts chasing through its rooms sharpe vicente and their men had slept in the stable block guarded by picquets who shivered in the night and peered through the damp blackness sharpe doing the rounds in the darkest heart of the night saw one window of the quinta glowing with the glimmer of shuddering candlelight behind the windshaken shutters and he thought he heard a cry like an animal in distress from that upper floor and for a fleeting second he was sure it was kates voice then he told himself it was his imagination or that it was just the wind shrieking in the chimneys he went to see hagman at dawn and found the old poacher was sweating but alive he was asleep and once or twice spoke a name aloud amy he said amy the doctor had visited the previous afternoon he had sniffed the wound shrugged said hagman would die washed the injury bandaged it and refused to take any fee keep the bandages wet he had told vicente who was translating for sharpe and dig a grave the portuguese lieutenant did not translate the last four words sharpe was summoned to colonel christopher soon after sunrise and found the colonel seated in the parlor and swathed in hot towels as luis shaved him he used to be a barber the colonel said werent you a barber luis a good one luis said you look as if you could do with a barber sharpe christopher said cut your own hair do you no sir looks like it looks like the rats got to it the razor made a slight scratching noise as it glided down his chin luis wiped the blade with a flannel scraped again my wife christopher said will have to stay here i aint happy no sir but she aint safe anywhere else is she she cant go to oporto its full of frenchmen who are raping anything that isnt dead and probably things that are dead if theyre still fresh and they wont get the place under decent control for another day or two so she must stay here and ill feel a great deal more comfortable sharpe if shes protected so you will guard my wife let your wounded fellow recover have a rest contemplate gods ineffable ways and in a week or so ill be back and you can go sharpe looked out of the window where a gardener was scything the lawn probably the first cut of the year the scythe slid through the pale blossoms blown from the wisteria mrs christopher could accompany you south sir he suggested no she bloody well cant christopher snapped i told her its too dangerous captain argenton and i have to get through the lines sharpe and we wont make things easier for ourselves by taking a woman with us the true reason of course was that he did not want kate to meet her mother and tell her of the marriage in vila real de zedess small church so kate will stay here christopher went on and you will treat her with respect sharpe said nothing just looked at the colonel who had the grace to shift uncomfortably of course you will christopher said ill have a word with the village priest on our way out and make sure his people deliver food for you bread beans and a bullock should do your fellows for a week eh and for gods sake dont make yourselves obvious i dont want the french sacking this house theres some damn fine pipes of port in the cellars and i dont want your rogues helping themselves they wont sir sharpe said last night when christopher had first told him that he and his men must stay at the quinta the colonel had produced a letter from general cradock the letter had been carried around for so long that it was fragile especially along the creases and its ink was faded but it clearly stated in english and portuguese that lieutenantcolonel james christopher was employed on work of great importance and enjoined every british and portuguese officer to attend to the colonels orders and offer him whatever help he might require the letter which sharpe had no reason to believe was counterfeit made it clear that christopher was in a position to give sharpe orders and so he now sounded more respectful than he had the previous evening they wont touch the port sir he said good good thats all sharpe youre dismissed youre going south sir sharpe asked instead of leaving i told you were going to see general cradock then perhaps youd take a letter to captain hogan for me sir write it quick sharpe write it quick i have to be off sharpe wrote it quick he disliked writing for he had never learned his letters properly not school proper and he knew his expressions were as clumsy as his penmanship but he wrote to tell hogan that he was stranded north of the river that he was ordered to stay at the quinta do zedes and that just as soon as he was released from those orders he would return to duty he guessed that christopher would read the letter and so he had made no mention of the colonel nor offered any criticism of his orders he gave the letter to christopher who dressed in civilian clothes and accompanied by the frenchman who was also out of uniform left in midmorning luis rode with them kate had also written a letter this one to her mother she had been pale and tearful in the morning which sharpe put down to her imminent parting from her new husband but in truth kate was upset that christopher would not let her accompany him an idea the colonel had brusquely refused to consider where we are going he had insisted is exceedingly dangerous going through the lines my dear one is perilous in the extreme and i cannot expose you to such risk he had seen kates unhappiness and taken both her hands in his do you believe that i wish to part from you so soon do you not understand that only matters of duty of the very highest duty would tear me from your side you must trust me kate i think trust is very important in marriage dont you and kate trying not to cry had agreed that it was you will be safe christopher had told her sharpes men will guard you i know he looks uncouth but hes an english officer and that means hes almost a gentleman and youve got plenty of servants to chaperone you he frowned does having sharpe here worry you no kate said ill just stay out of his way ive no doubt hell be glad of that lady grace might have tamed him a little but hes plainly uncomfortable around civilized folk im sure youll be quite safe till i return i can leave you a pistol if youre worried no kate said for she knew there was a pistol in her fathers old gun room and anyway she did not think she would need it to deter sharpe how long will you be away she asked a week at most ten days one cannot be precise about such things but be assured my dearest that i shall hurry back to you with the utmost dispatch she gave him the letter for her mother the letter written by candlelight just before dawn told mrs savage that her daughter loved her that she was sorry she had deceived her but nevertheless she was married to a wonderful man a man mrs savage would surely come to love as though he were her own son and kate promised she would be back at her mothers side just as soon as she possibly could in the meantime she commended herself her husband and her mother to gods tender care colonel james christopher read his wifes letter as he rode toward oporto then he read sharpes letter something important captain argenton asked him trivialities my dear captain mere trivialities christopher said and read sharpes letter a second time good god he said but they allow utter illiterates to carry the kings commission these days and with those words he tore both letters into tiny shreds that he let fly upon the cold rainladen wind so that for a moment the white scraps looked like snow behind his horse i assume he asked argenton that we shall need a permit to cross the river i shall get one from headquarters argenton said good christopher said good because in his saddlebag unknown to captain argenton was a third letter one that christopher had written himself in polished perfect french and it was addressed care of marshal soults headquarters to brigadier henri vuillard the man who was most feared by argenton and his fellow plotters christopher smiled remembered the joys of the night and anticipated the greater joys to come he was a happy man chapter spider webs hagman whispered and moss thatll do it sir spider webs and moss sharpe asked a poultice sir of spider webs moss and a little vinegar back it with brown paper and bind it on tight the doctor says you should just keep the bandage damp dan nothing else we knows better than a doctor sir hagmans voice was scarcely audible my mother always swore by vinegar moss and webs he fell silent except that every breath was a wheeze and brown paper he said after a long while and my father sir when he was shot by a gatekeeper at dunham on the hill he was brought back by vinegar moss and spider silk she was a wonderful woman my mother sharpe sitting beside the bed wondered if he would be different if he had known his mother if he had been raised by a mother he thought of lady grace dead these three years and how she had once told him he was full of rage and he wondered if that was what mothers did took the rage away and then his mind sheered away from grace as it always did it was just too painful to remember and he forced a smile you were talking about amy in your sleep dan is she your wife amy hagman blinked in surprise amy i havent thought of amy in years she was the rectors daughter sir the rectors daughter and she did things no rectors daughter ought to have even known about he chuckled and it must have hurt him for the smile vanished and he groaned but sharpe reckoned hagman had a chance now for the first two days he had been feverish but the sweat had broken how long are we staying here sir long as we need to dan but the truth is i dont know the colonel gave me orders so well just stay till he gives us more sharpe had been reassured by the letter from general cradock and even more by the news that christopher was going to meet the general plainly the colonel was up to his neck in strange work but sharpe now wondered whether he had misconstrued captain hogans words about keeping a close eye on christopher perhaps hogan had meant that he wanted christopher protected because his work was so important whatever sharpe had his orders now and he was satisfied that the colonel had the authority to issue them yet even so he felt guilty that he and his men were resting in the quinta do zedes while a war went on somewhere to the south and another to the east at least he assumed there was fighting for he had no real news in the next few days a peddler came to the quinta with a stock of bone buttons steel pins and stamped tin medallions showing the virgin mary and he said the portuguese still held the bridge at amarante where they were opposed by a big french army he also claimed the french had gone south toward lisbon then reported a rumor which said marshal soult was still in oporto a friar who called at the quinta to beg for food brought the same news which is good sharpe told harper whys that sir because soult isnt going to linger in oporto if theres a chance of lisbon falling is he no if soult is in oporto then thats as far as the frogs have got but they are south of the river a few bloody cavalrymen maybe sharpe said dismissively but it was frustrating not to know what was happening and sharpe to his surprise found himself wanting colonel christopher to return so he could learn how the war progressed kate doubtless wanted her husband to return even more than sharpe did for the first few days after the colonels departure she had avoided sharpe but increasingly they began to meet in the room where daniel hagman lay kate brought the injured man food and then would sit and talk with him and once she had convinced herself that sharpe was not the scurrilous rogue she had supposed him to be she invited him into the front of the house where she made tea in a pot decorated with embossed china roses lieutenant vicente was sometimes invited but he said almost nothing just sat on the edge of a chair and gazed at kate in sad adoration if she spoke to him he blushed and stammered and kate would look away seemingly equally embarrassed yet she seemed to like the portuguese lieutenant sharpe sensed she was a lonely woman and always had been one evening when vicente was supervising the picquets she spoke of growing up as a single child in oporto and of being sent back to england for her education there were three of us girls in a parsons house she told him it was a cold evening and she sat close to a fire that had been lit in the tileedged hearth of the quintas parlor his wife made us cook clean and sew kate went on and the clergyman taught us scripture knowledge some french a little mathematics and shakespeare more than i ever learned sharpe said you are not the daughter of a wealthy port merchant kate said with a smile behind her in the shadows the cook knitted kate when she was with sharpe or vicente always had one of the women servants to chaperone her presumably so that her husband would have no grounds for suspicion my father was determined to make me accomplished kate went on looking wistful he was a strange man my father he made wine but wouldnt drink it he said god didnt approve the cellar here is full of good wine and he added to it every year and he never opened a bottle for himself she shivered and leaned toward the fire i remember it was always cold in england i hated it but my parents didnt want me schooled in portugal why not they feared i might be infected with papism she said fidgeting with the tassels on the edge of her shawl my father was very opposed to papism she continued earnestly which is why in his will he insisted i must marry a communicant of the church of england or else or else i would lose my inheritance she said its safe now sharpe said yes she said looking up at him the light from the small fire catching in her eyes yes it is is it an inheritance worth keeping sharpe asked suspecting the question was indelicate but driven to it by curiosity this house the vineyards kate said apparently unoffended the lodge where the port is made its all held in trust for me at the moment though my mother enjoys the income of course why didnt she go back to england shes lived here for over twenty years kate said so her friends are here now but after this week she shrugged maybe she will go back to england she always said shed go home to find a second husband she smiled at the thought she couldnt marry here sharpe asked remembering the goodlooking woman climbing into the carriage outside the house beautiful they are all papists here mister sharpe kate said in mock reproof though i suspect she did find someone not so long ago she began to take more trouble with herself her clothes her hair but maybe i imagined it she was silent for a moment the cooks needles clicked and a log collapsed with a shower of sparks one spat over the wire fireguard and smoldered on a rug until sharpe leaned forward and pinched it out the tompion clock in the hall struck nine my father kate went on believed that the women in his family were prone to wander from the straight and narrow path which is why he always wanted a son to take over the lodge it didnt happen so he tied our hands in the will you had to marry a protestant englishman a confirmed anglican anyway kate said who was willing to change his name to savage so its colonel savage now is it he will be kate said he said he would sign a paper before a notary in oporto and then well send it to the trustees in london i dont know how we send letters home now but james will find a way hes very resourceful he is sharpe said dryly but does he want to stay in portugal and make port oh yes kate said and you of course i love portugal and i know james wants to stay he declared as much not long after he arrived at our house in oporto she said that christopher had come to the house beautiful in the new year and he had lodged there for a while though he spent most of his time riding in the north she did not know what he did there it wasnt my business she told sharpe and whats he doing in the south now thats not your business either not unless he tells me she said defensively then frowned at him you dont like him do you sharpe was embarrassed not knowing what to say hes got good teeth he said that grudging statement made kate look pained did i hear the clock strike she asked sharpe took the hint time to check the sentries he said and he went to the door glancing back at kate and noticing not for the first time how delicate her looks were and how her pale skin seemed to glow in the firelight and then he tried to forget her as he started on his tour of the picquets sharpe was working the riflemen hard patrolling the quintas lands drilling on its driveway working them long hours so that the little energy they had left was spent in grumbling but sharpe knew how precarious their situation was christopher had airily ordered him to stay and guard kate but the quinta could never have been defended against even a small french force it was high on a wooded spur but the hill rose behind it even higher and there were thick woods on the higher ground vhich could have soaked up a corps of infantry who would then have een able to attack the manor house from the higher ground with the idded advantage of the trees to give them cover but higher still the trees nded and the hill rose to a rocky summit where an old watchtower crumjled in the winds and from there sharpe spent hours watching the counryside he saw french troops every day there was a valley north of vila real de zedes that carried a road leading east toward amarante and enemy irtillery infantry and supply wagons traveled the road each day and to keep them safe large squadrons of dragoons patrolled the valley some days there were outbreaks of firing distant faint half heard and sharpe guessed that the country people were ambushing the invaders and he would stare through his telescope trying to see where the actions took place but he never saw the ambushes and none of the partisans came near sharpe and nor did the french though he was certain they must have known that a stranded squad of british riflemen were at vila real de zedes once he even saw some dragoons trot to within a mile of the quinta and two of their officers stared at the elegant house through telescopes yet they made no move against it had christopher arranged that nine days after christopher had left the headman of the village brought vicente a newspaper from oporto it was an illprinted sheet and vicente was puzzled by it ive never heard of the diario do porto he told sharpe and it is nonsense nonsense it says soult should declare himself king of northern lusitania it says there are many portuguese people who support the idea who why would they we have a king already the french must be paying the newspaper sharpe guessed though what else the french were doing was a mystery for they left him alone the doctor who came to see hagman thought marshal soult was gathering his forces in readiness to strike south and did not want to fritter men away in bitter little skirmishes across the northern mountains once he possesses all portugal the doctor said then he will scour you away he wrinkled his nose as he lifted the stinking compress from hagmans chest then he shook his head in amazement for the wound was clean hagmans breathing was easier he could sit up in bed now and was eating better vicente left the next day the doctor had brought news of general silveiras army in amarante and how it was valiantly defending the bridge across the tamega and vicente decided his duty lay in helping that defense but after three days he returned because there were too many dragoons patrolling the countryside between vila real de zedes and amarante the failure made him dejected i am wasting my time he told sharpe how good are your men sharpe asked the question puzzled vicente good as good as any i suppose are they sharpe asked and that afternoon he paraded every man rifleman and portuguese alike and made them all fire three rounds in a minute from the portuguese muskets he did it in front of the house and timed the shots with the big grandfather clock sharpe had no difficulty in firing the three shots he had been doing this for half his life and the portuguese musket was british made and familiar to sharpe he bit open the cartridge tasted the salt in the powder charged the barrel rammed down wadding and ball primed the pan cocked pulled the trigger and felt the kick of the gun into his shoulder and then he dropped the butt and bit into the next cartridge and most of his riflemen were grinning because they knew he was good sergeant macedo was the only man other than sharpe who fired his three shots within fortyfive seconds fifteen of the riflemen and twelve of the portuguese managed a shot every twenty seconds but the rest were slow and so sharpe and vicente set about training them williamson one of the riflemen who had failed grumbled that it was stupid to make him learn how to fire a smoothbore musket when he was a rifleman he made the complaint just loud enough for sharpe to hear and in the expectation that sharpe would choose to ignore it then looked aggrieved when sharpe dragged him back out of the formation youve got a complaint sharpe challenged him no sir williamson his big face surly looked past sharpe look at me sharpe said williamson sullenly obeyed the reason you are learning to fire a musket like a proper soldier sharpe told him is because i dont want the portuguese to think were picking on them williamson still looked sullen and besides sharpe went on were stranded miles behind enemy lines so what happens if your rifle breaks and theres another reason besides whats that sir williamson asked if you dont bloody do it sharpe said ill have you on another charge then another charge and another after that until youre so damn fed up with punishment duty that youll have to shoot me to be rid of it williamson stared at sharpe with an expression which suggested he would like nothing more than to shoot him but sharpe just stared into his eyes and williamson looked away well run out of ammunition he said churlishly and in that he was probably right but kate savage unlocked her fathers gun room and found a barrel of powder and a bullet mold so sharpe was able to have his men make up new cartridges using pages from the sermon books in the quintas library to wrap the powder and shot the balls were too small but they were fine for practice and for three days his men blasted their muskets and rifles across the driveway the french must have heard the musketry echoing dully from the hills and they must have seen the powder smoke above vila real de zedes but they did not come nor did colonel christopher but the french are going to come sharpe told harper one afternoon as they climbed the hill behind the quinta like as not the big man said i mean its not as if they dont know were here and theyll slice us into pieces when they do arrive sharpe said harper shrugged at that pessimistic opinion then frowned how far are we going the top sharpe said he had led harper through the trees and now they were on the rocky slope that led to the old watchtower on the hills summit have you never been up here sharpe asked i grew up in donegal harper said and there was one thing we learned there which was never go to the top of the hills why ever not because anything valuable will have long rolled down sir and all youll be doing is getting yourself out of breath by climbing up to find it gone jesus christ but you can see halfway to heaven from up here the track followed a rocky spine that led to the summit and on either side the slope steepened until only a goat could have found footing on the treacherous scree yet the path itself was safe enough winding up toward the watchtowers ancient stump were going to make a fort up here sharpe said enthusiastically god save us harper said were getting lazy pat soft idle it aint good but why make a fort harper asked its a fortress already the devil himself couldnt take this hill not if it was defended there are two ways up here sharpe said ignoring the question this path and another on the south side i want walls across each path stone walls pat high enough so a man can stand behind them and fire over their tops theres plenty of stone up here sharpe led harper through the towers broken archway and showed him how the old building had been raised about a natural pit in the hills summit and how the crumbling tower had filled the pit with stones harper peered down into the pit you want us to move all that masonry and build new walls he sounded appalled i was talking to kate savage about this place sharpe said this old tower was built hundreds of years ago pat when the moors were here they were killing christians then and the king built the watchtower so they could see when a moorish raiding party was coming its a sensible thing to do harper said and kate was saying how the folk in the valleys would send their valuables up here coins jewels gold all of it up here pat so that the heathen bastards wouldnt snatch it and then there was an earthquake nd the tower fell in and the locals reckon theres treasure under those tones harper looked skeptical and why wouldnt they dig it up sir the folk in the village dont strike me as halfwits i mean jesus mary and joseph if i knew there was a pit of bloody gold up on a hill i wouldnt be vasting my time with a plough or a harrow thats just it sharpe said he was making up the story as he went ilong and thought desperately for an answer to harpers entirely reasonable objection there was a child you see buried with the gold and the egend says the child will haunt the house of whoever digs up its bones but only a local house he added hastily harper sniffed at that embellishment then looked back down the path so you want a fort here and we need to bring barrels of water here sharpe said that was the summits weakness no water if the french came and he had to retreat to the hilltop then he did not want to surrender just because of thirst miss savagehe still did not think of her as mrs christopherwill find us barrels up here in the sun water will go rancid harper warned him a splash of brandy in each one sharpe said remembering his voyages to and from india and how the water had always tasted faintly of rum ill find the brandy and you really expect me to believe theres gold under those stones sir no sharpe admitted but i want the men to half believe it its going to be hard work building walls up here pat and dreams of treasure never hurt so they built the fort and never found gold but in the spring sunlight they made the hilltop into a redoubt where a handful of infantry could grow old under siege the ancient builders had chosen well not just selecting the highest peak for miles around to build their watchtower but also a place that was easily defended attackers could only come from the north or the south and in both cases they would have to pick their way along narrow paths sharpe exploring the southern path one day found a rusted arrowhead under a boulder and he took it back to the summit and showed it to kate she held it beneath the brim of her wide straw hat and turned it this way and that it probably isnt very old she said i was thinking it might have wounded a moor they were still hunting with bows and arrows in my grandfathers time she said your family was here then savages started in portugal in she said proudly she had been gazing southwest in the direction of oporto and sharpe knew she was watching the road in hope of seeing a horseman come but the passing days brought no sign of her husband nor even a letter the french did not come either though sharpe knew they must have seen his men toiling on the summit as they piled rocks to make ramparts across the two paths and struggled up those tracks with barrels of water that were put into the great cleared pit on the peak the men grumbled about being made to work like mules but sharpe knew they were happier tired than idle some encouraged by williamson complained that they wasted their time that they should have abandoned this godforsaken hill with its broken tower and found a way south to the army and sharpe reckoned they were probably right but he had his orders and so he stayed what it is williamson told his cronies is the bloody frow were humping stone and hes tickling the colonels wife and if sharpe had heard that opinion he might even have agreed with it too even though he was not tickling kate but he was enjoying her company and had persuaded himself that orders or no orders he ought to protect her against the french but the french did not come and nor did colonel christopher manuel lopes came instead he arrived on a black horse galloping up the driveway and then curbing the stallion so fast that it reared and twisted and lopes instead of being thrown off as ninetynine out of a hundred other riders would have been stayed calm and in control he soothed the horse and grinned at sharpe you are the englishman he said in english and i hate the english but not so much as i hate the spanish and i hate the spanish less than i hate the french he slid down from the saddle and held out a hand i am manuel lopes sharpe sharpe said lopes looked at the quinta with the eye of a man sizing it up for plunder he was an inch less than sharpes six feet but seemed taller he was a big man not fat just big witha strong face and quick eyes and a swift smile if i was a spaniard he said and i nightly thank the good lord that i am not then i would call myself something dramatic the slaughterman perhaps or the pig sticker or the prince of deathhe was talking of the partisan leaders who made french life so miserablebut i am a humble citizen of portugal so my nickname is the schoolteacher the schoolteacher sharpe repeated because that is what i was lopes responded energetically i owned a school in braganga where i taught ungrateful little bastards english latin greek algebra rhetoric and horsemanship i also taught them to love god honor the king and fart in the face of all spaniards now instead of wasting my breath on halfwits i kill frenchmen he offered sharpe an extravagant bow i am famous for it ive not heard of you sharpe said lopes just smiled at the challenge the french have heard of me senhor he said and i have heard about you who is this englishman who lives safe north of the douro why do the french leave him in peace who is the portuguese officer who lives in his shadow why are they here why are they making a toy fort on the watchtower hill why are they not fighting good questions sharpe said dryly all of them lopes looked at the quinta again everywhere else in portugal senhor where the french have left their dung they have destroyed places like this they have stolen the paintings broken the furniture and drunk the cellars dry yet the war does not come to this house he turned to stare down the driveway where some twenty or thirty men had appeared my pupils he explained they need rest the pupils were his men a ragged band with which lopes had been ambushing the french columns that carried ammunition to the gunners who fought against the portuguese troops still holding the bridge at amarante the schoolteacher had lost a good few men in the fights and admitted that his early successes had made him too confident until just two days before french dragoons had caught his men in open ground i hate those green bastards lopes growled hate them and their big swords nearly half his men had been killed and the rest had been lucky to escape so i brought them here lopes said to recover and because the quinta do zedes seems like a safe haven kate bridled when she heard lopes wanted his men to stay at the house tell him to take them to the village she said to sharpe and sharpe carried her suggestion to the schoolteacher lopes laughed when he heard the message her father was a pompous bastard too he said you knew him i knew of him he made port but wouldnt drink it because of his stupid beliefs and he wouldnt take off his hat when the sacrament was carried past what kind of a man is that even a spaniard takes off his hat for the blessed sacraments lopes shrugged my men will be happy in the village he drew on a filthysmelling cigar well only stay long enough to heal the worst wounds then we go back to the fight us too sharpe said you the schoolteacher was amused yet you dont fight now colonel christopher ordered us to stay here colonel christopher this is his wifes house sharpe said i did not know he was married lopes responded you know him he came to see me in braganga i still owned the school then and i had a reputation as a man of influence so the colonel comes calling he wanted to know if sentiment in braganca was in favor of fighting the french and i told him that sentiment in braganga was in favor of drowning the french in their own piss but if that was not possible then we would fight them instead so we do lopes paused i also heard that the colonel had money for anyone willing to fight against them but we never saw any he turned and looked at the house and his wife owns the quinta and the french dont touch the place colonel christopher sharpe said talks to the french and right now hes south of the douro where hes taken a frenchman to speak with the british general lopes stared at sharpe for a few heartbeats why would a french officer be talking to the british he asked and waited for sharpe to answer then did so himself when the rifleman was silent for one reason only lopes suggested to make peace britain is going to run away leave us to suffer i dont know sharpe said well beat them with you or without you lopes said angrily and stalked down the drive shouting at his men to bring his horse pick up their baggage and follow him to the village the meeting with lopes only made sharpe feel more guilty other men were fighting while he did nothing and that night after supper he asked to speak with kate it was late and kate had sent the servants back to the kitchen and sharpe waited for her to call one back to act as her chaperone but instead she led him into the long parlor it was dark for no candles were lit so kate went to one of the windows and pulled back its curtains to reveal a pale moonlit night the wisteria seemed to glow in the silver light the boots of a sentry crunched on the driveway i know what youre going to say kate said that its time for you to go yes sharpe said and i think you should come with us i must wait for james kate said she went to a sideboard and by the light of the moon poured a glass of port for you she said how long did the colonel say he would be sharpe asked a week maybe ten days its been more than two weeks sharpe said very nearly three he ordered you to wait here kate said not through eternity sharpe replied he went to the sideboard and took the port which was savages finest you cant leave me here kate said i dont intend to sharpe said the moon made a shadow of her cheek and glinted from her eyes and he felt a pang of jealousy for colonel christopher i think you should come no kate said with a note of petulance then turned a pleading face to sharpe you cant leave me here alone im a soldier sharpe said and ive waited long enough theres supposed to be a war in this country and im just sitting here like a lump kate had tears in her eyes whats happened to him maybe he got new orders in lisbon sharpe suggested then why doesnt he write because were in enemy country now maam sharpe said brutally and maybe he cant get a message to us that was very unlikely sharpe thought because christopher seemed to have plenty of friends among the french perhaps the colonel had been arrested in lisbon or killed by partisans hes probably waiting for you to come south he said instead of voicing those thoughts he would send a message kate protested im sure hes on his way are you sharpe asked she sat on a gilt chair staring out of the window he must come back she said softly and sharpe could tell from her tone that she had virtually given up hope if you think hes coming back he said then you must wait for him but im taking my men south he would leave the next night he decided march in the dark go south find the river and search its bank for a boat any boat even a tree trunk would do anything that could float them across the douro do you know why i married him kate suddenly asked sharpe was so astounded by the question that he did not answer he just gazed at her i married him kate said because life in oporto is so dull my mother and i live in the big house on the hill and the lawyers tell us what happens in the vineyards and the lodge and the other ladies come to tea and we go to the english church on sundays and that is all that ever happens sharpe still said nothing he was embarrassed you think he married me for the money dont you kate demanded dont you sharpe responded she stared at him in silence and he half expected her to be angry but instead she shook her head and sighed i dare not believe that she said though i do believe marriage is a gamble and we dont know how it will turn out but we still just hope we marry in hope mister sharpe and sometimes were lucky dont you think thats true ive never married sharpe evaded the answer have you wanted to kate asked yes sharpe said thinking of grace what happened she was a widow sharpe said and the lawyers were making hay with her husbands will and we thought that if she married me it would only complicate things her lawyers said so i hate lawyers he stopped talking hurt as he always was by the memory he drank the port to cover his feelings then walked to the window and stared down the moonlit drive to where the smoke of the village fires smeared the stars above the northern hills in the end she died he finished abruptly im sorry kate said in a small voice and i hope it turns out well for you sharpe said do you of course he said then he turned to her and he was so close that she had to tilt her head back to see him what i really hope he said is this and he bent and kissed her very tenderly on the lips and for a halfsecond she stiffened and then she let him kiss her and when he straightened she lowered her head and he knew she was crying i hope youre lucky he said to her kate did not look up i must lock the house she said and sharpe knew he was dismissed he gave his men the next day to get ready there were boots to be repaired and packs and haversacks to be filled with food for the march sharpe made sure every rifle was clean that the flints were new and that the cartridge boxes were filled harper shot two of the captured dragoon horses and butchered them down into cuts of meat that could be carried then he put hagman on another of the horses to make certain he would be able to ride it without too much pain and sharpe told kate she must ride another and she protested saying she could not travel without a chaperone and sharpe told her she could make up her own mind stay or leave maam but were going tonight you cant leave me kate said angry as if sharpe had not kissed her and she had not allowed the kiss im a soldier maam sharpe said and im going and then he did not go because that evening at dusk colonel christopher returned the colonel was mounted on his black horse and dressed all in black dodd and pendleton were the picquets on the quintas driveway and when they saluted him christopher just touched the ivory heel of his riding crop to one of the tasseled peaks of his bicorne hat luis the servant followed and the dust from their horses hooves drifted across the rills of fallen wisteria blossoms that lined either side of the driveway it looks like lavender dont it christopher remarked to sharpe they should try growing lavender here he went on as he slid from the horse it would do well dont you think he did not wait for an answer but instead ran up the quintas steps and held his hands wide for kate my sweetest one sharpe left on the terrace found himself staring at luis the servant raised an eyebrow as if in exasperation then led the horses round to the back of the house sharpe stared across the darkening fields now that the sun was gone there was a bite in the air a tendril of winter lingering into spring sharpe the colonels voice called from inside the house sharpe sir sharpe pushed through the halfopen door christopher stood in front of the hall fire the tails of his coat lifted to the heat kate tells me you behaved yourself thank you for that he saw the thunder on sharpes face it is a jest man a jest have you no sense of humor kate dearest a glass of decent port would be more than welcome im parched fair parched so sharpe no french activity they came close sharpe said curtly but not close enough not close enough youre fortunate in that i should think kate tells me you are leaving tonight sir no youre not christopher took the glass of port from kate and downed it in one that is delicious he said staring at the empty glass one of ours our best kate said not too sweet thats the trick of a fine port wouldnt you agree sharpe and i must say ive been surprised by the white port more than drinkable i always thought the stuff was execrable a womans tipple at best but savages white is really very good we must make more of it in the piping days of peace dont you think dearest if you say so kate said smiling at her husband that was rather good sharpe dont you think pipes of port piping days of peace a piping pun id say christopher waited for sharpes comment and when none came he scowled youll stay here lieutenant whys that sir sharpe asked the question surprised christopher he had been expecting a more surly response and was not ready for a mildly voiced query he frowned thinking how to phrase his answer i am expecting developments sharpe he said after a few heartbeats developments sir it is by no means certain christopher went on that the war will be prolonged we could indeed be on the very cusp of peace thats good sir sharpe said in an even voice and thats why were to stay here youre to stay here sharpe there was asperity in christophers voice now as he realized sharpes neutral tone had been impudence and that applies to you too lieutenant he spoke to vicente who had come into the room with a small bow to kate things are poised the colonel went on precariously if the french find british troops wandering around north of the douro theyll think we are breaking our word my troops are not british vicente observed quietly the principle is the same christopher snapped we do not rock the boat we do not jeopardize weeks of negotiation if the thing can be resolved without more bloodshed then we must do all that we can to ensure that it is so resolved and your contribution to that process is to stay here and who the devil are those rogues down in the village rogues sharpe asked a score of men armed to the teeth staring at me as i rode through so who the devil are they partisans sharpe said otherwise known as our allies christopher did not like that jibe idiots more like he snarled ready to upset the apple cart and theyre led by a man you know sharpe went on manuel lopes lopes lopes christopher frowned trying to remember oh yes the fellow who ran a flogging school for the few sons of the gentry in braganga blustery sort of fellow eh well ill have a word with him in the morning tell him not to upset matters and the same goes for you two and thathe looked from sharpe to vicenteis an order sharpe did not argue did you bring an answer from captain hogan he asked instead i didnt see hogan left your letter at cradocks headquarters and general wellesleys not here sharpe asked he is not christopher said but general cradock is and he commands and he concurs with my decision that you stay here the colonel saw the frown on sharpes face and opened a pouch at his belt from which he took a piece of paper that he handed to sharpe there lieutenant he said silkily in case youre worried sharpe unfolded the paper which proved to be an order signed by general cradock and addressed to lieutenant sharpe that placed him under colonel christophers command christopher had gulled the order from cradock who had believed the colonels assurance that he needed protection though in truth it simply amused christopher to have sharpe put under his command the order ended with the words pro tern which puzzled sharpe pro tem sir he asked you never learned latin sharpe no sir good god where did you go to school it means for the time being until indeed i am through with you but you do agree lieutenant that you are now strictly under my orders of course sir keep the paper sharpe christopher said irritably when sharpe tried to hand back general cradocks order its addressed to you for gods sake and looking at it once in a while might remind you of your duty which is to obey my orders and stay here if there is a truce then it wont hurt our bargaining position to say we have troops established well north of the douro so you dig your heels in here and you stay very quiet now if youll pardon me gentlemen id like some time with my wife vicente bowed again and left but sharpe did not move youll be staying here with us sir no christopher seemed uncomfortable with the question but forced a smile you and i my darlinghe turned to katewill be going back to house beautiful youre going to oporto sharpe was astonished i told you sharpe things are changing there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy so good night to you lieutenant sharpe went out onto the driveway where vicente was standing by the low wall that overlooked the valley the portuguese lieutenant was gazing at the halfdark sky which was punctured by the first stars he offered sharpe a rough cigar and then his own to light it from i talked to luis vicente said and sharpe rarely indulged and almost choked on the harsh smoke christopher has been back north of the douro for five days hes been in porto talking to the french but he did go south vicente nodded they went to coimbra met general cradock then came back captain argenton returned to porto with him so what the hell is going on vicente blew smoke at the moon maybe they do make peace luis does not know what they talked about so maybe it was peace there had been just such a treaty after the battles at rolica and vimeiro and the defeated french had been taken home on british ships so was a new treaty being made sharpe was at least reassured that christopher had seen cradock and now sharpe had definitive orders that took away much of the uncertainty the colonel left shortly after dawn at sunrise there had been a stuttering crackle of musketry somewhere to the north and christopher had joined sharpe on the driveway and stared into the valleys mist sharpe could see nothing with his telescope but christopher was impressed by the glass who is aw he asked sharpe reading the inscription just someone i knew sir not arthur wellesley christopher sounded amused just someone i knew sharpe repeated stubbornly fellow must have liked you christopher said because its a damned generous gift mind if i take it to the rooftop i might see more from there and my own telescopes an evil little thing sharpe did not like relinquishing the glass but christopher gave him no chance to refuse and just walked away he evidently saw nothing to worry him for he ordered the gig harnessed and told luis to collect the remaining cavalry horses that sharpe had captured at barca davintas you cant be bothered with horses sharpe he said so ill take them off your hands tell me what do your fellows do during the day there isnt much to do sharpe said were training vicentes men need it do they they could be quicker with their muskets sir christopher had brought a cup of coffee out of the house and now blew on it to cool the liquid if theres peace he said then they can go back to being cobblers or whatever it is they do when they aint shambling about the place in illfitting uniforms he sipped his coffee speaking of which sharpe its time you got yourself a new one ill talk to my tailor sharpe said and then before christopher could react to his insolence asked a serious question you think there will be peace sir quite a few of the frogs think bonapartes bitten off more than he can chew christopher said airily and spain certainly is probably indigestible portugal isnt portugals a mess christopher said dismissively but france cant hold portugal if she cant hold spain he turned to watch luis leading the gig from the stable i think theres the real prospect of radical change in the air he said and you sharpe wont jeopardize it lie low here for a week or so and ill send word when you can take your fellows south with a little luck youll be home by june you mean back with the army i mean home in england of course christopher said proper ale sharpe thatched roofs cricket on the artillery ground church bells fat sheep plump parsons pliant women good beef england something to look forward to eh sharpe yes sir sharpe said and wondered why he mistrusted christopher most when the colonel was trying to be pleasant theres no point in you trying to leave anyway christopher said the french have burned every boat on the douro so keep your lads out of trouble and ill see you in a week or twochristopher threw away the rest of his coffee and held his hand out to sharpeand if not me i shall send a message i left your telescope on the hall table by the way youve got a key to the house havent you keep your fellows out of it theres a good chap good day to you sharpe and to you sir sharpe said and after he had shaken the colonels hand he wiped his own on his french breeches luis locked the house kate smiled shyly at sharpe and the colonel took the gigs reins luis collected the dragoons horses then followed the gig down the drive toward vila real de zedes harper strolled over to sharpe were to stay here while they make peace the irishman had evidently been eavesdropping thats what the man said and is that what you think sharpe stared into the east toward spain the sky there was white not with cloud but heat and there was a thumping in that eastern distance an irregular heartbeat so far off as to be barely heard it was cannon fire proof that the french and the portuguese were still fighting over the bridge at amarante it doesnt smell like peace to me pat the folk here hate the french sir so do the dons which doesnt mean the politicians wont make peace sharpe said those slimy bastards will do anything that makes them rich harper agreed but captain hogan never smelt peace in the wind and there aint much passes him by sir but weve got orders sharpe said directly from general cradock harper grimaced youre a great man for obeying orders sir so you are and the general wants us to stay here god knows why theres something funny in the wind pat maybe it is peace god knows what you and i will do then he shrugged then went to the house to fetch his telescope and it was not there the hall table held nothing except a silver letter holder christopher had stolen the glass the bastard sharpe thought the utter goddamn bloody misbegotten bastard because the telescope was gone i never liked the name colonel christopher said it isnt even a beautiful house my father chose it kate said its from the pilgrims progress a tedious read my god how tedious they were back in oporto where colonel christopher had opened the neglected cellars of the house beautiful to discover dusty bottles of aging port and more of vinho verde a white wine that was almost golden in color he drank some now as he strolled about the garden the flowers were coming into bloom the lawn was newly scythed and the only thing that spoiled the day was the smell of burned houses it was almost a month since the fall of the city and smoke still drifted from some of the ruins in the lower town where the stench was much worse because of the bodies among the ashes there were tales of drowned bodies turning up on every tide colonel christopher sat under a cypress tree and watched kate she was beautiful he thought so very beautiful and that morning he had summoned a french tailor marshal soults personal tailor and to kates embarrassment he had made the man measure her for a french hussar uniform why would i want to wear such a thing kate had asked and christopher had not told her that he had seen a frenchwoman dressed in just such a uniform the breeches skintight and the short jacket cut high to reveal a perfect bum and kates legs were longer and better shaped and christopher who was feeling rich because of the funds released to him by general cradock funds christopher claimed were necessary to encourage argentons mutineers had paid the tailor an outrageous fee to have the uniform stitched quickly why wear that uniform he responded to her question because you will find it easier to ride a horse wearing breeches because the uniform becomes you because it reassures our french friends that you are not an enemy and best of all my dear one because it would please me and that last reason of course had been the one that convinced her you really like the name house beautiful he asked her im used to it not attached to it its not a matter of faith with you faith kate in a white linen dress frowned i consider myself a christian a protestant christian her husband amended her as am i but does not the name of the house somewhat flaunt itself in a romish society i doubt kate said with an unexpected tartness that anyone here has read bunyan some will have christopher said and they will know they are being insulted he smiled at her i am a diplomat remember it is my job to make the crooked straight and the rough places plain is that what youre doing here kate asked gesturing to indicate the city beneath them where the french ruled over plundered houses and embittered people oh kate christopher said sadly this is progress progress christopher got to his feet and paced up and down the lawn becoming animated as he explained to her that the world was changing fast about them there are more things in heaven and earth he told her than are dreamt of in your philosophy and kate who had been told this more than once in her short marriage suppressed her irritation and listened as her husband described how the ancient superstitions were being discredited kings have been dethroned kate whole countries now manage without them that would once have been considered unthinkable it would have been a defiance of gods plan for the world but were seeing a new revelation it is a new ordering of the world what do simple folk see here war just war but war between who france and britain france and portugal no it is between the old way of doing things and the new way superstitions are being challenged im not defending bonaparte good god no hes a braggart an adventurer but hes also an instrument hes burning out what is bad in the old regimes and leaving a space into which new ideas will come reason thats what animates the new regimes kate reason i thought it was liberty kate suggested liberty man has no liberty except the liberty to obey rules but who makes the rules with luck kate it will be reasonable men making reasonable rules clever men subtle men in the end kate it is a coterie of sophisticated men who will make the rules but they will make them according to the tenets of reason and there are some of us in britain a few of us in britain who understand that we will have to come to terms with that idea we also have to help shape it if we fight it then the world will become new without us and we shall be defeated by reason so we must work with it with bonaparte kate asked distaste in her voice with all the countries of europe christopher said enthusiastically with portugal and spain with prussia and austria with holland and yes with france we have more in common than divides us yet we fight what sense does that make there can be no progress without peace kate none you do want peace my love devoutly kate said then trust me christopher said trust that i know what im doing and she did trust him because she was young and her husband was so much older and she knew he was privy to opinions that were far more sophisticated than her instincts yet the following night that trust was put to the test when four french officers and their mistresses came to the house beautiful for supper the group led by brigadier general henri vuillard a tall elegantly handsome man who was charming to kate kissing her hand and complimenting her on the house and the garden vuillards servant brought a crate of wine as a gift though it was hardly tactful for the wine was savages best appropriated from one of the british ships that had been trapped on oportos quays by contrary winds when the french took the city after supper the three junior officers entertained the ladies in the parlor while christopher and vuillard paced the garden their cigars trailing smoke beneath the black cypress trees soult is worried vuillard confessed by cradock cradocks an old woman vuillard said scathingly isnt it true he wanted to withdraw last year but what about wellesley tougher christopher admitted but its by no means certain hell come here he has enemies in london political enemies i presume vuillard asked indeed the most dangerous enemies of a soldier vuillard said he was of an age with christopher and a favorite of marshal soult no soults worried he went on because were frittering troops away to protect our supply lines you kill two peasants armed with matchlock guns in this damn country and twenty more spring up from the rocks and the twenty dont have matchlocks any longer instead they have good british muskets supplied by your damn country take lisbon christopher said and capture every other port and the supply of arms will dry up well do it vuillard promised in time but we could do with another fifteen thousand men christopher stopped at the gardens edge and stared across the douro for a few seconds the city lay beneath him the smoke from a thousand kitchens smirching the night air is soult going to declare himself king you know what his nickname is now vuillard asked amused king nicolas no he wont make the declaration not if hes got any sense and hes probably got just enough the local people wont stand for it the army wont support it and the emperor will poach his balls for it christopher smiled but hes tempted oh hes tempted but soult usually stops before he goes too far usually vuillard sounded cautious for soult only the day before had sent a letter to all the generals in his army suggesting that they encourage the portuguese to declare their support for him to become king it was vuillard thought madness but soult was obsessed with the idea of being a royal i told him hell provoke a mutiny if he does that he will christopher said and you need to know that argenton was in coimbra he met cradock argentons a fool vuillard snarled hes a useful fool christopher observed let him keep talking to the british and theyll do nothing why should they exert themselves if your army is going to destroy itself by mutiny but will it vuillard asked just how many officers does argenton speak for enough christopher said and i have their names vuillard chuckled i could have you arrested englishman and given to a pair of dragoon sergeants wholl prize those names out of you in two minutes youll get the names christopher said in time but for the moment brigadier i give you this instead he handed vuillard an envelope what is it it was too dark in the garden to read anything cradocks order of battle christopher said some of his troops are in coimbra but most are in lisbon in brief he has sixteen thousand british bayonets and seven thousand portuguese the details are all there and you will note they are particularly deficient in artillery how deficient three batteries of sixpounders christopher said and one of three there are rumors that more guns heavier guns are coming but such rumors have always proved false in the past threepounders vuillard laughed he might as well chuck rocks at us the brigadier tapped the envelope so what do you want from us christopher walked a few paces in silence then shrugged it seems to me general that europe is going to be ruled from paris not from london youre going to put your own king here true vuillard said and it might even be king nicolas if he captures lisbon quickly enough but the emperor has a stableful of idle brothers one of those will probably get portugal but whoever it is christopher said i can be useful to him by giving us thisvuillard flourished the envelopeand a few names that i can kick out of argenton whenever i wish like all soldiers christopher said smoothly you are unsubtle once you conquer portugal general you will have to pacify it i know who can be trusted here who will work with you and who are your secret enemies i know which men say one thing and do another i bring you all the knowledge of britains foreign office i know who spies for britain and who their paymasters are i know the codes they use and the routes their messages take i know who will work for you and who will work against you i know who will lie to you and who will tell you the truth in short general i can save you thousands of deaths unless of course you would rather send your troops against peasants in the hills vuillard chuckled and what if we dont conquer portugal what happens to you if we withdraw then i shall own savages christopher answered calmly and my masters at home will simply calculate that i failed to encourage mutiny in your ranks but i doubt youll lose what has stopped the emperor so far la manche vuillard said dryly meaning the english channel he drew on his cigar you came to me he said with news of mutinv but you never told me what you wanted in exchange so tell me now englishman the port trade christopher said i want the port trade the simplicity of the answer made vuillard check his pacing the port trade all of it croft taylor fladgate burmester smith woodhouse dows savages gould kopke sandeman all the lodges i dont want to own them i already own savages or i will soon i just want to be the sole shipper vuillard took a few seconds to understand the scope of the demand youd control half the export trade of portugal he said youd be richer than the emperor not quite christopher said because the emperor will tax me and i cant tax him the man who becomes impressively rich general is the man who levies the tax not he who pays it youll still be wealthy and that general is what i want vuillard stared down at the black lawn someone was playing a harpsichord in the house beautiful and there was the sound of womens laughter peace he thought would eventually come and maybe this polished englishman could help bring it about youre not telling me the names i want he said and youve given me a list of british forces but how do i know youre not deceiving me you dont i want more than lists vuillard said harshly i need to know englishman that youre willing to give something tangible to prove that youre on our side you want blood christopher said mildly he had been expecting the demand blood will do but not portuguese blood british blood christopher smiled there is a village called vila real de zedes he said where savages have some vineyards it has been curiously undisturbed by the conquest that was true but only because christopher had arranged it with argentons colonel and fellow plotter whose dragoons were responsible for patrolling that stretch of country but if you send a small force there christopher went on you will find a token unit of british riflemen there are only a score of them but they have some portuguese troops and some rebels with them say a hundred men altogether theyre yours but in return i ask one thing which is spare the quinta it belongs to my wifes family a grumble of thunder sounded to the north and the cypresses were outlined by a flash of sheet lightning vila real de zedes vuillard asked a village not far from the amarante road christopher said and i wish i could give you something more but i offer what i can as an earnest of my sincerity the troops there will give you no trouble theyre led by a british lieutenant and he didnt strike me as particularly resourceful the man must be thirty if hes a day and hes still a lieutenant so he cant be up to much another crackle of thunder made vuillard look anxiously to the northern sky we must get back to quarters before the rain comes he said but then paused it doesnt worry you that you betray your country i betray nothing christopher said and then for a change he spoke truthfully if frances conquests general are ruled only by frenchmen then europe will regard you as nothing but adventurers and exploiters but if you share your power if every nation in europe contributes to the government of every other nation then we will have moved into the promised world of reason and peace isnt that what your emperor wants a european system those were his words a european system a european code of laws a european judiciary and one nation alone in europe europeans how can i betray my own continent vuillard grimaced our emperor talks a lot englishman hes a corsican and he has wild dreams is that what you are a dreamer i am a realist christopher said he had used his knowledge of the mutiny to ingratiate himself with the french and now he would secure their trust by offering a handful of british soldiers as a sacrifice so sharpe and his men must die so that europes glorious future could arrive chapter the loss of the telescope hurt sharpe he told himself it was a bauble a useful frill but it still hurt it marked an achievement not just the rescue of sir arthur wellesley but the promotion to commissioned rank afterward sometimes when he scarcely dared believe that he was a kings officer he would look at the telescope and think how far he had traveled from the orphanage in brewhouse lane and at other times though he was reluctant to admit it to himself he enjoyed refusing to explain the plaque on the telescopes barrel yet he knew other men knew they looked at him understood he had once fought like a demon under the indian sun and were awed now bloody christopher had the glass youll get it back sir harper tried to console him i bloody will too i hear that williamson got into a fight in the village last night not much of a fight sir i pulled him off who was he milling one of lopess men sir as evil a bastard as williamson should i punish him god no sir i looked after it but sharpe nevertheless declared the village out of bounds which he knew would not be popular with his men harper spoke for them pointing out that there were some pretty girls in vila real de zedes theres one wee slip of a thing there sir he said that would bring tears to your eyes the lads only want to walk down there of an evening to say hello and to leave some babies behind that too harper agreed and the girls cant walk up here sharpe asked i hear some do some do sir im told thats true including one wee slip of a thing that has red hair and can bring tears to your eyes harper watched a buzzard quartering the broomclad slopes of the hill on which the fort was being made some of us like to go to church in the village sir he said studiously not talking about the redheaded girl whose name was maria sharpe smiled so how many catholics have we got theres me sir and donnelly and carter and mcneill oh and slattery of course the rest of you are all going to hell slattery sharpe said fergus isnt a christian i never said he was sir but he goes to mass sharpe could not help laughing so ill let the catholics go to mass he said harper grinned that means theyll all be catholic by sunday this is the army sharpe said so anyone wanting to convert has to get my permission but you can take the other four to mass and you bring them back by midday and if i find any of the other lads down there ill hold you responsible me youre a sergeant arent you but when the lads see lieutenant vicentes men going to the village sir they wont see why theyre not allowed vicentes portuguese his men know the local rules we dont and sooner or later theres going to be a fight over girls thatll bring tears to your eyes and we dont need it pat the problem was not so much the girls though sharpe knew they could be a problem if one of his riflemen became drunk and that was the true problem there were two taverns in the village and both served cheap wine out of barrels and half his men would become paralyzed with drink given half a chance and there was a temptation to relax the rules because the situation of the riflemen was so strange they were out of touch with the army not sure what was happening and without enough to do and so sharpe invented more work for them the fort was now sprouting extra stone redoubts and sharpe found tools in the quintas barn and made his men clear the track through the woods and carry bundles of firewood up to the watchtower and when that was done he led long patrols into the surrounding countryside the patrols were not intended to seek out the enemy but to tire the men so that they collapsed at sundown and slept till dawn and each dawn sharpe held a formal parade and put men on a charge if he found a button undone or a scrap of rust on a rifle lock they moaned at him but there was no trouble with the villagers the barrels in the village taverns were not the only danger the cellar of the quinta was full of port barrels and racks of bottled white wine and williamson managed to find the key that was supposedly hidden in a kitchen jar then he and sims and gataker got helplessly drunk on savages finest a carouse that ended well past midnight with the three men hurling stones at the quintas shutters the three had ostensibly been on picquet under the eye of dodd a reliable man and sharpe dealt with him first why didnt you report them i didnt know where they were sir dodd kept his eyes on the wall above sharpes head he was lying of course but only because the men always protected each other sharpe had when he was in the ranks and he did not expect anything else of matthew dodd just as dodd did not expect anything except a punishment sharpe looked at harper got work for him sergeant the cook was complaining that all the kitchen copper needed a proper cleaning sir make him sweat sharpe said and no wine ration for a week the men were entitled to a pint of rum a day and in the absence of the raw spirit sharpe was doling out red from a barrel he had commandeered from the quintas cellar he punished sims and gataker by making them wear full uniform and greatcoats and then march up and down the drive with rucksacks filled with stones they did it under harpers enthusiastic eye and when they vomited with exhaustion and the effects of a hangover the sergeant kicked them to their feet made them clear the vomit off the driveway with their own hands and then keep marching vicente arranged for a mason from the village to brick up the wine cellars entrance and while that was being done and while dodd scrubbed the coppers with sand and vinegar sharpe took williamson up into the woods he was tempted to flog the man for he was very close to hating williamson but sharpe had once been flogged himself and he was reluctant to inflict the same punishment instead he found an open space between some laurels and used his sword to scratch two lines in the mossy turf the lines were a yard long and a yard apart you dont like me do you williamson williamson said nothing he just stared at the lines with red eyes he knew what they were what are my three rules williamson williamson looked up sullenly he was a big man heavyfaced with long side whiskers a broken nose and smallpox scars he came from leicester where he had been convicted of stealing two candlesticks from st nicholass church and offered the chance to enlist rather than hang dont thieve he said in a low voice dont get drunk and fight proper are you a thief no sir you bloody are williamson thats why youre in the army and you got drunk without permission but can you fight you know i can sir sharpe unbuckled his sword belt and let it and the weapon drop then took off his shako and green jacket and threw them down tell me why you dont like me he demanded williamson stared off into the laurels come on sharpe said say what you bloody like youre not going to be punished for answering a question williamson looked back at him we shouldnt be here he blurted out youre right williamson blinked at that but carried on ever since captain murray died sir weve been out on our own we should be back with the battalion its where we belong you were never our officer sir never i am now it aint right so you want to go home to england the battalions there so i do aye but theres a war on williamson a bloody war and were stuck in it we didnt ask to be here dont even want to be here but we are and were staying williamson looked at sharpe resentfully but said nothing but you can go home williamson sharpe said and the heavy face looked up interested there are three ways for you to go home one we get orders for england two you get wounded so badly that they send you home and three you put your feet on the scratch and you fight me win or lose williamson i promise to send you home as soon as i can by the first bloody ship we find all you have to do is fight me sharpe walked to one of the lines and put his toes against it this was how the pugilists fought they toed the line and then punched it out with bare fists until one man dropped in bloody battered exhaustion fight me properly mind sharpe said no dropping after the first hit youll have to draw blood to prove youre trying hit me on the nose thatll do it he waited williamson licked his lips come on sharpe snarled fight me youre an officer williamson said not now im not and no ones watching just you and me williamson and you dont like me and im giving you a chance to thump me and you do it properly and ill have you home by summer he did not know how he would keep that promise but nor did he think he would have to try for williamson he knew was remembering the epic fight between harper and sharpe a fight that had left both men reeling yet sharpe had won it and the riflemen had watched it and they learned something about sharpe that day and williamson did not want to learn the lesson again i wont fight an officer he said with assumed dignity sharpe turned his back picked up his jacket then find sergeant harper he said and tell him youre to do the same punishment as sims and gataker he turned back on the double williamson ran his shame at refusing the fight might make him more dangerous but it would also diminish his influence over the other men who even though they would never know what had happened in the woods would sense that williamson had been humiliated sharpe buckled his belt and walked slowly back he worried about his men worried that he would lose their loyalty worried that he was proving a bad officer he remembered bias vivar and wished he had the spanish officers quiet ability to enforce obedience through sheer presence but perhaps that effortless authority came with experience at least none of his men had deserted they were all present except for tarrant and the few who were back in coimbras military hospital recovering from the fever it was a month now since oporto had fallen the fort on the hilltop was almost finished and to sharpes surprise the men had enjoyed the hard labor daniel hagman was walking again albeit slowly but he was mended enough to work and sharpe placed a kitchen table in the sun where one by one hagman stripped cleaned and oiled every rifle the fugitives who had fled from oporto had now returned to the city or found refuge elsewhere but the french were making new fugitives wherever they were ambushed by partisans they sacked the closest villages and even without the provocation of ambush they plundered farms mercilessly to feed themselves more and more folk came to vila real de zedes drawn there by rumors that the french had agreed to spare the village no one knew why the french should do such a thing though some of the older women said it was because the whole valley was under the protection of saint joseph whose lifesize statue was in the church and the villages priest father josefa encouraged the belief he even had the statue taken from the church hung with fading narcissi and crowned with a laurel wreath and then carried about the village boundary to show the saint the precise extent of the lands needing his guardianship vila real de zedes folk believed was a sanctuary from the war and ordained as such by god may arrived with rain and wind the last of the blossoms were blown from the trees to make damp rills of pink and white petals in the grass still the french did not come and manuel lopes reckoned they were simply too busy to bother with vila real de zedes theyve got troubles he said happily silveiras giving them a bellyache at amarante and the road to vigo has been closed by partisans theyre cut off no way home theyre not going to worry us here lopes frequently went to the nearby towns where he posed as a peddler selling religious trinkets and he brought back news of the french troops they patrol the roads he said they get drunk at night and they wish they were back home and they look for food sharpe said they do that too lopes agreed and one day sharpe said when theyre hungry theyll come here colonel christopher wont let them lopes said he was walking with sharpe along the quintas drive watched by harris and cooper who stood guard at the gate the closest sharpe allowed his protestant riflemen to the village rain was threatening gray sheets of it fell across the northern hills and sharpe had twice heard rumbles of thunder which might have been the sound of the guns at amarante but seemed too loud i shall leave soon lopes announced back to braganca amarante my men are recovered it is time to fight again you could do one thing before you go sharpe said ignoring the implied criticism in lopess last words tell those refugees to get out of the village tell them to go home tell them saint joseph is overworked and he wont protect them when the french come lopes shook his head the french arent coming he insisted and when they do sharpe continued just as insistently i cant defend the village i dont have enough men lopes looked disgusted youll just defend the quinta he suggested because it belongs to an english family i dont give a damn about the quinta sharpe said angrily ill be up on that hilltop trying to stay alive for christs sake theres less than sixty of us and the french will send fifteen hundred they wont come lopes said he reached up to pluck some shriveled white blossom from a tree i never did trust savages port he said trust an elder tree lopes said showing sharpe the petals the bad port makers put elderberry juice in the wine to make it look richer he tossed away the flowers and sharpe had a sudden memory of that day in oporto the day the refugees drowned when the french had taken the city and he remembered how christopher had been about to write him the order to go back across the douro and the cannonball had struck the tree to shower pinkishred petals which the colonel had thought were cherry blossoms and sharpe remembered the look on christophers face at the mention of the name judas jesus sharpe said what lopes was taken aback by the force of the imprecation hes a bloody traitor sharpe said who the bloody colonel sharpe said it was only instinct that had so suddenly persuaded him that christopher was betraying his country an instinct grounded in the memory of the colonels look of outrage when sharpe said the blossoms came from a judas tree ever since then sharpe had been wavering between a half suspicion of christophers treachery and a vague belief that perhaps the colonel was engaged in some mysterious diplomatic work but the recollection of that look on christophers face and the realization that there had been fear as well as outrage in it convinced sharpe christopher was not just a thief but a traitor youre right he told an astonished lopes it is time to fight harris he turned toward the gate sir find sergeant harper for me and lieutenant vicente vicente came first and sharpe could not explain why he was so certain that christopher was a traitor but vicente was not inclined to debate the point he hated christopher because he had married kate and he was as bored as sharpe at the undemanding life at the quinta get food sharpe urged him go to the village ask them to bake bread buy as much salted and smoked meat as you can i want every man to have five days rations by nightfall harper was more cautious i thought you had orders sir i do pat from general cradock jesus sir you dont disobey a generals orders and who fetched those orders sharpe asked christopher did so he lied to cradock just as hes lied to everyone else he was not certain of that he could not be certain but nor could he see the sense in just dallying at the quinta he would go south and trust that captain hogan would protect him from general cradocks wrath well march at dusk tonight he told harper i want you to check everyones equipment and ammunition harper smelt the air were going to have rain sir bad rain thats why god made our skins waterproof sharpe said i was thinking we might do better to wait till after midnight sir give the rain a chance to blow over sharpe shook his head i want to get out of here pat i feel bad about this place suddenly well take everyone south toward the river i thought the crapauds had stripped out all the boats i dont want to go eastsharpe jerked his head toward amarante where rumor said a battle still ragedand theres nothing but crapauds to the west the north was all mountain rock and starvation but to the south lay the river and he knew british forces were somewhere beyond the douro and sharpe had been thinking that the french could not have destroyed every boat along its long rocky banks well find a boat he promised harper itll be dark tonight sir lucky even to find the way for gods sake sharpe said irritated with harpers pessimism weve been patrolling this place for a bloody month we can find our way south by evening they had two sacks of bread some rockhard smoked goat meat two cheeses and a bag of beans that sharpe distributed among the men then he had an inspiration and went to the quintas kitchen and stole two large tins of tea he reckoned it was time kate did something for her country and there were few finer gestures than donating good china tea to riflemen he gave one tin to harper and shoved the other into his pack it had started to rain the drops pounding on the stable roof and cascading off the tiles into the cobbled yard daniel hagman watched the rain from the stable door i feel just fine sir he reassured sharpe we can make a stretcher dan if you feel poorly lord no sir im right as rain right as rain no one wanted to leave in this downpour but sharpe was determined to use every hour of darkness to make his way toward the douro there was a chance he thought of reaching the river by midday tomorrow and he would let the men rest while he scouted the river bank for a means to cross packs on he ordered ready yourselves he watched williamson for any sign of reluctance but the man got a move on with the rest vicente had distributed wine corks and the men pushed them into the muzzles of their rifles or muskets the weapons were not loaded because in this rain the priming would turn to gray slush there was more grumbling when sharpe ordered them out of the stables but they hunched their shoulders and followed him out of the courtyard and up into the wood where the oaks and silver birches thrashed under the assault of wind and rain sharpe was soaked to the skin before they had gone a quartermile but he consoled himself that no one else was likely to be out in this vile weather the evening light was fading fast and early stolen by the black thickbellied clouds that scraped against the jagged outcrop of the ruined watchtower sharpe was following a path that would lead around the western side of the watchtowers hill and he glanced up at the old masonry as they emerged from the trees and thought ruefully of all that work he called a halt to let the rear of the line catch up daniel hagman was evidently holding up well harper two smoked legs of goat hanging from his belt climbed up to join sharpe who was watching the arriving men from a vantage point a few feet higher than the path bloody rain harper said itll stop eventually is that so harper asked innocently it was then sharpe saw the gleam of light in the vineyards it was not lightning it was too dull too small and too close to the ground but he knew he had not imagined it and he cursed christopher for stealing his telescope he gazed at the spot where the light had shown so briefly but saw nothing what is it vicente had climbed to join him thought i saw a flash of light sharpe said just rain harper said dismissively perhaps it was a piece of broken glass vicente suggested i once found some roman glass in a field near entreosrios there were two broken vases and some coins of septimus severus sharpe was not listening he was watching the vineyards i gave the coins to the seminary in porto vicente went on raising his voice to make himself heard over the seething rain because the fathers keep a small museum there the sun doesnt reflect off glass when its raining sharpe said but something had reflected out there more like a smear of light a damp gleam and he searched the hedgerow between the vines and suddenly saw it again he swore what is it vicente asked dragoons sharpe said dozens of the bastards dismounted and watching us the gleam had been the dull light reflecting from one of the brass helmets there must have been a tear in the helmets protective cloth cover and the man running along the hedge had served as a beacon but now that sharpe had seen the first green uniform among the green vines he could see dozens more the bastards were going to ambush us he said and he felt a reluctant admiration for an enemy who could use such vile weather then he worked out that the dragoons must have approached vila real de zedes during the day and somehow he had missed them but they would not have missed the significance of the work he was doing on the hilltop and they must know that the hogbacked ridge was his refuge sergeant he snapped at harper up the hill now now and pray they were not too late colonel christopher might have rewritten the rules yet the chess pieces could still only move in their accustomed ways but his knowledge of the moves allowed him to look ahead and he fancied he did that with more perspicacity than most men there were two possible outcomes to the french invasion of portugal either the french would win or far less likely the portuguese with their british allies would somehow evict soults forces if the french won then christopher would be the owner of savages lodge the trusted ally of the countrys new masters and rich beyond belief if the portuguese and their british allies won then he would use argentons pathetic conspiracy to explain why he had remained in enemy territory and use the collapse of the proposed mutiny as an excuse for the failure of his schemes and then he would need to move a couple of pawns to remain the owner of savages which would be enough to make him a rich man if not rich beyond belief so he could not lose so long as the pawns did what they were supposed to do and one of those pawns was major henri dulong the second in command of the st leger one of the crack french light infantry units in portugal the st knew it was good but none of its soldiers was the equal of dulong who was famous throughout the army he was tough daring and ruthless and on this early may evening of wind and rain and low cloud major dulongs job was to lead his voltigeurs up the southern path that led to the watchtower on the hill above the quinta take that height brigadier vuillard explained and the scrappy forces in vila real de zedes had nowhere to go so while the dragoons made a noose about the village and the quinta dulong would capture the hill it had been brigadier vuillards idea to attack at dusk most soldiers would expect an assault at dawn but it was vuillards notion that mens guard was lower late in the day theyre looking forward to a skin of wine a wench and a hot meal he had told christopher then he had fixed the time for the assault at a quarter to eight in the evening the sun would actually set a few moments before but the twilight would stretch until half past eight though the clouds had proved so thick that vuillard doubted there would be any twilight to speak of not that it mattered dulong had been lent a good breguet watch and he had promised that his men would be on the watchtowers peak at a quarter to eight just as the dragoons converged on the village and the quinta the remaining companies of the st leger would first climb up to the wood and then sweep down onto the quinta from the south i doubt dulong will see any action vuillard told christopher and hell be unhappy about that hes a bloodthirsty rascal youve given him the most dangerous task surely but only if the enemy are on the hilltop the brigadier explained i hope to catch them off guard colonel and it seemed to christopher as though vuillards hopes were justified for at a quarter to eight the dragoons charged into vila real de zedes and met almost no opposition a clap of thunder was the accompaniment to the attack and a stab of lightning split the sky and reflected silver white from the dragoons long swords a handful of men resisted some muskets were fired from a tavern beside the church and vuillard later discovered through questioning the survivors that a band of partisans had been recuperating in the village a handful of them escaped but eight others were killed and a score more including their leader who called himself the schoolteacher were captured two of vuillards dragoons were wounded a hundred more dragoons rode to the quinta they were commanded by a captain who would rendezvous with the infantry coming down through the woods and the captain had promised to make certain the property was not looted you dont want to go with them vuillard asked no christopher was watching the village girls being pushed toward the largest tavern i dont blame you vuillard said noticing the girls the sport will be here and vuillards sport began the villagers hated the french and the french hated the villagers and the dragoons had discovered partisans in the houses and they all knew how to treat such vermin manuel lopes and his captured partisans were taken to the church where they were forced to break up the altars rails and images then ordered to heap all the shattered timber in the center of the nave father josefa came to protest at the vandalism and the dragoons stripped him naked tore his cassock into strips and used the strips to lash the priest to the big crucifix that hung above the main altar the priests are the worst vuillard explained to christopher they encourage their people to fight us i swear well have to kill every last priest in portugal before were through other captives were being brought to the church any villager whose house contained a firearm or who had defied the dragoons was taken there a man who had tried to protect his thirteenyearold daughter was dragged to the church and once inside a dragoon sergeant broke the mens arms and legs with a great sledgehammer taken from the blacksmiths forge its a lot easier than tying them up vuillard explained christopher flinched as the big hammer snapped the bones some men whimpered a few screamed but most stayed obstinately silent father josefa said the prayer for the dying until a dragoon quieted him by breaking his jaw with a sword it was dark by now the rain still beat on the church roof but not so violently lightning lit the windows from the outside as vuillard crossed to the remnants of a side altar and picked up a candle that had been burning on the floor he took it to the pile of splintered furniture that had been laced with powder from the dragoons carbine ammunition he placed the candle deep in the pile and backed away for a moment the flame flickered small and insignificant then there was a hiss and a bright fire streaked up the piles center the wounded men cried aloud as smoke began to curl toward the beams and as vuillard and the dragoons retreated toward the door they flap like fish the brigadier spoke of the men who tried to drag themselves toward the fire in the vain hope of extinguishing it vuillard laughed the rain will slow things he told christopher but not by much the fire was crackling now spewing thick smoke its when the roof catches fire that they die vuillard said and it takes quite a time best not to stay though the dragoons left locking the church behind them a dozen men stayed out in the rain to make certain that the fire did not go out or more unlikely that no one escaped from the flames while vuillard led christopher and a halfdozen other officers to the villages largest tavern which was cheerfully lit by scores of candles and lamps the infantry will report to us here vuillard explained so we must find something to pass the time eh indeed christopher plucked off his cocked hat as he stooped through the tavern door well have a meal brigadier vuillard said and what passes in this country for wine he stopped in the main room where the villages girls had been lined against a wall what do you think he asked christopher tempting christopher said indeed vuillard still did not entirely trust christopher the englishman was too aloof but now vuillard thought he would put him to the test take your choice he said pointing to the girls the men guarding the girls grinned the girls were crying softly christopher took a pace toward the captives if the englishman was squeamish vuillard thought then that would betray scruples or worse a sympathy for the portuguese there were even some in the french army who expressed such sympathies officers who argued that by maltreating the portuguese the army only made their own problems worse but vuillard like most frenchmen believed that the portuguese needed to be punished with such severity that none would ever dare lift a finger against the french again rape theft and wanton destruction were to vuillard defensive tactics and now he wanted to see christopher join him in an act of war he wanted to see the aloof englishman behave like the french in their moment of triumph be quick vuillard said i promised my men they could have the ones we dont want ill take the small girl christopher said wolfishly the redhead she screamed but there was much screaming that night in vila real de zedes as there was on the hill to the south sharpe ran he shouted at his men to get to the top of the hill as fast as they could and then he scrambled up the slope and he had gone a hundred yards before he calmed down and realized that he was doing this all wrong rifles he shouted packs off he let his men unburden themselves until they carried only their weapons haversacks and cartridge boxes lieutenant vicentes men did the same six portuguese and the same number of riflemen would stay to guard the discarded packs and bags and greatcoats and cuts of smoked meat while the rest followed sharpe and vicente up the slope they went much faster now did you see the bastards up there harper panted no sharpe said but he knew the french would want to take the fort because it was the highest ground for miles and that meant they had probably sent a company or more to loop about the south and sneak up the hill so it was a race sharpe had no proof that the french were in the race but he did not underestimate them they would be coming and all he could pray was that they were not there already the rain fell harder no gun would fire in this weather this was going to be a fight of wet steel fists and rifle butts sharpes boots slipped on sodden turf and skidded on rock he was getting short of breath but at least he had climbed the flanking slope and was now on the path that led up the northern spine of the hill and his men had widened and strengthened the path cutting steps in the steepest places and pegging the risers with wedges of birch it had been invented work to keep them busy but it was all worth it now because it quickened the pace sharpe was still leading with a dozen riflemen close behind he decided he would not close ranks before they reached the top this was a scramble where the devil really would take the hindmost so the important thing was to reach the summit and he looked up into the whirl of rain and cloud and he saw nothing up there but wet rock and the sudden reflected sheen of a lightning bolt slithering down a sheer stone face he thought of the village and knew it was doomed he wished he could do something about that but he did not have enough men to defend the village and he had tried to warn them the rain was driving into his face blinding him he slithered as he ran there was a stitch in his side his legs were like fire and the breath rasped in his throat the rifle was slung on his shoulder bouncing there the stock thumping into his left thigh as he tried to draw the sword but then he had to let go of the hilt to steady himself against a rock as his boots slid wildly out from under him harper was twenty paces back panting vicente was gaining on sharpe who dragged his sword free of its scabbard pushed himself away from the boulder and forced himself on again lightning flickered to the east outlining black hills and a sky slanting with water the thunder crackled across the heavens filling them with angry noise and sharpe felt as though he were climbing into the heart of the storm climbing to join the gods of war the gale tore at him his shako was long gone the wind shrieked moaned was drowned by thunder and burdened by rain and sharpe thought he would never reach the top and suddenly he was beside the first wall the place where the path zigzagged between two of the small redoubts his men had built and a dagger of lightning stabbed down into the void that opened wet and dark to his right for a wild second he thought the hilltop was empty and then he saw the flash of a blade reflecting the storms white fire and knew the french were already there dulongs voltigeurs had arrived just seconds before and had taken the watchtower but they had not had time to occupy the northernmost redoubts where sharpes men now appeared throw them out dulong roared at his men kill the bastards sharpe shouted and his blade scraped along a bayonet jarred against the muzzle of the musket and he threw himself forward driving the man back and hammered his forehead against the mans nose and the first riflemen were past him and the blades were ringing in the near dark sharpe banged the hilt of his sword into the face of the man he had put down plucked the musket from him and threw it out into the void then pushed on to where a group of frenchmen were readying to defend the summit they aimed their muskets and sharpe hoped to god he was right and that no flintlock would ever fire in this wet fury two men struggled to his left and sharpe slid the sword into a blue jacket twisting it in the ribs and the frenchman threw himself sideways to escape the blade and sharpe saw it was harper hammering at the man with a rifle butt god save ireland harper wildeyed stared up at the french guarding the watchtower were going to charge those bastards sharpe shouted at the riflemen coming up behind god save ireland tirezl a french officer shouted and a dozen flints fell on steel and the sparks flashed and died in the rain now kill them sharpe roared just bloody kill them because the french were on his hilltop on his land and he felt a rage fit to match the anger of the stormfilled sky he ran uphill and the french muskets reached down with their long bayonets and sharpe remembered fighting on the steep breach at gawilghur and he did now what he had done then reached under the bayonet and grabbed a mans ankle and tugged the frenchman screamed as he was pulled down the hill to where three sword bayonets chopped at him and then vicentes portuguese realizing they could not shoot the french began hurling rocks at them and the big stones drew blood made men flinch and sharpe bellowed at his riflemen to close with the enemy he backswung the sword driving a bayonet aside pulled another musket with his left hand so that the man was tugged down onto harpers sword bayonet harris was flailing with an axe they had used to clear the path through the birch laurel and oak wood and the french shrank from the terrible weapon and still the rocks were hurled and sharpes riflemen snarling and panting were clawing their way upward a man kicked sharpe in the face cooper caught the boot and raked his sword bayonet up the mans leg harper was using his rifle as a club beating men down with his huge strength a rifleman fell backward blood pulsing from his throat to be instantly diluted by the rain a portuguese soldier took his place stabbing up with his bayonet and screaming insults sharpe rammed his sword twohanded up into the press of bodies stabbed twisted pulled and stabbed again another portuguese was beside him thrusting his bayonet up into a french groin while sergeant macedo lips drawn back in a snarl was fighting with a knife the blade flickered in the rain turned red was washed clean turned red again the french were going back retreating to the patch of bare stone terrace in front of the watchtower ruins and an officer was shouting angrily at them and then the officer came forward saber out and sharpe met him the blades clashed and sharpe just headbutted again and in the flash of lightning saw the astonishment on the officers face but the frenchman evidently came from the same school as sharpe for he tried to kick sharpes groin as he rammed his fingers at sharpes eyes sharpe twisted aside came back to hit the man on the jaw with the hilt of his sword then the officer just seemed to vanish as two of his men dragged him backward a tall french sergeant came at sharpe musket flailing and sharpe stepped back the man tripped and vicente reached out with his straightbladed sword and its tip ripped the sergeants windpipe so he roared like a punctured bellows and collapsed in a spray of pink rain vicente stepped back appalled but his men went streaming past to spread down into the southern redoubts where they enthusiastically bayoneted the french out of their holes sergeant macedo had left his knife trapped in a frenchmans chest and instead was using a french musket as a club and a voltigeur tried to pull the weapon out of his grasp and looked stunned when the sergeant just let him have it then kicked him in the belly so that the frenchman fell back over the edge of the bluff he screamed as he fell the scream seemed to last a long time then there was a wet thump on the rocks far below the musket clattered and the sound was swamped as thunder rolled over the sky the clouds were split by lightning and sharpe his sword blade dripping with raindiluted blood shouted at his men to check every redoubt and search the tower another bolt of lightning revealed a large group of frenchmen halfway up the southern path sharpe reckoned that a small group of fitter men had come on ahead and it was those men that he had encountered the largest group who could easily have held the summit against sharpe and vicentes desperate counterattack had been too late and vicente was now putting men into the lower redoubts a rifleman lay dead by the watchtower its sean donnelly harper said pity sharpe said a good man he was an evil little bastard from deny harper said who owed me four shillings he could shoot straight when he wasnt drunk harper allowed pendleton the youngest of the riflemen brought sharpe his shako found it on the slope sir what were you doing on the slope when you should have been fighting harper demanded pendleton looked worried i just found it sir did you kill anyone harper wanted to know no sergeant not earned your bloody shilling today then have you right pendleton williamson dodd sims harper organized a group to go back down the hill and bring up the discarded packs and food sharpe had another two men strip the dead and wounded of their weapons and ammunition vicente had garrisoned the southern side of the fort and the sight of his men was enough to deter the french from trying a second assault the portuguese lieutenant now came back to join sharpe beside the watchtower where the wind shrieked on the broken stone the rain was slackening but the stronger wind gusts still drove drops hard against the ruined walls what do we do about the village vicente wanted to know theres nothing we can do there are women down there children i know we cant just leave them what do you want us to do sharpe asked go down there rescue them and while were there what happens up here those bastards take the hill he pointed at the french voltigeurs who were still halfway up the hill uncertain whether to keep climbing or to give up the attempt and when you get down there sharpe went on what are you going to find dragoons hundreds of bloody dragoons and when the last of your men are dead youll have the satisfaction of knowing you tried to save the village he saw the stubbornness on vicentes face theres nothing you can do we have to try vicente insisted you want to take some men on patrol then do it but the rest of us stay up here this place is our one chance of staying alive vicente shivered you will not keep going south we get off this hill sharpe said and were going to have dragoons giving us haircuts with their bloody swords were trapped lieutenant were trapped you will let me take a patrol down to the village three men sharpe said he was reluctant to let even three men go with vicente but he could see that the portuguese lieutenant was desperate to know what was happening to his countrymen stay in cover lieutenant sharpe advised stay in the trees go very carefully vicente was back three hours later there were simply too many dragoons and bluejacketed infantry around vila real de zedes and he had got nowhere near the village but i heard screams he said aye sharpe said you would have done beneath him beyond the quinta the remnants of the village church burned out in the dark damp night it was the only light he could see there were no stars no candles no lamps just the sullen red glow of the burning church and tomorrow sharpe knew the french would come for him again in the morning the french officers had breakfast on the terrace of the tavern beneath a vine trellis the village had proved to be full of food and there was newly baked bread ham eggs and coffee for breakfast the rain had gone to leave a damp feel in the wind but there were shadows in the fields and the promise of warm sunlight in the air the smoke of the burnedout church drifted northwards taking with it the stench of roasted flesh maria the redheaded girl served colonel christopher his coffee the colonel was picking his teeth with a sliver of ivory but he took it from his mouth to thank her obrigado maria he said in a pleasant tone maria shuddered but nodded a hasty acknowledgment as she backed away shes replaced your servant brigadier vuillard asked the wretched fellows missing christopher said runaway gone a fair exchange vuillard said watching maria that ones much prettier she was pretty christopher allowed marias face was badly bruised now and the bruises had swollen to spoil her beauty and shell be pretty again he went on you hit her hard vuillard said with a hint of reproach christopher sipped his coffee the english have a saying brigadier a spaniel a woman and a walnut tree the more theyre beaten the better they be a walnut tree they say if the trunk is well thrashed it increases the yield of nuts i have no idea if its true but i do know that a woman has to be broken like a dog or a horse broken vuillard repeated the word he was rather in awe of christophers sangfroid the stupid girl resisted me christopher explained she put up a fight so i taught her who is master every woman needs to be taught that even a wife especially a wife christopher said though the process might be slower you dont break a good mare quickly but take your time but this onehe jerked his head toward mariathis one needed a damned fast whipping i dont mind if she resents me but one doesnt want a wife to be soured by resentment maria was not the only one with a bruised face major dulong had a black mark across the bridge of his nose and a scowl just as dark he had reached the watchtower before the british and portuguese troops but with a smaller group of men and then he had been surprised by the ferocity with which the enemy had attacked him let me go back mon general he pleaded with vuillard of course dulong of course vuillard did not blame the voltigeur officer for the nights only failure it seemed that the british and portuguese troops whom everyone had expected to find in the quintas stables had decided to go south and thus had been halfway to the watchtower when the attack began but major dulong was not accustomed to failure and the repulse on the hilltop had hurt his pride of course you can go back the brigadier reassured him but not straightaway i think we shall let les belles filles have their wicked way with them first yes les belles filles christopher asked wondering why on earth vuillard would send girls up to the watchtower the emperors name for his cannon vuillard explained les belles filles theres a battery at valengo and they must have a brace of howitzers im sure the gunners will be pleased to lend us their toys arent you a day of target practice and those idiots on the hill will be as broken as your redhead the brigadier watched as the girls brought out the food i shall look at their target after weve eaten perhaps you will do me the honor of lending me your telescope of course christopher pushed the glass across the table but take care of it my dear vuillard its rather precious to me vuillard examined the brass plate and knew just enough english to decipher its meaning who is this aw sir arthur wellesley of course and why would he be grateful to you you couldnt possibly expect a gentleman to answer a question like that my dear vuillard it would be boasting suffice it to say that i did not merely black his boots christopher smiled modestly then helped himself to eggs and bread two hundred dragoons rode the short journey back to valengo they escorted an officer who carried a request for a pair of howitzers and the officer and the dragoons returned that same morning with one howitzer only but that vuillard was certain would be enough the riflemen were doomed chapter what you really wanted lieutenant pelletieu said was a mortar a mortar brigadier general vuillard was astonished at the lieutenants selfconfidence you are telling me what i want what you want pelletieu said confidently is a mortar its a question of elevation sir it is a question lieutenantvuillard put a deal of stress on pelletieus lowly rankof pouring death shit horror and damnation on those impudent bastards on that goddamned hilltop he pointed to the watchtower he was standing at the edge of the wood where he had invited lieutenant pelletieu to unlimber his howitzer and start slaughtering dont talk to me of elevation talk to me of killing killing is our business sir the lieutenant said quite unmoved by the brigadiers anger but i do have to get closer to the impudent bastards he was a very young man so young that vuillard wondered whether pelletieu had even begun to shave he was also thin as a whip so thin that his white breeches white waistcoat and darkblue cutaway coat hung on him like discarded garments draped on a scarecrow a long skinny neck jutted from the stiff blue collar and his long nose supported a pair of thicklensed spectacles that gave him the unfortunate appearance of a halfstarved fish but he was a remarkablv selfpossessed fish who now turned to his sergeant two pounds at twelve degrees dont you think but only if we can get to within three hundred and fifty toise toise the brigadier knew gunners used the old unit of measurement but it meant nothing to him why the hell dont you speak french man three hundred and fifty toise call that pelletieu paused and frowned as he did the mathematics six hundred and eighty meters his sergeant as thin pale and young as pelletieu broke in six hundred and eightytwo pelletieu said cheerfully three fifty toise the sergeant mused aloud twopound charge twelve degrees i think that will serve sir only just though pelletieu said then turned back to the brigadier the targets high sir he explained i know its high vuillard said in a dangerous tone it is what we call a hill and everyone believes howitzers can work miracles on elevated targets pelletieu went on disregarding vuillards sarcasm but theyre not really designed to be angled at much more than twelve degrees from the horizontal now a mortar of course can achieve a much higher angle but i suspect the nearest mortar is at oporto i just want the bastards dead vuillard growled then turned back as a memory occurred to him and why not a threepound charge the gunners were using threepound charges at austerlitz he was tempted to add before you were born but restrained himself three pounds pelletieu audibly sucked in his breath while his sergeant rolled his eyes at the brigadiers display of ignorance shes a nantes barrel sir pelletieu added in gnomic explanation as he patted the howitzer she was made in the dark ages sir before the revolution and she was horribly cast her partner blew up three weeks ago sir and killed two of the crew there was an air bubble in the metal just horrible casting shes not safe beyond two pounds sir just not safe howitzers were usually deployed in pairs but the explosion three weeks before had left pelletieus the sole howitzer in his battery it was a strangelooking weapon that resembled a toy gun incongruously perched on a fullscale carriage the barrel just twentyeight inches long was mounted between wheels that were the height of a man but the small weapon was capable of doing what other field guns could not achieve it could fire in a high arc field guns were rarely elevated more than a degree or two and their round shot flew in a flat trajectory but the howitzer tossed its shells up high so that they plunged down onto the enemy the guns were designed to fire over defensive walls or above the heads of friendly infantry and because a lobbed missile came to a swift stop when it landed the howitzers did not fire solid round shot an ordinary field gun firing solid shot could depend on the missile to bounce and keep on bouncing and even after the fourth or fifth graze as the gunners called each bounce the round shot could still maim or kill but a round shot tossed into the air was likely to bury itself in the turf and do no subsequent damage so the howitzers fired shells that were fused to explode when the missile landed fortynine times two sir seeing as how we have the caisson for the other howitzer as well pelletieu said when vuillard asked him how many shells his gun possessed ninetyeight shells sir and twentytwo canister twice the usual rations forget the canister vuillard ordered canister which spread from a guns barrel like duck shot was for use against troops in the open not for infantry concealed amongst rocks drop the shells on the bastards and well send for more ammunition if you need it which you wont he added malevolently because youre going to kill the bastards arent you thats what were here for pelletieu said happily and with respect sir we wont make widows by standing here talking id best find a place to deploy her sir sergeant shovels shovels vuillard asked we have to level the ground sir pelletieu said because god didnt think of gunners when he made the world he made too many lumps and not enough smooth spots but were very good at improving his handiwork sir he led his men toward the hill in search of a place that could be leveled colonel christopher had been inspecting the howitzer but now nodded at pelletieus receding back sending schoolboys to fight our wars he seems to know his business vuillard admitted grudgingly did your servant turn up bloody mans gone missing had to shave myself shave yourself eh vuillard observed with amusement life is hard colonel life is sometimes so very hard and soon he thought it would be murderous for the fugitives on the hill at dawn a wet dawn with clouds scudding away southeast and a wind still gusting about the ragged summit dodd had spotted the fugitives halfway down the hills northern slope they were crouching in the rocks evidently hiding from the french picquets who lined the edge of the wood there were seven all men six had been survivors from manuel lopess band and the seventh was luis christophers servant it is the colonel he had told sharpe what is colonel christopher he is down there he brought them here he told them you were here sharpe stared down toward the village where a black smear showed where the church had stood hes a bastard he said quietly but he was not surprised not now he only blamed himself for being so slow to see that christopher was a traitor he questioned luis further and the servant told him about the journey south to meet general cradock about the dinner party in oporto where a french general had been the guest of honor and how christopher sometimes wore an enemy uniform but luis honestly admitted he did not know what webs the colonel spun he did know that christopher possessed sharpes good telescope and luis had managed to steal the colonels old telescope which he presented to sharpe with a triumphant flourish i am sorry it is not your own senhor but the colonel keeps that one in his tail pocket i fight for you now luis said proudly have you ever fought sharpe asked a man can learn luis said and there is no one better than a barber for slitting throats i used to think about that when i shaved my customers how easy it would be to cut i never did of course he added hastily in case sharpe thought he was a murderer i think ill go on shaving myself sharpe said with a smile so vicente gave luis one of the captured french muskets and a cartridge box of ammunition and the barber joined the other soldiers among the redoubts that barricaded the hilltop lopess men were sworn in as loyal portuguese soldiers and when one said he would rather take his chances on escape and join the partisan groups to the north sergeant macedo used his fists to force the oath on him hes a good lad that sergeant harper said approvingly the damp lifted the sodden flanks of the hill steamed in the morning sun but that haze vanished as the morning became hotter there were dragoons all about the hogbacked hill now they patrolled the valleys on either side had another strong picquet to the south and dismounted men watching from the woods edge sharpe seeing the dragoons tighten their noose knew that if he and his men tried to escape they would become meat for the horsemen harper his broad face glistening with sweat gazed down at the cavalry theres something ive noticed sir he said ever since we joined up with you in spain whats that that were always outnumbered and surrounded sharpe had been listening not to harper but to the day itself notice anything he asked that were surrounded and outnumbered sir no sharpe paused to listen again then frowned winds in the east isnt it more or less no sound of gunfire pat harper listened good god and youre right sir vicente had noticed the same thing and came to the watchtower where sharpe had set up his command post theres no noise from amarante the portuguese lieutenant said unhappily so theyve finished fighting there harper commented vicente made the sign of the cross which was admission enough that he suspected the portuguese army that had been holding the bridge over the tamega had been defeated we dont know whats happening sharpe said trying to cheer vicente up but in truth that admission was almost as depressing as the thought that amarante had fallen so long as the distant thunder of the guns had sounded from the east then so long had they known there were still forces fighting the french had known that the war itself was continuing and that there was hope that one day they could rejoin some friendly forces but the mornings silence was ominous and if the portuguese were gone from amarante then what of the british in coimbra and lisbon were they boarding ships in the broad mouth of the tagus ready to be convoyed home sir john moores army had been chased out of spain so was the smaller british force in lisbon now scuttling away sharpe felt a sudden and horrid fear that he was the last british officer in northern portugal and the last morsel to be devoured by an insatiable enemy it doesnt mean anything he lied seeing the same fear of being stranded on his companions faces sir arthur wellesleys coming we hope harper said is he good vicente asked the very bloody best sharpe said fervently and then seeing that his words had not really encouraged hope he made harper busy all the food that had been brought up to the watchtower had been stored in one corner of the ruin where sharpe could keep an eye on it but the men had taken no breakfast so he had harper supervise the distribution give them hunger rations sergeant he ordered for god alone knows how long well be up here vicente followed sharpe onto the small terrace outside the watchtower entrance from where he stared at the distant dragoons he looked distracted and began fiddling with a scrap of the white piping that decorated his darkblue uniform and the more he fidgeted the more piping was stripped away from his jacket yesterday he suddenly blurted out yesterday was the first time that i killed a man with a sword he frowned as he pulled another inch or two of the piping from his jackets hem a hard thing to do especially with a sword like that sharpe said nodding at vicentes scabbard the portuguese officers sword was slim straight and not particularly robust it was a sword for parades for show not for gutter fights in the rain now a sword like thissharpe patted the heavy cavalry sword that hung from his beltbatters the bastards down it dont cut them to death so much as it bludgeons them you could batter an ox to death with this blade get yourself a cavalry sword jorge theyre made for killing infantry officers swords are for dance floors i mean it was difficult to look in his eyes vicente explained and still use the blade i know what you mean sharpe said but its still the best thing to do what you want to do is to watch the sword or bayonet isnt it but if you keep watching their eyes you can tell what theyre going to do next by where they look never look at the place youre going to hit them though keep looking at their eyes and just hit vicente realized he was stripping the piping from his jacket and tucked the errant length into a buttonhole when i shot my own sergeant he said it seemed unreal like theater even but he was not trying to kill me that man last night it was frightening bloody well ought to be frightening sharpe responded a fight like that in the rain and dark anything can happen you just go in fast and dirty jorge do the damage and keep on doing it you have done so much fighting vicente said sadly as though he pitied sharpe ive been a soldier for a long time sharpe said and our army does a lot of fighting india flanders here denmark denmark why were you fighting in denmark god knows sharpe said something about their fleet we wanted it they didnt want us to have it so we went and took it he was gazing down the northern slope at a group of a dozen frenchmen who had stripped to the waist and now began to shovel at a patch of ferns a hundred yards from the edge of the wood he took out the replacement telescope luis had brought him it was little more than a toy and the outer lens was loose which meant it kept blurring and it was only half as powerful as his own glass but he supposed it was better than nothing he focused the glass steadied the outer lens with a fingertip and stared at the french work party shit he said what bastards have got a cannon sharpe said just pray it isnt a bloody mortar vicente looking bewildered was trying and failing to see a gun what happens if its a mortar we all die sharpe said imagining the potlike gun lobbing its shells into the sky so that they would drop almost vertically onto his position we all die he said again or else we run away and get captured vicente made the sign of the cross again he had not made that gesture at all in the first weeks sharpe had known him but the further vicente traveled from his life as a lawyer the more the old imperatives returned to him life he was beginning to learn was not controlled by law or reason but by luck and savagery and blind unfeeling fate i cant see a cannon he finally admitted sharpe pointed to the french working party those buggers are making a nice flat patch so they can aim properly he explained you cant fire a gun on a slope not if you want to be accurate he took a few steps down the northern path dan sir see where the bastards are going to put a cannon how far away is it hagman ensconced in a crevice of stone peered down bit under seven hundred paces sir too far we can try hagman shrugged i can try but maybe save it for later sharpe nodded better to reveal the rifles range to the french when things were more desperate vicente again looked bewildered so sharpe explained a rifle bullet can carry that far but it would take a genius to be accurate dans close to genius he thought about taking a small party of riflemen halfway down the slope and he knew that at three or four hundred yards they could do a lot of damage to a gun crew but the gun crew at that range would answer them with canister and though the lower slope of the hill was littered with rocks few were of a size to shelter a man from canister sharpe would lose soldiers if he went down the hill he would do it he decided if the gun turned out to be a mortar for mortars never carried canister but the french were bound to answer his foray with a strong skirmish line of infantry stroke and counterstroke it felt frustrating all he could do was pray the gun was not a mortar it was not a mortar an hour after the working party began making a level platform the cannon appeared and sharpe saw it was a howitzer that was bad enough but it gave his men a chance for a howitzer shell would come at an oblique angle and his men would be safe behind the bigger boulders on the hilltop vicente borrowed the small telescope and watched the french gunners unlimber the gun and prepare its ammunition a caisson its long coffinlike lid cushioned so that the gun crew could travel on it was being opened and the powder bags and shells piled by the leveled ground it looks like a very small gun vicente said doesnt have to be longbarrelled sharpe explained because it isnt a precision gun it just lobs shells on us itll be noisy but well survive he said that to cheer vicente up but he was not as confident as he sounded two or three lucky shells could decimate his command but at least the howitzers arrival had taken his mens minds off their larger predicament and they watched as the gunners made ready a small flag had been placed fifty paces in front of the howitzer presumably so the gun captain could judge the wind which would tend to drift the shells westward sure enough sharpe saw them edge the howitzers trail to compensate and then watched through the telescope as the quoins were hammered under the stubby barrel field guns were usually elevated with a screw but howitzers used the oldfashioned wooden wedges sharpe reckoned the skinny officer who supervised the gun must be using his largest wedges straining to get maximum elevation so that his shells would drop into the rocks on the hills summit the first powder bags were being brought to the weapon and sharpe saw the flash of reflected sunlight glance off steel and he knew the officer must be trimming the shells fuse under cover sergeant sharpe shouted every man had a place to go to a place that was well protected by the great boulders most of the riflemen were in the redoubts walled with stone but half a dozen including sharpe and harper were inside the old watchtower where a stairway had once led to the ramparts only four of the steps were left and they merely climbed to a gaping cavity in the stonework of the northern wall and sharpe positioned himself there so he could see what the french were doing the gun vanished in a cloud of smoke followed a heartbeat later by the massive boom of the exploding powder sharpe tried to find the missile in the sky then saw the tiny wavering trail of smoke left by the burning fuse then came the sound of the shell a thunder rolling overhead and the smoke trail whipped only a couple of feet above the ruined watchtower everyone had been holding their breath but now let it out as the shell exploded somewhere above the southern slope cut his fuse too long harper said he wont next time tongue said daniel hagman whitefaced sat against the wall with his eyes closed vicente and most of his men were a little way down the slope where they were protected by a boulder the size of a house nothing could reach them directly but if a shell bounced off the face of the watchtower it would probably fall among them sharpe tried not to think of that he had done his best and he knew he could not provide absolute safety for every man they waited get on with it harris said harper crossed himself sharpe looked through the hole in the wall and saw the gunner carrying the portfire to the barrel he said nothing to the men for the noise of the gun would be warning enough and he was not looking down the hill to see when the howitzer was fired but the moment when the french put in an infantry attack that seemed the obvious thing for them to do fire the howitzer to keep the british and portuguese heads down and then send their infantry to make an assault but sharpe saw no sign of any such attack the dragoons were keeping their distance the infantry was out of sight and the gunners just kept working shell after shell arced to the hilltop after the first shot the fuses were cut to the precise length and the shells cracked on rocks fell and exploded monotonously steadily shot after shot and each explosion sent shards of hot iron crackling and whistling through the jumble of boulders on the hilltop yet the french seemed unaware of how much shelter the boulders provided the summit stank of powder the smoke drifted like mist through the rocks and clung to the lichencovered stones of the watchtower but miraculously no one was badly hurt one of vicentes men was struck by a sliver of iron that cut his upper arm but that was the only casualty yet even so the men hated the ordeal they sat hunched counting down the shots that came at a regular pace one a minute and the seconds stretched between each one and no one spoke and each shot was a boom from the base of the hill a crash or thump as the shell struck the ragged explosion of the powder charge and the shriek of its fragmented casing one shell failed to explode and they all waited breathless as the seconds passed and then realized that its fuse must have been faulty how many bloody shells do they have harper asked after a quarterhour no one could answer sharpe had a vague recollection that a british sixpounder carried more than a hundred rounds of ammunition in its limber caisson and axle boxes but he was not sure of that and french practice was probably different so he said nothing instead he prowled round the hilltop going from the tower to the men in the redoubts and then watching anxiously down the other flanks of the hill and still there was no sign that the french contemplated an assault he went back to the tower hagman had produced a small wooden flute something he had whittled himself during his convalescence and now he played trills and snatches of old familiar melodies the scraps of music sounded like birdsong then the hilltop would reverberate to the next explosion the shell fragments would batter against the tower and as the brutal sound faded so the flutes breathy sound would reemerge i always wanted to play the flute sharpe said to no one in particular the fiddle harris said ive always wanted to play the fiddle hard that harper said because its fiddly they groaned and harper grinned proudly sharpe was mentally counting the seconds imagining the gun being pushed back into place and then being sponged out the gunners thumb over the touchhole to stop the rush of air forced by the incoming sponge from setting fire to any unexploded powder in the breech when every lingering scrap of fire had been extinguished inside the barrel they would thrust home the powder bags then the sixinch shell with its carefully cut fuse protruding from the wooden bung and the gunner would ram a spike down the touchhole to pierce a canvas powder bag and afterward push a reed filled with more powder down into the punctured bag they would stand back cover their ears and the gunner would touch the linstock to the reed and just then sharpe heard the boom and almost instantly there was an almighty crash inside the tower itself and he realized the shell had come right through the hole at the top of the truncated staircase and now it fell down fuse smoking in a wild spiral to lodge between two of the packs that held their food and sharpe stared at it saw the wisp of smoke shivering upward knew they must all die or be terribly maimed when it exploded and he did not think just dived he scrabbled at the fuse knew he was too late to extract it and so he dropped onto the shell his belly smothering it and his mind was screaming because he did not want to die it will be quick he thought it will be quick and at least he would not have to make decisions any more and no one else would be hurt and he cursed the shell because it was taking so long to explode and he was staring at daniel hagman who was staring back at him eyes wide and the forgotten flute held just an inch from his mouth stay there much longer harper said in a voice that could not quite hide the strain he was feeling and youll hatch the bloody thing hagman started to laugh then harris and cooper and harper joined in and sharpe climbed off the shell and saw that the wooden plug that held the fuse was blackened by fire but somehow the fuse had gone out and he picked up the damned missile and hurled it out of the hole and listened to it clatter down the hill sweet jesus sharpe said he was sweating shaking he collapsed back against the wall and looked at his men who were weak with laughter oh god he said youd have had a bellyache if that had popped sir hagman said and that started them all laughing again sharpe felt drained if you bastards have nothing better to do he said then take out the canteens give everyone a drink he was rationing the water like the food but the day was hot and he knew everyone would be dry he followed the riflemen outside vicente who had no idea what had just happened but only knew that a second shell had failed to explode looked anxious what happened fuse went out sharpe said just went out he went down to the northernmost redoubts and stared at the gun how much bloody ammunition did the bastards have the rate of fire had slowed a little but that seemed more to do with the gunners weariness than a shortage of shells he watched them load another round did not bother to take cover and the shell exploded up behind the watchtower the howitzer had recoiled eight or nine feet much less than a field gun and he watched as the gunners put their shoulders to the wheel and shoved it back into place the air between sharpe and the gun wavered because of the days heat which was made more intense by a small grass fire ignited by the cannons blast that had been happening all day and the howitzers muzzle flame had left a fanshaped patch of scorched grass and ferns in front of the barrel and then sharpe saw something else something that puzzled him and he opened christophers small telescope cursing the loss of his own and he steadied the barrel on a rock and stared intently and saw that an officer was crouching beside the gun wheel with an upraised hand that odd pose had been what puzzled him why would a man crouch by the front of a guns wheels and sharpe could just see something else shadows the ground there had been cleared but the sun was now low in the sky and it was throwing long shadows and sharpe could see that the cleared ground had been marked with two halfburied stones each maybe the size of a twelvepounders round shot and that the officer was bringing the wheels right up to the two stones when the wheels touched the stones he dropped his hand and the men went about the business of reloading sharpe frowned thinking now why on a fine sunny day would the french artillery officer need to mark a place for his guns wheels the wheels themselves ironrimmed would leave gouges in the soil that would serve as markers for when the gun was repositioned after each shot yet they had taken the trouble to put the stones there as well he ducked down behind the wall as another blossom of smoke heralded a shell this one fell fractionally short and the jaggededged iron scraps rattled against the low stone walls that sharpes men had built pendleton poked his head above the redoubt why dont they use round shot sir he asked howitzers dont have round shot sharpe said and its hard to fire a proper gun uphill he was brusque for he was wondering about those stones why put them there had he imagined them but when he looked through the glass he could still see them then he saw the gunners walk away from the howitzer a score of infantrymen had appeared but they were merely a guard for the gun which was otherwise abandoned theyre having their supper harper suggested he had brought water for the men in the forward positions and now sat beside sharpe for a moment he looked embarrassed then grinned that was a brave thing you did sir youd have done the bloody same i bloody wouldnt harper said vehemently id have been out of that bloody door like a scalded cat if my legs had bloody worked he saw the deserted gun so its over for the day he asked no sharpe said because he suddenly understood why the stones were there and knew what he could do about it brigadier vuillard ensconced in the quinta poured himself a glass of savages finest white port his blue uniform jacket was unhooked and he had eased a button of his breeches to make space for the fine shoulder of mutton that he had shared with christopher a dozen officers and three women the women were french though certainly not wives and one of them whose golden hair glinted in the candlelight had been seated next to lieutenant pelletieu who seemed unable to take his bespectacled eyes from a cleavage that was deep soft shadowed and streaked where sweat had made rivulets through the white powder on her skin her very presence had struck pelletieu almost dumb so that all the confidence he had shown on first meeting vuillard had fled the brigadier amused by the womans effect on the artillery officer leaned forward to accept a candle from major dulong that he used to light a cigar it was a warm night the windows were open and a big pale moth fluttered about the candelabra at the tables center is it true vuillard asked christopher between the puffs that were needed to get the cigar properly alight that in england the women are expected to leave the supper table before the cigars are lit respectable women yes christopher took the toothpick from his mouth to answer even respectable women i would have thought make attractive companions to a good smoke and a glass of port vuillard content that the cigar was drawing properly leaned back and glanced down the table i have an idea he said genially that i know precisely who is going to answer the next question what time is first light tomorrow there was a pause as the officers glanced at each other then pelletieu blushed sunrise sir he said will be at twenty minutes past four but it will be light enough to see at ten minutes to four so clever the blond who was called annette whispered to him and the moon state vuillard asked pelletieu blushed an even deeper red no moon to speak of sir the last full moon was on the thirtieth of april and the next will be his voice faded away as he became aware that the others about the table were amused by his erudition do go on lieutenant vuillard said on the twentyninth of this month sir so its a waxing moon in its first quarter sir and very slight no illumination in it not now i like a dark night annette whispered to him youre a veritable walking encyclopaedist lieutenant vuillard said so tell me what damage your shells did today very little sir im afraid pelletieu almost overwhelmed by annettes perfume looked as though he was about to faint that summit is prodigiously protected by boulders sir if they kept their heads down sir then they should have survived mostly intact though im sure we killed one or two only one or two pelletieu looked abashed we needed a mortar sir vuillard smiled when a man lacks instruments lieutenant he uses what he has to hand isnt that right annette he smiled then took a fat watch from his waistcoat pocket and snapped open the lid how many rounds of shell do you have left thirtyeight sir dont use them all at once vuillard said then raised an eyebrow in mock surprise dont you have work to do lieutenant he asked the work was to fire the howitzer through the night so that the ragged forces on the hilltop would get no sleep then an hour before first light the gunfire would stop and vuillard reckoned the enemy would all be asleep when his infantry attacked pelletieu scraped his chair back of course sir and thank you sir thank you for the supper sir vuillard made a gracious gesture of acceptance im just sorry lieutenant that you cant stay for the entertainment im sure mademoiselle annette would have liked to hear about your charges your rammer and your sponge she would sir pelletieu asked surprised go lieutenant vuillard said just go the lieutenant fled pursued by the sound of laughter and the brigadier shook his head god knows where we find them he said we must pluck them from their cradles wipe the mothers milk from their lips and send them to war still young pelletieu knows his business he dangled the watch on its chain for a second then thrust it into a pocket first light at ten minutes to four major he spoke to dulong well be ready dulong said he looked sour the failure of the previous nights attack still galling him the bruise on his face was dark ready and rested i hope vuillard said well be ready dulong said again vuillard nodded but kept his watchful eyes on the infantry major amarante is taken he said which means some of loisons men can return to oporto with luck major that means we shall have enough force to march south on lisbon i hope so sir dulong answered uncertain where the conversation was going but general heudelets division is still clearing the road to vigo vuillard went on foys infantry is scouring the mountains of partisans so our forces will still be stretched major stretched even if we get delabordes brigades back from general loison and even with lorgess dragoons we shall be stretched if we want to march on lisbon im sure well succeed all the same dulong said loyally but we need every man we can muster major every man and i do not want to detach valuable infantry to guard prisoners there was silence round the table dulong gave a small smile as he understood the implications of the brigadiers words but he said nothing do i make myself clear major vuillard asked in a harder tone you do sir dulong said bayonets fixed then vuillard said tapping ash from his cigar and use them major use them well dulong looked up his grim face unreadable no prisoners sir he did not inflect the words as a question that sounds like a very good idea vuillard said smiling now go and get some sleep major dulong left and vuillard poured more port war is cruel he said sententiously but cruelty is sometimes necessary the rest of youhe looked at the officers on both sides of the tablecan ready yourselves for the march back to oporto we should have this business finished by eight tomorrow morning so shall we set a march time of ten oclock for by then the watchtower on the hill would have fallen the howitzer would keep sharpes men awake by firing through the night and in the dawn as the tired men fought off sleep and a wolfgray light seeped across the worlds rim dulongs welltrained infantry would go in for the kill at dawn sharpe had watched till the very last seep of twilight had gone from the hill until there was nothing but bleak darkness and only then with pendleton tongue and harris as his companions he edged past the outer stone wall and felt his way down the path harper had wanted to come had even been upset at not being allowed to accompany sharpe but harper would need to command the riflemen if sharpe did not come back sharpe would have liked to take hagman but the old man was still not fully mended and so he had gone with pendleton who was young agile and cunning and with tongue and harris who were both good shots and both intelligent each of them carried two rifles but sharpe had left his big cavalry sword with harper for he knew that the heavy metal scabbard was likely to knock on stones and so betray his position it was hard slow work going down the hill there was a thin suggestion of a moon but stray clouds continually covered it and even when it showed clearly it had no power to light their path and so they felt their way down saying nothing groping ahead for each step and thereby making more noise than sharpe liked but the night was full of noises insects the sigh of the wind across the hills flank and the distant cry of a vixen hagman would have coped better sharpe thought for he moved through the dark with the grace of a poacher while all four of the riflemen going down the hills long slope were from towns pendleton sharpe knew was from bristol where he had joined the army rather than face transportation for being a pickpocket tongue like sharpe came from london but sharpe could not remember where harris had grown up and when they stopped to catch their breath and search the darkness for any hint of light sharpe asked him lichfield sir harris whispered where samuel johnson came from johnson sharpe could not quite place the name is he in the first battalion very much so sir harris whispered and then they went on and as the slope became less steep and they accustomed themselves to this blind journey they became quieter sharpe was proud of them they might not have been born to such a task as hagman had but they had become stalkers and killers they wore the green jacket and then after what seemed like an hour since they had left the watchtower sharpe saw what he expected to see a glimmer of light just a glimmer that swiftly vanished but it was yellow and he knew it came from a screened lantern and that someone a gunner probably had drawn back the screen to throw a small wash of light and then there was another light this one red and tiny and sharpe knew it was the howitzers portfire down he whispered he watched the tiny red glow it was further away than he would have liked but there was plenty of time close your eyes he hissed they closed their eyes and a moment later the gun crashed its smoke flame and shell into the night and sharpe heard the missile trundle overhead and he saw a dull light on his closed eyelids then he opened his eyes and could see nothing for a few seconds he could smell the gunsmoke though and he saw the red portfire move as the gunner put it aside on he said and they crept on down the hill and the screened lantern blinked again as the gun crew pushed the howitzers wheels back to the two stones which marked the place where they could be sure that despite the darkness the gun would be accurate that was the realization that had come to sharpe at sunset the reason why they had marked the ground because in the night the french gunners needed an easy method for realigning the howitzer and the two big stones made better markers than gouges in the soil so he had known this night firing was going to happen and knew exactly what he could do about it it was a long time before the howitzer fired again and by then sharpe and his men were two hundred paces away and not much higher than the gun sharpe had expected the second shot much sooner then he realized that the gunners would probably space their shells through the short night to keep his men awake and that would mean a long time between shots harris tongue he whispered off to the right if you get into trouble get the hell back up to harper pendleton come on he led the youngster away to the left crouching as he moved feeling his way through the rocks until he reckoned he had gone about fifty paces from the path and then he settled pendleton behind a boulder and positioned himself behind a low gorse bush you know what to do yes sir so enjoy it sharpe was enjoying himself it surprised him to realize it but he was there was a joy in thus foxing the enemy though perhaps the enemy had expected what was about to happen and was ready for it but this was no time to worry just time to spread some confusion and he waited and waited until he was certain he was wrong and that the gunners would not fire again and then the whole night was split apart by a tongue of white flame bright and long that was immediately swallowed by the cloud of smoke and sharpe had a sudden glimpse of the gun bucking back on its trail its big wheels spinning a foot high in the air and then his night vision was gone seared from his eyes by the bright stab of fire and he waited again only this time it was just a few seconds before he saw the yellow glow of the unshielded lantern and he knew the gunners were manhandling the howitzers wheels toward the stones he aimed at the lantern his vision was smeared by the aftereffects of the fire but he could see the square of lamplight clearly enough he was just about to squeeze the trigger when one of his men on the right of the path fired and the lantern was dropped its shielding fell away and sharpe could see two dark figures half lit by the new and brighter light he edged the rifle left and pulled the trigger heard pendleton fire then he snatched up the second rifle and aimed again into the pool of light a frenchman jumped forward to extinguish the lantern and three rifles one of them sharpes sounded at the same time and the man was snatched backward and sharpe heard a loud clang like a cracked bell ringing and knew one of the bullets had hit the howitzers barrel then the light went out come on sharpe called to pendleton and the two of them ran further to their left they could hear the french shouting one man gasping and moaning then a louder voice calling for silence down sharpe whispered and the two went to ground and sharpe began the laborious business of loading his two rifles in the dark he saw a small flame burning back where he and pendleton had been and he knew that the wadding from one of their rifles had started a small grass fire it flickered for a few seconds then he saw dark shapes nearby and guessed that the french infantry who had been guarding the gun were out looking for whoever had just fired the shots but the searchers found nothing trampled the small fire dead and went back to the trees there was another pause sharpe could hear the murmur of voices and reckoned the french were discussing what to do next the answer came soon enough when he heard the trampling of feet and he deduced that the infantry had been sent to scour the nearer hillside but in the dark they merely blundered through the ferns and cursed whenever they tripped on rocks or became entangled by gorse officers and sergeants snarled and snapped at the men who were too sensible to spread out and get lost or maybe ambushed in the darkness after a while they trailed back to the trees and there was another long wait though sharpe could hear the clatter of the howitzers rammer as it shoved and scraped the next shell home the french probably thought their attackers were gone he decided no shots had come for a long time and their own infantry had made a perfunctory search and the french were probably feeling safer for the gunner foolishly tried to revive the portfire by whipping it back and forth a couple of times until its tip glowed a brighter red he did not need the extra heat to light the reed in the touchhole but rather to see the touchhole and it was his death sentence for he then blew on the tip of the slow match held in the portfires jaws and either harris or tongue shot him and even sharpe jumped with surprise when the rifle shot blistered the night and he had a glimpse of flame far off to his right and then the french infantry were forming ranks the fallen portfire was snatched up and just as the howitzer fired so the muskets hammered a crude volley in the direction of tongue and harris and the grass fires started again one sprang up just in front of the howitzer and two smaller fires were ignited by the wadding of the french muskets sharpe his eyes still dazzled by the guns big flame nevertheless could see the crew heaving at the wheels and he slid the rifle forward he fired changed weapons and fired again aiming at the dark knot of men straining at the nearest gun wheel he saw one fall away pendleton fired two more shots came from the right and the grass fires were spreading and then the infantry realized that the flames were illuminating the gunners making them targets and they frantically stamped out the small fires but not before pendleton had fired his second rifle and sharpe saw another gunner spin away from the howitzer then a last shot came from tongue or harris before the flames were at last extinguished sharpe and pendleton went back fifty paces before reloading we hurt them that time sharpe said small groups of frenchmen emboldening themselves with loud shouts darted forward to search the slope again but again found nothing he stayed another halfhour fired four more times and then went back to the hilltop a journey which in the dark took almost two hours though it was easier than going down for there was just enough light in the sky to show the outline of the hill and the broken stub of the watchtower tongue and harris followed an hour later hissing the password up at the sentry before coming excitedly into the fort where they told the tale of their exploit the howitzer fired twice more during the night the first shot rattled the lower slope with canister and the second a shell cracked the night with flame and smoke just to the east of the watchtower no one got much sleep but sharpe would have been surprised if anyone had slept well after the days ordeal and just before dawn when the eastern edge of the world was a gray glow he went round to make sure everyone was awake harper was laying a fire beside the watchtower wall sharpe had forbidden any fires during the night for the flames would have given the french gunners an excellent aiming mark but now that the daylight was coming it would be safe to brew up some tea we can stay here forever harper had said so long as we can stew some tea sir but run out of tea and well have to surrender the gray streak in the east spread lightening at its base vicente shivered beside sharpe for the night had turned surprisingly cold you think theyre coming vicente asked theyre coming sharpe said he knew that the howitzers ammunition supply was not endless and there could only have been one reason to keep the gun working through the night and that was to fray his mens nerves so that they would be easy meat for a morning attack and that meant the french would come at dawn and the light grew wan and gray and pale as death and the tops of the highest clouds were already golden red as the light changed from gray to white and white to gold and gold to red and then the killing began sir mister sharpe i see them dark shapes melding into the dark shadows of the northern slope it was french infantry or perhaps dismounted dragoons coming to attack rifles make ready there were clicks as baker rifles were cocked your men dont fire understand sharpe said to vicente of course vicente said the muskets would be hopelessly inaccurate at anything more than sixty paces so sharpe would keep the portuguese volley as a final defense and let his riflemen teach the french the advantages of the seven lands and seven grooves twisting the quarter turn in the rifle barrels vicente was bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet betraying the nervousness he felt he fingered one end of his small mustache and licked his lips we wait till they reach that white rock yes yes sharpe said and why dont you shave that mustache off vicente stared at him why dont i shave my mustache he could scarcely believe his ears shave it off sharpe said youd look older less like a lawyer luis would do it for you he had successfully taken vicentes mind off his worries and now he looked east where a mist hung over the low ground no threat from there he reckoned and he had four of his riflemen watching the southern path but only four because he was fairly certain that the french would concentrate their troops on one side of the hill and once he was absolutely certain of that he would bring those four back across to the northern side and let a couple of vicentes men guard the southern path when youre ready lads sharpe called but dont fire high sharpe did not know it but the french were late dulong had wanted his men closed up on the summit approach before the horizon turned gray but it had taken longer than he anticipated to climb the dark slope and besides his men were befuddled and tired after a night of chasing phantoms except the phantoms were real and had killed one gunner wounded three more and put the fear of god into the rest of the artillery crew dulong ordered to take no prisoners felt some respect for the men he faced and then the massacre began it was a massacre the french had muskets the british had rifles and the french had to converge on the narrow ridge that climbed to the small summit plateau and once on the ridge they were easy meat for the rifles six men went down in the first few seconds and dulongs response was to lead the others on to overwhelm the fort with manpower but more rifles cracked more smoke drifted from the hilltop more bullets thumped home and dulong understood what he had only appreciated before through lectures the menace of a rifled barrel at a range where a full battalion musket volley was unlikely to kill a single man the british rifles were deadly the bullets he noticed made a different sound there was a barely detectable shriek in their whiplike menace the guns themselves did not cough like a musket but had a snap to their report and a man struck by a rifle bullet was thrown back further than he would have been by a musket ball dulong could see the riflemen now for they stood up in their rock pits to reload their damned guns ignoring the threat of the howitzers shells that sporadically arced over the french infantrys heads to explode on the crest dulong shouted at his men to fire at the greenjacketed enemy but the musket shots sounded feeble and the balls went wide and still the rifle shots slashed home and his men were reluctant to climb onto the narrow part of the ridge so dulong knowing that example was all and reckoning that a lucky man might possibly survive the rifle fire and reach the redoubts decided to set an example he shouted at his men to follow drew his saber and charged for france he cried for the emperor cease fire sharpe shouted not one man had followed dulong not one he came alone and sharpe recognized the frenchmans bravery and to show it he stepped forward and raised his sword in a formal salute dulong saw the salute checked and turned and saw he was alone he looked back to sharpe raised his own saber then sheathed it with a violent thrust that betrayed the disgust he felt at his mens reluctance to die for the emperor he nodded at sharpe then walked away and twenty minutes later the rest of the french were gone from the hill vicentes men had been formed in two ranks on the towers open terrace ready to fire a volley that had not been needed and two of them had been killed by a howitzer shell and another shell had slammed a piece of its casing into gatakers leg gouging a bloody path down his right thigh but leaving the bone unbroken sharpe had not even registered that the howitzer had been firing during the attack but it had stopped now the sun was fully risen and the valleys were flooded by light and sergeant harper his rifle barrel fouled by powder deposits and hot from firing had made the days first pot of tea chapter it was just before midday when a french soldier climbed the hill carrying a white flag of truce tied to the muzzle of his musket two officers accompanied him one in french infantry blue and the other colonel christopher in his red british uniform jacket with its black facings and cuffs sharpe and vicente went to meet the two officers who had advanced a dozen paces ahead of the glumlooking man with the white flag and vicente was forcibly struck by the resemblance between sharpe and the french infantry officer who was a tall blackhaired man with a scar on his right cheek and a bruise across the bridge of his nose his ragged blue uniform bore the greenfringed epaulettes that showed he was a light infantryman and his flared shako was fronted with a white metal plate stamped with the french eagle and the number the badge was surmounted by a plume of red and white feathers which looked new and fresh compared to the frenchmans stained and threadbare uniform well kill the frog first sharpe said to vicente because hes the dangerous bugger and then well fillet christopher slowly sharpe the lawyer in vicente was shocked theyre under a flag of truce they stopped a few paces from colonel christopher who took a toothpick from his lips and chucked it away how are you sharpe he asked genially then held up a hand to stay any answer give me a moment will you the colonel said and onehandedly clicked open a tinderbox struck a light and drew on a cigar when it was burning satisfactorily he closed the tinderboxs lid on the small flames and smiled fellow with me is called major dulong he dont speak a word of english but he wanted to have a look at you sharpe looked at dulong recognized him as the officer who had led so bravely up the hill and then felt sorry that a good man had climbed back up the hill alongside a traitor a traitor and a thief wheres my telescope he demanded of christopher back down the hill christopher said carelessly you can have it later he drew on the cigar and looked at the french bodies among the rocks brigadier vuillard has been a mite over eager wouldnt you say cigar please yourself the colonel sucked deep youve done well sharpe proud of you the st legerhe jerked his head toward dulongaint used to losing you showed the damn frogs how an englishman fights eh and how irishmen fight sharpe said and scots welsh and portuguese decent of you to remember the uglier breeds christopher said but its over now sharpe all over time to pack up and go frogs are offering you honors of war and all that march out with your guns shouldered your colors flying and let bygones be bygones they aint happy sharpe but i persuaded them sharpe looked at dulong again and he wondered if there was a look of warning in the frenchmans eyes dulong had said nothing but just stood a pace behind christopher and two paces to the side and sharpe suspected the major was distancing himself from christophers errand sharpe looked back to christopher you think im a damned fool dont you he retorted christopher ignored the comment i dont think youve time to reach lisbon cradock will be gone in a day or two and his army with him theyre going home sharpe back to england so probably the best thing for you to do is wait in oporto the french have agreed to repatriate all british citizens and a ship will probably be sailing from there within a week or two and you and your fellows can be aboard will you be aboard sharpe asked i very well might sharpe thank you for asking and if youll forgive me for sounding immodest i rather fancy i shall sail home to a heros welcome the man who brought peace to portugal there has to be a knighthood in that dont you think not that i care of course but im sure kate will enjoy being lady christopher if you werent under a flag of truce sharpe said id disembowel you here and now i know what youve been doing dinner parties with french generals bringing them here so they could snap us up youre a bloody traitor christopher nothing but a bloody traitor the vehemence of his tone brought a small smile to major dulongs grim face oh dear christopher looked pained oh dear me dear me he stared at a nearby french corpse for a few seconds then shook his head ill overlook your impertinence sharpe i suppose that damned servant of mine found his way to you he did thought as much luis has an unrivaled talent for misunderstanding circumstances he drew on his cigar then blew a plume of smoke that was whirled away on the wind i was sent here sharpe by his majestys government with instructions to discover whether portugal was worth fighting for whether it was worth an effusion of british blood and i concluded and ive no doubt you will disagree with me that it was not so i obeyed the second part of my remit which was to secure terms from the french not terms of surrender sharpe but of settlement we shall withdraw our forces and they will withdraw theirs though for forms sake they will be allowed to march a token division through the streets of lisbon then theyre going bonsoir adieu and au revoir by the end of july there will not be one foreign soldier remaining on portugals soil that is my achievement sharpe and it was necessary to dine with french generals french marshals and french officials to secure it he paused as if expecting some reaction but sharpe just looked skeptical and christopher sighed that is the truth sharpe however hard you may find it to believe but remember there are more things in i know sharpe interrupted more things in heaven and earth than i bloody know about but what the hell were you doing here his voice was angry now and youve been wearing a french uniform luis told me cant usually wear this red coat behind french lines sharpe christopher said and civilian clothes dont exactly command respect these days so yes i do sometimes wear a french uniform its a ruse de guerre sharpe a ruse de guerre a ruse of bloody nothing sharpe snarled those bastards have been trying to kill my men and you brought them here oh sharpe christopher said sadly we needed somewhere quiet to sign the memorandum of agreement some place where the mob could not express its crude opinions and so i offered the quinta i confess i did not consider your predicament as thoroughly as i should and that is my fault i am sorry he even offered sharpe the hint of a bow the french came here they deemed your presence a trap and against my advice attempted to attack you i apologize again sharpe most profusely but its over now you are free to leave you do not offer a surrender you do not yield your weapons you march out with your head held high and you will go with my sincerest congratulations and naturally i shall make quite certain that your colonel learns of your achievement here he waited for sharpes answer and when none came smiled and of course he went on i shall be honored to return your telescope i clean forgot to bring it with me just now you forgot nothing you bastard sharpe growled sharpe christopher said reprovingly try not to be brutish try to understand that diplomacy employs subtlety intelligence and yes deceit and try to understand that i have negotiated your freedom you may leave the hill in triumph shame stared into christophers face which seemed so guileless so pleased to be the bearer of this news and what happens if we stay he asked i have not the foggiest idea christopher said but of course i shall try to find out if that is indeed your wish but my guess sharpe is that the french will construe such stubbornness as a hostile gesture there are sadly folk in this country who will oppose our settlement they are misguided people who would prefer to fight rather than accept a negotiated peace and if you stay here then that encourages their foolishness my own suspicion is that if you insist upon staying and thus break the terms of our agreement the french will bring mortars from oporto and do their best to persuade you to leave he drew on the cigar then flinched as a raven pecked at the eyes of a nearby corpse major dulong would like to collect these men he gestured with the cigar toward the bodies left by sharpes riflemen hes got one hour sharpe said and he can bring ten men none of them armed and tell him some of my men will be on the hill and they wont be armed either christopher frowned why would your men need to be on the open hillside he asked because weve got to bury our dead sharpe said and its all rock up there christopher drew on the cigar i think it would be much better sharpe he said gently if you brought your men down now sharpe shook his head ill think about it he said youll think about it christopher repeated looking irritated now and how long might i ask will it take you to think about it as long as it takes sharpe said and i can be a very slow thinker you have one hour lieutenant christopher said precisely one hour he spoke in french to dulong who nodded at sharpe who nodded back then christopher threw away the halfsmoked cigar turned on his heel and went hes lying sharpe said vicente was less certain you can be sure of that ill tell you why im sure sharpe said the bugger didnt give me an order this is the army you dont suggest you order do this do that but he didnt hes given me orders before but not today vicente translated for the benefit of sergeant macedo who with harper had been invited to listen to sharpes report both sergeants like vicente looked troubled but they said nothing why vicente asked would he not give you an order because he wants me to walk off this hilltop of my own accord because whats going to happen down there isnt pretty because he was lying you cant be sure of that vicente said sternly sounding more like the lawyer he had been rather than the soldier he now was we cant be sure of bloody anything sharpe grumbled vicente looked into the east the guns have stopped at amarante maybe there is peace and why would there be peace sharpe asked why did the french come here in the first place to stop us trading with britain vicente said so why withdraw now the trading will start again they havent finished the job and it isnt like the french to give up so quick vicente thought for a few seconds perhaps they know they will lose too many men the further they go into portugal the more enemies they make and the longer the supply roads they have to protect perhaps they are being sensible theyre bloody frogs sharpe said they dont know the meaning of the word and theres something else christopher didnt show me any bits of paper did he no agreement signed and sealed vicente considered that argument then nodded to acknowledge its force if you like he said i will go down and ask to see the paper there isnt a piece of paper sharpe said and none of us are going off this hilltop vicente paused is that an order senhor that is an order sharpe said were staying then we stay vicente said he clapped macedo on the shoulder and the two went back to their men so vicente could tell them what had happened harper sat beside sharpe are you sure now of course im not bloody sure pat sharpe said testily but i think hes lying he never even asked me how many casualties we had up here if he was on our side hed ask that wouldnt he harper shrugged as if he could not answer that question so what happens if we leave they make us prisoners march us off to bloody france or send us home if the war is over pat theyll send us home but if the war is over then someone else will tell us a portuguese official someone not him not christopher and if the fightings over why give us just an hour wed have the rest of our lives to get off this hill not one hour sharpe stared down the slope where the last of the french bodies was being removed by a squad of infantrymen who had climbed the path with a flag of truce and no weapons dulong had led them and he had thought to bring two spades so that sharpes men could bury their corpses the two portuguese killed by the howitzer in the dawn attack and rifleman donnelly who had been lying on the hilltop under a pile of stones ever since sharpe had beaten dulongs men off the summit vicente had sent sergeant macedo and three men to dig his two graves and sharpe had given the second spade to williamson digging the grave will be the end of your punishment he had said ever since the confrontation in the wood sharpe had been giving williamson extra duties keeping the man busy and trying to wear his spirit down but sharpe reckoned williamson had been punished enough and leave your rifle here sharpe added williamson had snatched the spade dropped his rifle with unnecessary force and accompanied by dodd and harris gone downhill to where there was enough soil above the rock to make an adequate grave harper and slattery had carried the dead man down from the hilltop and rolled him into the hole and then harper had said a prayer and slattery had bowed his head and now williamson stripped to his shirtsleeves was shoveling the soil back into the grave while dodd and harris watched the french carry their last casualties away harper also watched the french what happens if they bring a mortar he asked were buggered sharpe said but a lot can happen before a mortar gets here what i dont know sharpe said irritably he really did not know any more than he knew what to do christopher had been very persuasive and it was only a streak of stubbornness in sharpe that made him so certain the colonel was lying that and the look in major dulongs eyes maybe im wrong pat maybe im wrong trouble is i like it here harper smiled you like it here i like being away from the army captain hogans all right but the rest i cant stand the rest jack puddings harper said flatly meaning officers im better on my own sharpe said and out here im on my own so were staying aye harper said and i think youre right you do sharpe sounded surprised i do harper said mind you my mother never reckoned i was any good at thinking sharpe laughed go and clean your rifle pat cooper had boiled a can of water and some of the riflemen used it to swill out their weapons barrels every shot left a little layer of caked powder that would eventually build up and make the rifle unusable but hot water dissolved the residue some riflemen preferred to piss down the barrel hagman used the boiling water then scraped at his barrel with his ramrod you want me to clean yours sir he asked sharpe itll wait dan sharpe said then saw sergeant macedo and his men come back and he wondered where his own gravediggers were and so he went to the northernmost redoubt from where he could see harris and dodd stamping the earth down over donnellys body while williamson leaned on the spade arent you finished sharpe shouted at them hurry coming sir harris called and he and dodd picked up their jackets and started up the hill williamson hefted the spade looked as if he was about to follow and then quite suddenly turned and ran down the hill jesus harper appeared beside sharpe and raised his rifle sharpe pushed it down he was not trying to save williamsons life but there was a truce on the hill and even a single rifle shot could be construed as breaking the truce and the howitzer could answer the shot while dodd and harris were still on the open slope the bastard hagman watched williamson run recklessly down the hill as though he was trying to outrun the expected bullet sharpe felt a terrible sense of failure he had not liked williamson but even so it was the officer who had failed when a man ran the officer would not get punished of course and the man if he were ever caught would be shot but sharpe knew that this was his failure it was a reproof to his command harper saw the stricken look on sharpes face and did not understand it were best off without the bastard sir he said dodd and harris looked dumbfounded and harris even turned as if he wanted to chase williamson until sharpe called him back i should never have sent williamson to do that job he said bitterly why not harper said you werent to know hed run i dont like losing men sharpe said bitterly its not your fault harper protested then whose is it sharpe asked angrily williamson had vanished into the french ranks presumably to join christopher and the only small consolation was that he had not been able to take his rifle with him but it was still failure and sharpe knew it best get under cover he told harper because theyll start that damn gun again soon the howitzer fired ten minutes before the hour was up though as no one on the hilltop possessed a watch they did not realize it the shell struck a boulder just below the lowest redoubt and ricocheted up into the sky where it exploded in a gout of gray smoke flame and whistling shards of shattered casing one scrap of hot iron buried itself in the stock of dodds rifle the rest rattled on rocks sharpe still reproaching himself for williamsons desertion was watching the main road in the far valley there was dust there and he could just make out horsemen riding from the northwest from the oporto road was it a mortar coming if it was he thought then he would have to think about making an escape maybe if they went fast they could break through the dragoon cordon to the west and get into the high ground where the rocky terrain would make things hard for horsemen but it would likely prove a bloody passage for the first halfmile unless he could try it at night but if that was a mortar approaching then it would be in action long before nightfall he stared at the distant road cursing the shortcomings of christophers telescope and persuaded himself that he could see no kind of vehicle whether gun carnage or mortar wagon among the horsemen but they were very far off and he could not be certain mister sharpe sir it was dan hagman can i have a go at the bastards sharpe was still brooding over his failure and his first instinct was to tell the old poacher not to waste his time then he became aware of the odd atmosphere on the hill his men were embarrassed because of williamson many of them probably feared that sharpe in his anger would punish them all for one mans sin and others very few might have wanted to follow williamson but most probably felt that the desertion was a reproach to them all they were a unit they were friends they were proud of each other and one of them had deliberately thrown that comradeship away yet now hagman was offering to restore some of that pride and sharpe nodded go on dan he said but only you only hagman he called to the other riflemen he knew that they would all love to blaze away at the gun crew but the distance was prodigious right at the very end of a rifles range and only hagman had the skill to even come close sharpe looked again at the distant dust cloud but the horses had turned onto the smaller track that led to vila real de zedes and head on he could not see whether they escorted any vehicle so he trained the glass on the howitzers crew and saw they were ramming a new shell down the stubby barrel get under cover hagman alone stayed in the open he was loading his rifle first pouring powder from his horn into the barrel most of the time he would have used a cartridge which had powder and ball conveniently wrapped in waxed paper but for this kind of shot at seven hundred yards he would use the highquality powder carried in the horn he used slightly more than was provided in a cartridge and when the barrel was charged he laid the weapon aside and took out the handful of loose bullets that nestled among the tea leaves at the bottom of his cartridge pouch the enemy shell went just wide of the watchtower and exploded harmlessly over the steep western slope and though the noise buffeted the eardrums and the broken casing rattled angrily against the stones hagman did not even look up he was using the middle finger of his right hand to roll the bullets one by one in the palm of his left hand and when he was sure he had found the most perfectly shaped ball he put the others away and picked up his rifle again at the back of the stock there was a small cavity covered with a brass lid the cavity had two compartments the larger held the rifles cleaning tools while the smaller was filled with patches made of thin and flexible leather that had been smeared with lard he took one of the patches closed the brass lid and saw vicente was watching him closely he grinned slow old business sir isnt it now he wrapped the bullet in the patch so that when the rifle fired the expanding bullet would force the leather into the barrels lands the leather also stopped any of the gasses escaping past the bullet and so concentrated the powders force he pushed the leatherwrapped ball into the barrel then used the rammer to force it down it was hard work and he grimaced with the effort then nodded his thanks as sharpe took over sharpe put the butt end of the steel ramrod against a rock and eased the rifle slowly forward until he felt the bullet crunch against the powder he took out the ramrod slid it into the hoops under the barrel and gave the gun back to hagman who used powder from his horn to prime the pan he smoothed the priming with a blackened index finger lowered the frizzen and grinned again at vicente shes like a woman sir hagman said patting the rifle take care of her and shell take care of you youll notice he let mister sharpe do the ramming sir harper said guilelessly vicente laughed and sharpe suddenly remembered the horsemen and he snatched up the small telescope and trained it on the road leading into the village but all that was left of the newcomers was the dust thrown up by their horses hooves they were hidden by the trees around the quinta and so he could not tell whether the horsemen had brought a mortar he swore well he would learn soon enough hagman lay on his back his feet toward the enemy then pillowed the back of his neck against a rock his ankles were crossed and he was using the angle between his boots as a rest for the rifles muzzle and because the weapon was just under four feet long he had to curl his torso awkwardly to bring the stock into his shoulder he settled at last the rifles brass butt at his shoulder and its barrel running the length of his body and though the pose looked clumsy it was favored by marksmen because it held the rifle so rigidly wind sir left to right dan sharpe said very light very light hagman repeated softly then he pulled back the flint the swanneck cock made a slight creaking noise as it compressed the mainspring then there was a click as the pawl took the strain and hagman hinged the backsight up as high as it would go then lined its notch with the bladesight dovetailed at the muzzle he had to lower his head awkwardly to see down the barrel he took a breath let it half out and held it the other men on the hilltop also held their breath hagman made some tiny adjustments edging the barrel to the left and drawing the stock down to give the weapon more elevation it was not only an impossibly long shot but he was firing downhill which was notoriously difficult no one moved sharpe was watching the howitzer crew through the telescope the gunner was just bringing the portfire to the breech and sharpe knew he should interrupt hagmans concentration and order his men to take cover but just then hagman pulled his trigger the crack of the rifle startled birds up from the hillside smoke wreathed about the rocks and sharpe saw the gunner spin round and the portfire drop as the man clutched his right thigh he staggered for a few seconds then fell right thigh dan sharpe said knowing that hagman could not see through the smoke of his rifle and you put him down under cover all of you quick another gunner had snatched up the portfire they scrambled behind rocks and flinched as the shell exploded on the face of a big boulder sharpe slapped hagmans back unbelievable dan i was aiming for his chest sir you spoiled his day dan harper said you spoiled his bloody day the other riflemen were congratulating hagman they were proud of him delighted that the old man was back on his feet and as good as ever and the shot had somehow compensated for williamsons treachery they were an elite again they were riflemen do it again sir hagman asked sharpe why not sharpe said if a mortar did come then its crew would be frightened if they discovered they were within range of the deadly rifles hagman began the laborious process all over again but no sooner had he wrapped the next bullet in its leather patch than to sharpes astonishment the howitzers trail was lifted onto the limber and the gun was dragged away into the trees for a moment sharpe was exultant then he feared that the french were simply taking away the howitzer so that the mortar could use the cleared patch of land he waited with a heavy sense of dread but no mortar appeared no one appeared even the infantry who had been posted close to the howitzer had gone back into the trees and for the first time since sharpe had retreated to the watchtower the northern slope was deserted dragoons still patrolled to the east and west but after a halfhour they too rode north toward the village whats happening vicente asked god knows then suddenly sharpe saw the whole french force the gun the cavalry and the infantry and they were all marching away down the road from vila real de zedes they must be going back to oporto and he gazed dumbfounded not daring to believe what he saw its a trick sharpe said has to be he gave the telescope to vicente maybe it is peace vicente suggested after he had stared at the retreating french maybe the fighting really is over why else would they go theyre going sir harper said thats all that matters he had taken the glass from vicente and could see a farm wagon loaded with the french wounded jesus mary and joseph he exulted but theyre going but why was it peace had the horsemen whom sharpe had feared were escorting a mortar brought a message instead an order to retreat or was it a trick were the french hoping he would go down to the village and so give the dragoons a chance to attack his men on level ground he was as confused as ever im going down he said me cooper harris perkins cresacre and sims he deliberately named the last two because they had been friends of williamson and if any men were likely to follow the deserter it was those two and he wanted to show them he still trusted them the rest of you stay here i would like to come vicente said and when he saw sharpe was about to refuse he explained the village senhor i want to see the village i want to see what happened to our people vicente like sharpe took five men sergeant harper and sergeant macedo were left in charge on the hilltop and sharpes patrol set off down the hill they went past the great fanshaped scorch mark which showed where the howitzer had been fired and sharpe half expected a volley to blast from the wood but no gun sounded and then he was under the shade of the trees he and cooper led going stealthily watching for an ambush among the laurels birch and oak but they were undisturbed they followed the path to the quinta which had its blue shutters closed against the sun and looked quite undamaged a tabby cat washed itself on the sunwarmed cobbles beneath the stable arch and paused to stare indignantly at the soldiers then went back to its ablutions sharpe tried the kitchen door but it was locked he thought of breaking it down then decided to leave it and led the men round to the front of the house instead the front door was locked the driveway deserted he backed slowly away from the quinta watching the shutters almost expecting them to be thrown open to loose a blast of musketry but the big house slept on in the earlyafternoon warmth i think its empty sir harris said though he sounded nervous i reckon youre right sharpe agreed and he turned and walked on down the drive the gravel crunched under his boots so he moved to the verge and signaled that his men should do the same the day was hot and still even the birds were silent and then he smelt it and immediately he thought of india and even imagined for a wild second that he was back in that mysterious country for it was there that he had experienced this smell so often it was thick and rank and somehow honeysweet a smell that almost made him want to vomit then that urge passed but he saw that perkins almost as young as pendleton was looking sickly take a deep breath sharpe told him youre going to need it vicente looking as nervous as perkins glanced at sharpe is it he began yes sharpe said it was death vila real de zedes had never been a large or a famous village no pilgrims came to worship in its church saint joseph might be revered locally but his influence had never extended beyond the vineyards yet for all its insignificance it had not been a bad village in which to raise children there was always work in the savage vineyards the soil was fertile and even the poorest house had a vegetable patch some of the villagers had possessed cows most kept hens and a few reared pigs though there was no livestock left now there had been little authority to persecute the villagers father josefa had been the most important person in vila real de zedes other than the english in the quinta and the priest had sometimes been irascible but he had also taught the children their letters he had never been unkind and now he was dead his body unrecognizable was in the ashes of the church where other bodies shrunken by heat lay among the charred and fallen rafters a dead dog was in the street a trickle of dried blood extending from its mouth and a cloud of flies buzzing above the wound in its flank more flies sounded inside the biggest of the two taverns and sharpe pushed open the door with the butt of his rifle and gave an involuntary shudder maria the girl harper had liked was spread naked on the only table left unbroken in the taproom she had been pinned to the table by knives thrust through her hands and now the flies crawled across her bloody belly and breasts every wine barrel had been splintered every pot smashed and every piece of furniture other than the single table torn apart sharpe slung his rifle and tugged the knives from marias palms so that her white arms flapped as the blades came free perkins stared aghast from the door dont just stand there sharpe snapped find a blanket anything and cover her yes sir sharpe went back to the street vicente had tears in his eyes there were bodies in half a dozen houses blood in every house but no living folk any survivors of vila real de zedes had fled the village chased out by the casual brutality of their conquerors we should have stayed here vicente said angrily and died with them sharpe asked they had no one to fight for them vicente said they had lopes sharpe said and he didnt know how to fight and if he had then he wouldnt have stayed and if wed fought for them wed be dead now and these folk would be just as dead we should have stayed vicente insisted sharpe ignored him cooper sims the two men cocked their rifles cooper shot first sharpe counted to ten and then sims pulled his trigger sharpe counted to ten again and then he fired into the air it was a signal that harper could lead the others down from the hilltop look for spades sharpe said to vicente spades were going to bury them the graveyard was a walled enclosure just north of the village and there was a small hut with sextons shovels that sharpe gave to his men deep enough so the animals dont scratch them up he ordered but not too deep why not too deep vicente bridled thinking that a shallow grave was a callous insult to the dead because when the villagers come back sharpe said theyll dig them up to find their relatives he found a large piece of sacking in the shed and he used it to collect the charred bodies from the church dragging them one by one to the graveyard the left arm came off father josefas body when sharpe tried to pull the priest free of the charred cross but sims saw what was happening and came to help roll the shrunken blackened corpse onto the sacking ill take it sir sims said seizing hold of the sacking you dont have to sims looked embarrassed were not going to run sir he blurted out then looked fearful as if he expected to get the rough edge of sharpes tongue sharpe looked at him and saw another thief another drunk another failure another rifleman then sharpe smiled thank you sims tell pat harper to give you some of his holy water holy water sims asked the brandy he keeps in his second canteen the one he thinks i dont know about afterward when the men who had come down from the hilltop were helping to bury the dead sharpe went back to the church where harper found him picquets are set sir good and sims says i was to give him some brandy i hope you did i did sir i did and mister vicente sir hes wanting to say a prayer or two i hope gods listening you want to be there no pat didnt think you would the big irishman picked his way through the ashes some of the wreckage still smoked where the altar had stood but he pushed a hand into the blackened tangle and pulled out a twisted black crucifix it was only four inches high and he laid it on his left palm and made the sign of the cross mister vicentes not happy sir i know he thinks we should have defended the village but i told him sir i told him you dont catch the rabbit by killing the dog sharpe stared into the smoke maybe we should have stayed here now youre talking like an irishman sir harper said because theres nothing we dont know about lost causes sure and wed all have died and if you see that the trigger guard on gatakers rifle is hanging loose then dont give him hell about it the screws are worn to buggery sharpe smiled at harpers effort to divert him i know we did the right thing pat i just wish lieutenant vicente could see it hes a lawyer sir cant see a bloody thing straight and hes young hed sell his cow for a drink of milk we did the right thing sharpe insisted but what do we do now harper tried to straighten the crucifix when i was a wee child he said i got lost i was no more then seven eight maybe no bigger then perkins anyway there were soldiers near the village your lot in red and to this day i dont know what the bastards were doing there but i ran away from them they didnt chase me but i ran all the same because thats what you did when the red bastards showed themselves i ran and i ran i did and i ran until i didnt know where the hell i was so what did you do i followed a stream harper said and came to these two wee houses and my aunty lived in one and she took me home sharpe started to laugh and though it was not really funny could not stop maire harper said aunty maire rest her soul he put the crucifix into a pocket i wish your aunty maire was here pat but were not lost no we go south find a boat cross the river keep going south and if the armys gone from lisbon walk to gibraltar sharpe said knowing it would never come to that if there was peace then he would be found by someone in authority and sent to the nearest port and if there was war then he would find someone to fight simple really he thought but we march at night pat so were still at war you think oh were at war pat sharpe said looking at the wreckage and thinking of christopher were bloody well at war vicente was staring at the new graves he nodded when sharpe said he proposed marching south during the night but he did not speak until they were outside the cemetery gates i am going to porto he said you believe theres been a peace treaty no vicente said then shrugged maybe i dont know but i do know colonel christopher and brigadier vuillard are probably there i didnt fight them here so i must pursue them there so youll go to oporto sharpe said and die maybe vicente said grandly but a man cannot hide from evil no sharpe said but if you fight it fight it clever im learning how to fight vicente said but i already know how to kill that was a recipe for suicide sharpe thought but he did not argue what im planning he said instead is to go back the way we came i can find the way easy enough and once im at barca davintas ill look for a boat there has to be something that will float im sure there is so come with me that far sharpe suggested because its close to oporto vicente agreed and his men fell in behind sharpes when they left the village and sharpe was glad of it for the night was pitch black again and despite his confidence that he could find the way he would have become hopelessly lost if vicente had not been there as it was they made painfully slow progress and eventually rested in the darkest heart of the night and made better time when the wolf light edged the eastern horizon sharpe was in two minds about going back to barca davintas there was a risk for the village was perilously close to oporto but on the other hand he knew it was a place where the river was safe to cross and he reckoned he should be able to find some wreckage from the huts and houses that his men could fashion into a raft vicente agreed saying that much of the rest of the douro valley was a rocky ravine and that sharpe would face difficulty in either approaching the river or finding a crossing place a larger risk was that the french would be guarding barca davintas but sharpe suspected they would be content with having destroyed all the boats in the village dawn found them in some wooded hills they stopped by a stream and made a breakfast of stale bread and smoked meat so tough that the men joked about resoling their boots then grumbled because sharpe would not let them light a fire and so make tea sharpe carried a crust to the summit of a nearby hill and searched the landscape with the small telescope he saw no enemy indeed he saw no one at all a deserted cottage lay further up the valley where the stream ran and there was a church bell tower a mile or so to the south but there were no people vicente joined him you think there might be french here i always think that sharpe said and do you think the british have gone home vicente asked no why not sharpe shrugged if we wanted to go home he said wed have gone after sir john moores retreat vicente stared south i know we could not have defended the village he said i wish we could have done it is just that they are my people vicente shrugged i know sharpe said and he tried to imagine the french army in the dales of yorkshire or in the streets of london he tried to imagine the cottages burning the alehouses sacked and the women screaming but he could not envisage that horror it seemed oddly impossible harper could doubtless imagine his home being violated could probably recall it but sharpe could not why do they do it vicente asked with a genuine note of anguish sharpe collapsed the telescope then scuffed the earth with the toe of his right boot on the day after they had climbed to the watchtower he had dried the rainsoaked boots in front of the fire but he had left them too close and the leather had cracked there are no rules in war he said uncomfortably there are rules vicente insisted sharpe ignored the protest most soldiers arent saints theyre drunks thieves rogues theyve failed at everything so they join the army or else theyre forced to join by some bastard of a magistrate then theyre given a weapon and told to kill back home theyd be hanged for it but in the army theyre praised for it and if you dont hold them hard then they think any killing is permitted those ladshe nodded down the hill to the men grouped under the cork oaksknow damn well theyll be punished if they step out of line but if i let them off the leash theyd run this country ragged then make a mess of spain and theyd never stop till someone killed them he paused knowing he had been unfair to his men mind you i like them he went on theyre not the worst not really just unlucky and theyre damn fine soldiers i dont know he frowned embarrassed but the frogs they dont have any choice its called conscription some poor bastard is working as a baker or a wheelwright one day and the next hes in uniform and being marched half a continent away they resent it and the french dont flog their soldiers so theres no way of holding them do you flog not me he thought about telling vicente that he had been flogged once long ago on a hot parade ground in india then decided it would sound like boasting i just take them behind a wall and beat them up he said instead its quicker vicente smiled i could not do that you could always give them a writ instead sharpe said id rather be beaten up than get tangled by a lawyer maybe he thought if he had beaten williamson the man might have settled to authority maybe not so how far is the river he asked three hours not much longer bugger all happening here we might as well keep going but the french vicente suggested nervously none here none there sharpe nodded to the south no smoke no birds coming out of trees like a cat was after them and you can smell french dragoons a mile off their horses all have saddle sores they stink like a cesspit so they marched the dew was still on the grass they went through a deserted village that looked undamaged and sharpe suspected the villagers had seen them coming and hidden themselves there were certainly people there for some drying washing was draped over two laurel bushes but though sergeant macedo bellowed that they were friends no one dared to appear one of the pieces of washing was a fine mans shirt with bone buttons and sharpe saw cresacre dawdling so that he would have a moment on his own when the others were ahead the penalty for theft sharpe called to his men is hanging and there are good hanging trees here cresacre pretended he had not heard but hurried on all the same they stopped when they reached the douro barca davintas was still some way to the west and sharpe knew his men were tired and so they bivouacked in a wood high on a bluff above the river no boats moved there far off to the south a single spire of smoke wavered in the sky and to the west there was a shimmering haze that sharpe suspected was the smoke of oportos cooking fires vicente said barca davintas was little more than an hour away but sharpe decided they would wait till next morning before marching again haifa dozen of the men were limping because their boots were rotting and gataker who had been wounded in the thigh was feeling the pain one of vicentes men was walking barefoot and sharpe was thinking of doing the same because of the condition of his boots but there was a still better reason for delay if the french are there he explained then id rather sneak up on them in the dawn and if theyre not weve got all day to make some sort of raft what about us vicente asked you still want to go to oporto thats where the regiment is from vicente said its home the men are anxious some have families there see us to barca davintas sharpe suggested then go home but go the last few miles slowly go carefully youll be all right he did not believe that but he could not say what he did believe so they rested picquets watched from the woods edge while the others slept and some time after midday when the heat made everyone drowsy sharpe thought he heard thunder far away but there were no rain clouds in sight and that meant the thunder had to be gunfire but he could not be sure harper was sleeping and sharpe wondered if he was just hearing the echo of the big irishmans snores but then he thought he heard the thunder again though it was so faint that he could just have imagined it he nudged harper what is it im trying to listen sharpe said and im trying to sleep listen but there was silence except for the murmur of the river and the rustle of leaves in the east wind sharpe thought about taking a patrol to reconnoiter barca davintas but decided against it he did not want to divide his already perilously small force and whatever dangers lurked at the village could wait till morning at nightfall he thought he heard the thunder again but then the wind gusted and snatched the sound away dawn was silent still and the gently misted river looked as polished as steel luis who had attached himself to vicentes men had proved to be a good cobbler and had sewn up some of the more decrepit boots he had volunteered to shave sharpe who had shaken his head ill have a shave when were across the river he said i pray you dont grow a beard vicente said and then they marched following a track that meandered along the high ground the track was rough overgrown and deeply rutted and the going was slow but they saw no enemy and then the land flattened the track turned into a lane that ran beside vineyards and barca davintas its white walls lit bright by the rising sun was ahead there were no french there two score of folk had moved back into the plundered houses and they looked alarmed at the uniformed ruffians who came across the small bridge over the stream but vicente calmed them there were no boats the people said the french had taken or burned them all they rarely saw the french they added sometimes a patrol of dragoons would clatter through the village stare across the river steal some food and then go away they had little other news one woman who sold olive oil eggs and smoked fish in oportos market said that the french were all guarding the river bank between the city and the sea but sharpe did not put much weight on her words her husband a bent giant with gnarled hands guardedly allowed that it might be possible to make a raft from some of the villages broken furniture sharpe put picquets on the villages western margin where hagman had been wounded he climbed a tree there and was amazed that he could see some of oportos outlying buildings on the hilly horizon the big flatroofed white building that he remembered passing when he first met vicente was the most obvious and he was appalled that they were so close he was no more than three miles from the big white building and surely the french would have their own picquets on that hill and surely they would have a telescope up there to watch the city approaches but he was committed to crossing the river here and so he clambered down and was just brushing off his jacket when a wildhaired young man in ragged clothes mooed at him sharpe stared back astonished the man mooed again then grinned inanely before giving a cackle of laughter he had dirty red hair bright blue eyes and a slack dribbling mouth and sharpe realized he was an idiot and probably harmless sharpe remembered ronnie a village idiot in yorkshire whose parents would shackle him to the stump of an elm on the village green where ronnie would bellow at the grazing cows talk to himself and growl at the girls this man was much the same but he was also importunate plucking at sharpes elbow as he tried to drag the englishman toward the river made yourself a friend sir tongue asked amused hes being a bloody nuisance sir perkins said he dont mean harm tongue said just wants you to go for a swim sir sharpe pulled away from the idiot whats your name he asked then realized there was probably little point in speaking english to a portuguese lunatic but the idiot was so pleased at being spoken to that he gibbered wildly grinned and bounced up and down on his toes then he plucked at sharpes elbow again ill call you ronnie sharpe said and what do you want his men were laughing now but sharpe had intended to go to the river bank anyway to see what kind of challenge his raft would face and so he let ronnie pull him along the idiot made conversation all the way but none of it made any sense he took sharpe right to the river bank and when sharpe tried to detach his surprisingly strong grip ronnie shook his head and tugged sharpe on through some poplars down through thick bushes and then at last he relinquished his grip on sharpes arm and clapped his hands youre not such an idiot after all are you sharpe said in fact youre a bloody genius ronnie there was a boat sharpe had seen the ferry burned and sunk on his first visit to barca davintas but now realized there must have been two craft and this was the second it was a flat wide and cumbersome vessel the kind of boat that could carry a small flock of sheep or even a carriage and its horses and it had been weighted with stones and sunk in this wide ditchlike creek that jutted under the trees to make a small backwater sharpe wondered why the villagers had not shown it to him before and guessed that they feared all soldiers and so they had hidden their most valuable boat until peaceful times returned the french had destroyed every other boat and had never guessed that this second ferry still existed youre a bloody genius sharpe told ronnie again and he gave him the last of his bread which was the only gift he had but he also had a boat and then he had something else for the thunder he had heard so distantly the previous day sounded again only this time it was close and it was unmistakable and it was not thunder at all and christopher had lied and there was no peace in portugal it was cannon fire chapter the sound of the firing was coming from the west channeled up the steepsided river valley and sharpe could not tell whether the battle was being fought on the northern or southern bank of the douro nor could he even tell whether it was a battle perhaps the french had established batteries to protect the city against an attack from the sea and those batteries might just be firing at inquisitive frigates or maybe the guns were merely practice firing but one thing was certain he would never know what the guns were doing unless he got closer he ran back to the village followed by the shambling ronnie who was bellowing his inarticulate achievement to the world sharpe found vicente the ferrys still here sharpe said he showed me he pointed to ronnie but the guns vicente was bemused were going to find out what theyre doing sharpe said but ask the villagers to raise the ferry we might yet need it but well go toward the city all of us vicente asked all of us but tell them i want that boat floating by midmorning ronnies mother a shrunken and bent woman swathed in black retrieved her son from sharpes side and berated him in a shrill voice sharpe gave her the last chunk of cheese from harpers pack explained that ronnie was a hero then led his motley group westward along the river bank there was plenty of cover orchards olive groves cattle sheds and small vineyards were crowded on the narrow piece of level land beside the douros northern bank the cannons hidden by the loom of the great hill on which the flatroofed building stood were sporadic their firing would swell to a battle intensity then fade away for minutes at a time there would be no shots or just a single gun would fire and the sound of it would echo off the southern hills rebound from the northern and bounce its way down the valley perhaps vicente suggested pointing up to the great white building we should go to the seminary frogs will be there sharpe said he was crouching beside a hedge and for some reason kept his voice very low it seemed extraordinary that there were no french picquets not one but he was certain the french must have put men into the big building that dominated the river east of the city as effectively as a castle what did you say it was a seminary vicente saw sharpe was puzzled a place where priests are trained i thought of becoming a priest once good god sharpe said surprised you wanted to be a priest i thought of it vicente said defensively do you not like priests not much then im glad i became a lawyer vicente said with a smile youre no lawyer jorge sharpe said youre a bloody soldier like the rest of us he offered that compliment and then turned as the last of his men came across the small meadow to crouch behind the hedge if the french did have men in the seminary he thought then either they were fast asleep or more likely they had seen the blue and green uniforms and confused them with their own jackets did they think the portuguese blue were french coats the portuguese blue was darker than the french infantry coats and the rifle green was much darker than the dragoons coats but at a distance the uniforms might be confused or was there no one in the building sharpe took out the small telescope and stared for a long time the seminary was huge a great white block four stories high and there had to be at least ninety windows in the south wall alone but he could see no movement in any of them nor was anyone on the flat roof which had a red tile coping and surely provided the best lookout post east of the city shall we go there vicente prompted sharpe maybe sharpe responded cautiously he was tempted because the building would offer a marvelous view of the city but he still could not believe the french would leave the seminary empty well go further along the bank first though he led with his riflemen their green jackets blended better with the leaves offering them a small advantage if there was a french picquet ahead but they saw no one nor did sharpe see any activity on the southern bank yet the guns were still firing and now over the loom of the seminary hill he could see a dirty white cloud of gun smoke being pumped into the river valley there were more buildings now many of them small houses built close to the river and their gardens were a maze offences vines and olive trees that hid sharpes men as they went on westward above sharpe to his right the seminary was a great threat in the sky its serried windows blank and black and sharpe could not rid himself of the fear that a horde of french soldiers were hidden behind that sunglossed cliff of stone and glass yet every time he looked he saw no movement then suddenly there was a single french soldier just ahead sharpe had turned a corner and there the man was he was in the middle of a cobbled slipway that led from a boat builders shed to the river and he was crouching to play with a puppy sharpe desperately beckoned for his men to stop the enemy was an infantryman and he was only seven or eight paces away utterly oblivious his back to sharpe and his shako and musket on the cobblestones letting the puppy playfully nip his right hand and if there was one french soldier there had to be more had to be sharpe stared past the man to where a stand of poplars and thick bushes edged the slipways far side was there a patrol there he could see no sign of one nor any activity among the boatyards tumbledown sheds then the frenchman either heard the scuff of a boot or else sensed he was being watched for he stood and turned then realized his musket was still on the ground and he stooped for it then froze when sharpes rifle pointed at his face sharpe shook his head then jerked the rifle to indicate that the frenchman should stand up straight the man obeyed he was a youngster scarce older than pendleton or perkins with a round guileless face he looked scared and took an involuntary step back as sharpe came fast toward him then he whimpered as sharpe tugged him by the jacket back around the corner sharpe pushed him to the ground took his bayonet from its scabbard and threw it into the river tie him up he ordered tongue slit his throat tongue suggested its easier tie him up sharpe insisted gag him and make a good job of it he beckoned vicente forward hes the only one ive seen there must be more vicente declared god knows where they are sharpe went back to the corner peered around and saw nothing except the puppy which was now trying to drag the frenchmans musket across the cobbles by its sling he gestured for harper to join him i cant see anyone sharpe whispered he cant have been alone harper said yet still no one moved i want to get into those trees pat sharpe hissed nodding across the slipway run like shit sir harper said and the two of them sprinted across the open space and threw themselves into the trees no musket flared no one shouted but the puppy thinking it was a game followed them go back to your mother harper hissed at the dog which just barked at him jesus sharpe said not because of the noise the dog was making but because he could see boats the french were supposed to have destroyed or taken every vessel along the douro but in front of him stranded by the falling tide on the muddy outer bank of a great bend in the river were three huge wine barges three he wondered if they had been holed and while harper kept the puppy quiet he waded through the sticky mud and hauled himself aboard the nearest barge he was hidden from anyone on the north bank by thick trees which was perhaps why the french had somehow missed the three vessels and better still the barge sharpe had boarded seemed quite undamaged there was a good deal of water in its bilge but when sharpe tasted it he found it was fresh so it was rainwater not the salty tidewater that swept twice daily up the douro sharpe splashed through the flooded bilge and found no gaping rents torn by axes then he heaved himself up onto a side deck where six great sweeps were lashed together with fraying lengths of rope there was even a small skiff stored upside down at the stern with a pair of ancient oars cracked and bleached lodged halfway beneath its hull sir harper hissed from the bank sir he was pointing across the river and sharpe looked over the water and saw a red coat a single horseman evidently british stared back at him the man had a cocked hat so was an officer but when sharpe waved he did not return the gesture sharpe guessed the man was confused by his green coat get everyone here now sharpe ordered harper then looked back to the horseman for a second or two he wondered if it was colonel christopher but this man was heavier and his horse like most british horses had a docked tail while christopher aping the french had left his horses tail uncut the man who was sitting his horse beneath a tree turned and looked as if he was speaking to someone though sharpe could see no one else on the opposite bank then the man looked back to sharpe and gestured vigorously toward the three boats sharpe hesitated it was a safe bet that the man was senior to him and if he crossed the river he would find himself back in the iron discipline of the army and no longer free to act as he wished if he sent any of his men it would be the same but then he thought of luis and he summoned the barber helping him up over the barges heavy gunwale can you manage a small boat he asked luis looked momentarily alarmed then nodded firmly i can yes then go over the river and find out what that british officer wants tell him im reconnoitering the seminary and tell him theres another boat at barca davintas sharpe was making a swift guess that the british had advanced north and had been stopped by the douro he assumed the cannonade was from the guns firing at each other across the river but without boats the british would be helpless where the hell was the bloody navy harper macedo and luis manhandled the skiff over the gunwale and down the glutinous mud into the river the tide was rising but it still had some way to go before it reached the barges luis took the oars settled himself on the thwart and with admirable skill pulled away from the bank he looked over his shoulder to judge his direction then sculled vigorously sharpe saw another horseman appear behind the first the second man also in red coat and black cocked hat and he felt the bindings of the army reaching out to snare him so he jumped off the barge and waded through the mud to the bank you stay here he ordered vicente ill look up the hill for a moment vicente seemed ready to argue then he accepted the arrangement and sharpe beckoned his riflemen to follow him as they disappeared into the trees sharpe looked back to see luis was almost at the other bank then sharpe pushed through a stand of laurel and saw the road in front of him this was the road by which he had escaped from oporto and to his left he could see the houses where vicente had saved his bacon he could see no french he stared again at the seminary but nothing moved there to hell with it he thought just go he led his men in skirmish order up the hill which offered little cover a few straggly trees broke the pasture and a dilapidated shed stood halfway up but otherwise it was a deathtrap if there were any frenchmen in the big building sharpe knew he should have exercised more caution but no one fired from the windows no one challenged him and he quickened his pace so that he felt the pain in his leg muscles because the slope was so steep then suddenly he had arrived safe at the base of the seminary the ground floor had small barred windows and seven arched doors sharpe tried a door and found it locked and so solid that when he kicked it he only succeeded in hurting himself he crouched and waited for the laggards among his men to catch up he could see westward across a valley that lay between the seminary and the city and he could see where the french guns at the top of oportos hill were shooting across the river but their target was hidden by a hill on the southern bank a huge convent stood on the obscuring hill the same convent sharpe remembered where the portuguese guns had duelled with the french on the day the city fell all here harper told him sharpe followed the seminary wall which was made of massive blocks of stone he went westward toward the city he would have preferred to go the other way but he sensed the buildings main entrance would face oporto every door he passed was locked why the hell were there no french here he could see none not even at the citys edge a halfmile away and then the wall turned to his right and he saw a flight of steps climbing to an ornamental door no sentries guarded the entrance though he could at last see frenchmen now there was a convoy of wagons on a road that ran in the valley which lay to the north of the seminary the wagons which were drawn by oxen were being escorted by dragoons and sharpe used christophers small telescope to see that the vehicles were filled with wounded men so was soult sending his invalids back to france or just emptying his hospitals before fighting another battle and he was surely not now thinking of marching on to lisbon for the british had come north to the douro and that made sharpe think that sir arthur wellesley must have arrived in portugal to galvanize the british forces the seminary entrance was framed by an ornate facade rising to a stone cross that had been chipped by musket fire the main door approached by stairs was wooden studded with nails and when sharpe twisted the great wroughtiron handle surprised him by being unlocked he pushed the door wide open with the muzzle of his rifle to see an empty tiled hallway with walls painted a sickly green the portrait of a halfstarved saint hung askew on one wall the saints body riddled with bullet punctures a crude painting of a woman and a french soldier had been daubed next to the saint and proved that the french had been in the seminary though there were none evident now sharpe went inside his boots echoing from the walls jesus mary and joseph harper said making the sign of the cross ive never seen such a huge building he gazed in awe down the shadowed corridor how many bloody priests does a country need depends how many sinners there are sharpe said and now we search the place he left six men in the entrance hall to serve as a picquet then went downstairs to unbolt one of the arched doors facing the river that door would be his bolt hole if the french came to the seminary and once that retreat was secure he searched the dormitories bathrooms kitchens refectory and lecture rooms of the vast building broken furniture littered every room and in the library a thousand books lay strewn and torn across the hardwood floor but there were no people the chapel had been violated the altar chopped for firewood and the choir used as a lavatory bastards harper said softly gataker his trigger guard dangling by one last screw gaped at an amateur painting of two women curiously joined to three french dragoons that had been daubed on the whitewashed wall where once a great triptych of the holy birth had surmounted the altar good that he said in a tone as respectful as he might have used at the royal academys summer exhibition i like my women a bit plumper slattery said come on sharpe snarled his most urgent task now was to find the seminarys store of winehe was certain there would be onebut when at last he discovered the cellar he saw with relief that the french had already been there and nothing remained but broken bottles and empty barrels real bastards harper said feelingly but sharpe would have destroyed the bottles and barrels himself to prevent his men from drinking themselves insensible and that thought made him realize that he had already unconsciously decided that he would stay in this big building as long as he could the french doubtless wanted to hold oporto but whoever held the seminary dominated the citys eastern flank the long facade with its myriad windows facing the river was deceptive for the building was very narrow scarce a dozen windows looked straight toward oporto though at the rear of the seminary furthest from the city a long wing jutted north in the angle of the two wings was a garden where a score of apple trees had been cut down for firewood the two sides of the garden not cradled by the building were protected by a high stone wall pierced by a pair of fine iron gates that opened toward oporto in a shed hidden beneath a pile of netting that had once been used to keep birds from the fruit bushes sharpe found an old pickaxe that he gave to cooper start making loopholes he said pointing to the long wall patrick find some more tools detail six men to help coops and the rest of the men are to go to the roof but theyre not to show themselves understand theyre to stay hidden sharpe himself went to a large room that he suspected had been the office of the seminarys master it was shelved like a library and it had been plundered like the rest of the building torn and brokenspined books lay thick on the floorboards a large table had been thrown against one wall and a slashed oil painting of a saintlylooking cleric was half burned in the big hearth the only undamaged object was a crucifix black as soot that hung high on the wall above the mantel sharpe threw open the window that was immediately above the seminarys main door and used the little telescope to search the city that lay so tantalizingly close across the valley then disobeying his own instructions that everyone was to stay hidden he leaned across the sill in an attempt to see what was happening on the rivers southern bank but he could see nothing meaningful and then while he was still craning his neck a strangers voice boomed behind him you must be lieutenant sharpe names waters lieutenant colonel waters and well done sharpe bloody well done sharpe pulled back and turned to see a redcoated officer stepoine through the mess of books and papers im sharpe sir he acknowledged bloody frogs are dozing waters said he was a stocky man bowlegged from too much horseriding with a weatherbeaten face sharpe guessed he was in his low forties but looked older because his grizzled hair was gray they should have had a battalion and a half up here shouldnt they that and a couple of gun batteries our enemies are dozing sharpe bloody dozing you were the man i saw across the river sharpe asked the very same your portuguese fellow came across smart man so he rowed me back and now were floating those damned barges waters grinned its heaveho my hearties and if we can get the damn things afloat then well have the buffs over first then the rest of the st brigade should be interesting when marshal soult realizes weve sneaked in his back door eh is there any liquor in the building all gone sir good man waters said mistakenly deducing that sharpe himself must have removed the temptation before the arrival of the redcoats then he stepped to the window took a big telescope from a leather satchel hanging from his shoulder and stared at oporto so whats happening sir sharpe asked happening were running the frogs out of portugal hop hop croak croak and good bloody riddance to the spavined bastards look at it waters gestured at the city they dont have the first blind idea that were here your portuguese fellow said youd been cut off is that true since the end of march ye gods waters said you must be out of touch the colonel pulled back from the window and perched on the sill where he told sharpe that sir arthur wellesley had indeed arrived in portugal he came less than three weeks ago waters said and hes put some snap into the troops by god he has cradock was a decent enough fellow but he had no snap none so were on the march sharpe left right left right and the devil take the hindmost british army over there he oointed through the window indicating the hidden ground beyond the high convent on the southern bank bloody frogs seem to think well come by sea so all their men are either in the city or guarding the river between the city and the sea sharpe felt a twinge of guilt for not believing the woman in barca davintas who had told him exactly that sir arthur wants to get across waters went on and your fellows have conveniently provided those three barges and you say theres a fourth three miles upriver sir you aint done a bad mornings work sharpe waters said with a friendly grin we only have to pray for one thing that the french dont discover us here exactly so best remove my red coat from the window eh waters laughed and crossed the room pray they go on sleeping with their sweet froggy dreams because once they do wake up then the days going to be damned hot dont you think and those three barges can take how many men apiece thirty and god alone knows how long each crossing will take we could be shoving our damned heads into the tigers mouth sharpe sharpe forbore to comment that he had spent the last few weeks with his head inside the tigers mouth instead he stared across the valley trying to imagine how the french would approach when they did attack he guessed they would come straight from the city across the valley and up the slope that was virtually bare of any cover the northern flank of the seminary looked toward the road in the valley and that slope was just as bare all except for one solitary tree with pale leaves that grew right in the middle of the climb anyone attacking the seminary would presumably try to get to the garden gate or the big front door and that would mean crossing a wide paved terrace where carriages bringing visitors to the seminary could turn around and where attacking infantry would be cut down by musket and rifle fire from the seminarys windows and its balustraded roof a deathtrap colonel waters was sharing the view and evidently thinking the same thoughts i wouldnt want to be attacking up that slope sharpe agreed and ive no doubt well put some cannon on the other bank to make it all a bit less healthy waters said cheerfully sharpe hoped that was true he kept wondering why there were no british guns on the wide terrace of the convent that overlooked the river the terrace where the portuguese had placed their batteries in march it seemed an obvious position but sir arthur wellesley appeared to have chosen to put his artillery down among the port lodges which were out of sight of the seminary whats the time waters asked then answered his own question by taking out a turnip watch nearly eleven are you with the staff sir sharpe asked because waterss red coat though decorated with some tarnished gold braid had no regimental facings im one of sir arthurs exploring officers waters said cheerfully we ride ahead to scout the land like those fellows in the bible that joshua sent ahead to spy out jericho remember the tale and a frow called rahab gave them shelter thats the luck of the jews aint it the chosen people get greeted by a prostitute and i get welcomed by a rifleman but i suppose its better than a sloppy wet kiss from a bloody frog dragoon eh sharpe smiled do you know captain hogan sir the mapping fellow of course i know hogan a capital man capital waters suddenly stopped and looked at sharpe my god of course youre his lost rifleman aint you ah ive placed you now he said youd survive well done sharpe ah here come the first of the gallant buffs vicente and his men had escorted thirty redcoats up the hill but instead of using the unlocked arched door they had trudged round to the front and now gaped up at waters and sharpe who in turn looked down from the window the newcomers wore the buff facings of the rd regiment of foot a kentish regiment and they were sweating after their climb under the hot sun a thin lieutenant led them and he assured colonel waters that two more bargeloads of men were already disembarking then he looked curiously at sharpe what on earth are the rifles doing here first on the field sharpe quoted the regiments favorite boast and last off it first you must have flown across the bloody river the lieutenant wiped his forehead any water here barrel inside the main door sharpe said courtesy of the th more men arrived the barges were toiling to and fro across the river propelled by the massive sweeps which were manned by local people who were eager to help and every twenty minutes another eighty or ninety men would toil up the hill one group arrived with a general sir edward paget who took over command of the growing garrison from waters paget was a young man still in his thirties energetic and eager who owed his high rank to his aristocratic familys wealth but he had the reputation of being a general who was popular with his soldiers he climbed to the seminary roof where sharpes men were now positioned and seeing sharpes small telescope asked to borrow it lost me own he explained its somewhere in the baggage in lisbon you came with sir arthur sir sharpe asked three weeks ago paget said staring at the city sir edward waters told sharpe is second in command to sir arthur which doesnt mean much sir edward said because he never tells me anything whats wrong with this bloody telescope you have to hold the outer lens in place sir sharpe said take mine waters said offering the better instrument sir edward scanned the city then frowned so what are the bloody french doing he asked in a puzzled tone sleeping waters answered wont like it when they wake up will they paget remarked asleep in the keepers lodge with poachers all over the coverts he gave the telescope back to waters and nodded at sharpe damn pleased to have some riflemen here lieutenant i dare say youll get some target practice before the days out another group of men came up the hill every window of the seminarys brief western facade now had a group of redcoats and a quarter of the windows on the long northern wall were also manned the garden wall had been loopholed and garrisoned by vicentes portuguese and by the buffs grenadier company the french thinking themselves secure in oporto were watching the river between the city and the sea while behind their backs on the high eastern hill the redcoats were gathering which meant the gods of war were tightening the screws and something had to break officers were posted in the entrance hall of the palacio das carrancas to make sure all visitors took their boots off his grace they explained referring to marshal nicolas soult duke of dalmatia whose nickname was now king nicolas is sleeping the hallway was cavernous arched high beautiful and hardheeled boots striding over its tiled floor echoed up the staircase to where king nicolas slept early that morning a hussar had come in hurriedly his spurs had caught in the rug at the foot of the stairs and he had sprawled with a terrible clatter of saber and scabbard that had woken the marshal who had then posted the officers to make certain the rest of his sleep was not disturbed the two officers were powerless to stop the british artillery firing from across the river but perhaps the marshal was not so sensitive to gunfire as he was to loud heels the marshal had invited a dozen guests to breakfast and all had arrived before nine in the morning and were forced to wait in one of the great reception rooms on the palaces western side where tall glass doors opened onto a terrace decorated with flowers planted in carved stone urns and with laurel bushes that an elderly gardener was trimming with long shears the guests all but one of them men and all but two of them french continually strolled onto the terrace which offered from its southern balustrade a view across the river and thus a sight of the guns that fired over the douro in truth there was not much to see because the british cannon were emplaced in vila nova de gaias streets and so even with the help of telescopes the guests merely saw gouts of dirty smoke and then heard the crash of the round shots striking the buildings that faced oportos quay the only other sight worth seeing was the remains of the pontoon bridge which the french had repaired at the beginning of april but had now blown up because of sir arthur wellesleys approach three scorched pontoons still swung to their anchors the rest along with the roadway had been blasted to smithereens and carried by the tide to the nearby ocean kate was the only woman invited to the marshals breakfast and her husband had been adamant that she wear her hussar uniform and his insistence was rewarded by the admiring glances that the other guests gave to his wifes long legs christopher himself was in civilian clothes while the other ten men all officers were in their uniforms and because a woman was present they did their best to appear insouciant about the british cannonade what they are doing a dragoon major resplendent in aiguillettes and gold braid remarked is shooting at our sentries with sixpound shots theyre swatting at flies with a bludgeon he lit a cigar breathed deep and gave kate a long appreciative look with a butt like that he said to his friend she should be french she should be on her back that too of course kate kept herself turned away from the french officers she was ashamed of the hussar uniform which she thought immodest and worse appeared to suggest her sympathies were with the french you might make an effort christopher told her i am making an effort she answered bitterly an effort not to cheer every british shot youre being ridiculous i am kate bridled this is merely a demonstration christopher explained waving toward the powder smoke that drifted like patchy fog through the redtiled roofs of vila nova wellesley has marched his men up here and he cant go any further hes stuck there are no boats and the navy isnt foolish enough to try and sail past the river forts so wellesley will hammer a few cannonballs into the city then turn around and march back to coimbra or lisbon in chess terms my dear this is a stalemate soult cant march south because his reinforcements havent arrived and wellesley cant come further north because he doesnt have the boats and if the military cant force a decision here then the diplomats will have to settle matters which is why i am here as i keep trying to tell you youre here kate said because your sympathies are with the french that is an exceptionally offensive remark christopher said haughtily i am here because sane men must do whatever they can to prevent this war continuing and to do that we must talk with the enemy and i cannot talk with them if i am on the wrong side of the river kate did not answer she no longer believed her husbands complicated explanations of why he was friendly with the french or his high talk of the new ideas controlling europes destiny she clung instead to the simpler idea of being a patriot and all she wanted now was to cross the river and join the men on the far side but there were no boats no bridge left and no way to escape she began to weep and christopher disgusted at her display of misery turned away he worked at his teeth with an ivory pick and marveled that a woman so beautiful could be so prey to vapors kate cuffed at her tears then walked to where the gardener was slowly clipping the laurels how do i get across the river she asked in portuguese the man did not look at her just clipped away you cant i must they shoot you if you try he looked at her taking in the tightfitting hussar uniform then turned away they shoot you anyway a clock in the palaces hallway struck eleven as marshal soult descended the great staircase he wore a silk robe over his breeches and shirt is breakfast ready he demanded in the blue reception room sir an aide answered and your guests are here good good he waited as the doors were thrown open for him then greeted the visitors with a broad smile take your seats do ah i see we are being informal this last remark was because the breakfast was laid in silver chafing dishes on a long sideboard and the marshal went along the row lifting lids ham splendid braised kidneys excellent beef some tongue good good and liver that does look tasty good morning colonel this greeting was to christopher who replied by giving the marshal a bow how good of you to come soult went on and did you bring your pretty wife ah i see her good good you shall sit there colonel he pointed to a chair next to the one he would occupy soult liked the englishman who had betrayed the plotters who would have mutinied if soult had declared himself king the marshal still harbored that ambition but he acknowledged that he would need to beat back the british and portuguese army that had dared to advance from coimbra before he assumed the crown and scepter soult had been surprised by sir arthur wellesleys advance but not alarmed the river was guarded and the marshal had been assured there were no boats on the opposite bank and so as far as king nicolas was concerned the british could sit on the douros southern bank and twiddle their thumbs forever the tall windows rattled in sympathy with the pounding guns and the sound made the marshal turn from the chafing dishes our gunners are a bit lively this morning are they not theyre mostly british guns sir an aide answered doing what firing at our sentries on the quay the aide said theyre swatting at flies with sixpound balls soult laughed so much for the vaunted wellesley eh he smiled at kate and gestured that she should take the place of honor at his right so good to have a pretty woman for company at breakfast better to have one before breakfast an infantry colonel remarked and kate who spoke more french than any of the men knew blushed soult heaped his plate with liver and bacon then took his seat theyre swatting sentries he said so what are we doing counterbattery fire sir the aide answered you dont have any kidneys sir can i bring you some oh do cailloux i like kidneys any news from the castelo the castelo de sao was on the douros north bank where the river met the sea and was heavily garrisoned to fight off a british seaborne assault they report two frigates just out of range sir but no other craft in sight he dithers doesnt he soult said with satisfaction this wellesley hes a ditherer help yourself to the coffee colonel he told christopher and if you would be so kind a cup for me as well thank you soult took a bread roll and some butter i talked with vuillard last night the marshal said and hes making excuses hundreds of excuses another day sir christopher said and we would have captured the hill kate her eyes red looked down at her empty plate nous her husband had said we another day soult responded scornfully he should have taken it in a short minute the very first day he arrived soult had recalled vuillard and his men from vila real de zedes the instant he heard that the british and portuguese were advancing from coimbra but he had been annoyed that so many men had failed to dislodge so small a force not that it mattered what mattered now was that wellesley had to be taught a lesson soult did not think that should prove too difficult he knew wellesley had a small army and was weak in artillery he knew that because captain argenton had been arrested five days before and was now spilling all he knew and all he had observed on his second visit to the british argenton had even met with wellesley himself and the frenchman had seen the preparations being made for the allied advance and the warning given to soult by argenton had enabled the french regiments south of the river to skip backward out of the way of a force sent to hook about their rear so now wellesley was stuck on the wrong side of the douro without any boats to make a crossing except for any craft brought by the british navy and that it seemed was no danger at all two frigates dithering offshore that was hardly going to make the duke of dalmatia quake in his boots argenton who had been promised his life in exchange for information had been captured thanks to christophers revelation and that put soult in the englishmans debt christopher had also revealed the names of the other men in the plot donadieu of the th the brothers lafitte of the th dragoons as well as three or four other experienced officers and soult had decided to take no action against them the arrest of argenton would be a warning to them and they were all popular officers and it did not seem sensible to stir up resentment in the army by a succession of firing squads he would let the officers know that he knew who they were then hint that their lives depended on their future conduct better to have such men in his pocket than in their graves kate was crying she made no noise the tears just rolled down her cheeks and she brushed them away in an attempt to hide her feelings but soult had noticed what is the matter he asked gently she fears sir christopher said she fears soult asked christopher gestured toward the window which still rattled from the pummelling of the cannons women and battle sir dont mix only between the sheets soult said genially tell her he went on that she has nothing to fear the british cannot cross the river and if they try they will be repulsed in a few weeks we shall be reinforced he paused so that the translation could be made and hoped he was right in saying that reinforcements would come soon or else he did not know how he was to continue his invasion of portugal then we shall march south to taste the joys of lisbon tell her we shall have peace by august ah the cook a plump frenchman with extravagant mustaches had come into the room he wore a bloodstreaked apron with a wickedlooking carving knife thrust into its belt you sent for me he sounded grudgingsir ah soult pushed back his chair and rubbed his hands we must plan supper sergeant deron supper i intend to sit sixteen so what do you suggest i have eels eels soult responded happily stuffed with buttered whiting and mushrooms excellent i shall fillet them sergeant deron said doggedly fry them with parsley and serve the fillets with a red wine sauce then for an entree i have lamb very good lamb good i do like lamb soult said you can make a caper sauce a caper sauce deron looked disgusted the vinegar will drown the lamb he said indignantly and it is good lamb tender and fat a very delicate caper sauce perhaps soult suggested the guns rose to a sudden fury shaking the windows and rattling the crystal peardrops of the two chandeliers above the long table but both the marshal and the cook ignored the sound what i will do deron said in a voice which suggested that there could be no discussion is bake the lamb with some goose fat good good soult said and garnish it with onions ham and a few cepes a harassedlooking officer sweating and redfaced from the days heat came into the room sir a moment soult said frowning then looked back to deron onions ham and some cepes he repeated and perhaps we might add some lardons sergeant lardons go so well with lamb i shall garnish it with a little chopped ham deron said stoically some small onions and a few cepes soult surrendered i know it will taste superb quite superb and deron thank you for this breakfast thank you it would have been better eaten when it was cooked deron said then sniffed and went from the room soult beamed at the cooks retreating back then scowled at the newcomer who had interrupted him youre captain brossard are you not you wish some breakfast the marshal indicated with a butter knife that brossard should take the seat at the end of the table hows general foy brossard was an aide to foy and he had no time for breakfast nor indeed to offer a report on general foys health he had brought news and for a second he was too full of it to speak properly but then he controlled himself and pointed eastward the british sir theyre in the seminary soult stared at him for a heartbeat not quite believing what he heard they are what he asked british sir in the seminary but quesnel assured me there were no boats soult protested quesnel was the citys french governor none on their bank sir all the boats in the city had been pulled from the water and piled on the quays where they were available for the french to use but would be of no use to anyone coming from the south but theyre nevertheless crossing brossard said theyre already on the hill soult felt his heart miss a beat the seminary was on a hill that dominated the road to amarante and that road was his lifeline back to the depots in spain and also the connection between the garrison in oporto and general loisons men on the tamega if the british cut that road then they could pick off the french army piece by piece and soults reputation would be destroyed along with his men the marshal stood knocking over his chair in his anger tell general foy to push them back into the river he roared now go push them into the river the men hurried from the room leaving kate and christopher alone and kate saw the look of utter panic on her husbands face and felt a fierce joy because of it the windows rattled the chandeliers shivered and the british were coming well well well we have rifles among our congregation we are blessed indeed i didnt know any of the th were attached to the st brigade the speaker was a burly rubicund man with a balding head and an affable face if it were not for his uniform he would have looked like a friendly farmer and sharpe could imagine him in an english market town leaning on a hurdle prodding plump sheep and waiting for a livestock auction to begin you are most welcome he told sharpe thats daddy hill harris told pendleton now now young man general hill boomed you shouldnt use an officers nickname within his earshot liable to get you punished sorry sir harris had not meant to speak so loudly but youre a rifleman so youre forgiven and a very scruffy rifleman too i must say what is the army coming to when we dont dress for battle eh he beamed at harris then fished in his pocket and brought out a handful of almonds something to occupy your tongue young man thank you sir there were now two generals on the seminary roof general hill commander of the st brigade whose forces were crossing the river and whose kindly nature had earned him the nickname of daddy had joined sir edward paget just in time to see three french battalions come from the citys eastern suburbs and form into two columns that would assault the seminary hill the three battalions were in the valley being pushed and harried into their ranks by sergeants and corporals one column would come straight up at the seminarys facade while the other was forming near the amarante road to assault the northern flank but the french were also aware that british reinforcements were constantly arriving at the seminary and so they had sent a battery of guns to the river bank with orders to sink the three barges the columns waited for the gunners to open fire probably hoping that once the barges were sunk the gunners would turn their weapons onto the seminary and sharpe who had been wondering why sir arthur wellesley had not put guns at the convent across the river saw that he had worried about nothing for no sooner did the french batteries appear than a dozen british guns which had been parked out of sight at the back of the convent terrace were wheeled forward thats the medicine for frenchmen general hill exclaimed when the great row of guns appeared the first to fire was a fiveandahalfinch howitzer the british equivalent of the cannon that had bombarded sharpe on the watchtower hill it was loaded with a spherical case shot a weapon that only britain deployed which had been invented by lieutenant colonel shrapnel and the manner of its working was kept a closely guarded secret the shell which was packed with musket balls about a central charge of powder was designed to shower those balls and the scraps of its casing down onto enemy troops yet to work properly it had to explode well short of its target so that the shots forward momentum carried the lethal missiles on to the enemy and that precision demanded that the gunners cut their fuses with exquisite skill the howitzers gunner had that skill the howitzer boomed and rocked back on its trail the shell arced over the river leaving the telltale wisp of fuse smoke in its wake then exploded twenty yards short and twenty feet above the leading french gun just as it was being unlimbered the explosion tore the air red and white the bullets and shattered casing screamed down and every horse in the french team was eviscerated and every man in the french gun crew all fourteen of them was either killed or wounded while the gun itself was thrown off its carriage oh dear hill said forgetting the bloodthirsty welcome with which he had greeted the sight of the british batteries those poor fellows he said dear me the cheers of the british soldiers in the seminary were drowned by the huge bellow of the other british guns opening fire from their eyrie on the southern bank they dominated the french position and their spherical case common shells and round shot swept the french guns with dreadful effect the french gunners abandoned their pieces left their horses squealing and dying and fled and then the british guns racked their elevating screws or loosened the howitzer quoins and started to pour shot and shell into the massed ranks of the nearest french column they raked it from the flank pouring round shot through closepacked files exploding case shot over their heads and killing with a terrible ease the french officers took one panicked look at their broken artillery and ordered the infantry up the slope drummers at the heart of the two columns began their incessant rhythm and the front rank stepped off as another round shot whipped through the files to plough a red furrow in the blue uniforms men screamed and died yet still the drums beat and the men chanted their war cry vive iempereur sharpe had seen columns before and was puzzled by them the british army fought against other infantry arrayed in two ranks and every man could use his musket and if cavalry threatened they marched and wheeled into a square of four ranks and still every man could use his musket but the soldiers at the heart of the two french columns could never fire without hitting the men in front these columns both had around forty men in a rank and twenty in each file the french used such a formation a great battering block of men because it was simpler to persuade conscripts to advance in such an array and because against badly trained troops the very sight of such a great mass of men was daunting but against redcoats it was suicide vive iempereur the french shouted in rhythm with the drums though their shout was halfhearted because both formations were climbing steep slopes and the men were breathless god save our good king george general hill sang in a surprisingly fine tenor voice long live our noble george dont shoot too high he sang the last four words and the men on the roof grinned hagman hauled back the flint of his rifle and sighted on a french officer who was laboring up the slope with a sword in his hand sharpes riflemen were on the northern wing of the seminary facing the column that was not being flayed by the british guns on the convent terrace a new battery had just deployed low on the rivers southern bank and it was adding its fire to the two batteries on the convent hill but none of the british guns could see the northern column which would have to be thrown back by rifle and musket fire alone vicentes portuguese were manning the loopholes on the northern garden wall and by now there were so many men in the seminary that every loophole had three or four men so that each could fire then step back to reload while another took his place sharpe saw that some of the redcoats had green facings and cuffs the berkshires he thought which meant the whole of the buffs were in the building and new battalions were now arriving aim at the officers sharpe called to his riflemen muskets dont fire this order is for rifles only he made the distinction because a musket fired at this range was a wasted shot but his riflemen would be lethal he waited a second took a breath fire hagmans officer jerked back both arms in the air sword cartwheeling back over the column another officer was down on his knees clutching his belly and a third was holding his shoulder the front of the column stepped over the corpse and the bluecoated line seemed to shudder as more bullets slammed into them and then the long leading french ranks panicked by the whistle of rifled bullets about their ears fired up at the seminary the volley was earsplitting the smoke smothered the slope like sea fog and the musket balls rattled on the seminary walls and shattered its glass windows the volley at least served to hide the french for a few yards but then they reappeared through the smoke and more rifles fired and another officer went down the column divided to pass the solitary tree then the long ranks reunited when they were past it the men in the garden began firing then the redcoats crammed into the seminary windows and arrayed with sharpes men on the roof pulled their triggers muskets crashed smoke thickened the balls plucked at men in the columns front ranks and put them down and the men advancing behind lost their cohesion as they tried not to step on their dead or wounded colleagues fire low a sergeant of the buffs called to his men dont waste his majestys lead colonel waters was carrying spare canteens about the roof for men who were parched by biting the cartridges the saltpeter in the gunpowder dried the mouth fast and men gulped the water between shots the column attacking the seminarys western face was already shredded those frenchmen were being assailed by rifle and musket fire but the cannonade from the southern bank of the river was far worse gunners had rarely been offered such an easy target the chance to rake the flank of an enemys infantry column and they worked like demons spherical case cracked in the air shooting fiery strands of smoke in crazy trajectories round shots bounced and hammered through the ranks and shells exploded in the columns heart three drummers were hit by case shot then a round shot whipped the head off another drummer boy and when the instruments went silent the infantrymen lost heart and began to edge backward musket volleys spat from the seminarys three upper floors and the big building now looked as though it was on fire because powder smoke was writhing thick from every window the loopholes fetted flame the balls struck wavering ranks and then the french in the western column began to retreat faster and the backward movement turned to panic and they broke some of the french instead of retreating to the cover of the houses on the valleys far side houses that were even now being struck by round shot so that their rafters and masonry were being splintered and the first fires were burning in the wreckage ran to join the northern attack which was shielded by the seminary from the cannon fire that northern column kept coming it was taking dreadful punishment but it was soaking up the bullets and musket balls and the sergeants and officers continually pushed men into the front ranks to replace the dead and the wounded and so the column came ponderously uphill but no one in the french ranks had really thought what they would do when they reached the hilltop where there was no door facing them they would have to skirt the building and try to break through the big gates leading to the garden and when the men in the front ranks saw no place to go they simply stopped advancing and began shooting instead a ball plucked at sharpes sleeve a newly arrived lieutenant of the northamptonshire regiment fell back with a sigh a bullet in his forehead he lay on his back dead before he fell looking strangely peaceful the redcoats had placed their cartridges and propped their ramrods on the redtiled parapet to make loading quicker but there were now so many on the roof that they jostled each other as they fired down into the dim mass of frenchmen who were wreathed in their own smoke one frenchman ran bravely forward to fire through a loophole but he was hit before he could reach the wall sharpe had fired one shot then he just watched his men pendleton and perkins the youngest were grinning as they fired cooper and tongue were reloading for hagman knowing he was a better shot and the old poacher was calmly picking off one man after the other a cannonball screamed overhead and sharpe twisted round to see that the french had placed a battery on the hill to the west at the citys edge there was a small chapel there with a bell tower and sharpe saw the bell tower vanish in smoke then crumble into ruin as the british batteries at the convent hammered the newly arrived french guns a berkshire man turned to watch and a bullet whipped through his mouth mangling his teeth and tongue and he swore incoherently spitting a stream of blood dont watch the city sharpe bellowed keep shooting keep shooting hundreds of frenchmen were firing muskets uphill and the vast majority of the shots were simply wasted against stone walls but some found targets dodd had a flesh wound in his left arm but he kept firing a redcoat was hit in the throat and choked to death the solitary tree on the northern slope was twitching as it was struck by bullets and shreds of leaf were flying away with the french musket smoke a sergeant of the buffs fell back with a bullet in his ribs and then sir edward paget sent men from the western side of the roof who had already seen their column defeated to add their fire to the northern side the muskets flared and coughed and spat down the smoke thickened and sir edward grinned at daddy hill brave bastards sir edward had to shout over the noise of muskets and rifles they wont stand ned hill called back they wont stand hill was right the first frenchmen were already backing down the hill because of the futility of shooting at stone walls sir edward exultant at this easy victory went to the parapet to look at the retreating enemy and he stood there gold braid catching the smokedimmed sun watching the enemy column disintegrate and run away but a few stubborn frenchmen still fired and suddenly sir edward gasped clapped a hand to his elbow and sharpe saw that the sleeve of the generals elegant red coat was torn and that a jagged piece of white bone was showing through the ripped wool and bloody mangled flesh jesus paget swore he was in terrible pain the ball had shattered his elbow and seared up through his biceps he was half bent over with the agony and very pale take him down to the doctors hill ordered youll be all right ned paget forced himself to stand straight an aide had taken off a neckcloth and was trying to bind his generals wound but paget shook him off the command is yours he said to hill through clenched teeth so it is hill acknowledged keep firing sharpe shouted at his men it did not matter that the rifle barrels were almost too hot to touch what mattered was to drive the remaining french back down the hill or better still to kill them another rush of feet announced that more reinforcements had arrived at the seminary for the french had yet to find any way of stopping the traffic across the river the british artillery kings of this battlefield were hammering any french gunner who dared show his face every few moments a brave french crew would run to the abandoned guns on the quay in hope of putting a round shot into one of the barges but every time they were struck by spherical case and even by canister for the new british battery down at the waters edge was close enough to use the deadly ammunition across the river the musket balls flared from the cannons mouths like duck shot killing six or seven men at a time and after a while the french gunners abandoned their efforts and just hid in the houses at the back of the quay and then quite suddenly there were no frenchmen firing on the northern slope the grass was horrid with dead men and wounded men and with fallen muskets and with little flickering fires where the musket wadding had set light to the grass but the survivors had fled to the amarante road in the valley the single tree looked as though it had been attacked by locusts a drum trundled down the hill making a rattling noise sharpe saw a french flag through the smoke but could not see whether the staff was topped by an eagle stop firing hill called clean your barrels sharpe shouted check your flints for the french would be back of that he was certain they would be back chapter more men came to the seminary a score of portuguese civilians arrived with hunting guns and bags of ammunition escorted by a plump priest who was cheered by the redcoats when he arrived in the garden with a bellmouthed blunderbuss like those carried by stagecoach drivers to repel highwaymen the buffs had relit the fires in the kitchens and now fetched great metal cauldrons of tea or hot water to the roof the tea cleaned out the soldiers throats and the hot water swilled out their muskets and rifles ten boxes of spare ammunition were also carried up and harper filled his shako with the cartridges which were not as fine as those supplied for the rifles but would do in a pinch and this is what you call a pinch sir eh he asked distributing the cartridges along the parapet where the rifles and ramrods leaned the french were thickening in the low ground to the north if they had any sense sharpe thought the enemy would bring mortars to that low ground but so far none had appeared perhaps all the mortars were to the west of the city guarding against the royal navy and too far away to be fetched quickly extra loopholes were battered through the gardens northern wall two of the northamptonshires had manhandled a great pair of rain butts to the wall and propped the door of the garden shed across the barrels tops to make a fire step from which they could shoot over the walls coping harris brought sharpe a mug of tea then looked left and right before producing a leg of cold chicken from his cartridge box thought you might like this as well sir where did you get it found it sir harris said vaguely and i got one for you too sarge harris gave a leg to harper then produced a breast for himself brushed some loose powder from it and bit into it hungrily sharpe discovered he was famished and the chicken tasted delicious where did it come from he insisted i think they were general pagets dinner sir harris confessed but hes probably lost his appetite i should think he has sharpe said and a pity to let good chicken waste eh he turned as a drumbeat sounded and saw the french were forming their ranks again but this time only on the northern side of the seminary to your places he called chucking the chicken bone far out into the garden a few of the french were now carrying ladders presumably plundered from the houses that were being battered by the british guns when they come he called aim for the men with the ladders even without the rifle fire he doubted the french could get close enough to place the ladders against the garden wall but it did no harm to make certain most of his riflemen had used the lull in the fight to load their newly cleaned barrels with leatherwrapped balls and prime powder which meant their first shots ought to be lethally accurate after that as the french pressed closer and the noise rose and the smoke thickened they would use cartridges leave the leather patches in their butt traps and so sacrifice accuracy for speed sharpe now loaded his own rifle using a patch but no sooner had he returned the ramrod to its slots than general hill was beside him ive never fired a rifle hill said very like a musket sir sharpe said embarrassed at being singled out by a general may i hill reached for the weapon and sharpe yielded it its rather beautiful hill said wistfully caressing the bakers flank not nearly as cumbersome as a musket its a lovely thing sharpe said fervently hill aimed the gun down the hill seemed about to cock and fire then suddenly handed it back to sharpe id dearly like to try it he said but if i missed my aim then the whole army would know about it eh and id never live that down he spoke loudly and sharpe understood he had been an unwitting participant in a little piece of theater hill had not really been interested in the rifle but rather in taking the mens minds away from the threat beneath them in the process he had subtly flattered them by suggesting they could do something he could not and he had left them grinning sharpe thought about what he had just seen he admired it but he also admired sir arthur wellesley who would never have resorted to such a display sir arthur would ignore the men and the men in turn would fight like demons to gain his grudging approval sharpe had never wasted much time worrying why some men were born to be officers and others not he had jumped the gap but that did not make the system any less unfair yet to complain of the worlds unfairness was the same as grumbling that the sun was hot or that the wind sometimes changed its direction unfairness existed it always had and it always would and the miracle to sharpes eyes was that some men like hill and wellesley though they had become wealthy and privileged through unfair advantages were nevertheless superb at what they did not all generals were good many were downright bad but sharpe had usually been lucky and found himself commanded by men who knew their business sharpe did not care that sir arthur wellesley was the son of an aristocrat and had purchased his way up the ladder of promotion and was as cold as a lawyers sense of charity the longnosed bugger knew how to win and that was what mattered and what mattered now was to beat these frenchmen the column much larger than the first was surging forward driven by the drumsticks the frenchmen cheered perhaps to give themselves confidence and they must have been encouraged by the fact that the british guns on the rivers far side could not see them but then provoking a british cheer a spherical case shot fired by a howitzer exploded just ahead of the columns center the british gunners were firing blind arching their shots over the seminary but they were firing well and their first shot killed the french cheering dead rifles only sharpe called fire when youre ready dont waste the patch hagman go for that big man with the saber i see him sir hagman said and shifted his rifle to aim at the officer who was striding ahead setting an example asking to be rifle meat look for the ladders sharpe reminded the others then walked to the parapet put his left foot on the coping and the rifle to his shoulder he aimed at a man with a ladder sighting on the mans head in the expectation that the bullet would fall to take him in the lower belly or groin the wind was in sharpes face so would not drift the shot he fired and was immediately blinded by the smoke hagman fired next then there was the crackle of the other rifles the muskets kept silent sharpe went to his left to see past the smoke and saw that the sabercarrying officer had vanished as had any other man struck by a bullet they had been swallowed by the advancing column that stepped over and past the victims then sharpe saw a ladder reappear as it was snatched up by a man in the fourth or fifth rank he felt in his cartridge box for another round and began to reload he did not look at the rifle as he reloaded he just did what he had been trained to do what he could do in his sleep and just as he primed the rifle so the first musket balls were shot from the garden wall then the muskets opened fire from the windows and roof and the seminary was again wreathed in smoke and noise the cannon shots rumbled above so close that sharpe almost ducked once and the case shot banged above the slope bullets and musket balls ripped into the french files close to a thousand men were in the seminary now and they were protected by stone walls and given a wide open target sharpe fired another shot down the hill then walked up and down behind his men watching slattery needed a new flint and sharpe gave him one then tarrants mainspring broke and sharpe replaced the weapon with williamsons old rifle which harper had been carrying ever since they left vila real de zedes the enemys drums sounded nearer and sharpe reloaded his own rifle as the first french musket bullets rattled against the seminarys stones theyre firing blind sharpe told his men firing blind dont waste your shots look for targets that was difficult because of the smoke hanging over the slope but vagaries of wind sometimes stirred the fog to reveal blue uniforms and the french were close enough for sharpe to see faces he aimed at a man with an enormous mustache fired and lost sight of the man as the smoke blossomed from his rifles muzzle the noise of the fight was awesome muskets crackling incessantly the drumbeats thumping the case shots banging overhead and beneath all that violence was the sound of men crying in distress a redcoat slumped down near harper blood puddling by his head until a sergeant dragged the man away from the parapet leaving a smear of bright red on the roofs lead far offit had to be on the rivers southern banka band was playing the drum major and sharpe tapped his rifles butt in time to the tune a french ramrod came whirling through the air to clatter against the seminary wall evidently fired by a conscript who had panicked and pulled his trigger before he cleared his barrel sharpe remembered how in flanders at his very first battle as a redcoated private a mans musket had misfired but he had gone on reloading pulling the trigger reloading and when they drilled out his musket after the battle they found sixteen useless charges crammed down the barrel what was the mans name he had been from norfolk despite being in a yorkshire regiment and he had called everyone bor sharpe could not remember the name and it annoyed him a musket ball whipped past his face another hit the parapet and shattered a tile down in the garden vicentes men and the redcoats were not aiming their muskets but just pushing the muzzles into the loopholes pulling the triggers and getting out of the way so the next man could use the embrasure there were some greenjackets in the garden now and sharpe guessed a company of the th the royal american rifles must be attached to hills brigade and was now joining the fight they would do better he thought to climb to the roof than try to fire their bakers through the loopholes the single tree on the northern slope was thrashing as though in a gale and there was scarcely one leaf left on its splintered branches smoke drifted through the winterbare twigs that twitched continually from the bullet strikes sharpe primed his rifle put it to his shoulder looked for a target saw a knot of blue uniforms very close to the garden wall and put the bullet into them the air hissed with bullets god damn it but why didnt the bastards pull back a brave group of frenchmen tried to run down the seminarys western face to reach the big gate but the british guns at the convent saw them and the shells cracked black and red smearing blood across the paved terrace and up the garden walls whitewashed stones sharpe saw his men grimacing as they tried to force the new bullets down the powderfouled barrels there was no time to clean the rifles they just hammered the bullets down and pulled the trigger fire and fire again and the french were doing the same a mad duel of bullets and above the smoke across the northern valley sharpe saw a horde of new french infantry streaming out of the city two men in shirtsleeves were carrying boxes of ammunition round the roof who needs it they shouted sounding like london street traders fresh lead who needs it fresh lead new powder one of general hills aides was carrying canteens of water to the parapet while hill himself redfaced and anxious stood close to the redcoats so he was seen to share their danger he caught sharpes gaze and offered a grimace as if to suggest that this was harder work than he had anticipated more troops came to the roof men with fresh muskets and full cartridge boxes and with them were the riflemen of the th whose officer must have realized he had been in the wrong place he gave sharpe a companionable nod then ordered his men to the parapet flames jetted down smoke thickened and still the french tried to blast their way through stone walls with nothing but musket fire two frenchmen succeeded in scaling the garden wall but hesitated at the top and were seized and dragged across the coping to be battered to death by musket butts on the path beneath seven dead redcoats were laid out on another gravel path their hands curling in death and the blood of their wounds slowly hardening and turning black but most of the british dead were in the seminarys corridors dragged away from the big windows that made the best targets for the frustrated french a whole new column was now climbing the slope coming to swell the shattered ranks of the first but though the beleaguered men in the seminary could not know it these newcomers were the symptom of french defeat marshal soult desperate for fresh troops to attack the seminary had stripped the city itself of infantry and the people of oporto finding themselves unguarded for the first time since the end of march swarmed down to the river and dragged their boats out of warehouses shops and backyards where the occupiers had kept them under guard a swarm of those small craft now rowed across the river past the shattered remnants of the pontoon bridge to the quays of vila nova de gaia where the brigade of guards was waiting an officer peered anxiously across the douro to reassure himself that the french were not waiting in ambush on the opposite quay then shouted at his men to embark the guards were rowed back to the city and still more boats appeared and more redcoats crossed soult did not know it but his city was filling with the enemy nor did the men attacking the seminary know it not till the redcoats appeared at the citys eastern edge and by then the second giant column had climbed into the death storm of bullets flicking from the seminarys walls roof and windows the noise rivaled that of trafalgar where sharpe had been dazed by the incessant boom of the great ships guns but this noise was higher pitched as the muskets discharges blended into an eerie hardedged shriek the higher slope of the seminary hill was sodden with blood and the surviving frenchmen were using the bodies of their dead comrades as protection a few drummers still tried to drive the broken columns on but then came a shout of alarm from a french sergeant and the shout spread and suddenly the smoke was dissipating and the slope emptying as the french saw the brigade of guards advancing across the valley the french ran they had fought bravely going against stone walls with muskets but now they panicked and all discipline vanished as they ran for the road going east toward amarante other french forces cavalry and artillery among them were hurrying from the higher part of the city escaping the flood of redcoats ferried across the douro and fleeing the revenge of the townsfolk who hunted up the alleys and streets to find wounded frenchmen whom they attacked with fishfilleting knives or battered with clubs there was screaming and howling in oportos streets but only a strange silence in the bulletscarred seminary then general hill cupped his hands follow them he shouted follow them i want a pursuit rifles to me sharpe called he held his men back from the pursuit they had already endured enough he reckoned and it was time to give them a rest clean your guns he ordered them and so they stayed as the redcoats and riflemen of the st brigade formed ranks outside the seminary and then marched away eastward a score of dead men were left on the roof there were long streaks of blood showing where they had been pulled away from the parapet the smoke about the building slowly cleared until the air felt clean again the slopes beneath the seminary were strewn with discarded french packs and french bodies not all of them dead a wounded man crawled away between the bloodspattered blossoms of ragweed a dog sniffed at a corpse ravens came on black wings to taste the dead and women and children hurried from the houses in the valley to begin the plunder a wounded man tried to twitch away from a girl who could not have been more than eleven and she drew a butchering knife from her apron belt a knife that had been sharpened so often that its blade was little more than a whisper of thin steel attached to a bone handle and she sliced it across the frenchmans throat then grimaced because his blood had splashed onto her lap her little sister was dragging six muskets by their slings the small fires started by wadding smoked between the corpses where the plump portuguese priest the blunderbuss still in one hand made the sign of the cross over the frenchmen he had helped to kill while the living french in panicked disarray ran and the city of oporto had been recaptured the letter addressed to richard sharpe esq was waiting on the mantel of the parlor in the house beautiful and it was a miracle it had survived because that afternoon a score of royal artillery gunners made the house into their billet and the first thing they did was to break up the parlors furniture to make a fire and the letter was an ideal piece of kindling but then captain hogan arrived just before the fire was lit and managed to retrieve the paper he had come looking for sharpe and had asked the gunners if any messages had been left in the house thinking sharpe might have left one english folk live here lads he told the gunners as he opened the unsealed letter so wipe your feet and clean up behind yourselves he read the brief message and thought for a while i suppose none of you have seen a tall rifle officer from the th no well if he shows up tell him to go to the palacio das carrancas the what sir a gunner asked big building down the hill hogan explained headquarters hogan knew sharpe was alive for colonel waters had told him of meeting sharpe that morning but though hogan roamed the streets he had not found sharpe and so a pair of orderlies were sent to search the city for the stray rifleman a new pontoon bridge was already being floated across the douro the city was free again and it celebrated with flags wine and music hundreds of french prisoners were under guard in a warehouse and a long row of captured french guns was parked on the rivers quay where the british merchant ships that had been captured when the city fell now flew their own flags again marshal soult and his army had marched away east toward the bridge at amarante that the french had captured so recently and they were blissfully unaware that general beresford the new commander of the portuguese army had recaptured the bridge and was waiting for them if they cant cross at amarante wellesley demanded that evening then where will they go the question was asked in the blue reception room of the palacio das carrancas where wellesley and his staff had eaten a meal that had evidently been cooked for marshal soult and which had been found still hot in the palaces ovens the meal had been lamb which sir arthur liked but so tricked out with onions scraps of ham and mushrooms that its taste had been quite spoiled for him i thought the french appreciated cooking he had grumbled then demanded that an orderly bring him a bottle of vinegar from the kitchens he had doused the lamb scraped away the offending mushrooms and onions and decided the meal was much improved now with the remnants of the meal cleared away the officers crowded about a handdrawn map that captain hogan had spread on the table sir arthur traced a finger across the map theyll want to get back to spain of course he said but how he had expected colonel waters the most senior of the exploring officers to answer the question but waters had not ridden the north country and so the colonel nodded to captain hogan the most junior officer in the room hogan had spent the weeks before soults invasion mapping the tras os montes the wild northern mountains where the roads twisted and the rivers ran fast and the bridges were few and narrow portuguese troops were even now marching to cut off those bridges and so deny the french the roads which would lead them back to their fortresses in spain and hogan now tapped the vacant space on the map north of the road from oporto to amarante if amarantes taken sir and our fellows capture braga tomorrow hogan paused and glanced at sir arthur who gave an irritable nod then soult is in a pickle a real pickle hell have to cross the serra de santa catalina and there are no carriage roads in those hills what is there wellesley asked staring at the forbidding vacancy of the map goat tracks hogan said wolves footpaths ravines and very angry peasants once he gets to here sirhe tapped the map to the north of the serra de santa catalinahes got a passable road that will take him home but to reach that road hell have to abandon his wagons his guns his carriages in fact everything that cant be carried on a man or a mules back thunder growled above the city the sound of rain began then grew heavier pelting down onto the terrace and rattling on the tall uncurtained windows damn bloody weather wellesley growled knowing it would slow down his pursuit of the beaten french it rains on the ungodly too sir hogan observed damn them as well wellesley bridled he was not sure how much he liked hogan whom he had inherited from cradock the damn man was irish for a start which reminded wellesley that he himself had been born in ireland a fact of which he was not particularly proud and the man was plainly not high born and sir arthur liked his aides to come from good families yet he recognized that prejudice as quite unreasonable and he was beginning to suspect that the quietspoken hogan had a good deal of competence while colonel waters of whom wellesley did approve spoke very warmly of the irishman so wellesley summed up the situation theyre on the road between here and amarante and they cant come back without fighting us and they cant go forward without meeting beresford so they must go north into the hills and where do they go after that to this road here sir hogan answered pointing a pencil at the map it goes from braga to chaves sir and if he manages to get past the ponte nova and reach ruivaens which is a village herehe paused to make a pencil mark on the mapthen theres a track that will take him north across the hills to montalegre and thats just a stones throw from the frontier sir arthurs aides were huddled about the dining table looking down at the candlelit map though one man a slight and pale figure dressed in elegant civilian clothes did not bother to take any interest but just stretched languidly in an armchair where he managed to convey the insulting impression that he was bored by this talk of maps roads hills and bridges and this road sir hogan went on tracing his pencil from the ponte nova to montalegre is a real devil its a twister sir you have to walk five miles to go a halfmile forward and better still sir it crosses a couple of rivers small ones but in deep gorges with quick water and that means high bridges sir and if the portuguese can cut one of those bridges then monsieur soult is lost sir hes trapped he can only lead his men across the mountains and theyll have the devil on their heels all the way god speed the portuguese wellesley grunted grimacing at the sound of the rain which he kriew would slow his allies who were advancing inland in an attempt to sever the roads by which the french could reach spain they had already cut them off at amarante but now they would need to march further north while wellesleys army fresh from its triumph at oporto would have to chase the french the british were the beaters driving their game toward the portuguese guns wellesley stared at the map you drew this hogan i did sir and its reliable it is sir sir arthur grunted if it were not for the weather he thought he would bag soult and all his men but the rain would make it a damned difficult pursuit which meant the sooner it began the better and so aides were sent with orders that would start the british army on its march at dawn then the orders given sir arthur yawned he badly needed some sleep before the morning and he was about to turn in when the big doors were thrown open and a very wet very ragged and very unshaven rifleman entered he saw general wellesley looked surprised and instinctively came to attention good god wellesley said sourly i think you know lieutenant hogan began of course i know lieutenant sharpe wellesley snapped but what i want to know is what the devil is he doing here the th arent with us hogan removed the candlesticks from the corners of the map and let it roll up thats my doing sir arthur he said calmly i found lieutenant sharpe and his men wandering like lost sheep and took them into my care and ever since hes been escorting me on my journeys to the frontier i couldnt have coped with the french patrols on my own sir arthur and mister sharpe was a great comfort wellesley while hogan offered the explanation just stared at sharpe you were lost he demanded coldly cut off sir sharpe said during the retreat to corunna yes sir sharpe said in fact his unit had been retreating toward vigo but the distinction was not important and sharpe had long learned to keep replies to senior officers as brief as possible so where the devil have you been these last few weeks wellesley asked tartly skulking yes sir sharpe said and the staff officers stiffened at the whiff of insolence that drifted through the room i ordered the lieutenant to find a young englishwoman who was lost sir hogan hurried to explain in fact i ordered him to accompany colonel christopher the mention of that name was like a whip crack no one spoke though the young civilian who had been pretending to sleep in the armchair and who had opened his eyes wide with surprise when sharpes name was first mentioned now paid very close attention he was a painfully thin young man and pallid as though he feared the sun and there was something feline almost feminine in his delicate appearance his clothes so very elegant would have been well suited to a london drawing room or a paris salon but here amidst the unwashed uniforms and suntanned officers of wellesleys staff he looked like a pampered lapdog among hounds he was sitting up straight now and staring intently at sharpe colonel christopher wellesley broke the silence so youve been with him he demanded of sharpe general cradock ordered me to stay with him sir sharpe said and took the generals order from his pouch and laid it on the table wellesley did not even glance at the paper what the devil was cradock doing he snapped christophers not even a properly commissioned officer hes a damned foreign office flunkey these last words were spat at the pale young man who rather than respond made an airily dismissive gesture with the delicate fingers of his right hand he caught sharpes eye then and turned the gesture into a small wave of welcome and sharpe realized with a start of recognition that it was lord pumphrey whom he had last met in copenhagen his lordship sharpe knew was mysteriously prominent in the foreign office but pumphrey offered no explanation of his presence in oporto as wellesley snatched up general cradocks order read it and then threw the paper down so what did christopher order you to do he asked sharpe to stay at a place called vila real de zedes sir and do what there pray be killed sir be killed sir arthur asked in a dangerous tone he knew sharpe was being impudent and though the rifleman had once saved his life sir arthur was quite ready to slap him down he brought a french force to the village sir they attacked us not very effectively it seems wellesley said sarcastically not very no sir sharpe agreed but there were twelve hundred of them sir and only sixty of us he said no more and there was silence in the big room as men worked out the odds twenty to one another peal of thunder racked the sky and a shard of lightning flickered to the west twelve hundred richard hogan asked in a voice which suggested sharpe might like to amend the figure downward there were probably more sir sharpe said stoically the st leger attacked us but they were backed up by at least one regiment of dragoons and an howitzer only the one though sir and we saw them off he stopped and no one spoke again and sharpe remembered he had not paid tribute to his ally and so turned back to wellesley i had lieutenant vicente with me sir of the th portuguese and his thirtyodd lads helped us a lot but im sorry to report he lost a couple of men and i lost a couple too and one of my men deserted sir im sorry about that there was another silence a much longer one in which the officers stared at sharpe and sharpe tried to count the candles on the big table and then lord pumphrey broke the silence you tell us lieutenant that mister christopher brought these troops to attack you yes sir pumphrey smiled did he bring them or was he brought by them he brought them sharpe said vigorously and then he had the bloody nerve to come up the hill and tell me the war was over and we ought to walk down and let the french take care of us thank you lieutenant pumphrey said with exaggerated civility there was another silence then colonel waters cleared his throat you will recall sir he said softly that it was lieutenant sharpe who provided us with our navy this morning in other words he was saying to sir arthur wellesley show some damned gratitude but sir arthur was in no mood to show gratitude he just stared at sharpe and then hogan remembered the letter that he had rescued from the house beautiful and he took it from his pocket its for you lieutenant he said holding the paper toward sharpe but it wasnt sealed and so i took the liberty of reading it sharpe unfolded the paper he is going with the french sharpe read and forcing me to accompany him and i do not want to it was signed kate and had plainly been written in a tearing hurry the him i assume hogan asked is christopher yes sir so the reason that miss savage absented herself in march hogan went on was colonel christopher yes sir she is sweet on him shes married to him sharpe said and was puzzled because lord pumphrey looked startled a few weeks earlierhogan was talking to wellesley nowcolonel christopher was courting miss savages mother does any of this ridiculous talk of romance help us determine what christopher is doing sir arthur asked with considerable asperity its amusing if nothing else pumphrey said he stood up flicked a speck of dust from a cuff and smiled at sharpe did you really say christopher married this girl he did sir then he is a bad boy lord pumphrey said happily because hes already married his lordship plainly enjoyed that revelation he married pearce courtnells daughter ten years ago in the happy belief that she was worth eight thousand a year then discovered she was hardly worth sixpence it is not i hear a contented marriage and might i observe sir arthur that lieutenant sharpes news answers our questions about colonel christophers true allegiance it does wellesley asked puzzled christopher cannot hope to survive a bigamous marriage if he intends to make his future in britain or in a free portugal lord pumphrey observed but in france or in a portugal ruled by france the french wont care how many wives he left in london but you said he wants to return i tendered a surmise that he would wish to do so pumphrey corrected the general he has after all been playing both sides of the table and if he thinks were winning then he will doubtless want to return and equally doubtless he will then deny ever marrying miss savage she might have another opinion wellesley observed dryly if shes alive to utter it which i doubt pumphrey said no sir he cannot be trusted and dare i say that my masters in london would be immensely grateful if you were to remove him from their employment thats what you want it is not what i want pumphrey contradicted wellesley and for a man of such delicate and frail appearance he did it with considerable force it is what london would want you can be certain of that wellesley asked plainly disliking pumphreys insinuations he has knowledge that would embarrass us pumphrey admitted including the foreign office codes wellesley gave his great horse neigh of a laugh hes probably given those to the french already i doubt it sir pumphrey said examining his fingernails with a slight frown a man usually holds his best cards till last and in the end christopher will want to bargain either with us or with the french and i must say that his majestys government does not wish either eventuality then i leave his fate to you my lord wellesley said with obvious distaste and as it doubtless means filthy work then id better lend you the services of captain hogan and lieutenant sharpe as for me im going to bed he nodded curtly and left the room followed by his aides clutching sheaves of paper lord pumphrey took a decanter of vinho verde from the table and crossed to his armchair where he sat with an exaggerated sigh sir arthur makes me go weak at the knees he said and pretended to be unaware of the shocked reaction on both sharpe and hogans faces did you really save his life in india richard sharpe said nothing and hogan answered for him thats why he treats sharpe so badly the irishman said nosey cant stand being beholden and especially cant stand being beholden to a misbegotten rogue like sharpe pumphrey shivered do you know what we in the foreign office dislike doing most of all going to foreign places they are so uncomfortable but here i am and i suppose we must attend to our duties sharpe had crossed to one of the tall windows where he was staring out into the wet darkness what are my duties he asked lord pumphrey poured himself a liberal glass of wine not to put too fine a point on it richard he said your duty is to find mister christopher and then he did not finish the sentence but instead drew a finger across his throat a gesture sharpe saw mirrored in the dark window who is christopher anyway sharpe wanted to know he was a thruster richard pumphrey said his voice acid with disapproval a rather clever thruster in the foreign office a thruster was a man who would bully and whip his way to the head of the field while riding to hounds and in doing so upset dozens of other hunters yet he was thought to have a very fine future pumphrey continued if he could just curb his compulsion to complicate affairs he likes intrigue does christopher the foreign office of necessity deals in secret matters and he rather indulges in such things still despite that he was reckoned to have the makings of an excellent diplomat and last year he was sent out here to determine the temper of the portuguese there were rumors happily illfounded that a large number of folk especially in the north were more than a little sympathetic to the french and christopher was merely supposed to be determining the extent of that sympathy couldnt the embassy do that hogan demanded not without being noticed pumphrey said and not without occasioning some offense to a nation which is after all our most ancient ally and i rather suspect that if you despatch someone from the embassy to ask questions then you will merely fetch the answers people think you want to hear no christopher was supposed to be an english gentleman traveling in north portugal but as you observe the opportunity went to his head cradock was then halfwitted enough to give him brevet rank and so christopher began hatching his plots lord pumphrey gazed up at the ceiling which was painted with reveling deities and dancing nymphs my own suspicion is that mister christopher has been laying bets on every horse in the race we know he was encouraging a mutiny but i strongly suspect he betrayed the mutineers the encouragement was to reassure us that he worked for our interests and the betrayal endeared him to the french he is determined is he not to be on the winning side but the main intrigue of course was to enrich himself at the expense of the savage ladies pumphrey paused then offered a seraphic smile ive always rather admired bigamists one wife would be altogether too much for me but for a man to take two did i hear you say he wants to come back sharpe asked i surmise as much james christopher is not a man to burn his bridges unless he has no alternative oh yes im sure hell be designing some way to return to london if he finds a lack of opportunity with the french now im supposed to shoot the shitfaced bastard sharpe said not precisely how we in the foreign office would express the matter lord pumphrey said severely but you are i see seized of the essence go and shoot him richard and god bless your little rifle and what are you doing here sharpe thought to ask other than being exquisitely uncomfortable pumphrey asked i was sent to supervise christopher he approached general cradock with news of a proposed mutiny cradock quite properly reported the affair to london and london became excited at the thought of suborning bonapartes army in portugal and spain but felt that someone of wisdom and good judgment was needed to propel the scheme and so quite naturally they asked me to come and we can forget the scheme now hogan observed indeed we can pumphrey replied tartly christopher brought a captain argenton to talk with general cradock he explained to sharpe and when cradock was replaced argenton made his own way across the lines to confer with sir arthur he wanted promises that our forces wouldnt intervene in the event of a french mutiny but sir arthur wouldnt hear of his plots and told him to tuck his tail between his legs and go back into the outer darkness whence he came so no plots no mysterious messengers with cloaks and daggers just plain oldfashioned soldiering it seems alas that i am surplus to requirements and mister christopher if your lady friends note is to be believed has gone with the french which must mean i think that he believes they will still win this war hogan had opened the window to smell the rain but now turned to sharpe we must go richard we have things to plan yes sir sharpe picked up his battered shako and tried to bend the visor back into shape then thought of another question my lord richard lord pumphrey responded gravely you remember astrid sharpe asked awkwardly of course i remember the fair astrid pumphrey answered smoothly ole skovgaards comely daughter i was wondering if you had news of her my lord sharpe said he was blushing lord pumphrey did have news of her but none he cared to tell sharpe for the truth was that both astrid and her father were in their graves their throats cut on pumphreys orders i did hear his lordship said gently that there was a contagion in copenhagen malaria perhaps or was it cholera alas richard he spread his hands shes dead i do fear so oh sharpe said inadequately he stood stricken blinking he had thought once that he could leave the army and live with astrid and so make a new life in the clean decencies of denmark im sorry he said as am i lord pumphrey said easily so very sorry but tell me richard about miss savage might one assume she is beautiful yes sharpe said she is i thought so lord pumphrey said resignedly and shell be dead hogan snarled at sharpe if you and me dont hurry yes sir sharpe said and hurried hogan and sharpe walked through the night rain going uphill to a schoolhouse that sharpe had commandeered as quarters for his men you do know hogan said with considerable irritation that lord pumphrey is a molly of course i know hes a molly he can be hanged for that hogan observed with indecent satisfaction i still like him sharpe said hes a serpent all diplomats are worse than lawyers he aint stuck up sharpe said there is nothing hogan said nothing in all the world that lord pumphrey wants more than to be stuck up with you richard he laughed his spirits restored and how the hell are we to find that poor wee girl and her rotten husband eh we sharpe asked youre coming too this is far too important to be left to some lowly english lieutenant hogan said this is an errand that needs the sagacity of the irish once in the schoolhouse sharpe and hogan settled in the kitchen where the french occupiers of the city had left an undamaged table and because hogan had left his good map at the generals headquarters he used a piece of charcoal to draw a cruder version on the tables scrubbed top from the main schoolroom where sharpes men had spread their blankets came the sound of womens laughter his men sharpe reflected had been in the city less than a day yet they had already found a dozen girls best way to learn the language sir harper had assured him and were all very short on education sir as you doubtless know right hogan kicked the kitchen door shut look at the map richard he showed how the british had come up the coast of portugal and dislodged the french from oporto and how at the same time the portuguese army had attacked in the east theyve retaken amarante hogan said which is good because it means soult cant cross that bridge hes stuck richard stuck so hes got no choice hell have to strike north through the hills to find a wee road up herethe charcoal scratched as he traced a wiggly line on the tableand its a bastard of a road and if the portuguese can keep going in this godawful weather then theyre going to cut the road here the charcoal made a cross its a bridge called ponte nova do you remember it sharpe shook his head he had seen so many bridges and mountain roads with hogan that he could no longer remember which was which the ponte nova hogan said means the new bridge and naturally its as old as the hills and one tub of powder will send it crashing down into the gorge and then richard monsieur soult is properly buggered but hes only buggered if the portuguese can get there he looked gloomy for the weather was not propitious for a swift march into the mountains and if they cant stop soult at the ponte nova then theres a halfchance theyll catch him at the saltador you remember that of course i do remember that sir sharpe said the saltador was a bridge high in the mountains a stone span that leaped across a deep and narrow gorge and the spectacular arch had been nicknamed the leaper the saltador sharpe remembered hogan mapping it remembered a small village of low stone houses but chiefly remembered the river tumbling in a seething torrent beneath the soaring bridge if they get to the saltador and cross it hogan said then we can kiss them goodbye and wish them luck theyll have escaped he flinched as a crash of thunder reminded him of the weather ah well he sighed we can only do our best and just what are we doing sharpe wanted to know now that richard is a very good question hogan said he helped himself to a pinch of snuff paused then sneezed violently god help me but the doctors say it clears the bronchial tubes whatever the hell they are now as i see it one of two things can happen he tapped the charcoal streak marking the ponte nova if the french are stopped at that bridge then most will surrender theyll have no choice some will take to the hills of course but theyll find armed peasants all over the place looking for throats and other parts to cut so well either find mister christopher with the army when it surrenders or more likely hell run away and claim to be an escaped english prisoner in which case we go into the mountains find him and put him up against a wall truly that worries you id rather hang him ah well we can discuss the method when the time comes now the second thing that might happen richard is that the french are not stopped at the ponte nova in which case we need to reach the saltador why think what it was like richard hogan said a deep ravine steep slopes everywhere the kind of place where a few riflemen could be very vicious and if the french are crossing the bridge then well see him and your baker rifles will have to do the necessary we can get close enough sharpe asked trying to remember the terrain about the leaping bridge there are cliffs high bluffs im sure you can get within two hundred paces thatll do sharpe said grimly so one way or another we have to finish him hogan said leaning back hes a traitor richard hes probably not as dangerous as he thinks he is but if he gets to paris then no doubt the monsewers will suck his brain dry and so learn a few things wed rather they didnt know and if he got back to london hes slippery enough to convince those fools that he was always working for their interests so all things considered richard id say he was better off dead and kate were not going to shoot her hogan said reprovingly back in march sir sharpe said you ordered me to rescue her does that order still stand hogan stared at the ceiling which was smokeblackened and pierced with lethallooking hooks in the short time ive known you richard he said ive noticed you possess a lamentable tendency to put on shining armor and look for ladies to rescue king arthur god rest his soul would have loved you hed have had you fighting every evil knight in the forest is rescuing kate savage important not really the main thing is to punish mister christopher and i fear that miss kate will have to take her chances sharpe looked down at the charcoal map how do we get to the ponte nova we walk richard we walk we cross the mountains and those tracks arent fit for horses youd spend half the time leading them worrying about their feed looking after their hooves and wishing you didnt have them mules now id saddle some mules and take them but where will we find mules tonight its either mules or shankss pony but either way we can only take a few men your best and your fittest and we have to leave before dawn what do i do with the rest of my men hogan thought about it major potter could use them he suggested to help guard the prisoners here i dont want to lose them back to shorncliffe sharpe said he feared that the second battalion would be making inquiries about their lost riflemen they might not care that lieutenant sharpe was missing but the absence of several prime marksmen would definitely be regretted my dear richard hogan said if you think sir arthurs going to lose even a few good riflemen then you dont know him half as well as you think hell move hell and high water to keep you here and you and i have to move like hell to get to ponte nova before anyone else sharpe grimaced the french have a days start on us no they dont like fools they went toward amarante which means they didnt know that the portuguese had recaptured it by now theyll have discovered their predicament but i doubt theyll start north till dawn if we hurry we beat them he frowned looking down at the map theres only one real problem i can see other than finding mister christopher when we get there a problem i can find my way to ponte nova from braga hogan said but what if the french are already on the braga road well have to take to the hills and its wild country richard an easy place to get lost we need a guide and we need to find him fast sharpe grinned if you dont mind traveling with a portuguese officer who thinks hes a philosopher and a poet then i think i know just the man im irish hogan said theres nothing we love more than philosophy and poetry hes a lawyer too if he gets us to ponte nova hogan said then god will doubtless forgive him for that the womens laughter was loud but it was time to end the party it was time for a dozen of sharpes best men to mend their boots and fill their cartridge boxes it was time for revenge chapter kate sat in a corner of the carriage and wept the carriage was going nowhere it was not even a proper carriage not half as comfortable as the quintas fragile gig that had been abandoned in oporto and nothing like as substantial as the one her mother had taken south across the river in march and how kate now wished she had gone with her mother but instead she had been stricken by romance and certain that loves fulfillment would bring her golden skies clear horizons and endless joy instead she was in a twowheeled oporto hackney with a leaking leather roof cracked springs and a brokendown gelding between its shafts and the carriage was going nowhere because the fleeing french army was stuck on the road to amarante rain seethed on the roof streaked the windows and dripped onto kates lap and she did not care she just hunched in the corner and wept the door was tugged open and christopher put his head in there are going to be some bangs he told her but theres no need to be alarmed he paused decided he could not cope with her sobbing so just closed the door then he jerked it open again theyre disabling the guns he explained thats what the noise will be kate could not have cared less she wondered what would become of her and the awfulness of her prospects was so frightening that she burst into fresh tears just as the first guns were fired muzzle to muzzle on the morning after the fall of oporto marshal soult had been woken to the appalling news that the portuguese army had retaken amarante and that the only bridge by which he could carry his guns limbers caissons wagons and carriages back to the french fortresses in spain was therefore in enemy hands one or two hotheads had suggested fighting their way across the river tamega but scouts reported that the portuguese were occupying amarante in force that the bridge had been mined and had a dozen guns now dominating its roadway that it would take a day of bitter and bloody fighting to get across and even then there would probably be no bridge left for the portuguese would doubtless blow it and soult did not have a day sir arthur wellesley would be advancing from oporto so that left him only one option which was to abandon all the armys wheeled transport every wagon every limber every caisson every carriage every mobile forge and every gun they would all have to be left behind and twenty thousand men five thousand camp followers four thousand horses and almost as many mules must do their best to scramble over the mountains but soult was not going to leave the enemy good french guns to turn against him and so the weapons were each loaded with four pounds of powder were doubleshotted and placed muzzle to muzzle gunners struggled to keep their portfires alight in the rain and then on a word of command touched the two reed fuses and the powder flashed down to the overcharged chambers the guns fired into each other leaped back in a wrenching explosion of smoke and flames and then were left with ripped torn barrels some of the gunners were weeping as they destroyed their weapons while others just cursed as they used knives and bayonets to rip open the powder bags that were left to spoil in the rain the infantry were ordered to empty their packs and haversacks of everything except food and ammunition some officers ordered inspections and insisted their men throw away the plunder of the campaign cutlery candlesticks plate all had to be abandoned by the roadside as the army took to the hills the horses oxen and mules that hauled the guns carriages and limbers were shot rather than be ceded to the enemy the animals screamed and thrashed as they died the wounded who could not walk were left in their wagons and given muskets so they could at least try to protect themselves against the portuguese who would find them soon enough and then attempt to exact revenge on helpless men soult ordered the military chest eleven great barrels of silver coins put by the road so the men could help themselves to a handful apiece as they went past the women hitched up their skirts scooped up the coins and walked with their men the dragoons hussars and chasseurs led their horses thousands of men and women were climbing into the barren hills leaving behind wagons loaded with bottles of wine with port with crosses of gold stolen from churches and with ancestral paintings plundered from the walls of northern portugals big houses the french had thought they had conquered a country that they were merely waiting for a few reinforcements to swell the ranks as they marched on lisbon and none understood why they were suddenly faced with disaster or why king nicolas was leading them on a shambolic retreat through torrential rain if you stay here christopher told kate youll be raped ive been raped she wept night after night oh for gods sake kate christopher dressed in civilian clothes was standing by the carriages open door with rain dripping from the point of his cocked hat im not leaving you here he reached in took her by the wrist and despite her screams and struggles hauled her from the carriage walk damn you he snarled and dragged her across the verge and up the slope she had only been out of the carriage a few seconds and already her blue hussar uniform which christopher had insisted she wore was soaked through this isnt the end christopher told her his grip painful on her thin wrist the reinforcements never arrived thats all but well be back kate despite her misery was struck by the we did he mean the two of them or did he mean the french i want to go home she cried stop being tedious christopher snapped and keep walking he pulled her on her new leathersoled boots slipped on the path the french are going to win this war christopher insisted he was no longer certain of that but when he weighed the balances of power in europe he managed to convince himself that it was true i want to go back to oporto kate sobbed we cant why not she tried to pull away from him and though she could not loosen his grip she did manage to bring him to a halt why not she asked we just cant he said now come on he tugged her into motion again unwilling to tell her that he could not go back to oporto because that damned man sharpe was alive good christ in his heaven but the bastard was only an overage lieutenant and one he had now learned who was up from the ranks but sharpe knew too much that was damning to christopher and so the colonel would need to find a safe haven from where by the discreet methods that he knew so well he could send a letter to london then in quiet he could judge from the reply whether london believed his story that he had been forced to demonstrate an allegiance to the french in order to engineer a mutiny that would have freed portugal and that story sounded convincing to him except that portugal was being freed anyway but all was not lost it would be his word against sharpes and christopher whatever else he might be was a gentleman and sharpe was most decidedly not there would be the delicate problem of course of what to do with kate if he was called back to london but he could probably deny that the marriage had ever taken place he would put reports of it down to kates vapors women were given to vapors it was notorious what had shakespeare said frailty thy name is woman so he would truthfully claim that the gabbled service in vila real de zedess small church was not a proper marriage and say that he had undergone it solely to save kates blushes it was a gamble he knew but he had played cards long enough to know that sometimes the most outrageous gambles paid the biggest winnings and if the gamble failed and if he could not salvage his london career then it probably would not matter for he clung to the belief that the french would surely win in the end and he would be back in oporto where for lack of any other knowledge the lawyers must account him as kates husband and he would be wealthy kate would come to terms with it she would recover when she was restored as she would be to comfort and home thus far it was true she had been unhappy her joy at the marriage turning to horror in the bedroom but young mares often rebelled against the bridle yet after a whipping or two became docile and obedient and christopher wished that outcome for kate because her beauty still thrilled him he dragged her on to where williamson now christophers servant held his horse get on its back he ordered kate i want to go home she said get up he almost hit her with the riding crop that was tucked under the saddle but then she meekly let him help her onto the horse hold on to the reins williamson christopher ordered he did not want kate turning the horse and kicking it away westward hold them tight man yes sir williamson said he was still in his riflemans uniform though he had exchanged his shako for a widebrimmed leather hat he had picked up a french musket a pistol and a saber in the retreat from oporto and the weapons made him look formidable an appearance that was a comfort to christopher the colonel had needed a servant after his own had fled but he wanted a bodyguard even more and williamson played the role superbly he told christopher tales of tavern brawls of wild fights with knives and clubs of barefisted boxing bouts and christopher lapped it up almost as eagerly as he listened to williamsons bitter complaints about sharpe in return christopher had promised williamson a golden future learn french he had advised the deserter and you can join their army show that youre good and theyll give you a commission they aint particular in the french army and if i wants to stay with you sir williamson had asked i was always a man to reward loyalty williamson christopher had said and so the two suited each other even if for now their fortunes were at a low ebb as with thousands of other fugitives they climbed into the rain were buffeted by the wind and saw nothing ahead but the hunger bleak slopes and wet rocks of the serra de santa catalina behind them on the road from oporto to amarante a sad trail of abandoned carriages and wagons stood in the downpour the wounded french watched anxiously praying that the pursuing british would appear before the peasants but the peasants were closer than the redcoats much closer and soon their dark shapes were seen flitting in the rain and in their hands were bright knives and in the rain the wounded mens muskets would not fire and so the screaming began sharpe would have liked to take hagman on his pursuit of christopher but the old poacher was not fully recovered from his chest wound and so sharpe was forced to leave him behind he took twelve men his fittest and cleverest and all complained vehemently when they were rousted out into oportos rain before dawn because their bellies were sour with wine their heads sore and their tempers short but not as short as mine sharpe warned them so dont make such a damned fuss hogan came with them as did lieutenant vicente and three of his men vicente had learned that three mail carriages were going to braga at first light and told hogan that the vehicles were notoriously fast and would be traveling on a good road the drivers carrying sacks of mail that had been waiting for the french to leave before they could be delivered to braga happily made room for the soldiers who collapsed on the mail sacks and fell asleep they passed through the remnants of the citys northern defenses in the wet halflight of dawn the road was good but the mail coaches were slowed because partisans had felled trees across the highway and each barricade took a halfhour or more to clear if the french had known amarante had fallen hogan told sharpe theyd have retreated on this road and wed never have caught them mind you we dont know that their braga garrison has left with the rest it had and the mail arrived along with a troop of british cavalry who were welcomed by cheering inhabitants whose joy could not be dampened by the rain hogan in his engineers blue coat was mistaken for a french prisoner and some horse dung was thrown at him before vicente managed to persuade the crowd that hogan was english irish hogan protested please same thing vicente said absentmindedly good god in his heaven harper said disgusted then laughed because the crowd insisted on carrying hogan on their shoulders the main road from braga went north across the frontier to pontevedra but to the east a dozen tracks climbed into the hills and one of them vicente promised would take them all the way to ponte nova but it was the same road that the french would be trying to reach and so he warned sharpe that they might have to take to the trackless hills if we are lucky vicente said we shall be at the bridge in two days and how long to the saltador hogan asked another halfday and how long will it take the french three days vicente said it must take them three days he made the sign of the cross i pray it takes them three days they spent the night in braga a cobbler repaired their boots insisting he would take no money and he used his best leather to make new soles that were studded with nails to give some grip in the wet high ground he must have worked all night for in the morning he shyly presented sharpe with leather covers for the rifles and muskets the weapons had been protected from the rain by corks shoved into their muzzles and by ragged clouts wrapped about the locks but the leather sheaths were far better the cobbler had greased the seams with sheep fat to make the covers waterproof and sharpe like his men was absurdly pleased with the gift they were given so much food that they ended up giving most of it to a priest who promised to distribute it among the poor and then in the rainlashed dawn they marched hogan rode because the mayor of braga had presented him with a mule a surefooted beast with a vile temper and a wall eye which hogan saddled with a blanket and then rode with his feet almost touching the ground he suggested using the mule to carry their weapons but of all the party he was the oldest and the least spry and so sharpe insisted he ride ive no idea what well find hogan told sharpe as they climbed into the rockstrewn hills if the bridge at ponte nova has been blown as it should have been by now then the french will scatter theyll just be running for their lives and well be hard put to find mister christopher in all that chaos still we must try and if it hasnt been blown well cross that bridge when we come to it hogan said and laughed ah jesus i do hate this rain have you ever tried taking snuff in the rain richard its like sniffing up cat vomit they walked eastward through a wide valley edged by high pale hills that were crowned with gray boulders the road lay to the south of the river cavado which ran clear and deep through rich pastureland that had been plundered by the french so that no cattle or sheep grazed the spring grass the villages had once been prosperous but were now almost deserted and the few folk who remained were wary hogan like vicente and his men wore blue and that was also the color of the enemys coats while the riflemens green jackets could be mistaken for the uniforms of dismounted french dragoons most people if they expected anything thought the british wore red and so sergeant macedo anticipating the confusion had found a portuguese flag in braga that he carried on a pole hacked from an ash tree the flag showed a wreathed crest of portugal surmounted by a great golden crown and it reassured those folk who recognized the emblem not all did but once the villagers had spoken with vicente they could not do enough for the soldiers for gods sake sharpe told vicente tell them to hide their wine theyre friendly sure enough harper said as they left another small settlement where the dungheaps were bigger than the cottages not like the spanish they could be cold not all of them but some were bastards the spanish dont like the english hogan told him they dont like the english harper asked surprised so theyre not bastards after all then just wary eh but are you saying sir that the portuguese do like the english the portuguese hogan said hate the spanish and when you have a bigger neighbor whom you detest then you look for a big friend to help you so whos irelands big friend sir god sergeant hogan said god dear lord above harper said piously staring into the rainy sky for christs sake wake up why dont you fight for the bloody french harris snarled enough sharpe snapped they marched in silence for a while then vicente could not contain his curiosity if the irish hate the english he asked why do they fight for them harper chuckled at the question hogan raised his eyes to the gray heavens and sharpe just scowled the road now that they were far from braga was less well maintained grass grew down its center between ruts made by ox carts the french had not scavenged this far and there were a few flocks of bedraggled sheep and some small herds of cattle but as soon as a herdsman or shepherd saw the soldiers he hustled his beasts away vicente was still puzzled and having failed to elicit an answer from his companions tried again i really do not understand he said in a very earnest voice why the irish would fight for the english king harris drew a breath as if to reply but one savage look from sharpe made him change his mind harper began to whistle over the hills and far away then could not help laughing at the strained silence that was at last broken by hogan its hunger the engineer explained to vicente hunger and poverty and desperation and because theres precious little work for a good man at home and because weve always been a people that enjoy a good fight vicente was intrigued by the answer and that is true for you captain he asked not for me hogan allowed my familys always had some money not much but we never had to scratch in thin soil to raise our daily bread no i joined the army because i like being an engineer i like practical things and this was the best way to do what i liked but someone like sergeant harper he glanced at harper i dare say hes here because hed be starving otherwise true harper said and you hate the english vicente asked harper careful sharpe growled i hate the bloody ground the bastards walk on sir harper said cheerfully then saw vicente cast a bewildered glance at sharpe i didnt say i hated them all harper added life is complicated hogan said vaguely i mean theres a portuguese legion in the french army i hear vicente looked embarrassed they believe in french ideas sir ah ideas hogan said theyre much more dangerous than big or little neighbors i dont believe in fighting for ideashe shook his head ruefullyand nor does sergeant harper i dont harper asked no you bloody dont sharpe snarled so what do you believe in vicente wanted to know the trinity sir harper said sententiously the trinity vicente was surprised the baker rifle sharpe said the sword bayonet and me those too harper acknowledged and laughed what it is hogan tried to help vicente is that its like being in a house where theres an unhappy marriage and you ask a question about fidelity you cause embarrassment no one wants to talk about it harris sharpe warned seeing the redheaded rifleman open his mouth i was only going to say sir harris said that theres a dozen horsemen on that hill over there sharpe turned just in time to see the horsemen vanish across the crest the rain was too thick and the light too poor to see if they were in uniform but hogan suggested the french might well have sent cavalry patrols far ahead of their retreat theyll be wanting to know whether weve taken braga he explained because if we hadnt then theyd turn this way and try to escape up to pontevedra sharpe gazed at the far hill if theres bloody cavalry about he said then i dont want to be caught on the road it was the one place in a nightmare landscape where horsemen would have an advantage so to avoid enemy horsemen they struck north into the wilderness it meant crossing the cavado which they managed at a deep ford which led only to the high summer pastures sharpe continually looked behind but saw no sign of the horsemen the path climbed into a wild land the hills were steep the valleys deep and the high ground bare of anything except gorse ferns thin grass and vast rounded boulders some balanced on others so precariously that they looked as if a childs touch would send them bounding down the precipitous slopes the grass was fit only for a few tanglehaired sheep and scores of feral goats on which the mountain wolves and wild lynx fed the only village they passed was a poor place with high rock walls about its small vegetable gardens goats were hobbled on pastures the size of inn yards and a few bony cattle stared at the soldiers as they passed they climbed still higher listening to the goat bells among the rocks and passing a small shrine heaped with faded gorse blossom vicente crossed himself as he passed the shrine they turned eastward again following a stony ridge where the great rounded boulders would make it impossible for any cavalry to form and charge and sharpe kept watching southwards and saw nothing yet there had been horsemen and there would be more for he was making a rendezvous with a desperate army that had been bounced from imminent success to abject defeat in one swift day it was hard traveling in the hills they rested every hour then trudged on all were soaked tired and chilled the rain was relentless and the wind had now gone into the east so that it came straight into their faces the rifle slings rubbed their wet shoulders raw but at least the rain lifted that afternoon even if the wind stayed brisk and cold at dusk feeling as weary as he ever had on the terrible retreat to vigo sharpe led them down from the ridge to a small deserted hamlet of low stone cottages roofed with turf just like home harper said happily the driest places to sleep were two long coffinshaped granaries that protected their contents from rats by being raised on mushroomshaped stone pillars and most of the men crammed themselves into the narrow spaces while sharpe hogan and vicente shared the least damaged cottage where sharpe conjured a fire from damp kindling and brewed tea the most essential skill of a soldier hogan said when sharpe brought him the tea whats that vicente asked ever eager to learn his new trade making fire from wet wood hogan said arent you supposed to have a servant sharpe asked i am but so are you richard im not one for servants sharpe said nor am i hogan said but youve done a grand job with that tea richard and if his majesty ever decides he doesnt want a london rogue to be one of his officers then ill give you a job as a servant picquets were set more tea brewed and moist tobacco coaxed alight in clay pipes hogan and vicente began an impassioned argument about a man called hume of whom sharpe had never heard and who turned out to be a dead scottish philosopher but as it seemed the dead scotsman had proposed that nothing was certain sharpe wondered why anyone bothered to read him let alone argue about him yet the notion diverted hogan and vicente sharpe bored with the talk left them to their debate and went to inspect the picquets it started to rain again then peals of thunder shook the sky and lightning whipped into the high rocks sharpe crouched with harris and perkins in a cavelike shrine where some faded flowers lay in front of a sadlooking statue of the virgin mary jesus bloody wept harper announced himself as he splashed through the downpour and we could be tucked up with those ladies in oporto he crammed himself in beside the three men i didnt know you were here sir he said i brought the boys some picquet juice he had a wooden canteen of hot tea jesus he went on you cant see a bloody thing out there weather like home sergeant perkins asked what would you know lad in donegal now the sun never stops shining the women all say yes and both the gamekeepers have wooden legs he gave perkins the canteen and peered into the wet dark how are we going to find your fellow in this sir god knows if we do does it matter now i want my telescope back jesus mary and joseph harper said youre going to wander into the middle of the french army and ask for it something like that sharpe said all day he had been besieged by a sense of the futility of the effort but that was no reason not to make the effort and it seemed right to him that christopher should be punished sharpe believed that a mans loyalties were at his roots that they were immovable but christopher evidently believed they were negotiable that was because christopher was clever and sophisticated and if sharpe had his way he would soon be dead the dawn was cold and wet they climbed back up to the boulderstrewn heights leaving behind the valley which was filled with mist the rain was soft now but still in their faces sharpe led and saw nobody and still saw nobody even when a musket banged and a cloud of smoke blossomed beside a rock and he dived for cover as the bullet smacked on a boulder and whined into the sky everyone else sheltered except for hogan who was stranded on his ugly mule but hogan had the presence of mind to shout ingles he called ingles he was half on and half off the mule fearing another bullet but hoping his claim to be english would prevent it a figure in ragged goatskins appeared from behind the rock the man had a vast beard no teeth and a wide grin vicente called to him and the two had a rapid conversation at the end of which vicente turned to hogan he calls himself javali and says he is sorry but he did not know we were friends he asks you to forgive him javali hogan asked it means wild boar vicente sighed every man in this countryside gives himself a nickname and looks for a frenchman to kill theres just one of him sharpe asked just the one then hes either bloody stupid or bloody brave sharpe said then succumbed to an embrace from javali and a gust of foulsmelling breath the mans musket looked ancient the wooden stock which was bound to the barrel by oldfashioned iron hoops was split and the hoops themselves were rusted and loose but javali had a canvas bag filled with loose powder and an assortment of differently sized musket balls and he insisted on accompanying them when he learned there might be frenchmen to kill he had a wickedlooking curved knife stuck into his belt and a small axe hanging by a fraying piece of string sharpe walked on javali talked incessantly and vicente translated some of his story his real name was andrea and he was a goatherd from bouro he had been an orphan since he was six and he thought he was now twentyfive years old though he looked much older and he worked for a dozen families by protecting their animals from lynx and wolves and he had lived with a woman he said proudly but the dragoons had come and they had raped her when he was not there and his woman had possessed a temper he said worse than a goats and she must have drawn a knife on her rapists for they had killed her javali did not seem very upset by his womans death but he was still determined to avenge her he patted the knife and then tapped his groin to show what he had in mind javali at least knew the quickest ways through the high ground they were traveling well to the north of the road they had left when harris spotted the horsemen and that road led through the wide valley that now narrowed as it went eastward the cavado twisted beside the road sometimes vanishing in stands of trees while streams fed by the rain tumbled from the hills to swell the river vicentes estimate of two days was ruined by the weather and they spent the next night high in the hills half protected from the rain by the great boulders and in the morning they walked on and sharpe saw how the river valley had nearly narrowed to nothing by midmorning they were overlooking salamonde and then looking back up the valley where the last of the morning mist was vanishing they saw something else they saw an army it came in a swarm along the road and in the fields either side of the road a great spread of men and horses in no particular order a horde that was trying to escape from portugal and from the british army that was now pursuing them from braga well have to hurry hogan said itll take them hours to get up that road sharpe said nodding toward the village that was built where the valley finally narrowed into a defile from where the road instead of running on level land twisted beside the river into the hills for the moment the french could spread themselves in fields and march with a broad front but once past salamonde they were restricted to the narrow and deeprutted road sharpe borrowed hogans good telescope and stared down at the french army some units he could see marched in good order but most were straggling loosely there were no guns wagons or carriages so that if marshal soult did manage to escape he would have to crawl back into spain and explain to his master how he had lost everything of value there must be twenty thirty thousand down there he said in wonderment as he handed back hogans glass itll take them the best part of the day to get through that village but theyve got the devil on their heels hogan pointed out and that encourages a man to swiftness they pressed on a weak sun at last lit the pale hills though gray showers fell to north and south behind them the french were a great dark mass pressing up against the valleys narrow end where like grains of sand trickling through an hourglass they streamed through salamonde smoke rose from the village as the passing troops plundered and burned the french road to safety began to climb now it followed the defile made by the whitewatered cavado which twisted out of the hills in great loops and sometimes leaped down series of precipices in misted waterfalls a squadron of dragoons led the french retreat riding ahead to smell out any partisans who might try to ambush the vast column if the dragoons saw hogan and his men high on the northern hills they made no effort to reach them for the riflemen and portuguese soldiers were too far away and much too high and then the french had other things to worry about for late in the afternoon the dragoons arrived at the ponte nova sharpe was already above the ponte nova gazing down at the bridge it was here that the french retreat might be stopped for the tiny village that clung to the high ground just beyond the bridge bristled with men and on first seeing the ponte nova from high in the hills hogan had been jubilant weve done it he said weve done it but then he trained his telescope on the bridge and his good mood died theyre ordenanqa he said not a proper uniform there he gazed for another minute theres not a single bloody gun he said bitterly and the bloody fools havent even destroyed the bridge sharpe borrowed hogans glass to stare at the bridge it possessed two hefty stone abutments one on each bank and the river was spanned by two great beams over which a wooden roadway had once been laid the ordenanqa presumably not wanting to rebuild the bridge entirely once the french were defeated had removed the plank roadway but left the two enormous beams in place then at the edge of the village on the bridges eastern side they had dug trenches from which they could smother the halfdismantled bridge with musket fire it might serve sharpe grunted and what would you do if you were the french hogan asked sharpe stared down into the defile then looked back westward he could see the dark snake of the french army coming along the road but further back there was no sign yet of any british pursuit wait till dark he said then attack across the beams the ordenanqa was enthusiastic but it was little more than a rabble ill armed and with scarce any training and such troops might easily be panicked worse there were not many ordenanqa at the ponte nova there would have been more than enough if the bridge had been fully broken but the twin beams were an invitation to the french sharpe trained the telescope on the bridge again those beams are wide enough to walk on he said theyll attack in the night hope to catch the defenders sleeping lets just hope the ordenanga stay awake hogan said he slid off the mule and what we do he said is wait wait if they are stopped here hogan explained then this is as good a place as any to watch out for mister christopher and if they get across he shrugged i should go down there sharpe said and tell them to get rid of those beams and how will they accomplish it hogan wanted to know with dragoons firing at them from the other bank the dragoons had dismounted and spread along the western bank and hogan could see the white puffs of their carbine smoke its too late to help richard he said too late you stay here they made a rough camp in the boulders night fell swiftly because the rain had come again and the clouds shrouded the setting sun sharpe let his men light fires so they could brew tea the french would see the fires but that did not matter for as the darkness shrouded the hills a myriad flames showed in the high grounds the partisans were gathering they were coming from all across northern portugal to help destroy the french army an army that was cold wet hungry boneweary and trapped major dulong still smarted from his defeat at vila real de zedes the bruise on his face had faded but the memory of the repulse hurt he sometimes thought of the rifleman who had beaten him and wished the man was in the st leger he also wished that the st leger could be armed with rifles but that was like wishing for the moon because the emperor would not hear of rifles too fiddly too slow a womans weapon he said vive le fusil now at the old bridge called ponte nova where the french retreat was blocked dulong had been summoned to marshal soult because the marshal had been told that this was the best and bravest soldier in all his army dulong looked it the marshal thought with his ragged uniform and scarred face dulong had taken the bright feather plume from his shako wrapped it in oilcloth and tied it to his saber scabbard he had hoped to wear that plume when his regiment marched into lisbon but it seemed that was not to be not this spring anyway soult walked with dulong up a small knoll from where they could see the bridge with its two beams and see and hear the jeering ordenanga beyond there are not many of them soult remarked three hundred more dulong grunted so how do you get rid of them dulong gazed at the bridge through a telescope the beams were both about a meter wide more than enough though the rain would doubtless make them slippery he raised the glass to see that the portuguese had dug trenches from which they could fire directly along the beams but the night would be dark he thought and the moon clouded i would take a hundred volunteers he said fifty for each beam and go at midnight the rain was getting worse and the dusk was cold the portuguese muskets dulong knew would be soaked and the men behind them chilled to the bone a hundred men he promised the marshal and the bridge is yours soult nodded if you succeed major he said then send me word but if you fail i do not want to hear he turned and walked away dulong went back to the st leger and he called for volunteers and was not surprised when the whole regiment stepped forward so he chose a dozen good sergeants and let them pick the rest and he warned them that the fight would be messy cold and wet we will use the bayonet he said because the muskets wont fire in this weather and besides once you have fired one shot you will not have time to reload he thought about reminding them that they owed him a display of bravery after their reluctance to advance into the rifle fire on the watchtower hill at vila real de zedes then decided they all knew that anyway and so held his tongue the french lit no fires they grumbled but marshal soult insisted across the river the ordenanga believed they were safe and so they made a fire in one of the cottages high above the bridge where their commanders could keep warm the cottage had one small window and just enough flame light escaped through the unshuttered glass to reflect off the wet cross beams that spanned the river the feeble reflections shimmered in the rain but they served as a guide for dulongs volunteers they went at midnight two columns fifty men in each and dulong told them they must run across the bridge and he led the righthand column his saber drawn and the only sounds were the river hissing beneath the wind shrieking in the rocks the pounding of their feet and a brief scream as one man slipped and fell into the cavado then dulong was climbing the slope and found the first trench empty and he guessed the ordenanga had taken shelter in the small hovels that lay just beyond the second trench and the fools had not even left a sentry by the bridge even a dog would have served to warn them of a french attack but men and dogs alike were sheltering from the weather sergeant the major hissed the houses clean them out the portuguese were still asleep when the frenchmen came they arrived with bayonets and no mercy the first two houses fell swiftly their occupants killed scarcely before they were awake but their screams alerted the rest of the ordenanqa who ran into the darkness to be met by the besttrained infantry in the french army the bayonets did their work and the cries of the victims completed the victory because the survivors confused and terrified by the terrible sounds in the dark night fled by a quarter past midnight dulong was warming himself by the fire that had lit his way to victory marshal soult took the medal of the legion dhonneur from his own coat and pinned it to the turnback of major dulongs frayed jacket then with tears in his eyes the marshal kissed the major on both cheeks because the miracle had happened and the first bridge belonged to the french kate wrapped herself in a damp saddle blanket then stood beside her tired horse and watched dully as french infantry cut down pine trees slashed off their branches then carried the trimmed trunks to the bridge more timber was fetched from the small cottages and the ridge beams were just long enough to span the bridges roadway but it all took time for the rough timbers had to be lashed together if the soldiers horses and mules were to cross in safety the soldiers who were not working huddled together against the rain and wind it felt like winter suddenly musket shots sounded far away and kate knew it was the country people come to shoot at the hated invaders a cantiniere one of the tough women who sold the soldiers coffee tea needles thread and dozens of other small comforts took pity on kate and brought her a tin mug of lukewarm coffee laced with brandy if they take much longershe nodded at the soldiers rebuilding the bridges roadwaywell all be on our backs with an english dragoon on top so at least well get something out of this campaign she laughed and went back to her two mules which were laden with her wares kate sipped the coffee she had never been so cold wet or miserable and she knew she only had herself to blame williamson stared at the coffee and kate unsettled by his gaze moved to the far side of her horse she disliked williamson disliked the hungry look in his eyes and feared the threat in his naked desire of her were all men animals christopher for all his elegant civility by day liked to inflict pain at night but then kate remembered the single soft kiss that sharpe had given her and she felt the tears come to her eyes and lieutenant vicente she thought was a gentle man christopher liked to say how there were two sides in the world just as there were black pieces and white pieces on a chessboard and kate knew she had chosen the wrong side worse she did not know how she was to find her way back to the right one christopher strode back down the stalled column is that coffee he asked cheerfully good i need something warming he took the mug from her drained it then tossed it away another few minutes my dear he said and well be on our way one more bridge after this then well be over the hills and far away in spain youll have a proper bed again eh and a bath how are you feeling cold hard to believe its may eh worse than england still dont they say rains good for the complexion youll be prettier than ever my dearest he paused as some muskets sounded from the west the noise rattled loud for a few seconds echoing back and forth between the defiles steep sides then faded chasing off bandits christopher said its too soon for the pursuit to catch us up i pray they do catch us kate said dont be ridiculous my dear besides weve got a brigade of good infantry and a pair of cavalry regiments as rearguard we kate asked indignantly im english christopher gave her a longsuffering smile as am i dearest but what we want above all is peace peace and perhaps this retreat will be just the thing to persuade the french to leave portugal alone thats what im working on peace there was a pistol bolstered in christophers saddle just behind kate and she was tempted to pull the weapon free thrust it into his belly and pull the trigger but she had never fired a gun did not know if the longbarrelled pistol was loaded and besides what would happen to her if christopher were not here williamson would maul her she thnnaht and for some reason she remembered the letter she had succeeded in leaving for lieutenant sharpe putting it on the house beautifuls mantel without christopher seeing what she was doing she thought now what a stupid letter it was what was she trying to tell sharpe and why him what did she expect him to do she stared up the far hill there were men on the high crest line and christopher turned to see what she was looking at more of the scum he said patriots kate insisted peasants with rusted muskets christopher said acidly who torture their prisoners and have no idea none what principles are at stake in this war they are the forces of old europe he insisted superstitious and ignorant the enemies of progress he grimaced then unbuckled one of his saddlebags to make sure that his blackfronted red uniform jacket was inside if the french were forced to surrender then that coat was his passport he would take to the hills and if any partisans accosted him he would persuade them he was an englishman escaping from the french were moving sir williamson said bridge is up sir he knuckled his forehead to christopher then turned his leering face on kate help you onto the horse maam i can manage kate said coldly but she was forced to drop the damp blanket to climb into the saddle and she knew that both christopher and williamson were staring at her legs in their tight hussar breeches a cheer came from the bridge as the first cavalrymen led their horses over the precarious roadway the sound prompted the infantry to stand pick up their muskets and packs and shuffle toward the makeshift crossing one more bridge christopher assured kate and were safe just one more bridge the leaper and above them high in the hills richard sharpe was already marching toward it toward the last bridge in portugal the saltador chapter it had been at dawn that sharpe and hogan saw their fears were realized several hundred french infantry were across the ponte nova the ordenanqa were nothing but bodies in a plundered village and energetic work parties were remaking the roadway across the cavados white water the long and winding defile echoed with sporadic musket shots as portuguese peasants attracted to the beleaguered army like ravens to meat took longrange shots sharpe saw a hundred voltigeurs in open order climb a hill to drive off one brave band that had dared to approach within two hundred paces of the stalled column there was a flurry of shots the french skirmishers scoured the hill and then trudged back to the crowded road there was no sign of any british pursuit but hogan guessed that wellesleys army was still a halfdays march behind the french he wont have followed the french directly he explained he wont have crossed the serra de santa catalina like they did hell have stayed on the roads so he went to braga first and now hes marching eastward as for us he stared down at the captured bridge wed best shift ourselves to the saltador he said grimly because its our last chance to sharpe it seemed there was no chance at all more than twenty thousand french fugitives darkened the valley beneath him and christopher was lost somewhere in that mass and how sharpe was ever to find the renegade he did not know but he pulled on his threadbare coat and picked up his rifle and followed hogan who sharpe saw was similarly pessimistic while harper perversely was oddly cheerful even when they had to wade through a tributary of the cavado which ran waist deep through a steep defile which fell toward the larger river hogans mule baulked at the cold fast water and the captain proposed abandoning the animal but then javali smacked the beast hard across the face and while it was still blinking picked it up and carried it bodily through the wide stream the riflemen cheered the display of strength while the mule safe on the opposite bank snapped its yellow teeth at the goatherd who simply smacked it again useful lad that harper said approvingly the big irish sergeant was soaked to the skin and as cold and tired as any of the other men but he seemed to relish the hardship its no worse than herding back home he maintained as they trudged on i remember once my uncle was taking a flock of mutton prime meat the lot of them walking them on the hoof to belfast and half the buggers ran like shite when wed not even got to letterkenny jesus all that money gone to waste did you get them back perkins asked youre joking lad i searched half the bloody night and all i got was a clip round the ear from my uncle mind you it was his fault hed never herded so much as a rabbit before and didnt know one end of a sheep from the other but he was told there was good cash for mutton in belfast so he stole the flock off a skinflint in colcarney and set off to make his fortune do you have wolves in ireland vicente wanted to know in red coats harper said and saw sharpe scowl my grandfather now he went on hurriedly claimed to see a pack of them at derrynagrial big they were he said and with red eyes and teeth like graveyard stones and he told my grandmother that they chased him all the way to the glenleheel bridge but he was a drunk jesus he could soak the stuff up javali wanted to know what they were talking about and immediately had his own tales of wolves attacking his goats and how he had fought one with nothing but a stick and a sharpedged stone and then he claimed to have raised a wolf cub and told how the village priest had insisted on killing it because the devil lived in wolves and sergeant macedo said that was true and described how a sentry at almeida had been eaten by wolves one cold winters night do you have wolves in england vicente asked sharpe only lawyers richard hogan chided him they were going north now the road that the french would use from ponte nova to the spanish frontier twisted into the hills until it met another tributary of the cavado the misarella and the saltador bridge crossed the upper reaches of that river sharpe would rather have gone down to the road and marched ahead of the french but hogan would not hear of it the enemy he said would put dragoons across the cavado as soon as the bridge was repaired and the road was no place to be caught by horsemen and so they stayed in the high ground that became ever more rugged stony and difficult their progress was painfully slow because they were forced to make long detours when precipices or slopes of scree barred their way and for every mile they went forward they had to walk three and sharpe knew the french were now advancing up the valley and gaining fast for their progress was signaled by scattered musket shots from the hills about the misarellas defile those shots fired at too long a range by men activated by hatred sounded closer and closer until at midmorning the french came into view a hundred dragoons led but not far behind them was infantry and these men were not a panicked rabble but marching in good order javali the moment he saw them growled incoherently grabbed a handful of powder from his bag half of which he spilled as he tried to push it into his muskets barrel he rammed down a bullet primed his musket and shot into the valley it was not apparent that he hit an enemy but he gave a small joyful shuffle and then loaded the musket again you were right richard hogan said ruefully we should have used the road the french were overtaking them now you were right sir sharpe said people like himhe jerked his head toward the wildbearded javaliwould have been taking shots at us all morning maybe hogan said he swayed on the mules back then glanced down again at the french pray the saltador has been broken he said but he did not sound hopeful they had to clamber down into a saddle of the hills then climb again to another hogbacked ridge littered with the massive rounded boulders they lost sight of the fastflowing misarella and of the french on the road beside it but they could hear the occasional flurry of musket shots which told of partisans sniping into the valley god grant the portuguese have got to the bridge hogan said for the tenth or twentieth time since dawn if all had gone well then the portuguese forces advancing northward in parallel to sir arthur wellesleys army should have blocked the french at ruivaens so cutting the last eastward road to spain and then sent a brigade into the hills to plug the final escape route at the saltador if all had gone well the portuguese should now be barring the mountain road with cannon and infantry but the weather had slowed their march as it had slowed wellesleys pursuit and the only men waiting for marshal soult at the saltador were more ordenanqa there were over a thousand of them half trained and ill armed but an english major from the portuguese staff had ridden ahead to give them advice his strongest recommendation was to destroy the bridge but many of the ordenanga came from the hard frontier hills and the soaring arch across the misarella was the lifeline of their commerce and so they refused to heed major warres advice instead they compromised by knocking off the bridges parapets and narrowing its roadway by breaking the roadways stones with great sledgehammers but they insisted on leaving a slim strip of stone to leap the deep ravine and to defend the ribbonlike arch they barricaded the northern side of the bridge with an abattis made from thorn bushes and behind that formidable obstacle and on either side of it they scraped earthworks behind which they could shelter as they fired at the french with ancient muskets and fowling guns there was no artillery the strip of bridge that remained was just wide enough to let a farm cart cross the rivers ravine it meant that once the french were gone the valleys commerce could resume while the roadway and parapets were rebuilt but to the french that narrow strip would mean only one thing safety hogan was the first to see that the bridge was not fully destroyed he climbed off the mule and swore viciously then handed sharpe his telescope and sharpe stared down at the bridges remnants musket smoke already shrouded both banks as the dragoons of the french vanguard fired across the ravine and the ordenanga in their makeshift redoubts shot back the sound of the muskets was faint theyll get across hogan said sadly theyll lose a lot of men but theyll clear that bridge sharpe did not answer hogan was right he thought the french were making no effort to take the bridge now but doubtless they were assembling an assault party and that meant he would have to find a place from where his riflemen could shoot at christopher as he crossed the narrow stone arch there was nowhere on this side of the river but on the misarellas opposite bank there was a high stone bluff where a hundred or more ordenanqa were stationed the bluff had to be less than two hundred paces from the bridge too far for the portuguese muskets but it would provide a perfect vantage for his rifles and if christopher reached the center of the bridge he would be greeted by a dozen rifle bullets the problem was reaching the bluff it was not far away perhaps a halfmile but between sharpe and that enticing high ground was the misarella we have to cross that river sharpe said how long will that take hogan asked as long as it takes sharpe said we dont have a choice the musketry grew in intensity crackling like burning thorn then fading before bursting back into life the dragoons were crowding the southern bank to swamp the defenders with fire but sharpe could do nothing to help so for the moment he walked away in the valley of the cavado just twelve miles from the advance guard that fought the ordenanqa across the ravine of the misarella the first british troops caught up with soults rearguard which protected the men and women still crossing the ponte nova the british troops were light dragoons and they could do little more than exchange carbine fire with the french troops who were drawn across the road to fill the valley between the river and the southern cliffs but not far behind the dragoons the brigade of guards was marching and behind them was a pair of threepounder cannons guns that fired shot so light that they were derided as toys but on this day when no one else could deploy artillery the two toys were worth their weight in gold the french rearguard waited while a dozen miles away the vanguard readied to attack the saltador two battalions of infantry would assault the bridge but it was plain that they would become mincemeat if the thick barrier of thorn were not removed from the bridges far end the abattis was four feet high and just as thick and made from two dozen thorn bushes that had been tied together and weighted down with logs and it made a formidable obstacle and so a forlorn hope was proposed a forlorn hope was a company of men who were expected to die but in doing so they would clear a path for their comrades and usually such suicidal bands were deployed against the heavily defended breaches of enemy fortresses but todays band must cross the narrow remnant of a bridge and die under the flail of musket fire and as they died they were to clear away the thorn abattis major dulong of the st leger the new legion dhonneur medal still bright on his chest volunteered to lead the forlorn hope this time he could not use darkness and the enemy was far more numerous but his hard face showed no apprehension as he pulled on a pair of gloves and then twisted the loops of his saber cords about his wrist so that he would not lose the weapon in the chaos he anticipated as the thorns were wrenched aside general loison who commanded the french vanguard ordered every available man to the river bank to swamp the ordenanga with musket carbine and even pistol fire and when the noise had swelled to a deafening intensity dulong raised his saber then swung it forward as a signal to advance the skirmishing company of his own regiment ran across the bridge three men could just go abreast on the narrow ribbon of stone and dulong was in the very first rank the ordenanqa roared their defiance and a volley blasted from the closest earthwork dulong was hit in the chest he heard the bullet strike his new medal and then distinctly heard the snap as a rib broke and he knew the bullet must be in his lung but he felt no pain he tried to shout but his breath was very short yet he began hauling at the thorns with his gloved hands more men came cramming themselves on the bridges thin roadway one slipped and fell screaming into the white tumult of the misarella bullets smacked into the forlorn hope the air was nothing but smoke and splintering noise and hissing bullets but then dulong managed to pitch a whole section of the abattis into the river and there was a gap wide enough to let a man through and big enough to save a trapped army and he staggered through it saber raised spitting bubbles of blood as his breath labored a huge shout came from behind him as the first of the support battalions ran toward the bridge with fixed bayonets dulongs surviving men cleared away the last of the thorn abattis a dozen dead voltigeurs were unceremoniously kicked over the roadways edge into the ravine and suddenly the saltador was dark with french troops they screamed a war cry as they came and the ordenanqa most of whom were still reloading after trying to stop dulongs forlorn hope now fled hundreds of men ran westward climbing into the hills to escape the bayonets dulong paused by the nearest abandoned earthwork and there he bent over his saber dangling by the cords tied to his wrist and a long dribble of mingled blood and saliva trickling from his mouth he closed his eyes and tried to pray a stretcher a sergeant shouted make a stretcher find a doctor two french battalions chased the ordenanqa away from the bridge a few portuguese still lingered on a high rocky bluff to the left of the road but they were too far away for their musket fire to be anything except a nuisance and so the french let them stay there and watch an army escape for major dulong had prized open the last jaws of the trap and the road north was open sharpe up in the rough ground south of the misarella heard the furious musketry and knew the french must be assaulting the bridge and he prayed the ordenanqa would hold them but he knew they would fail they were amateur soldiers the french were professional and though men would die the french would still cross the misarella and once the first troops were over then the rest of their army would surely follow so he had little time in which to cross the river which tumbled white in its deep rocky ravine and sharpe had to go more than a mile upstream before he found a place where they might just negotiate the steep slopes and rainswollen water the mule would have to be abandoned for the ravine was so precipitous that not even javali could manhandle the beast down the cliff and through the fast water sharpe ordered his men to strip the slings off their rifles and muskets then buckle or tie them together to make a long rope javali eschewing such an aid scrambled down to the misarella waded through and began climbing the other side but sharpe feared losing one of his men to a broken leg up in these hills and so he went more slowly the men eased themselves down using the rope as a support then passed down their weapons the river was scarcely a dozen paces across but it was deep and its cold water tugged hard at sharpes legs as he led the crossing the rocks underfoot were slick and uneven tongue fell over and was swept a few yards downstream before he managed to haul himself onto the bank sorry sir he managed to say through chattering teeth as water drained from his cartridge box it took over forty minutes for them all to cross the ravine and climb its other side where from a peak of rock sharpe could just see the cloudshadowed hills of spain they turned east toward the bridge just as it began to rain again all morning the dark showers had slanted about them but now one opened directly above them and then a crash of thunder bellowed across the sky ahead far off to the south there was a patch of sunshine lightening the pale hills but above sharpe the sky grew darker and the rain heavier and he knew the rifles would have difficulty firing in such a teeming downpour he said nothing they were all cold and dispirited the french were escaping and christopher might already be over the misarella and on his way into spain to their left the grassgrown road twisted up into the last portuguese hills and they could see dragoons and infantry slogging up the roads tortuous bends but those men were a halfmile away and the rocky bluff was just ahead javali was already on its summit and he warned the remnants of the ordenanga who waited among the ferns and boulders that the uniformed men who approached were friends the portuguese whose muskets were useless in the heavy rain had been reduced to throwing rocks that bounded down the bluffs eastern face and were nothing but a minor nuisance to the stream of french who crossed the thin lifeline across the misarella sharpe shrugged off the ordenanqa who wanted to welcome him and threw himself down on the bluffs lip rain thrashed the rocks poured down the cliffs face and drummed on his shako a crash of thunder sounded overhead to be echoed by another from the southwest and sharpe recognized the second peal as the sound of guns it was cannon fire and the noise meant that sir arthur wellesleys army must have caught up with the french and that his artillery had opened fire but that fight was miles away back beyond the ponte nova and here at the final obstacle the french were escaping hogan panting from the exertion of climbing the bluff dronned beside sharpe they were so close to the bridge they could see the mustaches on the faces of the french infantry see the striped brownandblack pattern of a womans long skirt she walked beside her man carrying his musket and his child and had a dog tied to her belt by a length of string behind them an officer led a limping horse is that cannon im hearing hogan asked yes sir must be the threepounders hogan guessed we could do with a couple of those toys here but they had none only sharpe vicente and their men and an army that was escaping back at the ponte nova the gunners had manhandled their two toy cannon to the crest of a knoll that overlooked the french rearguard it was not raining here an occasional flurry whipped down from the mountains but the muskets could still fire and the brigade of guards loaded their weapons fixed bayonets and then formed to advance in column of companies and the guns the despised threepounders opened on the french and the small balls scarcely bigger than an orange each whipped through the tight ranks and bounced on rock to kill more frenchmen and the band of coldstream guards struck up rule britannia and the great colors were unfurled to the damp air and the threepound balls struck again each shot leaving a long spray of blood in the air as though a giant unseen knife were slashing through the french ranks the two light companies of the guards and a company of the greenjacketed th the royal american rifles were advancing among a jumble of rocks and low stone walls on the french left flank and the muskets and baker rifles began taking their toll of french officers and sergeants french skirmishers men from the renowned th leger a regiment chosen by soult to guard his rear because the th was famous for its steadiness ran forward to drive the british skirmishers back but the rifles were too much for them they had never faced such longrange accurate fire before and the voltigeurs backed away take them forward campbell take them forward sir arthur wellesley called to the brigades commander and so the first battalion of the coldstreamers and the first battalion of the rd foot guards marched toward the bridge their bearskins made them seem huge the bands drummers thumped for all they were worth the rifles snapped and the two threepounders crashed back onto their trails to cut two more bloody furrows through the long lines of frenchmen theyre going to break colonel waters said he had served as sir arthurs guide all day and was watching the french rearguard through his glass he could see them wavering see the sergeants dashing back and forth behind the ranks to push men into file theyre going to break sir pray they do sir arthur said pray they do and he wondered what was happening far ahead whether the french escape route had been blocked he already had a victory but how complete would it be the two battalions of guards both twice the size of an ordinary battalion marched steadily and their bayonets were two thousand specks of light in the clouddimmed valley and their colors were red white blue and gold above them and in front of them the french shivered and the cannons fired again and the blood mist flickered in two long lines to show where the round shots ploughed the files and sir arthur wellesley did not even watch the guards he was staring up into the hills where a great black rainfall blotted the view god grant he said fervently that the road is cut amen colonel waters said amen the road was not blocked because a leaping strip of stone spanned the misarella and a seemingly endless line of french made their way across the humpbacked arch sharpe watched them they walked like beaten men tired and sullen and he could see from their faces how they resented the handful of engineer officers who chivvied them across the bridge in april these men had been the conquerors of northern portugal and they had thought they were about to march south and capture lisbon they had plundered all the country north of the douro they had ransacked houses and churches raped women killed men and strutted like the cocks of the dunghill but now they had been whipped broken and chased and the distant sound of the two cannon told them that their ordeal was not yet over and above them on the rockstrewn hill crests they could see dozens of bitter men who just waited for a straggler and then the knives would be sharpened the fires lit and every frenchman in the army had heard the stories of the horribly mutilated corpses found in the highlands sharpe just watched them every now and then the bridge arch would be cleared so that a recalcitrant horse could be coaxed over the narrow span riders were peremptorily ordered to climb down from their saddles and two hussars were on hand to blindfold the horses and lead them across the stone remnant the rain eased and then became heavy again it was getting dark an unnatural dusk brought by black cloud and veils of rain a general his uniform heavy with sodden braid followed his blindfolded horse across the bridge the water seethed white far below him bouncing off the rocks of the ravine twisting in pools foaming on down to the cavado the general hurried off the bridge and then had trouble remounting his horse the ordenanqa jeered him and hurled a volley of rocks but the missiles merely bounced on the bluffs lower slopes and rolled harmlessly toward the road hogan was watching the french bunched behind the bridge through his telescope which he constantly wiped clear of water where are you mister christopher he asked bitterly maybe the bastards gone ahead harper said tonelessly if i was him sir id be in the front get away thats what he wants to do maybe sharpe acknowledged maybe he thought harper was probably right and that christopher might already be in spain with the french vanguard but there was no way of knowing that well watch till nightfall richard hogan suggested in a flat voice that could not hide his disappointment sharpe could see a mile back down the road which was crammed thick as the men women horses and mules shuffled toward the bottleneck of the saltador two stretchers were carried over the bridge the sight of the wounded men prompting shouts of triumph from the ordenanqa on the bluff another man his leg broken limped over on a makeshift crutch he was in agony but it was better to struggle on with blistered hands and a bleeding leg than fall behind and be caught by the partisans his crutch slipped on the bridges stone and he fell heavily and his predicament provoked another flurry of curses from the ordenanqa a french infantryman aimed his musket up at the taunting portuguese but when he pulled his trigger the spark fell on damp powder and nothing happened except that the jeering became louder and then sharpe saw him saw christopher or rather he saw kate first recognized the oval of her face the contrast of her pale skin and jetblack hair her beauty apparent even in this dark wet horror of an early dusk and he saw surprised that she was wearing a french uniform which was strange he thought but then he saw christopher and williamson beside her horse the colonel was dressed in civilian clothes and was trying to edge and bully and force his way through the crowd so that he could get across the bridge and so know himself to be safe from his pursuers sharpe snatched up hogans telescope wiped its lens and stared christopher he thought looked older almost aged with something gray about his face then he edged the lens to the right and saw williamsons sullen face and felt a surge of pure anger have you seen him hogan asked hes there sharpe said and he put the glass down slid his rifle from its new leather case and eased the barrel forward across a lip of rock thats him so it is harper had seen christopher now where hogan wanted to know twenty yards back from the bridge sir harper said beside the horse and thats miss kate on the horses back and jesus harper had seen williamson is that yes sharpe said curtly and he was tempted to aim the rifle at the deserter rather than at christopher hogan was gazing through the telescope a goodlooking girl he said she makes the heart beat faster right enough harper said sharpe kept the rifles lock covered hoping to keep the powder dry and now he took off the scrap of cloth pulled back the flint and aimed the gun at christopher and just then the heavens bellowed with thunder and the rain which was already heavy increased in malevolence it crashed in torrents to make sharpe curse he could not even see christopher now he jerked the rifle up and stared down into the blurred air which was filled with silver streaks a cloudbursting rain a deluge fit to make a man build an ark jesus and he could see nothing and just then a slash of lightning sliced the sky in two and the rain drummed like the devils hoofbeats and sharpe pointed the barrel toward the heavens and pulled the trigger he knew what would happen and it did the spark died the rifle was useless and so he threw the weapon down stood up and drew his sword what the hell are you doing hogan asked going to fetch my damn telescope sharpe said and went toward the french the th leger counted as one of the best infantry units in soults army broke and the two cavalry regiments broke with them the three regiments had been well posted dominating a slight ridge that ran athwart the road as it approached the ponte nova but the sight of the brigade of guards and the constant smack of rifle bullets and the stinging blows of the twin threepounders had finished the french rearguard their task had been to halt the british pursuit then withdraw slowly and destroy the repaired ponte nova behind them but instead they ran two thousand men and fourteen hundred horses were converging on the makeshift roadway across the cavado none tried to fight they turned their backs and they fled and the whole dark panicked mass of them was crushed against the rivers bank as the guards came up behind move the guns sir arthur spurred his horse toward the gunners whose weapons had scorched two wide fans of grass in front of the barrels move them up he shouted move them up keep at them it was beginning to rain harder the sky was darkening and forked lightning slithered above the northern hills the guns were moved a hundred yards nearer the bridge and then rolled up the southern slope of the valley to a small terrace from where they could slam their round shot into the crowded french rain hissed and steamed on the barrels as the first rounds crashed out and the blood flickered its red haze above the broken rearguard a dragoons horse screamed reared and killed a man with its flailing hooves more round shots slammed home a few frenchmen those at the back who knew they would never reach the bridge alive turned back threw down their muskets and held up their hands the guards opened ranks to let the prisoners through closed ranks and loosed a volley that punched into the rear of the french rabble the fugitives were jostling pushing and fighting their way onto the bridge and the congestion on the unbalustraded roadway was so great that men and horses were forced off the edge to fall screaming into the cavado and still the two guns kept at them slamming shots onto the ponte nova itself now bloodying the rafters and the felled trunks that were the rearguards only escape the round shots drove more men and horses off the spans unprotected edges so many that the dead and dying made a dam beneath the bridge the high point of the french invasion of portugal had been a bridge at oporto where hundreds of folk had drowned in panic and now the french were on another broken bridge and the dead of the douro were being avenged and still the guns hammered the french and now and then a musket or rifle would fire despite the rain and the british were a vengeful line converging on the horror that was the ponte nova more french surrendered some were weeping with shame misery hunger and cold as they staggered back a captain of the th leger threw down his sword and then in disgust picked it up and snapped the thin blade across his knee before letting himself be taken captive cease fire a coldstreamer officer shouted a dying horse whinnied the smoke of muskets and cannon was lost in the rain and the bed of the river was pitiful with the moans of men and beasts who had broken their bones when they fell from the roadway the dam of dying and dead of soldiers and horses was so high that the cavado was piling up behind them and drying up downstream of them though a trickle of bloodreddened water escaped from the human spillway a wounded frenchman tried to drag himself up from the river and died just as he reached the top of the bank where the coldstreamer bandsmen were collecting their wounded enemies the doctors stropped their scalpels on leather belts and took fortifying slugs of brandy the guards took the bayonets from their muskets and the gunners rested beside their threepound cannon for the pursuit was over and soult was gone from portugal sharpe went headlong down the bluffs steep escarpment leaping recklessly between rocks and praying that he would not lose his footing on the soaking grass the rain was hammering down and thunder was drowning the distant noise of the guns at the ponte nova it was getting darker and darker twilight and storm combining to throw a hellish gloom across portugals wild northern hills though it was the sheer intensity of the rain that did most to obscure the bridge but as sharpe neared the foot of the bluff where the ground began to level he saw that the saltador was suddenly empty a riderless horse was being led across the narrow span and the beast had held back the men behind and then sharpe saw a hussar leading the horse and christopher williamson and kate were just behind the saddled beast a group of infantrymen were walking away from the bridge as sharpe came from the rain with his drawn sword and they stared at him astonished and one man moved to intercept him but sharpe told him in two short words what to do and the man even if he did not speak english had the good sense to obey then sharpe was on the saltador and the hussar leading the horse just gaped at him christopher saw him and turned to escape but more men were already climbing the roadway and so there was no way off the bridges other side kill him christopher shouted at both williamson and the hussar and it was the frenchman who obediently began to draw his saber but sharpes sword hissed in the rain and the mans sword hand was almost cut off at the wrist and then sharpe rammed the blade at the hussars chest and there was a scream as the cavalryman fell into the misarella the horse terrified by the lightning and by the uncertain footing on the bridge gave a great whinny and then bolted past sharpe almost knocking him off the roadway its horseshoes made sparks from the stones then it was gone and sharpe faced christopher and williamson on the saltadors thin crest kate screamed at the sight of the long sword get up the hill sharpe shouted at her move kate move and you you bastard give me my telescope christopher reached out to stop kate but williamson darted past the colonel and obstructed his hand and kate seeing safety a few feet away had the sense to run past sharpe williamson tried to grab her then saw sharpes sword swinging toward him and he managed to parry the cut with his french musket the clash of sword and gun drove williamson back a pace and sharpe was already following snarling the sword flickering out like a snakes tongue to force williamson another pace backward and then christopher shoved the deserter forward again kill him he screamed at williamson and the deserter did his best swinging the musket like a great club but sharpe stepped back from the wild blow then came forward and the sword seared through the rain to catch williamson on the side of his head half severing his ear williamson staggered the widebrimmed leather hat had taken some of the blades sting but the sheer force of the blow still sent williamson lurching sideways toward the roadways ragged edge and sharpe was still attacking this time lunging and the point of the blade pierced the deserters green jacket jarred on a rib and sent williamson over the edge he screamed then christopher was alone with sharpe on the high arched summit of the saltador christopher stared at his greenjacketed enemy he did not believe what he saw he tried to speak because words had always been christophers best weapon but now he found he was struck dumb and sharpe walked toward him and then a surge of frenchmen came up behind the colonel and they were going to force him onto sharpes sword and christopher did not have the courage to draw his own and so in sheer desperation he followed williamson into the rainy dark of the misarellas ravine he jumped vicente harper and sergeant macedo had followed sharpe down the hill and now encountered kate look after her sir harper called to vicente and then with sergeant macedo he hurried toward the bridge just in time to see sharpe leap off the roadway sir harper shouted oh jesus bloody god he swore the daft bloody bastard he led macedo across the road just as a flood of bluecoated infantrymen spilled off the bridge but if any of the frenchmen thought it strange that enemy soldiers were on the misarellas bank they showed no sign of it they just wanted to escape and so they hurried north toward spain as harper prowled the bank and stared into the ravine for a sight of sharpe he could see dead horses among the rocks and half submerged in the white water and he could see the sprawling bodies of a dozen frenchmen who had fallen from the saltadors high span but of christophers dark coat and sharpes green jacket he could see nothing williamson had fallen straight into the deepest part of the ravine and by chance had landed in a swirling pool of the river that was deep enough to break his fall and he had pitched forward onto the corpse of a horse that had further cushioned him christopher was less fortunate he fell close to williamson but his left leg struck rock and his ankle was suddenly a mass of pain and the river water was cold as ice he clung to williamson and looked about desperately and saw no sign of any pursuit and he reasoned that sharpe could not stay long on the bridge in the face of the retreating french get me to the bank he told williamson i think my ankles broken youll be all right sir williamson said im here sir and he put an arm round the colonels waist and helped him toward the neatest bank wheres kate christopher asked she ran sir she ran but well find her sir well find her here we are sir we can climb here williamson hauled christopher onto rocks beside the water and looked for an easy way to climb the ravines side and instead saw sharpe he swore what is it christopher was in too much pain to notice much that bloody jackedup jack pudding williamson said and drew the saber that he had taken from a dead french officer on the road near the seminary bloody sharpe he explained sharpe had escaped the rush of oncoming frenchmen by jumping for the side of the ravine where a gorse sapling clung to a ledge its stem bent under his weight but it held and he had managed to find a foothold on the wet rock beneath and then jump down to another boulder where his feet had shot out from beneath him so that he slid down the big stones rounded side to crash into the river but the sword was still in his hand and in front of him was williamson and beside the deserter was a wet and terrified christopher rain hissed about them as the dark ravine was garishly lit by a stab of lightning my telescope sharpe said to christopher of course sharpe of course christopher pulled his sopping wet coattails up groped in one of his pockets and took out the glass not damaged he said brightly i only borrowed it put it on that boulder sharpe ordered not damaged at all christopher said putting the precious glass on the boulder and well done lieutenant christopher nudged williamson who was just watching sharpe sharpe took a step nearer the two men who both backed away christopher pushed williamson again trying to make him attack sharpe but the deserter was wary the longest blade he had ever used in a fight was a sword bayonet but that experience had not trained him to fight with a saber and especially not against a butchers blade like the heavy cavalry sword that sharpe held he stepped back waiting for an opportunity im glad youre here sharpe christopher said i was wondering how to get away from the french they were keeping a pretty close eye on me as you can imagine i have lots to tell sir arthur hes done well hasnt he hes done well sharpe agreed and he wants you dead dont be ridiculous sharpe were english christopher had lost his hat when he jumped and the rain was flattening his hair we dont assassinate people i do sharpe said and he took a step nearer again and christopher and williamson edged away christopher watched sharpe pick up the glass not damaged you see i took good care of it he had to shout to make himself heard over the seething rain and the crash of the river thrusting through the rocks he pushed williamson forward again but the man obstinately refused to attack and christopher now found himself trapped on a slippery ledge between cliff and river and the colonel in this last extremity finally abandoned trying to talk himself out of trouble and simply shoved the deserter toward sharpe kill him he shouted at williamson kill him the hard shove in his back seemed to startle williamson who nevertheless raised the saber and slashed it at sharpes head there was a great clang as the two blades met then sharpe kicked the deserters left knee a kick that made williamsons leg buckle and sharpe who looked as though he was not making any particular effort sliced the sword across williamsons neck so that the deserter was knocked back to the right and then the sword lunged through the riflemans green jacket and into his belly sharpe twisted the blade to stop it being trapped by the suction of flesh ripped it free and watched the dying williamson topple into the river i hate deserters sharpe said i do so hate bloody deserters christopher had watched his man defeated and seen that sharpe had not had to fight hard at all to do it no sharpe he said you dont understand he tried to think of the words that would make sharpe think make him step back but the colonels mind was in panic and the words would not come sharpe watched williamson for a moment the dying man tried to struggle out of the river but the blood ran red from his neck and his belly and he suddenly flopped back and his ugly face sank under the water i do so hate deserters sharpe said again then he looked at christopher is that sword good for anything except picking your teeth colonel christopher numbly drew his slender blade he had trained with a sword he used to spend good money that he could scarce afford at horace jacksons hall of arms on jermyn street where he had learned the finer graces of fencing and where he had even earned grudging praise from the great jackson himself but fighting on the frenchchalked boards of jermyn street was one thing and facing richard sharpe in the misarellas ravine was altogether another no sharpe he said as the rifleman stepped toward him then raised his blade in a panicked riposte as the big sword flickered toward him sharpes lunge had been a tease a probe to see whether christopher would fight but sharpe was staring into his enemys eyes and he knew this man would die like a lamb fight you bastard he said and lunged again and again christopher made a feeble riposte but then the colonel saw a boulder in the rivers center and he thought that he might just leap to it and from there he could reach the opposite bank and so climb to safety he slashed his sword in a wild blow to give himself the space to make the jump and then he turned and sprang but his broken ankle crumpled the rock was wet under his boots and he slipped and would have fallen into the river except that sharpe seized his jacket and so christopher fell on the ledge the sword useless in his hand and with his enemy above him no he begged no he stared up at sharpe you saved me sharpe he said realizing what had just happened and with a sudden hope surging through him you saved me cant pick your pockets colonel if youre under water sharpe said and then his face twisted in rage as he rammed the sword down christopher died on the ledge just above the pool where williamson had drowned the eddy above the deserters body ran with new red blood then the red spilled out into the main stream where it was diluted first to pink and then to nothing christopher twitched and gargled because sharpes sword had taken out his windpipe and that was a mercy for it was a quicker death than he deserved sharpe watched the colonels body jerk and then go still and he dipped his blade in the water to clean it dried it as best he could on christophers coat and then gave the colonels pockets a quick search and came up with three gold coins a broken watch with a silver case and a leather folder crammed with papers that would probably interest hogan bloody fool sharpe said to the body then he looked up into the gathering night and saw a great shadow at the ravines edge above him for a second he thought it must be a frenchman then he heard harpers voice is he dead didnt even put up a fight williamson too sharpe climbed up the ravines side until he was near harper and the sergeant lowered his rifle to haul sharpe the rest of the way sergeant macedo was there and the three could not return to the bluff because the french were on the road and so they took shelter from the rain in a gully formed where one of the great round boulders had been split by a frost sharpe told harper what had happened then asked if the irishman had seen kate the lieutenants got her sir harper answered the last i saw of her she was having a good cry and he was holding hard onto her and giving her a nice pat on the back women like a good cry have you noticed that sir i have sharpe said i have makes them feel better harper said funny how it doesnt work for us sharpe gave one of the gold coins to harper the second to macedo and kept the third darkness had fallen it promised to be a long cold and hungry night but sharpe did not mind got my telescope back he told harper i thought you would wasnt even broken at least i dont think so the glass had not rattled when he shook it so he assumed it was fine the rain eased and sharpe listened and heard nothing but the scrape of french feet on the saltadors stones the gusting of the wind the sound of the river and the fall of the rain he heard no gunfire so that faraway fight at the ponte nova was over and he did not doubt that it was a victory the french were going they had met sir arthur wellesley and he had licked them licked them good and proper and sharpe smiled at that for though wellesley was a cold beast unfriendly and haughty he was a bloody good soldier and he had made havoc for king nicolas and sharpe had helped he had done his bit historical note sharpe is once again guilty of stealing another mans thunder it was indeed a portuguese barber who rowed a skiff across the douro and alerted colonel waters to the existence of three stranded barges on the rivers northern bank but he did it on his own initiative and there were no british troops on the northern bank at the time and no riflemen from the th helped in the defense of the seminary the french believed they had either destroyed or removed every boat on the river but they missed those three barges which then began a cumbersome ferry service that fed redcoats into the seminary which inexplicably had been left unguarded the tale of the spherical case shot destroying the leading french gun team is taken from omans a history of the peninsular war vol ii general sir edward paget was wounded in the arm in that fight he lost his arm returned to england to recuperate and then came back to the peninsula as general of the first division but his bad luck continued when he was captured by the french the british lost seventyseven men killed or wounded in the fight at the seminary while french casualties were at least three or four times as many the french also failed to destroy the ferry at barca davintas which was refloated on the morning of the attack and carried two kings german legion infantry battalions and the th light dragoons across the river a force that could have given the french serious problems as they fled oporto but the genera m charge of the units george murray though he advanced north to the amarante road supinely watched the enemy pass later that day general charles stewart led the th light dragoons in a magnificent charge that broke the french rearguard but murray still refused to advance his infantry and so it was all too little too late i have probably tradiced marshal soult by suggesting he was talking to his cook when the british crossed the river but he did sleep in till nearly eleven oclock that morning and whatever his cook provided for supper was indeed eaten by sir arthur wellesley the seminary still stands though it has now been swallowed by oportos suburbs but a plaque records its defense on may another plaque on the quay close to where eiffels magnificent iron bridge now spans the gorge records the horrors of march when the portuguese refugees crowded onto the broken pontoon bridge there are two explanations for the drownings one claims that retreating portuguese troops pulled the drawbridge up to prevent the french from the bridge while the second explanation which i prefer is that the sheer weight of refugees sank the central pontoons which then broke under me pressure of the river whichever is true the result was horror as hundreds of people most of them civilians were forced off the shattered end to drown in the douro with his capture of oporto marshal soult had conquered northern portugal and as he gathered his strength for the onward march to lissabon he did indeed flirt with the idea of making himself king more than once he canvassed his general officers tried to gain support among me portuguese and doubtless encouraged the diario do porto a newspaper established during the french occupation of the city and edited by a priest who supported the egregious idea quite what napoleon would have made of such a selfpromotion is not difficult to guess and it was probably the prospect of the emperors displeasure as much as anything else which persuaded soult against the idea but the idea was real and it gave soult the nickname king nicolas and very nearly provoked a mutiny which was to be led by colonel donadieu and colonel lafitte plus several other now unknown officers and captain argenton did make two trips through the lines to consult with the british argenton wanted the british to use their influence on the portuguese to persuade them to encourage soult to declare himself king for when soult did so the mutiny would break out at which point donadieu and the others would supposedly lead the army back to france the british were asked to encourage this nonsense by blocking the roads east into spain but leaving the northern roads unthreatened sir arthur wellesley arriving at lisbon to take over from cradock met argenton and dismissed the plot out of hand argenton then returned to soult was betrayed and arrested but was promised his life if he revealed all that he knew and among those revelations was the fact that the british army far from readying itself to withdraw from portugal was preparing to attack northwards the warning gave soult a chance to withdraw his advance forces from south of the douro who otherwise might have been trapped by an ambitious encircling move that wellesley had initiated argentons career was not over he managed to escape his captors reached the british army and was given a safe passage to england for some reason he then decided to return to france where he was again captured and this time shot it is also worth noting while we are discussing sinister plots that the aspirations christopher attributes to napoleon aspirations for a european system a european code of laws a european judiciary and one nation alone in europe europeans were indeed articulated by bonaparte this is a story that begins and ends on bridges and the twin tales of how major dulong of the st leger captured the ponte nova and then the saltador are true he was a rather sharpelike character who enjoyed an extraordinary reputation for bravery but he was wounded at the saltador and i have been unable to discover his subsequent fate he almost singlehandedly saved soults army so he deserved a long life and an easy death and he certainly does not deserve to be given a failing role in the fictional story of the fictional village of vila real de zedes hagmans marksmanship at seven hundred paces sounds a little too good to be believable but is based on an actual event which occurred the previous year during sir john moores retreat to corunna tom plunkett fired the miracle shot which killed the french general colbert at around seven hundred yards the shot rightly became famous among riflemen i read in a recent publication that the extreme range of the baker rifle was only three hundred yards a fact that would have surprised the men in green who reckoned that distance to be middling marshal soult still merely the duke of dalmatia was forced to retreat once wellesley had crossed the douro and the tale of his retreat is described in the novel the french should have been trapped and forced to surrender but it is easy to make such criticisms long after the event if the portuguese or british had marched a little faster or if the ordenanqa had destroyed either the ponte nova or the saltador then soult would have been finished but a small measure of good fortune and major dulongs singular heroism rescued the french the weather doubtless had much to do with their escape the rain and cold of that early may were unseasonably vicious and slowed the pursuit and as sir arthur wellesley observed in a report to the prime minister an army that abandons all its guns vehicles and wounded can move a great deal faster than an army that retains its heavy equipment but the french escape was nevertheless a missed opportunity after the brilliant victory at oporto oporto has now grown to encompass the seminary so it is hard to see the ground as it was on the day when the buffs crossed the river but for anyone interested in seeing the seminary it can be found in the largo do padre balthazar guedes a small square overlooking the river the best guide to the battlefield indeed to all sir arthur wellesleys battlefields of portugal and spain is julian pagets wellingtons peninsular war published by leo cooper the book will guide you across the river to the monastery de serra do pilar where there is a memorial to the battle that is built on the spot where wellesley placed his guns to such advantage and any visit to that southern bank should include the port lodges many of which are still british owned there are splendid restaurants on the northern quay where the plaque remembers the drowned of march the palacio das carrancas where both soult and wellesley had their headquarters is now the museo nacional scares dos reis and can be found on rua de dom manuel ii both the ponte nova and the saltador still exist though sadly they exist underwater for each is now submerged in a reservoir but the area is well worth visiting for its wild and spectacular beauty soult escaped but his incursion into portugal had cost him of his men just under half of those being killed or captured during the retreat he also lost his baggage his transport and all fiftyfour of his guns it was indeed a broken army and a massive defeat but it did not end french designs on portugal they would be back the following year and would have to be thrown out again so sharpe and harper will march again
