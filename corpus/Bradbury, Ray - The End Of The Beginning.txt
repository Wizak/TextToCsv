the end of the beginning the end of the beginning ray bradbury he stopped the lawn mower in the middie of the yard because he felt that the sun at just that moment had gone down and the stars come out the freshcut grass that had showered his face and body died softy away yes the stars were there faint at first but brightening in the clear desert sky he heard the porch screen door tap shut and felt his wife watching him as he watched the night almost time she said he nodded he did not have to check his watch in the passing moments he felt very old then very young very cold then very warm now this now that suddenly he was miles away he was his own son talking steadily moving briskly to cover his pounding heart and the resurgent panics as he felt himself slip into fresh uniform check food supplies oxygen flasks pressure helmet spacesuiting and turn as every man on earth tonight turned to gaze at the swiftly filling sky then quickly he was back once more the father of the son hands gripped to the lawnmower handle his wife called come sit on the porch ive got to keep busy she came down the steps and across the lawn dont worry about robert hell be all right but its all so new he heard himself say its never been done before think of it a manned rocket going up tonight to build the first space station good lord it cant be done it doesnt exist theres no rocket no proving ground no takeoff time no technicians for that matter i dont even have a son named bob the whole things too much for me then what are you doing out here staring he shook his head well late this morning walking to the office i heard someone laugh out loud it shocked me so i froze in the middle of the street it was me laughing why because finally i really knew what bob was going to do tonight at last i believed it holy is a word i never use but thats how i felt stranded in all that traffic then middle of the afternoon i caught myself humming you know the song a wheel in a wheel way in the middle of the air i laughed again the space station of course i thought the big wheel with hollow spokes where bobll live six or eight months then get along to the moon walking home i remembered more of the song little wheel run by faith big wheel run by the grace of god i wanted to jump yell and flameout myself his wife touched his arm if we stay out here lets at least be comfortable they placed two wicker rockers in the center of the lawn and sat quietly as the stars dissolved out of darkness in pale crushings of rock salt strewn from horizon to horizon why said his wife at last its like waiting for the fireworks at sisley field every year bigger crowd tonight i keep thinking a billion people watching the sky right now their mouths all open at the same time they waited feeling the earth move under their chairs what time is it now eleven minutes to eight youre always right there must be a clock in your head i cant be wrong tonight ill be able to tell you one second before they blast off look the tenminute warning on the western sky they saw four crimson flares open out float shimmering down the wind above the desert then sink silently to the extinguishing earth in the new darkness the husband and wife did not rock in their chairs after a while he said eight minutes a pause seven minutes what seemed a much longer pause six his wife her head back studied the stars immediately above her and murmured why she closed her eyes why the rockets why tonight why all this id like to know he examined her face pale in the vast powdering light of the milky way he felt the stirring of an answer but let his wife continue i mean its not that old thing again is it when people asked why men climbed mt everest and they said because its there i never understood that was no answer to me five minutes he thought time ticking his wrist watch a wheel in a wheel little wheel run by big wheel run by way in the middle of four minutes the men snug in the rocket by now the hive the control board flickering with light his lips moved all i know is its really the end of the beginning the stone age bronze age iron age from now on well lump all those together under one big name for when we walked on earth and heard the birds at morning and cried with envy maybe well call it the earth age or maybe the age of gravity millions of years we fought gravity when we were amoebas and fish we struggled to get out of the sea without gravity crushing us once safe on the shore we fought to stand upright without gravity breaking our new invention the spine tried to walk without stumbling run without falling a billion years gravity kept us home mocked us with wind and clouds cabbage moths and locusts thats whats so godawful big about tonight its the end of old man gravity and the age well remember him by for once and all i dont know where theyll divide the ages at the persians who dreamt of flying carpets or the chinese who all unknowing celebrated birthdays and new years with strung ladyfingers and high skyrockets or some minute some incredible second the next hour but were in at the end of a billion years trying the end of something long and to us humans anyway honorable three minutes two minutes fiftynine seconds two minutes fiftyeight seconds but said his wife i still dont know why two minutes he thought ready ready ready the far radio voice calling ready ready ready the quick faint replies from the humming rocket check check check tonight he thought even if we fail with this first well send a second and a third ship and move on out to all the planets and later all the stars well just keep going until the big words like immortal and forever take on meaning big words yes thats what we want continuity since our tongues first moved in our mouths weve asked what does it all mean no other question made sense with death breathing down our necks but just let us settle in on ten thousand worlds spinning around ten thousand alien suns and the question will fade away man will be endless and infinite even as space is endless and infinite man will go on as space goes on forever individuals will die as always but our history will reach as far as well ever need to see into the future and with the knowledge of our survival for all time to come well know security and thus the answer weve always searched for gifted with life the least we can do is preserve and pass on the gift to infinity thats a goal worth shooting for the wicker chairs whispered ever so softly on the grass one minute one minute he said aloud oh his wife moved suddenly to seize his hands i hope that bob hell be all right oh god take care thirty seconds watch now fifteen ten five watch four three two one there there oh there there they both cried out they both stood the chairs toppled back fell flat on the lawn the man and his wife swayed their hands struggled to find each other grip hold they saw the brightening color in the sky and ten seconds later the great uprising comet burn the air put out the stars and rush away in fire flight to become another star in the returning profusion of the milky way the man and wife held each other as if they had stumbled on the rim of an incredible cliff that faced an abyss so deep and dark there seemed no end to it staring up they heard themselves sobbing and crying only after a long time were they able to speak it got away it did didnt it yes its all right isnt it yes yes it didnt fall back no no its all right bobs all right its all right they stood away from each other at last he touched his face with his hand and looked at his wet fingers ill be damned he said ill be damned they waited another five and then ten minutes until the darkness in their heads the retina ached with a million specks of fiery salt then they had to close their eyes well she said now lets go in he could not move only his hand reached a long way out by itself to find the lawnmower handle he saw what his hand had done and said theres just a little more to do but you cant see well enough he said i must finish this then well sit on the porch awhile before we turn in he helped her put the chairs on the porch and sat her down and then walked back out to put his hands on the guide bar of the lawn mower the lawn mower a wheel in a wheel a simple machine which you held in your bands which you sent on ahead with a rush and a clatter while you walked behind with your quiet philosophy racket followed by warm silence whirling wheel then soft footfall of thought im a billion years old he told himself im one minute old im one inch no ten thousand miles tall i look down and cant see my feet theyre so far off and gone away below he moved the lawn mower the grass showering up fell softly around him he relished and savored it and felt that he was all mankind bathing at last in the fresh waters of the fountain of youth thus bathed he remembered the song again about the wheels and the faith and the grace of god being way up there in the middle of the sky where that single star among a million motionless stars dared to move and keep on moving then he finished cutting the grass
