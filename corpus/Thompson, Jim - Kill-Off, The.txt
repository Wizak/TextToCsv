the killoff by jim thompson copyright kossmeyer mostly she was a woman who loved scandal and lived by it luane devore made a specialty of being impetuous bold headstrong and she thought sultry mostly though it was sunday only two days after the season had opened when luane devore telephoned as usual she sounded a little hysterical as usual she was confronted with a dire emergency which only i could handle significantly however or at least i thought it significant she did not calm down when i told her to go to hell and to stop acting like a damned fool please kossy she burbled you must come its vitally important darling i cant talk about it over the telephone but why the hell cant you i cut in you talk about everything and everyone else over the phone now lay off luane im a lawyer not a babysitter im here on a vacation and im not going to spend all my time listening to you moan and whine about a lot of imaginary problems she wept audibly i felt a very small twinge of conscience the devore estate didnt amount to anything any more it had been years since id gotten a nickel out of her so well you see what i mean when people dont have anything when they cant do anything for you you kind of have to go a little easy on em now take it easy honey i said be a big girl for kossy the world aint going to come to an end if i dont dash up there right now it aint going to kill you is it yes she said yes it is and then she hung up with a wild sob i hung up also i came out of the bedroom crossed the living room and returned to the kitchen rosa was at the stove her back turned to me she was talking ostensibly mumbling to herself but actually addressing me it is a habit of hers one she has resorted to more and more frequently during the twentyodd years of our marriage i listened to the familiar words bum loafer timewaster thinksnothingofhiswifebut and for the first time in a long time i was affected by them i began to get sore angry and sad and a little sick on the inside so im sorry i said shes a client shes in trouble ive got no choice but to see her a client he says rosa said so of course everything else he must drop she is his only client is she not his first case with a good lawyer i said it is always the first case dont make such a production out of it dammit ill be back in a little while in a little while he says rosa said in a little while he was going to help with the unpacking he was going to help clean up the cottage and take his wife bathing and i will i said goddammit you want me to put it in writing listen to him she said listen to the great attorney curse at his wife see how he acts the great attorney when it is his wife he deals with listen to yourself i said see how you act she turned around unwillingly i stood up and put on a performance watching her face slowly turn red then white i am pretty good at such mimicry painfully good you might say i have a talent for it and when a man is only five feet tall when he has had no formal law education damned little formal education of any kind he leaves no talent undeveloped this is you i said mrs abie why dont you go on tv go into vaudeville they love those characters nnow she smiled weakly i guess im not that bad mister sm arty mister smarty i said now theres a good line you just keep it up keep building on that stuff and well be all fixed up well be getting a nice offer for our property maybe she snapped wed better not wait for an offer if youre ashamed of your own wife if youre so worried about what your friends may think of me what im ashamed of is someone that isnt my wife this character youve slipped into goddammit youre supposed to amount to something and yet half the time you i stopped myself short she said listen to him listen to the great attorney and then she caught herself we stood staring at each other after a long moment i started to break the silence and the first word was a swear word and the second one was an aint i broke off again look at whos talking i said me telling you how to behave she laughed and put her arms around me and i put mine around her but youre right darling she murmured i dont know how i ever got into the habit of carrying on that way you stop me if i do it any more and you stop me i said she warmed up the breakfast coffee and we both had a cup chatting and smoking a cigarette while we drank it then i got the car out of the garage and headed up the beach road toward town manduwoc is a seacoast town a few hours trainride from new york city it is too far from the city for commuting there are no local industries according to the last census the population was and i doubt that it has increased since then it used to be quite a resort town back before the war but the number of summer visitors has declined steadily in recent years the natives got a little too independent they leaned a little too heavily on the gypping so what with so many places closer to the population centers manduwoc began to go downhill the largest hotel here has been boarded up for the past two summers some business establishments have closed down permanently and at least a third of the beach cottages are never rented there is still a considerable influx of vacationers but nothing like there used to be practically the only people who come here now are those who own property here people who generally speaking are out to save money rather than spend it the town proper sits a few hundred yards back from the ocean built around a courthouse square it is adjoined on the land side by an area of summer estates and on the sea side by the usual resort installations these last include the aforementioned hotels and cottages a couple of seafood restaurants a boatandbait concession a dance pavilion and so on our cottage which we own is about three miles out the others the rentcottages i should say are all closein i was approaching them row upon row of identical clapboard structures when a man stepped out onto the road and began to trudge toward the village he was tall stoopshouldered very thin he had a mop of grayblack hair and his angular intelligent face was almost a dead white i pulled the car even with him and stopped he went on walkinglooking straight ahead i called to him rags rags mcguire and finally after another hail or two he turned around he was frowning in a kind of fiercely absent way he came toward me slowly his features twisted in that vacant scowl and then suddenly his face lit up with a smile of friendliness and recognition kossy how are you boy he climbed into the seat with me where you been hiding yourself i said that rosa and i were just getting settled down wed be dropping by the pavilion as soon as we were finished he beamed and slapped me on the back and said that was the kossy kid and then he went completely silent it wasnt an awkward silence not seemingly that is on his part but there was something about it something about his smile and his eyes that made me more ill at ease than i have ever been in my life i dont suppose i hesitated i mean is janie with the band this summer he didnt say anything for several seconds then he said no she wasnt with him he had a new vocalist janie was staying in the city with the kids i figure that gives her enough to do he added just bringing the kids up right yknow after all you take a couple of boys that age and a woman dont have time to yeah you were saying kossy nothing i said i mean well the boys are all right then all right he looked bewildered for a moment then he laughed amiably oh i guess you saw that little story in the papers huh well that wasnt janie that wasnt my family i see i said im certainly glad to hear it rags aint it hell though he said musingly a guy wants some publicity he knocks himself out to get some and he just cant swing it but let something phony come along something that wont do him no good yknow and hell make the papers every time yeah i said thats the way it seems to go all right i thought about suing them he said but then i thought what the hell after all it was a natural mistake it was the same name names see and janie does have a rep for tipping the bottle i was almost convinced in fact im not at all sure that i wasnt there were probably any number of smalltime band leaders named mcguire it would be easy to confuse one with another particularly in a case where a story had to be written largely from newspaper files and that had been the case in this instance the two boys had died in the crash janie if it was janie had lived but she had been in a coma for days rags had me drop him off in front of a bar i drove on through town wondering worrying then mentally shrugging he wasnt a close friend not a friend at all really just a guy id got to know during the summers id come here i liked him like i like a lot of people but he wasnt my business luane devore was and straightening her out would be headache enough for one day she lived in a twostory brick box of a house on the landside outskirts of manduwoc it sat a few hundred feet back from the road at the apex of a wooded slope the driveway curved up through an expanse of meticulously clipped lushly green lawn in the rear of the house there was more lawn stretching out fanwise to the whitewashed gates and fences of the orchard barnyard and pasture i parked my car beneath the porte cochere and took a quick glance around the place a sleek jersey grazed in the pasture several dozen leghorns scratched and pecked industriously in the barnyard a sow and half a dozen piglets wandered through the orchard grunting and squealing contentedly as they gobbled the fallen fruit everything was as i remembered it from last season over all there was an air of peace and contentment the evidence of loving care of quiet pride in homely accomplishments you dont find that much any more that kind of pride i mean people who will give everything they have to a humble runofthemill job all the office boys want to be company presidents all the store clerks want to be department heads all the waitresses and waiters want to be any damned thing but what they are and they all let you know it the whole lazy shiftless indifferent insolent lot they cant do their own jobs well rather they wont do them but by god theyre going to have something better the best theyre going to have it or else and meanwhile its a case of do as little as you can and grab as much as you can get so i stood there in the drive looking around and feeling better the longer i looked and then from an upstairs window luane devore called down to me petulantly kossy kossy what are you doing down there ill be right up i said is the door unlocked of course its unlocked its always unlocked you know that how in the world could i save it i said keep your pants on ill be right with you i went in through the front door crossed a foyer floor that was waxed and polished to a mirrorlike finish i started up the stairs they were polished to the same gleaming perfection as the floors and i slipped perilously once when i stepped off of the carpet runner for perhaps the thousandth time i wondered how ralph devore found the time to maintain the house and grounds as he did for he did do it all everything that was done here and a hundred other things besides luane hadnt lifted a hand in years it had been years since she had contributed a penny to maintaining the place there was a picture of them ralph and luane on the wall at the turn in the stairs one of those enlarged retouched photographs hung in an oval gilt frame it had been taken twentytwo years before at the time of their marriage in those days luane had resembled theda bara if you remember your silentmotionpicture stars and ralph looked a lot like that spanish lad ramon navarro ralph still looked pretty much as he had then but luane did not she was sixtytwo now he was forty her bedroom extended across the front of the house facing the town through its huge picture window she could see just about everything that went on in manduwoc and judging by the gossip id heard she not only saw everything that happened but a hell of a lot that didnt her door was open i went in and sat down trying not to wrinkle my nose against that bedfast smell the smell of stale sweat stale food rubbing alcohol talcum and disinfectant this was one room that ralph could do nothing about luane hadnt left it since god knows when and it was so cluttered you could hardly turn around it there was a huge television set on one side of the room on the other side was a massive radio and next to it an elaborate hifl phonograph they were operated from a remote control panel on a bedside table almost completely circling the bed were other tables and benches loaded down variously with magazines books candy boxes cigarettes carafes an electric toaster coffee pot chafing dish and cartons and cans of food thus surrounded with everything imaginable at her fingertips luane could makedo for herself during the long hours that ralph was away for that matter she could have done so anyhow because there was not a damned thing wrong with her the local doctor said there wasnt so did a diagnostician id once brought down from the city the local man treated hei since she insisted on it but there was nothing at all wrong with her nothing but selfpity and selfishness viciousness and fear the urge to lash out at others from the sanctuary of the invalids bed i sat down near the window and lighted a cigar she sniffed distastefully and i sniffed right back at her all right i said lets get it over with whats the matter now her mouth worked she took a grayish handkerchief from beneath her pillow and blew into it it its rralph kossy hes planning to kill me yeah i said so whats wrong with that he is kossy i know you dont believe me but he is swell i said you tell him if he needs any help just to give me a ring she looked at me helplessly big fat tears filling her eyes i grinned and gave her a wink you see i said you talk stupid to me and ill talk stupid to you and where the hell will that get us but its not i mean its true kossy why would i say so if it wasnt because you want attention excitement and youre too damned noaccount to go after it like other people do i hadnt meant to get rough with her but she needed it she had to be brought to her senses and i admit i just couldnt help it i very seldom lose my temper i may act like it but i very seldom do but this time it was no act how the hell can you do it i said aint you done enough to the poor guy already you marry him when hes eighteen you talk his father your caretaker into getting him to marry you i did not i i the hell you didnt the old man was ignorant he thought he was doing the right thing by his son setting him up so that he could get a good education and amount to something but how did it turn out why i gave ralph a good home every advantage its not my fault that you didnt give him anything i said ralph worked for everything he got and he helped support you besides and hes still working anywhere from ten to twentyfour hours a day oh sure youve tossed the dough around youve thrown away the whole damned estate but ralph never got any of it it all went for luane devore and to hell with ralph she cried some more then she pouted then she pulled the injured dignity stunt she believed she said that ralph was quite satisfied with the way she had treated him hed married her because he loved her he hadnt wanted to go away to school he was never happier than when he was working under the circumstances then her voice trailed away a look of foolish embarrassment spreading over her flabby talcumcaked face i nodded slowly that just about wraps it up doesnt it luane youve said it all yourself well she hesitated perhaps i do worry brood too much but lets pin it down tight wrap it up once and for all just what reason would ralph have to kill you this place all thats left of the estate huhuh he has it now practically speaking hell have it legally when you die after all the years hes slaved here worked to improve it you couldnt will it to someone else you could of course but it wouldnt hold up in court i yeah i nothing she hesitated again im pretty sure she couldnt be the reason after all hes only known her a couple of days who i said a girl at the dance pavilion the vocalist with the band this year id heard that ralph was driving her around a lot but of course so who doesnt he drive around when he gets a chance i said its a way of picking up a few bucks she nodded that that was so she agreed that most of ralphs haulandcarry customers were women since women were less inclined to walk than men anyway she added thoughtfully if it was just another woman well that couldnt be the reason could it he could just run away with her he could get a divorce he wouldnt have to to of course he wouldnt i said and he doesnt want to and he doesnt intend to where did you ever get the notion that he did anyhow has he said anything done anything out of the way she shook her head shed thought hed been behaving rather oddly and then shed heard this gossip about the girl and then shed been feeling so poorly lately sick to her stomach and unable to sleep nights and the telephone rang she broke off the recital of her various ailments and snatched it up she didnt talk long not as long as she obviously wanted to and what she did say was phrased obliquely still with what id already heard in town i was able to get the drift of the conversation she hung up the receiver keeping her eyes averted from mine she thanked me for coming to see her im sorry to have bothered you kossy i get so worried you know and then i get excited but youre all squared away now i said you know now that ralph has no intention of killing you that he never did have and never will have yes kossy and i cant tell you how much i dont try i said dont tell me anything dont call me again because im not representing you any longer youve gone too damned far this time why why kossy her hand went to her mouth youre not angry with me jjust because im disgusted with you i said you make me want to puke but why what did i do her lower lip pulled down piteously i lie here all day long with nothing to do and no one to talk to a sick lonely old woman she saw it wasnt going to work that nothing she could say would square things between us her eyes glinted with sudden venom and her whine shifted abruptly to a vicious snarl all right get out get out and stay out and good riddance you you hooknosed little shyster ill give you a piece of advice first i said youd better stop telling those rotten lies about people before one of them stops you permanently know what i mean let them try she screamed id just like to see them try ill make things a lot hotter for em than they are now i left her screeches and screams followed me down the stairs and out of the house i drove back to the cottage and told rosa the outcome of my visit she listened to me frowning but dear do you think you should have done that if shes that far gone at the point where someone may kill her no ones going to dammit i said i was just trying to throw a scare into her if anyone was going to kill her they wouldnt have waited this long but shes never gone this far before has she rosa shook her head i wish you hadnt done it it now dont get angry but it just isnt like you she needs you and when someone needs you she smiled at me nervously with a kind of nervous firmness the cords in my throat began to tighten i said what luane devore needed was a padded cell she needed her tail kicked she needed a psychiatrist not a lawyer what the hell i said aint i entitled to a vacation i got to spend the whole goddamned summer with a poisonedtongue maniac banging my ear i dont get this i said i thought youd be pleased first you raise hell because im going to see her and now you raise hell because im not so i talk a little rosa shrugged im a woman that dont mean you should let me run your business i jumped up and danced around her i puffed out my cheeks and rolled my eyes and fluttered my hands this is you i said mrs nutty nonsense you know so damned much why aint you a lawyer the great man said rosa listen how the great attorney talks to his wife im sorry dear you do whatever you think is right and im sorry i said i guess maybe im getting old i guess things get on my nerves more than they used to i guess i guessed i might possibly have been a little hasty with luane devore dont let me influence you rosa said dont do what you think i want you to that way there is always trouble ralph devore the day i began thinking about killing luane was the day the season opened which was also the day the dance pavilion opened which was the day i met danny lee who was the vocalist with rags mcguires orchestra she was a shevocalist even if her name was danny a lot of girl vocalists have boys names take janie rags wife who was always with the band until she had that bad accident i mean until this year because there wasnt really any accident rags says it was another party by the same name and she is staying at home now to look after their boys who did not actually get killed after all well janie always sang under the name of jan mcguire i dont know why those girls do that because everyone knows that theyre girls they do anyway as soon as they see them and with janie you didnt even need to see her to know it you could just feel it i mean you could just be in the same building with her with your eyes closed maybe and youd know janie was there and no it wasnt because of her voice because she had more kind of a mans voice than a womans what they call a contralto or what they would call a contralto if she wasnt a pop singer because they dont seem to classify pop vocalists like they do the other kind rags was kidding when he said it he used to kid around a lot but he told me that janie was the only girl singer in the country who wasnt a coloratura or at least a lyric soprano he didnt know where the hell they all came from he said since there didnt used to be a coloratura come along more than once every ten years well anyway he cant say that any more i mean about janie being the only girl who isnt a coloratura because danny lee isnt one either shes got the same kind of voice that janie had only well kind of different and she even kind of looks like janie only rags gets sore when you say so so ive never done it but once rags is awfully funny in some ways nice you know but funny now me when you like a person when you think a lot of em i think you ought to show it i mean if youre me you have to you cant do anything else and you wouldnt think of saying or doing anything to hurt them but a lot of people are different and rags is one of them take with janie i know he thought the world of janie but he was all the time jumping on her always accusing her of something dirty she couldnt look at anyone crosseyed just being pleasant you know without him saying she was running after the guy or something like that and it just wasnt so you wouldnt find a nicer girl than janie in a month of sundays oh she drank a little i guess these last few years she drank quite a bit but well well leave that go a while now i was saying that id thought about killing luane that first day of the season but that isnt really the way it was i mean i didnt actually think about killing her what i thought about was how it would be maybe if she wasnt there i didnt want her not to be there exactly to be dead but still well you know i started off wondering how it would be if she was and then after a while i began kind of halfwishing that she was and then finally i thought about different ways that she might be because if she wasnt dead i mean i didnt know what i was going to do and you put yourself in my place and i dont think youd have known either usually during the winter anyway i lay around in bed until fivethirty or six in the morning but that day was the first of the season so i was up at four i dressed in the dark and slipped out into the starlight i did the chores sort of humming and grinning to myself feeling as tickled as a kid on christmas morning i felt good ill tell you it was dark and the air was pretty nippy at that hour of the morning but still everything seemed bright to me and i had that nice warm feeling inside it was like id been buried in a cave and id finally managed to get out and that was kind of the way it was too in a way because this last winter had really been a bad one take the engineers job at the courthouse firing the boilers now thats always been my job an hour morning and evening and an hour on saturday morning but last winter it wasnt mine and the school custodian job four hours a day and two days once a month that had always been mine too and now it wasnt i talked to the head of the county commissioners and he sent me to the county attorney and the way he explained it about the boilers was that the commissioners could be held liable for any money they spent in excess of what was necessary so automatic boilers were being installed and that was that i tried to argue with him but it didnt do any good it didnt do any good when i talked to the president of the school board doctor ashton they were dividing my job up among some of the vocational students i wouldnt be needed now or at any time in the future doc said and he gave me one of those straight hardeyed looks like the county attorney had so there i was a hundred and fifty dollars a month gone down the drain practically every bit of my winter income except for a little woodcutting and stuff like that well sure id always kept a pretty big garden canned and dried a lot of stuff and of course there were the pigs and we had our own eggs and milk and so on and naturally i had some money put by but you know you just cant figure that way i mean you cant count on standing on rock bottom you do that say and what happens if things get worse if a rainy day comes along and that water thats only been up to your chin goes over your nose money can go mighty fast when you dont have any coming in say you run in the hole five dollars a day why in a years time thats almost two thousand dollars and say youre forty like i am and youve got maybe twentyfive years to live unless you starve to death i tell you i was almost crazy with worry anyone would have been but now it was the first day of the season and all my worries were over i thought id just work a little harder make enough to make up for what i didnt make during the winter and everything would be fine i mean i thought it would be i finished my chores then i spread a big tarp in the back of the mercedesbenz and put my mower and tools inside youre probably wondering what a man like me is doing with a mercedes them being worth so much money but the point is theyre only worth a lot when youre buying you go to sell one its a different story i did get a pretty good offer or two for it back when i first got it two seasons ago but i kind of held on thinking i might get a better one and of course i liked it a lot too and i did need a car to get around in to haul myself and my tools and passengers during the season so maybe it was the wrong thing but it looked to me like i couldnt really lose since id gotten it for nothing so well ive still got it the man who did own it was a writes a motionpicture writer who used to come up here for the season he began having trouble with it right after i went to work for him and he had me tinker on it for him and it would run pretty good for a time and then it would go blooey again he got pretty sore about it i mean he got sore at the car one morning he got so mad he started to take an ax to it and i guess he would have if i hadnt stopped him well back then there was a summer rolls agency over at atlantic center thats a pretty big place probably ten times as big as manduwoc so i suggested to this writer that as long as he needed a car and he didnt like the mercedes why not let me tow him over there and see what kind of a tradein he could get well you know how it is those dealers can stick just about any price tag on a car they want to so this one said he could allow six thousand on the mercedes and the writer snapped him up on it and as soon as hed driven off the dealer signed the mercedes over to me i tinkered with the motor a little ive never had to touch it since yes this writer was pretty sore when he found out what had happened he claimed id deliberately put the mercedes on the blink and he threatened to have both me and that dealer arrested but he couldnt prove anything so it didnt bother me that much i mean after all a man thats got twentyfive or thirty thousand dollars to throw away on a car has got blamed little to fuss about and if he cant protect an investment like that he shouldnt have it in the first place after id finished loading the mercedes i went in and did a quick job on the house which didnt take long since id slicked everything up good the night before i ate breakfast and then i fixed more breakfast and carried it up to luane we had a real nice talk while she ate when she was through i gave her a sponge bath tickling her and teasing her until she was almost crying she laughed so hard as a matter of fact she did cry a little but not sad like she sometimes does it was more kind of wondering you know like when you know somethings true but you cant quite believe it you like me dont you she said you really do like me dont you well sure i said of course i dont need to tell you that youve never regretted anything wished things had been different regret what i said what would i want different well she gestured to travel see the world do something besides just work and eat and sleep why i do a lot besides that i said anyway what would i want to travel for when ive got everything i want right here have you darling she patted my cheek do you have everything you want i nodded maybe i didnt have everything i wanted right there in the house her being pretty well along in years but working like i do i didnt have to hunt very hard to get it most of the time it was the other way around well anyway i got her fixed up for the day with everything she might need and then i left feeling good like i said feeling like all my troubles were over i drove up to mr j b brocktons place and started to work on the lawn and in just about five minutes just about the time it took him to get out of the house all the good feeling was gone and i knew i hadnt seen any trouble compared with what i was liable to im sorry ralph he said sort of kicking at the grass with his toe i tried any number of times to reach you yesterday but your phone was always tied up i shook my head i just couldnt think of anything to say for a minute he wasnt like some of the summer people i worked for people who just order you around like you didnt have any feelings and maybe make jokes about you about the natives in front of their company he was more like a friend you know i liked him and he went out of his way to show that he liked me why just last season hed given me a couple suits two hundred and fifty dollar suits he said they were and of course he was probably exaggerating a little because how could just a suit of clothes cost two hundred and fifty but even if they only cost fifty or seventyfive it was a mighty handsome gift not something youd give to people unless you thought an awful lot of them mr brockton i said and that was as far as i could go for a minute mr brockton whats the matter well ill tell you ralph he said not looking at me still kicking at the grass doctor ashtons son got in touch with me by mail a week or so ago ive decided to give the work to him well you could have pushed me over with a dew drop i didnt know whether to laugh or cry bobbie ashton i said why what would bobbie be doing doing yard work why he must have been joking you mr brockton doc ashton why he always hires his own yard work done so why would bobbie ive already engaged him mr brockton said its all settled im sorry ralph he hesitated a second then he said i think doctor ashton is a good man i think bob is a fine boy well so do i i said you never heard me say anything else mr brockton i like them he said and i come here to rest to enjoy myself and i do not like in fact i refuse ralph to be drawn into community quarrels i knew what the trouble was then i knew there was nothing i could do about it all i could do now was to get to some other place as fast as i could so so i made myself smile i said i could see how he might feel and that he shouldnt feel bad about it on my account then i started reloading the mercedes ralph he said wait a minute yes sir i turned back around i can give you a job with my company in one of our factories something that you could do and that would pay quite well oh i said you mean in new york city mr brockton or new jersey newark i think youd like it ralph i think it would be the best thing that ever happened to you yes sir i said i guess youre probably right mr brockton and i sure do appreciate the offer but i guess not you guess not he said why not well i i just guess i hadnt better i said you see i never lived anywhere but here ive never been any further away than atlantic center and that was just for a couple of hours and just being away that far that little time i was so rattled and mixed up it was twothree days before i could calm down oh well he shrugged youd get over that i guess not i said i mean i cant mr brockton its kind of like i was rooted here like i was one of them those shrubs you try to put me down somewhere else and oh im not trying to far be it from me to persuade a man against his will he nodded kind of huffylike and headed for the house i drove away i knew he was probably right i kind of wished i could leave manduwoc just kind of you know and before that day was much older i was really wishing it with hardly any kindof at all but there just wasnt any way that i could luane would never leave here even if she would what good would it do any place we went people would laugh and talk about us like theyd always done here thered be the same stories well not exactly the same i guess because outsiders wouldnt know about pa so they wouldnt be apt to say that pa and luane well that i was really her son instead of her husband or her son as well as her husband but however it was it would be bad and luane would start striking back twice as hard like shed struck back here probably shed do it anyhow even if people did have the good manners and kindness to keep their mouths shut because shed been the way she was now for so long shed lost the knack for being any other way i felt awful sorry for luane shed sure given up a lot on my account she was a lady and she came from a proud old family shed been a good churchgoer and a charityworker and everything like that and then just because she wanted someone to love before she got too old for it why there was all that dirtiness stuff that took the starch right out of you and filled you up with something else no it didnt bother me too much i guess i just didnt have enough sense to be bothered and of course i never amounted to anything to begin with but it did something pretty terrible to luane she didnt show it for a long time except maybe a little around me she had too much pride but the hurt was there inside festering and spreading and finally breaking out and then really getting bad getting a little worse the older she got i sure wished luane could go away with me i figured i could make out pretty fine with luane with someone like that you know someone who knew her way around and could tell you what to do someone that really loved you and you could talk to and and well i guess i just hadnt wanted to face the facts there at mr j b brocktons place i mean it was such an awful setback i didnt feel like i could bear any more i just couldnt admit that it would be the same way wherever else i went because what was i going to do if it was how was i going to live what would i do if i couldnt make out here and i couldnt go any place else you can see how id be kind of stunned so scared that i couldnt look at the truth even with my nose rubbed in it so anyway i went on to all the other estates i made them all just taking no for an answer at first and then arguing and finally begging and of course it was the same story everywhere i was just wasting my breath and my time they were sorry sure most of em said they were anyhow but bobbie ashton had asked for the work and doc ashton was an influential man and he treated most of them so bobbie was going to get it it was noon by the time id gone to the last place i could go to i drove down to the beach and ate the lunch id packed that morning gulping it down not really tasting it twentyfive years i thought twentyfive years but no a man like me would probably live a lot longer than that thirtyfive or forty probably maybe even fifty or sixty fifty or sixty years with everything going out and nothing coming in yes there was a little work around town for the local residents you know but it wasnt worth bothering with just fifty cents here and a dollar there anyway the kids had it all sewed up i wondered if it would do any good for me to talk to bobbie but i didnt wonder long hed made up his mind to run me out of town to get back at luane through me doc ashton settled here a little short of seventeen years ago his wife had died in childbirth so he had this negro wet nurse for bobbie the woman who still works for them as housekeeper doc was quite a young man then the woman was young too in fact shes still fairly young and pretty goodlooking besides well bobbie was sick when he got here the colic or something and he no sooner got over that than he was hit by something else every disease you ever heard of practically why bobbie had it one right after another year after year he couldnt play with other kids couldnt go to school he was hardly out of the house for almost twelve years then finally i guess because hed had every blamed sickness there was to get he didnt get any more he began to shoot up and broaden out all at once he was just about the healthiest huskiest and handsomest kid you ever saw in your life and smart you couldnt believe a kid could be that smart and probably you wont find many that are i suppose he got a lot of it from all those books hed read when he couldnt do anything else but there was plenty more to bobbies smartness than booklearning he just seemed to have been born with a head on him a head with all the answers he could do things without being told how or reading about em or maybe even hearing of em before not just lessons you know but anything he went through eight grades of grammar school in a year he went through high school in a year and a half at least he could have gone through if he hadnt dropped out the last semester now it didnt look like hed be going to college he wouldnt be studying to be a doctor and how doc ashton would be feeling about that i hated to think i wadded up my lunch sack and put it in a trash basket then i got a drink of water from one of the picnicker fountains and drove up to the dance pavilion the big front doors were swung open i went inside circled around in front of the bandstand and stopped in the doorway of pete pavlovs office he was at his desk bent over some papers he glanced up squirted a stream of tobacco into a spittoon and bent back over the papers again hes one of those roundfaced squarebuilt men about fifty i guess he wore khaki pants with both a belt and suspenders and a blue work shirt with a black bow tie his hair was parted on the side and there was a blob of shaving soap up around one of the temples i waited i began to get a little uneasy even though i was practically sure that i had a job with him for the summer because any time pete pavlov could do anything to annoy people in manduwoc he was just about certain to do it i mean hed go out of his way to get under their hides and giving me work would get under em bad he didnt need to care what they thought of him his business was all with the summer trade he owned most of the rent cottages and the pavilion and two of the hotels and oh probably twothirds of the concession buildings so to heck with manduwoc was the way he felt the town people hadnt ever done anything for him in fact theyd always been kind of down on him sort of resentful because even back when he was a day laborer cleaning out cesspools or anything he could get to do he was as independent as a hog on ice hed do a good days work but he wouldnt say thankyou for his pay if anyone called him by his first name or just pavlov hed do exactly the same thing with them no matter who they were or how much money they had he straightened up from his desk and looked at me i smiled and said hello and remarked that it was a nice day i said i guess i better be getting to work hadnt i pete he waited for me to say something else i didnt because i was just too worried here was maybe another twentyfive dollars a week going down the hole the only chance i had left for any income pete kind of squirmed around in his chair kind of scratching his rear i guess he leaned back and picked something out of his nose and held it up and looked at it and then he pushed his lips out moved them in and out while he stared down at his desk well hell he said i tell you how it is ralph the way this goddamned summer business is going i figure on hiring out myself i didnt say anything i guessed things werent as good for him as they used to be but i knew he was still setting pretty he had plenty all right pete pavlov did it would take more than a few slack seasons to hurt him much what are you looking like that for he said you think im a goddamned liar then his eyes flickered and shifted and he let out a whoop of laughter and slapped his hand down on his desk well youre right by god i wish you could have seen your face really had you going didnt i aw no you didnt i said i knew you were joking all the time you know what a broom looks like he waved me toward the door well see if you can find one thatll fit your hands i got out i got busy on the restrooms and after a while as he was leaving for downtown he looked in on me stood around talking and joking for a few minutes he asked about luane and said he was pretty goddamned hurt the way she never told any dirty stories about him i laughed kind of uncomfortable and said i guessed that was his fault not hers which was mainly the way it was of course because how can you mud a man up when hes already covered himself with it to annoy people you know whats the point in saying that a man does such and such or so and so when he lets em all know it himself he had a family a wife and daughter but luane couldnt do much to dirty them either there just wasnt enough to them you know to hold dirt they were dowdy and drab they went around with their shoulders slumped and their heads bowed like they might cut and run if you looked their way no one was interested in them there wasnt anything to be interested in and if the time ever came when there was well i figured luane would do some tall thinking before she gossiped about it you see years ago before luane and i were married her father gave pete an awful raw deal cheated him out of a pile of money and then placed it in luanes name so that pete couldnt sue luanes always felt kind of guilty about it shed think a long time before she did anything else to hurt pete or his family well pete said i got a feeling that this may be a good season after all the best damned season yet i think it will too i said i think youre right pete he left i finished with the washrooms and went back to his office i pulled a chair up to the airvent took off the grate and crawled up inside the duct i crawled through it slowly squirming along on my stomach brushing all the dust and cobwebs and dead bugs in front of me it was so hot and stuffy i could hardly breathe and i kept sneezing and bumping my head and i was just about one big muddy smear of sweat and dust i crawled through all the duct the branches and the main and came out at the rear of the building i dropped down to the roof of the blower shed i started up the big fourhorse motor tightened the belt to the fan and went in the back door of the mens room i looked at myself in the mirror and man was i a mess dirt and cobwebs from head to foot i started to turn on the water at one of the sinks and then i stopped with my hand a couple of inches away kind of frozen in the air i stood that way for a few seconds listening to the piano to rags listening to her then i turned toward the door picking up my broom sort of automatically and went out into the ballroom it was pretty shadowed in there and there was just the swivelnecked light on over the piano so for a second i thought it was janie up there singing then i started across the floor and pretty soon i saw it was another girl she had the same kind of voice as janie and the same kind of candycolored hair but she was quite a bit bigger i dont mean she was any taller or that she probably weighed any more but still she was bigger in certain places you know you could see that she was without even halfway studying the matter because it was still pretty warm there in the ballroom and rags was stripped to the waist and all she had on was a bra and a little skimpy pair of shorts i thought she was a mighty good singer but i knew rags wasnt pleased with her i knew because he was putting her through stardust having her rehearse it when hed always told me that no singer needed to thats one they cant bitch up see hed told me they can do it with all the others but stardust huhuh he brought his hands down on the keys suddenly with just a big crash she stopped singing and turned toward him her face hard and sullenlooking all right rags said you win baby ill send for liberace me im too old to run races im sorry she mumbled not looking a darned bit sorry never mind that sorry stuff he said your names lee aint it danny lee aint it you know what it is she said im asking you he said its not carmichael or porter or mercer is it this aint your music is it youve got no right to bitch it up have you youre goddamned right you havent its theirs they made it and the way they made it is the way it should be so cut out the embroidery cut out that barahead stuff just get with it and stay with it he picked up his cigarette from the piano and tucked it into the corner of his mouth he brought his hands down on the keys he seemed to kind of stroke them the keys i mean but yet there was no running together every note came through clear and firm soft but sharp so smooth and easy and sweet danny lee took a deep breath she held it the bra swelled full and tight she was nodding her head with the music tapping one toe listening and then opening her mouth and letting her breath out in the stardust words softhusky pushing them out from down deep inside letting them float out with that husky softness still warm and sweet from the place theyd been i looked at rags his eyes were closed and there was a smile on his lips i looked back at the girl and i kind of frowned she didnt hardly have to move at all to look like she was moving a lot and she was moving a lot now and if there was one thing that burned rags mcguire up it was that he said it was cheap he said singers who did that were acrobats rags opened his eyes his smile went away and he lifted his hands from the keys and laid them in his lap he didnt curse he didnt yell for a minute he hardly seemed to move and the silence was so thick you could cut it with a knife then he motioned for her to come over to the piano she hesitated then went over kind of dragging her feet sullen and hardfaced and watchfullooking and then rags reamed her out real hard it was pretty rough she took her place again rags brought his hands down on the keys and she began to sing i moved in close rags gave me a little nod i stood up close drinking her voice in drinking her in she finished the song without thinking how it might seem to rags like i might be butting in you know i busted out clapping it had been so nice i just had to rags eyes narrowed then he grinned and made a gesture toward me okay baby take off he said youve passed the acid test i guess he meant it as kind of an insult just to her of course because he and i are good friends and always kidding around a lot anyway she started down at me and gosh id forgot all about what a mess i was and then she whirled around bent over and stuck out her bottom at me kind of wiggled at me rags let out a whoop he whooped with laughter banging his fists down on the top of the piano making so much noise that you couldnt hear what she was yelling although i guess it was mostly cuss words he was still whooping and pounding as she marched back across the bandstand and down the steps to the dressing room i grinned or tried to feeling a little funny naturally but not at all mad rags mcguire i saw her for the first time about four months ago it was in a place in fort worth far out on west seventh street i wasnt looking for her or it or anything id just started walking that night and when id walked as far as i could i was in front of this place so i went inside there was a small bar up front in the rear was a latticedoff open roof area with a lot of tables and a crowd of beer drinkers i sat down and ordered a stein the waitress came with it another woman came right behind her and helped herself to a chair she was a pretty wretchedlooking bag not that it would have meant anything to me if she hadnt been i gave her a couple bucks and said no thanks she went away and the threepiece group on the bandstand sax piano and drums went back to work they werent good of course but they were dixieland they played the music and thats something they played the music or tried to and these days thats really something they did sugar blues and wang wang and goofus there was a kitty on the bandstand a replica of a cats hat with a please feed the sign so at intermission i sent the waitress up with a twentydollar bill i didnt notice that it was a twenty until it was in her hand id meant to make it a five which was a hell of a lot more than i could afford anything was a lot more than i could afford but she already had it and you dont hear the music much any more so i let it go the waitress pointed me out to them they all stood up and smiled and bowed to me and for a moment i was stupid enough to think that they knew who i was for naturally they didnt they dont know you any more if you play the music only the players of crap the atonal clashbang offkey stuff that saint vitus himself couldnt dance to to these lads i was just a big spender thats all i was to anyone in the place i saw the waitress go over to a table in the corner there was a man seated at it facing me a guy with a beerbleared face and a suit that must have cost all of eighteen dollars there was also a girl her back turned my way the waitress whispered to her and the girl got up her companion made noises of protest and a burly shirtsleeved character who had been lurking in the vicinity grabbed him by the collar and hustled him out the girl started toward the bandstand there was a small burst of handclapping and steinthumping and my eyes snapped open and my heart pounded and i half rose out of my chair and then i settled back down again because of course it wasnt janie janie wouldnt be in a joint like this she wouldnt be hanging around with barflies anyway i knew where janie was at home looking after the boys whoring and guzzling and janie was back in new york id talked to her longdistance that night had her sing to me over the telephone it was melancholy baby one of our alltime hit recordings one of the dozenodd which still sell considerably and thank god they do although i dont know who the hell buys them probably they all go to insane asylums the patients there it must be that way the poor devils must all be locked up since there seems to be nothing on the outside any more but tonedeaf morons why goddammit i talked to a man a while back one of those pseudoerudite bastards who is mopping up with articles about modern music the socalled upbeat cool crap i said let me ask you something suppose the printer started interpreting your articles suppose he started leaving out lines and putting in his own suppose he threw away your punctuation and put in his own how would you feel if he did that an interpretation of your stuff i shouldnt have wasted my time on him of course i shouldnt even have spit on him he called himself a music critic a critic by god and hed never heard of blue steele the girl didnt look like janie not the slightest id only thought she did at the time she sang it was dont get around much any more another old hit of janies and mine and she bitched it up brother did she bitch it but when i closed my eyes she had a voice she had what it took raw and undeveloped as it was and she hit you thats the only way i can say it she hit you she brought out the goosebumps like that first blast of air when you step into an airconditioned room and god knows i dont expect much i work for something good i do my best to get it but i dont really expect it i began to get a little excited i did some fast mental calculations i was working single at the moment doing a series of club dates and i was just squeaking by but the resort season wasnt too far off and i had some recording checks due and it would be easy enough to whip together another band i could just about swing it i thought a five man combo including myself and this girl i couldnt make any money with it not playing the music id be very lucky in fact if i could break even but i could do it do something by god that needed to be done give this mixedup world something that it ought to have regardless of whether it knew it or wanted it she finished the song she was at my table before i could motion to her i was still wrapped up in my calculations i heard her pitch but it was a minute or two before it sank in on me and perhaps i should have expected it and perhaps by god i should not have from some girls yes from any other girl but not her not someone with the music in them i wanted to spit on her i wanted to break my stein slash her throat with it so that she would never sing another word instead i said fine i hated sleeping by myself i suppose my expression had startled her at any rate she drew back a little she didnt mean that she said all she meant was that maybe i could buy her dinner some place and we could have a nice visit since she was alone too and maybe i could help her buy a new dress because a drunk had spilt some beer on this one and she was really a nice girl she told me so herself she was just doing this because her mother was awfully sick a sick mother no less and she had a couple of younger brothers to support and her father was dead and crops had been awfully bad on this farm she came from and so on ad infinitum ad nauseam the only thing she spared me was the fineoldsouthernfamily routine if shed pulled that i think i would have killed her i took a couple of twenties out of my wallet and riffled them she simpered around a little more and then she went back to my hotel with me i looked at her and suddenly i turned and ducked into the bathroom i hunched over hugging my stomach feeling my guts twist and knot themselves wanting to scream with the pain i puked and wept silently and it was better then i washed my face and went back into the bedroom i told her to get her clothes on i told her what i could and would do for her all the clothes shed need good clothes a years contract at two hundred dollars a week yes two hundred dollars a week and a chance to make something of herself a chance eventually to make two thousand five thousand ten thousand more than a chance an absolute certainty because i would make something of her i would not let her fail she believed me people usually do believe me if i care to make the effort still she hung back apparently too shocked by the break i was offering her to immediately accept it i gave her twenty dollars promised her another twenty to meet me at the club in the morning she did so we had the place to ourselves except for the cleaning people and i gave her a sample of what i could do for her a good sample because i wanted her firmly hooked with what i had in mind the two hundred a week might not be enough to hold her that invalid mother and two brothers et cetera notwithstanding i wanted to give her a glimpse of the mint boost her high enough up the wall so that even a whoring moron such as she could see it and i did i worked with her a couple hours at the end of that time she was no longer terrible but merely bad which to her of course seemed nothing less than wonderful she was beaming and bubbling and the sun seemed to have risen behind her eyes i can hardly believe it she said it seems kind of like magic like a beautiful dream the dream will get better i said it will come true assuming that is that you want to accept my offer oh i do you know i do she said i dont know how to thank you mr mcguire i told her not to bother she didnt owe me any thanks we went back to my room and i closed and locked the door she seemed to crumple a little grow smaller and the sun went out of her eyes she stammered that she wouldnt do it then that she didnt want to finally as i waited she asked if she had to ive never done anything like that before honestly i havent mr mcguire only once anyway and it wasnt for money i was in love with him this boy back in my home town and we were supposed to be married and then he went away and i thought i was pregnant so i left and never mind i said if you dont want to and itll be all right she looked at me anxiously youll still s still i didnt say anything wwill it will it mr mcguire please please if you only knew if i only knew believed that she was really a good girl if i only knew how much she wanted to sing how much this meant to her you know i shrugged remained silent but inside i was praying and what i was praying was that she would tell me to go to hell i could have got down and kissed her feet for that if she had insisted on being what the good lord had meant her to be or being nothing keeping the music undefiled or keeping it silent where it was if only it had meant that much to her as much as it meant to me and it didnt it never means as much even a fraction as much as it means to me not to janie not to anyone no one cares about the music except for me it would vanish and there would be no more slowly she unbuttoned her dress slowly she pulled it down off one shoulder i stared at her grinning wanting to yell and wanting to weep and blackness swam up on me from the floor dropped down over me from above i came out of it she was kneeling in front of me my head was against her and she was wet with my tears and she was crying and holding me mister mcguire wwhats the matter mmist oh darling baby honeylamb what can i she brushed her lips against my forehead stroked my hair whispering better now sweetheart is dannys dearest honeypie bet you rotten lowdown little whore i said pete pavlov was waiting at the station when we came in late thursday night the boys and danny went on down to their cottages and i went to his office with him i like pete i like his bluntness his going straight to the point of a matter there is no compromise about him he knows what he wants and he will take nothing else and whether it suits anyone else makes not the damnedest bit of difference to him he did not ask about janie nor the why of the new band that was my business and pete minds his own business he simply poured us a couple whopping drinks tossed me a cigar and asked me if i knew where he could lay his hands on a fast ten or twenty thousand i said i wished i did he shrugged and said he didnt really suppose i would and just to forget hed said anything then he said excuse me mac pete has always called me mac know i didnt need to tell you to keep quiet thats okay i said things pretty bad pete he said they were goddamned bad so bad that hed fire his hotels if he could collect on them those goddamned insurance companies he said yknow i figure thats why so many people get burned to death because the companies wont pay off on empty buildings guess i should have fired mine while they were open but i kind of hated to take a chance on roasting someone i laughed and shook my head i hardly knew what to say i knew what i should say but i wasnt quite up to saying it hardpressed as i was he went on to explain his situation hed never borrowed any money locally hed always done business on a cash basis then when things began to tighten up hed gone to some new york factors and now the interest was murdering him no usury laws when it comes to business loans yknow did you know that well thats the way she stands i dont get up ten twenty thousand im just about going to be wiped out he took a chew of tobacco grunted sardonically own damned fault i guess too goddamned stubborn should have unloaded when things first started slipping you couldnt have done it pete i said if you knew how to give up youd never have got to where you are he said he guessed that was so guessed he didnt know how to lay down and didnt want to learn pete i said look your contract is with the agency and i cant cut the price but i can rebate on it hell with you he said you ugly ornery overgrown bastard he walked around the room grunting that there were too damned many throats in need of cutting without bleeding some dullwitted sonofabitch like me who ought to have a guardian looking after him nope he said turning back around i aint that bad off if i was i just wouldnt have signed up for you this year maybe you shouldnt have i said and look pete you cant break that contract but if i should refuse to play nope no now listen to me he said i wouldnt do it even if i didnt like to listen to that damned pounding of yours i got to keep the pavilion open once i closed it itd be kind of a signal i might as well paint a bullseye on my butt and tell em all to start kicking we went on drinking and talking talking of things in general and nothing much in particular he said that when kossmeyer came down the three of us ought to get together some night and have us a bull session i said id like that some time when i was feeling good and didnt have anything on my mind i like him i said hes a hell of an interesting little guy and a nice one but sometimes yknow pete i get a feeling that he aint where im seeing him i mean hes right in front of me but it seems like hes walking all around me looking me over staring through the back of my head pete laughed he gives you that feeling too huh aint it funny mac all the people there are in the world and how many there are you can just sit down and cut loose and be yourself with i said it certainly was funny or tragic well hell he said finally and three is seven daddys gone and went to heaven guess you and me ought to be getting some sleep mac we said goodnight and he went off toward town his chunky body moving in a straight line i went to my cottage feeling consciencestricken and depressed by my failure to help him by my failures period bitch and botch that was me in common honesty i ought to start billing myself that way bitch and botch and his band and bitch i could work up a theme song out of it set it to the melody of well goodie goodie lets see now tatuh ta ta turn tatuh i worked on that for a minute and then swore softly to myself i couldnt do anything right any more not the simplest damnedest ordinary thing take tonight for example my people were new here there are rows and rows of cottages all exactly alike yet i hadnt bothered to see that they got to the right ones to see that they were comfortably settled id just gone my own merry way thinking only of myself and to hell with them it didnt matter of course about danny lee she could sleep on the beach for all i cared but my men poor bastards were a different matter they had enough to bear as it was those sad sad bastards just barely squeaking by year after year working for the minimum and tickled to death to get it bigtalking and bragging when they know for certainly they must know that they were unfitted to wipe a real musicians tail it must be very hard to maintain a masquerade like that i felt very sorry for them my men and i was very gentle with them they had no talent nothing to build on nothing to give there can be nothing more terrible it seems to me than having nothing to give i unpacked my suitcases and climbed into bed i fell asleep slipping almost immediately into that old familiar dream where everyone in the band was me i was on the trumpet the saxandclarinet i was on the trombone at the drums and of course the piano all of us were me the whole combo and danny lee janie was the vocalist but shethey were also me and it was not perfect the music was not quite perfect but it was close so close by god all wei needed was a little more time time is all it takes if you have it to work with and iwokeup it was a little after twelve noon the smell of coffee drifted through my window along with snatches of conversation it came from the boys cabin they were batching together to save money they were keeping their voices low and our cottages like the others were thirty feet apart but sound carries farther around water did you hear what he said to me claimin i had a lip why goddammit i been pla yin trumpet hell you got off easy what about him asking me if i had rheumatism and i needed a hammer to close the valves the wildeyed bastard is crazy thats all i leave it to you charlie you ever hear me slide in or off a note i ever have to feel for em why they were all chiming in trying to top one another but the drummer finally got and held the floor i listened to his complaints the bitter lowpitched voice and i was both startled and hurt possibly i had seemed a little sharp to the others but i certainly hadnt meant to i had only been joking trying to make light of something that could not be helped with the drummer however i had been especially gentle exceedingly careful to do or say nothing that might hurt his pride he had nothing at all to feel bitter about that i could see it was true that i had joked with him but in the mildest of ways i had not so much corrected him as tried to get him to correct himself i had tossed him a bag of peanuts on one occasion on a couple of others i had suddenly held a mirror in front of him at the height of his idiotic orgiastic contortions i had had him look at himself that was all i had said nothing it was pointless to say anything since english was even more than a mystery to him than music and i saw no necessity to it seemed best simply to let him look at himself at the man become monkey and how that could possibly have made him sore why he should blame me for the way he looked well the hell with it he wasnt worth worrying about or bothering with none of them were only danny lee danny lees voice i wished to god i could have gotten hold of her a couple of years sooner by now shed have been at the top so good that she wouldnt have been caught dead in a place like this i shaved and bathed and dressed i walked over to her cottage and told her to show at the pavilion at two oclock sharp then i dropped in on the boys they saw or heard me coming for their voices rose suddenly in awkward selfconscious conversation i went in and there was a stilted exchange of greetings and a heavy silence and then two of them offered me coffee at the same time i declined said i was eating in town by the way i added can i do anything for you guys in town mail some letters to the local for you they knew id heard them then i looked at them smiling one eyebrow cocked glancing from one sheepish reddening silly face to another no one said a word no one made a move they almost seemed to have stopped breathing and i stared at them and suddenly i was sick with shame i mumbled that everything was jake i told them theyd better get out and have some fun to rent a boat buy some swim trunks anything they needed and to charge it to me no rehearsal today i said none any day i got out of there i ate and went to the pavilion and went to work with danny lee after a while ralph devore showed up ralphs the handymanjanitor here also the floorman the guy who moves around among the dancers and maintains order and so on hes a hell of a handsome guy vaguely reminiscent of someone i seem to have seen in pictures he has a convertible mercedes which i understand he got through some elaborate chiseling and dressed up in those fancy duds he has he looks like a matinee idol but he wasnt dressed up now now when danny lee was seeing him for the first time he looked like bowery bill from trashcan hill she was so burned up when he gave her a hand and i kidded her about it that she flounced her butt at him she stomped off to the dressing room ralph and i chewed the fat a little and i began to get a very sweet idea a plan for giving miss danny her comeuppance i could see that ralph had fallen for her he wanted her so bad he could taste it so with him looking as he did or could and danny being what she was i put it up to ralph giving him slightly less than the facts about danny i said that she not only looked like a nice girl but she was one very nice the sole support of her family in fact so how did that cut any ice he wasnt going to rape her he could just take her out and leave the rest up to her if she wanted to cut loose okay and if not the same well he hesitated nervously it just dont somehow seem right rags i mean fooling a nice little girl like that i dont like people foolin me and so wheres the harm i said if she really wants to hang on to it money wont make any difference to her if it does make a difference all the dough youre supposed to have theres still no harm done what she loses cant be worth much well yeah he said yeah but i was afraid he was going to ask why my enthusiasm for the enterprise but i neednt have worried he was too absorbed in danny so hard hit that he was in kind of a trance and vaguely with part of my mind i wondered about that ralph had seen sexy babes before seen them and had them they were invariably kitchen maids or shopgirls on an outing but still they had what it took all that ralph being married was interested in she looks kind of tough he murmured absently awful sweet kind of but tough like she could be plenty hardboiled if she took the notion oh well i said think what a hard time shes had supporting an invalid mother and i bet she knows her way around dont she and youd win i said she can take care of herself ralph you wont be taking advantage of her at all well he squirmed indecisively i i what you want me to do he had some good clothes in his car i told him to get washed and change into them while i fixed things up with danny and hurry i said as he hesitated get back here as fast as you can you cant keep a high class girl like her waiting he snapped out of it and hurried away i went down to the dressing room she was waiting there sullen and defiant and a little afraid i hadnt told her she could go to her cottage so she waited i looked at her sorrowfully slowly shaking my head well you really tore it that time sister i said you know who that guy was just about the richest man in this county owns most of the beach property around here has a big piece of this pavilion as a matter of fact ill bet she said but a trifle uncertainly oh sure how did pete pavlov stack up to you i said hardly a fashionplate huh you just cant figure these local people that way baby they keep right on working after they get it they dont go in for show while theyre working she studied my face uncertainly trying to read it i took her by the elbow and led her to the window who does that guy look like down there i said for ralph was just taking his clothes out of the mercedes what do you think a buggy like that costs you think an ordinary janitor would be driving it she stiffened slightly hell that mercedes even bowls me over then she shrugged with attempted indifference so what she asked what did it mean to her if he was loaded just thought youd like to know i said just thought you might like to meet him he could do a lot for a gal if he took the notion to uhhuh she said you just want to help me i suppose youre doing me favors suit yourself i picked up my shirt and began putting it on its entirely up to you baby you do a little thinking though and maybe youll remember me doing you a favor or two before it maybell occur to you that i cant be any harder on you than i am on myself and it aint making me a penny all right she snapped what do you want me to do about it ive tried to thank you ive ive never mind i said im satisfied just to see you get ahead thats all ive ever wanted i finished buttoning my shirt i tucked the tails in studying her out of the corner of my eye she was wavering teetering one way then the other wavering and then convinced like the stupid moronic tramp she was there was nothing in her head only in her throat and you could dump a thousand gallons of vinegar down it and shed still expect the next cup to be lemonade well she said he did seem awfully nice i mean i couldnt tell what he looked like much but he acted nice and respectful and and he clapped for me hes a wonderful guy i said one of the best well well i guess i ought to apologize anyway she said i ought to do that even if he was only a janitor she preceded me up the steps she started to open the door that leads out to the bandstand and suddenly i put out my hand danny wait baby it was the way i said it the last word a way id never thought i could say it to her she froze in her tracks one foot on one step the other the shorts drawn high and tight upon her thighs then her head moved and she looked slowly over her shoulder wwhat she stammered what did you cal say nothing i said i guess i nothing tell me she said tell me what you want rags i want i said i want the unobtainable that was all the nonexistent the that which neverwouldbe i wanted it and i did not want it for once achieved there would be nothing left to live for i want you to get your butt out of my face i said fast before i kick it off of you bobbie ashton i finished at the thorncastle estate about fourthirty in the afternoon and mr thorncastle that fine democratic fatbottomed man paid me off personally my bill came to twelve dollars i looked at him from under my lashes as he paid it and he added an extra five managing to stroke my hand in the process he is a very juicylooking character this thorncastle i had some difficulty in getting away from him without kicking him in the groin father was already at the table when i reached home i washed hastily and joined him begging his pardon for keeping him waiting he snatched up his fork then he slammed it down and asked me just how long i intended to keep up this nonsense the yard work i said why permanently perhaps it would seem well suited to my station in life you know with so much racial discrimination and stop it his face whitened dont ever let me hear you and theres the money i said a chance to advance myself financially like ralph devore i suppose like the town oddjobs man i shrugged the facts of the matter were under his nose even if he like the rest of the town was too dullwitted to see them ralph had earned approximately twentyeight hundred dollars a year for the past twentytwo years he had spent practically nothing ergo he now had a minimum of fifty thousand dollars and probably a great deal more he had it he would have to and now that his income was cut off he would be worried frantic for fifty thousand would not represent enough security to ralph not fifty thousand or a hundred thousand he would visualize its disappearing vanishing into nothingness before his life span had run he would be terrified and his terror must certainly react terrifyingly upon luane i wondered where he had hidden the money since naturally he had hidden it how else could he keep its possession a secret as in his insecurity he would feel that he had to well no matter where it was now there was still this first stage of the game to play when it was played out i would concentrate on the money locate and appropriate it and watch what happened to luane then she had behaved very badly luane she had made the serious mistake of telling the truth that was unfair it was theft the truth was mine i had earned it painfully and it belonged to me and now after years of waiting and planning it was worthless a heap of rust instead of the stout sharppronged lever i was entitled to what good was the truth now how could i use it on him now not much not enough not nearly enough he was talking again bumbling on with his nonsense about my returning to school whether i thought i was or not youre going understand youre going to complete your education you can finish up your high school here or you can go away and then youre going on to am i i said you certainly are why what kind of a boy are you letting some gossips some fool woman spoil your life no one believes anything she says oh yes they do i said yes they do father i could name at least three who do right here in our own household he stared at me his mouth trembling the mist of fear and frustration in his eyes i winked at him hoping he would start blubbering but of course he didnt he has too much pride for that too much dignity ah what a proud upright man my father is you have to leave he said slowly you must see that you have to leave this town with your mind with no outlet for your intelligence ill think about it i said ill let you know what i decide i said youd leave youll do what i say ill tell you what ill do i said exactly dear father as i damned please and if what pleases me doesnt please you you know what you can do about it he stood up abruptly flinging his napkin to the table he said yes he confounded well did know what he could do and hed just about reached the point where he was ready to do it you mean youd call in the authorities i said id hate to see you do that father id feel forced to go into the background of my supposed incorrigibility and the result might be embarrassing for you i gave him a sunny smile he whirled and stamped away to his office he was back a moment later his hat on his medicine kit in one hand do one thing at least he said for your own good stay away from that pavlov girl myra why should i stay away from her i said stay away from her he repeated you know what pete pavlovs like if if you he yes i said im afraid i dont understand what possible objection could pavlov have to his daughters going about with doctor ashtons wellbred brilliant and i might add handsome son please bob his voice sagged tiredly please do it leave her alone i hesitated thoughtfully after a long moment i shrugged well all right i said if it means that much to you thank you i ill leave her alone i said whenever i get ready to not before he didnt flinch or explode much to my disappointment apparently hed been partially prepared for the trick he simply stared at me hardeyed and when he spoke his voice was very very quiet i have one more thing to say he said a considerable quantity of narcotics is missing from my stock if i discover any further shortages ill see to it that youre punished imprisoned or institutionalized ill do it regardless of what it does to me he turned and left i scraped up the dishes and carried them out into the kitchen hattie was at the stove her back turned to me she stiffened as i went in then turned part way around trying to keep an eye on me while appearing occupied with her work hattie is probably thirtynine or forty now she isnt as pretty as i remember her as a child i thought she was the loveliest woman in the world then but she is still something to take a second look at i put the dishes in the sink i moved along the edge of the baseboard smiling to myself watching her neck muscles tighten as i moved out of her range of vision i was right behind her before fear forced her to whirl around she pressed back against the stove putting her hands out in a pushingaway gesture why mother i said whats the matter youre not afraid of your own darling son are you go way her eyes rolled whitely lea me alone you hear but i just wanted a kiss i said just a kiss from my dear sweet mother after all i havent had one now since well i was about three wasnt i a very long time for a child to go without a kiss from his own mother i remember being rather heartbroken when ddont she moaned you dont know nothin about get outta here i tell doctor on you an he you mean youre not my mother i said youre truly not nno i tol you aint i aint nothin nobody i i well all right i shrugged in that case i grabbed her suddenly clamped her against me pinning her arms to her sides she gasped moaned struggled futilely she didnt of course cry out for help how about it i said as long as youre not my mother keep it all in the family huh what do you say we i let go of her laughing i stepped back wiping her spittle from my face why hattie i said why on earth did you do a thing like that all i wanted was what my heart did a painful skipjump and there was a choking lump in my throat what i dont believe i understood you hattie she looked at me lips curled back from her teeth eyes narrowed steady with contempt with something beyond contempt beyond disgust and hatred you hear me right she said you couldn do nothin couldn an never will yes i said are you very sure of that my dearest mother huh me i tell you she grinned a skulls grin yeah i ver sure aw right my deares son and it amuses you i said well ill tell you mother doubtless it is very funny but i dont believe wed better have any further displays of amusement not that id mind killing you you understand in fact ill probably get around to that eventually but i have other projects afoot at the moment more important projects if i may say so without hurting your feelings she moved suddenly made a dash for her room i followed her it adjoins the kitchen and leaned absently against the door the locked door to my mothers room the door that had been locked for yes my recollection was right it is always right i had been about three the last time she had kissed me the last time she had cuddled babied motherandbabied me i would have remembered it even if i did not have almost total recall for how could one forget such a fierce outpouring of love the balmlike soulsatisfying warmth of it or forget its abrupt nevertobeagain withdrawal or the stupid selfish cruel bewildering insistence that it had never been i was a very silly little boy i was a very foolish bad little boy and i had better pray god to forgive me i was not sweets or hon or darlin or even bobbie i was mister bobbie master robert mistah mastah bobbie a reborn stranger among strangers my continuing illnesses psychosomatic the manifold masques of frustration my intelligence compensatory for certainly i inherited none from either of them i listened at night when they thought i was asleep i asked a few questions strategically spacing them months apart shed had a child shed had to wetnurse me where was that child dead well where and when had he died when and where had my mother died it was ridiculously simple only a matter of putting a few questions to a fatuous imbecile my father and an oversexed docile moron my mother and listening to them at night listening and wanting to shriek with laughter hed be ruined if anyone found out it would ruin my life wreck all my chances it would be that way if and what way did the blind stupid silly sonofabitch think it was now what worse way could it be than as it was now and no it did not need to be that way neednt and wouldnt have been for a man with courage and honesty and decency i had deduced the truth by the time i was five several years later when i was able to be up and around to post and receive letters secretly i proved my deductions he my father had practiced in only one other state before coming to this one it had no record of a birth to mrs james ashton or of the death of said mrs ashton there was however a record of the birth of a son to one hattie marie smith and the attending physician was dr james ashton well or perhaps i should say well as a matter of fact i said goddammit since the cigarette was scorching my fingers i dropped it to the floor ground it out with my shoe and rapped on my mothers door mother i said mammy i knocked harder you heah me talkin to you mammy well you sho bettah answer then or your lul ol boy gonna come in theah an peel that soft putty hide right offen you he do it mammy you knows all about him doncha an you knows he will he gonna wait just five seconds and then hes gonna bus this heah ol doah down an i looked at my wristwatch began counting off the seconds aloud the bed creaked and i heard a muffled croak a dull weary sound that was part sigh part sob now thats better i said listen closely because this concerns you its my plan for finishing you off you and my dearly beloved father i am going to take you out to some deserted place and bind you with chains i shall so chain you that you will be apart from each other and yet together inseparable yet touching and you shall be stripped to your lustful hides and in winter i shall douse you with icewater and in summer i shall smother you with blankets and you shall shriek and shiver with the cold and you shall scream and scorch with the heat yet you shall be voiceless and unheard that will go on for seventeen years mother no ill be fair deduct a couple of years then ill bring you back here pile you into bed together and give you a sample of the hell that could never be hot enough for you set you on fire set the house on fire set the whole goddamned town on fire think of it mammy the whole population whole families infants children mothers and fathers grandparents and greatgrandparents all burning all stacked together in lewd juxtaposition and it shall come to pass mammy yeah verily for to each thing there is a season mammy and a time she was moaning peculiarly keening i suppose you would say i listened absently deciding that pete pavlov should be spared from my prospective holocaust no one else at least i could think of no one else at the moment but certainly pete pavlov it was early around eight oclock when i arrived at the dance pavilion the bandstand was dark the ticket booth where myra pavlov serves as cashier was closed only one of the ballroom chandeliers was burning there was however a light in petes office so i vaulted the turnstile and started across the dance floor he was at his desk counting a stack of bills i was almost to the doorway when he looked up startled his hand darting toward an open desk drawer then he saw it was i and he let out a disgusted grunt damn you bobbie better watch that sneakin up on people might get your tail shot off i laughed and apologized i said i hoped that if anyone ever did try to hold him up he wouldnt try to stop them you do huh he said how come you hope that why why because i frowned innocently you have robbery insurance havent you well why risk your life for some insurance company i suspect from the brief flicker in his eyes the very slight change in facial expression that he had entertained some such notion himself that is i should say a fake robbery to collect on his insurance he needed money popular opinion notwithstanding a robbery would be the simplest most straightforward means of getting it and he was a simple straightforward man i would have been glad to help him perpetrate such a robbery broadly speaking i would have done anything i could to help him unfortunately however although i respected him for it he distrusted me instinctively so he treated me to a long unblinking gaze then he grunted spat in the spittoon and leaned back in his chair he rocked back and forth in it hands locked behind his head looking down at the desk and then slowly raising his eyes to mine i tell you he said used to be a hound dog around these parts fastfootedest goddammed dog you ever saw in your life you know what happened to him i imagine he ran over himself i said yup bashed his brains out with his own butt hell of a nicelooking dog too and he seemed smart as turpentine always wondered why he didnt know bettern to do a thing like that i smiled pete would not have wondered at all about the why of his allegorical dog nor the why of anything like myself petes concern was with what things were not how or why they had become that way he finished counting the money he put it in a tin cash box locked it up in his safe and came back to the desk sat down on a corner of it in front of me one thick leg swung over the other well his hard hazelcolored eyes rolled over on my face figure on sleepin in here tonight want me to move you in a bed im sorry i got up reluctantly i was just uh yeah something on your mind nno no i guess not i said i just dropped by to say hello i didnt have anything to do for a while so i he looked at me steadily he spat at the spittoon without shifting his eyes i cleared my throat feeling a hot embarrassing flush spread over my face he stood up suddenly and started for the door spoke over his shoulder his voice gruff aint got nothing to do myself for a few minutes come on and ill buy you a sody i followed him to a far corner of the ballroom followed since he kept a halfpace in front of me i wanted to pay for the drinks but he brushed my hand aside dropped two dimes into the coke machine himself he handed me a bottle i thanked him and he grunted jerking the cap on his own we stood facing the distant bandstand where the musicians were arriving we stood side by side almost touching each other separated by no more than a few inches and silence he finished his drink smacked his lips and dropped the bottle into the empty case i finished mine reluctantly disposed of the bottle as he had well he spoke as i straightened from the case spoke still looking out across the ballroom you and myra steppin out again tonight i said why yes we were as soon as she got off work that is and after a moment i added if thats all right with you mr pavlov know any reason why it shouldnt be why well no i said i guess not i mean ill tell you he said he hesitated and belched i aint got a goddamned bit of use for you never have had far back as i can remember but i guess you already know that yes i said and i cant tell you how sorry i am mr pavlov cant say im not sorry myself always rather like someone than dislike em he belched again mumbling something about the gas on the other hand i got no real reason not to have no use for you nothing i can put my finger on youve always been friendly and polite around me i dont know of no dirty deals youve pulled unlessn its this stuff with ralph and i cant really call that dirty considering mightve gone off sideways like that myself when i was your age i knew youd understand i said mr pavlov i i was sayin he cut me off curtly i got no reason to feel like i do and reasons are all i go by people dont give me no trouble i dont give them any i rock along with em as long as they rock with me and whether i like em or not dont figure in the matter all right i guess we understand each other now i got to get busy he nodded curtly and headed back toward his office i moved toward the exit myra had come in while pete and i were talking and she called to me from the ticket booth i looked her way blindly my eyes stinging misting not really hearing or seeing her i went out without answering her and sat down in my car i got a cigarette lighted i took a few deep puffs forcing away my disgusting selfpity recovering some of my normal objectiveness pete detested me it was fitting that he should things being as they were and i would not have had it any other way things being as they were but what a pity what a goddamned pity that they were that way and why couldnt they have been another the right and logical way why couldnt my own dear father and mother those encephalitic cretans those gutless jukesters those lubricious lusus naturae why couldnt they have had myra inflicted upon them why should pete have to suffer such a drab spiritless wretch as she why couldnt they have had her and why couldnt he have had myra a feeling of fury came over me every time i looked at her id had some plans for her vague but decidedly unpleasant long before she came to the office that day a couple of months ago father was away on some calls i glanced at the notes on her file card this was her second trip she was having menstrual difficulties something that a good kick in the stomach or a dose of salts would have jarred her out of but father that wise and philanthropic aesculapian had set her up for a series of hormone shots she said she was in a hurry so i prepared to administer the medication yes i do that take care of routine patients rather i did do it until father became wary i know a hell a lot more about medicine than he does a hell of a lot more about everything than he does in this case for example i knew that what myra needed deserved was not hormone i gave her a hypodermic she flashed to use the slang expression barely made it to the sink before she started vomiting i told her it was perfectly all right and gave her another shot well someone like that someone with only part of a character is made for the stuff the stuff is made for them she was hooked in less than a week she doesnt go to father any more but she does come to me i treat her now i give her what she needs and deserves when i am ready to and after certain ceremonies tenthirty came not more than five minutes later which was as fast as she could make it she was running toward the car begging before she had the door open i told her to shut up i said that if she said one more word until i gave her permission she would get nothing i had her well trained she subsided mouth twisting gulping down the whimpers that rose in her throat i drove to a place about six miles up the beach happy hollow it is called for reasons which you may guess i suppose there is some such place in every community dubbed with the same sly euphemism or a similar one it this place was not a hollow not wholly at least most of its area was hill wooded and brushy marked with innumerable trails and sidetrails which terminated in tiremarked beachlike patches of sand i stopped at one of these patches the only tiremarks were those of my own car i made her take her clothes off i grabbed her i shook her and slapped her and pinched her i called her every name i could think of she didnt speak or cry out but suddenly i stopped short and gave her the shot i was tired there seemed no point in going on action and words words and action leading to nothing arriving nowhere it wasnt enough there can be no real satisfaction without an objective myra lay back in the seat breathing in long deep breaths eyes half shut she didnt have a bad shape in fact without clothes on she simply couldnt wear clothes she shaped up quite beautifully but only aesthetically as far as i was concerned i felt no desire for her i wanted to my mind shrieked that i should but the flesh could not hear it she dozed i may have dozed myself or perhaps i merely became lost in thought at any rate i snapped back to awareness suddenly aroused by the dull lacing of light through the trees the throb of a familiar motor myra sat up abruptly stared at me eyes wide with fright i told her to sit still and be quiet just do what i told her to and shed be all right i listened to the motor following the progress of the car it stopped with a final purring throbthrob and i knew exactly where it had stopped i hesitated i opened the door of the car bbobbie a frightened whisper from myra where you going im afraid to stay i told her to shut up id only be gone for a few minutes bbut why whatre you going to nothing i dont know i mean hell just shut up i said i went down the trail a few yards i branched off into another and then another i came to the end of it near the end of it and hunkered down in the shadows of the trees they werent more than twenty feet away ralph devore and that whatshername the girl with the orchestra i could see them clearly in the filtered moonlight i could hear every word they said every sound and the way it looked and sounded i could hardly believe it particularly of a guy like ralph because when ralph stepped out with em it was for just one thing and he lost no time about getting it yet now with this girl and no she certainly didnt hate him she obviously felt the same way about him that he did her and that way i didnt know what it was for a moment then when i finally knew remembered realized i refused to admit it i grinned to myself silently jeering them jeering myself ralph was really making time i thought here it was only the sixth week of the season hed only known this babe six weeks and they were cutting up like a couple of newlyweds newlyweds sans the sex angle which of course theyd soon be getting around to maybe i thought i ought to do the silly jerk a favor go up to his house some night and bump off luane it could be made to look like an accident and believe me it would need to look damned little like one to leave ralph in the clear father was the coroner the county medical officer as for the county attorney henry clay williams i shook my head choking back a laugh you had to hand it to that goddamned luane she had a positively fiendish talent for tossing the knife for plunging it into exactly the right spot to send the crap flying henry clay williams was a bachelor henry clay williams lived with his maiden sister and henry clay williams sister had an abdominal tumor which created a bulge normally created by a different kind of growth at any rate and unless the job was done in front of witnesses it would be ridiculously easy to get away with killing luane just make it look like an accident enough like one to give brother williams an out and i leaned forward straining to hear them ralph and the girl for they were clinging even closer to each other than they had been and their voices were consequently muffled dont you worry one bit honey her i dont know how but but gosh theres got to be some way i just love you so much and youre so wonderful and not wonderful nough for you him old loveemandscram ralph for gods sake why he sounded practically articulate aint it funny sweetheart here i am an old man you are not youre the sweetest darlingest kindest handsomest anyways i mean i lived all these years and i reckon i never knew there was such a thing like love i mean i guess i i found that i was smiling i scrubbed it away with my fist scrubbed my eyes with my fist but it kept coming back that word the one hed spoken the one id been ducking it kept coming back and i knew that there was no other word for what this was he wasnt going to pitch it to her she wasnt going to hit him up for dough they were in love ah simply simply in love only only in love and ah the sweetness of it the almost unbearable beauty and wonderment of it to be loved like that more important to love like that i smiled upon them at them smiled like a loving god happy in their happiness probably i thought i should kill them now it would be such a wonderful way time to die i glanced around absently i ran a hand back under the bushes searching for a suitable club or rock i could find none nothing that would do the job with the instantaneousness necessary nothing that was sufficiently sturdy or heavy i did locate a pointed daggerlike stick and i considered it for a moment but a very little mental calculation established that it would never do it wasnt long enough it would never pass through that barrelchest of ralphs and go on into her bosom and if i did not get them both at the same time if i left one to live without the other i almost wept at the thought a strange warmth spread over me spread down from my head and up from my feet it increased intensified and i did not know what it was how could i never having experienced it before and then at last i knew and i knew what had brought it about i straightened up i backed down the trail quietly and then i turned and strode toward my car excitedly my mind racing there could be nothing now of course dope inhibits the sexual impulses so she would have to be tapered off first but that should be relatively easy she should unhook almost as easily as she had been hooked if i could just get the stuff to work with and i would get it by god id kill that stupid sonofabitch my father if he gave me any trouble i cut off the thought somehow the thought of parricide entirely justifiable though it was interfered with the other i would get what i needed in some way that was all that mattered and meanwhile i could be preparing her laying the necessary groundwork and meanwhile i knew i knew i reached the car i climbed in smiling she had her coat draped over her but she was still undressed i told her lovingly to get dressed lovingly with tender pats and caresses i started to help her ddont she shivered what ddo you want nothing i said only what you want darling whatever you want thats what i want she stared at me like a snakecharmed bird her teeth chattered i took her in my arms gently pressed my mouth against hers i smiled softly dreamily stroking her hair thats all i want honey i said now you tell me what you want i wwant to go home pplease bobbie just look i said i love you id do anything in the world for you i i kissed her i crushed her body against mine and her lips were stiff and lifeless and her body was like ice and the glow was leaving me the life and the resurrection were leaving me ddont i said i mean please i only want to love you only to love you and have you love me thats all only sweetness and tenderness and suddenly i dug my fingers into her arms i shook her until her silly stupid head almost flopped off i told her shed better do what i said or id kill her ill do it by god i slapped her in the face ill beat your goddamned head off you be nice to me you moronic bitch be sweet you slut yyou be gentle and tender and loving you love me damn you you love me or ill ill dr james ashton it may ring false when i say so but i did love her back in the beginning and for several years afterward it became impossible later on will it as i would and despite anything i could do for we could share nothing but a bed and that less and less frequently we could not share the most important thing we had it was impossible you see that do you not so the love went away but once long ago she was twentytwo or three when she came to me she was practically illiterate a shabby lifebeaten slumdweller there was a great deal of race prejudice in that state there is still unfortunately so much everywhere and negroes got little if any schooling they had no place to live but slums i hired her as my housekeeper i paid her twice the pittance the prevailing and starvation wage for negro houseworkers i gave her decent quarters a clean attic room with a lavatory there in my own house she was thin undernourished i saw to it that she got plenty of good wholesome food she needed medical attention i gave it to her taking time from paying patients to do so i shall never forget the day i examined her i had suspected the beauty of her body even in the shabby illfitting clothes i had first seen her in but the revelation of it was almost more than the eyes could bear of all the nude women i had seen professionally of course i had seen none to compare with her she was like a statue sculpted of ivory by one of the great masters even frail and halfstarved she but i digress she was very grateful for all i had done for her overflowing with gratitude her eyes followed me wherever i went and in them there was that burning worship you see in a dogs eyes i think that if i had ordered her to take poison she would have done so instantly i did not want her to feel that way at least i made it very clear to her that she owed me nothing i had done no more than was decent i explained no more than one decent person should do for another circumstances permitting all i wanted of her i said was that she be happy and well as such a fine young woman should be she would not have it so i wanted was more than willing to at any rate but not she there was an immutable quality about her gratitude wherever i was there was it quietly omnipotent passively resistant a constant proffering impossible to dispose of beyond at least my powers i did not wish to hurt her feelings i could see no real harm in accepting what she was so anxious to give it was all she had to give and the gift of ones all is not lightly rejected finally around the middle of her second month of service with me i accepted it there was no love in it that first time none on my side that is it was merely a matter of saving her pride and of course to a degree at least physical gratification but after that very quickly after that the love came and it was only natural i suppose that it should i came from a very poor family migrant sharecroppers my parents had twelve children three stillborn five who died in early childhood the largest house we ever lived in was two rooms i was six or seven years old before i tasted cows milk or knew that there was such a thing as red meat i was almost a grown man before i owned a complete set of clothes if it had not been for a plantation overseers taking an interest in me if he had not induced my father to let me remain with his family when my own moved on i should probably have wound up like the rest of the brood like my living brothers and sisters if they are living hoehands cottonpickers white trash or no i do myself an injustice i could never have been like them i would have found some way to push myself up overseer or no through grade school high school college and medical school in all that time i cannot remember having a complete day of rest i worked my way every step of the way i did nothing but work and study i had no time for recreation for girls when i did have the time when i was at last practicing and reasonably free from financial worry i had no well knack with them i was ill at ease around girls i was incapable of the flipperydippery and chitchat which they seemed to expect i learned that one young lady i liked and who i thought reciprocated my feeling had referred to me as a terrible stick so there you have it hattie loved me a woman more beautiful than any i had ever seen loved me and i could be with her in the most intimate way talk to her of the most intimate things and feel not a whit of awkwardness i fell in love with her deeply it was inevitable that i should i was of course quite alarmed when i learned that she was pregnant alarmed and not a little angry for she had failed to take the precautions i had prescribed and entrusted her to take as i saw it there was nothing for it but an abortion even though she was three months along but much to my chagrin for she had always done as i wanted before hattie refused she was virtually tigerish in her refusal threatening me with what she would do if i attempted to take the foetus from her then as i became firm considerably shocked by her conduct she turned to pleading and i could not help feeling touched nor the feeling that i had been taken sore advantage of the boy would be able to pass after perhaps two hundred years of outracebreeding after eight generations there would be a child of her blood who could pass for white couldn i understand didn i see why she jus had to have it i relented i could have insisted on the abortion and she would have had to submit but i did not insist except for me the child would not have been born when the pregnancy began to show i moved her out of the house from that day on until she gave birth i called on her at least twice a week i could not go through such an experience now there were times even then when i thought i could stand no more a white man a white doctor visiting in the negro slums treating a negro woman it was unheard of unprecedented a soulshaking pridetrampling experience white doctors did not treat negroes generally speaking no one did they simply did without medical attention administering to themselves when it was necessary with home remedies and patent nostrums delivering their own babies or depending on midwives all in all they seemed to get by fairly well in that manner although negro vital statistics being what they are or were one cannot be sure and in the good health she was enjoying i think that hattie could have gotten by quite well without me but it apparently didnt occur to her to suggest it she didnt suggest it anyway and i hardly felt able to for that matter i dont know that i would have been willing to leave her untended in fact and on reflection i am quite sure that i would not i was deeply in love with her deeply concerned for her and our child otherwise i would not have done what i did when the birth became imminent negroes were not treated by white doctors as i have said this meant that they were not admitted to white hospitals and there were nothing but white hospitals there was a ramshackle poorly staffed county institution which admitted negroes but not unless it was absolutely impelled to if a negro was dying he might get in if he did he would probably never live to regret it well i was on the staff of one of the white hospitals i had only recently obtained the appointment i got hattie admitted to it as a white woman of spanishindian descent i did that knowing almost certainly that the fraud would be discovered i loved her that much thought that much of her and needless to say the child they were giving her narroweyed looks from the moment she stepped through the door they suspected her from the beginning me and her i could see that they did see it and feel it then when she was coming out of the anaesthesia when she began to talk i shall never forget how they looked at me or what the chief of staff said to me i was forced to remove her and the child the following day i did not put itto an issue how could i but if i had refused to remove them i believe they would have been thrown out that was the end of my staff job of course the end of my practice of everything in that state probably i can consider myself lucky that i wasnt lynched it was several days before i could nerve myself even to leave the house there was only one thing to do relocate move to some place so remote and far away that no word of my secret would ever reach to it some place yes now that the die was cast where hattie could be accepted as my wife down here where we were they were always on the lookout for colored blood expert at detecting it but in a new location the kind i had in mind and with a little intensive coaching for hattie as to her speech and mannerisms well my plan seemed entirely feasible i believe it would have been too if circumstances had not turned out as they did i saw a practice advertised here at manduwoc i left hattie and the boy behind and came here to look at it it seemed to fit my needs to a t in remoteness in distance from that other state it was not too big a thing financially the town being as small as it was but there was a large farmtrade area to draw from and i was confident that a livewire could double or even triple the present practice i decided to buy it i went to henry clay williams to have the papers drawn up hank i should say was not then the county attorney he was in fact only a few years out of law school but he was a very shrewd man very knowing and he took an immediate liking to me he looked upon me as a friend as i did him he was determined that i should get off on the right foot and he knew how to go about it i owe a lot to hank more than any man i know of he was very adroit with his advice he came out with it in a rather backhanded way hed lead with a feeler as to my notion on things then on the next time around hed move in with something a little stronger i mustnt think he was nosy he said far be it from him to give a whoop what a mans politics or his religion or his race was but there were still a hell of a lot of hidebound mossbacks around people with foolish prejudices shameful prejudices in his opinion although of course they had the same right to their ideas that he had to his and the center of population for those people by god hank gets pretty salty at times seemed to be right here in manduwoc i laughed i said it was certainly unfortunate that people had to be that way but whats a man going to do jim he said a mans got a living to make and wants to get somewhere what can he do about em i guess theres nothing much he can do i said its a problem of education evolution something that only time can take care of i dont see how he can go around with a chip on his shoulder do you jim he said why look now some of my very best friends are well lets say people that arent exactly popular around here my very best friends jim but a man cant live off his friends can he that wouldnt be fair to them would it he has to live with the community as a whole doesnt he thats the way it is i said its too bad but its outrageous he said absolutely outrageous jim why my blood actually boils sometimes at some of the carryingson in this town i dont mean that theyre not good people understand the salt of the earth in many respects theyre just narrowminded and they dont want to broaden and if you try to buck em give em the slightest reason to get their claws into you hell they dont actually need a real reason if you know what i mean why theyll rip you apart ive seen it happen jim theres a man here in town now a bohunk contractor name of pete pavlov he i see i said i understand what you mean hank and you think ive got the right slant jim you agree with me oh absolutely i said theres no question about it now there is one thing in view of what youve told me as ive mentioned my wife died recently and a great loss im sure my deepest sympathies to you jim and i have our infant son to take care of i said or i should say i have a ne nigger woman taking care of him a wet nurse i suppose i could get another one for him but oh well hank shrugged shes a southern nigger isnt she knows her place well thatll be all right after all no one could expect you to take a baby away from its nurse well i certainly wouldnt want to i said and you dont have to as long as she stays in her place and i guess youll see to that wont you haha shell get along fine i dont see how i could have done anything else i certainly had no easy row to hoe myself it is only in recent years that i have been able to take things a little easy before that it was work work work until all hours of the day and night fighting to hold onto the old practice to build it into something really worthwhile fighting to be someone to build something for nothing i had no time for them the boy and her no time at least on many days perhaps to be entirely truthful i did not want time for them and if i did not i hardly see how i can be faulted for it it was awkward being with her even in intimacy she made me feel uncomfortable guilty hypocritical i had become something here and i was rapidly becoming more i was a big frog in a little puddle a deacon in the church a director of the bank a pillar in the community yet here i was sleeping with a negro wench i would have stopped it even if it had not become dangerous my conscience would not have allowed me to continue as for the boy i did and do i am afraid love him as i did her so long ago he was my own flesh and blood my only son and i loved him as i loved her but like her although in a different way he made me uncomfortable it distressed me to be around him i cannot say why exactly but i am confident of one thing it was not a matter of resentment i did not blame him an innocent child for my own tragic and irremediable error if i could lay the whole truth before him i might be able to make him understand but naturally i cannot do that it is impossible for him to be absolutely sure of the truth he may guess and suspect and think but he cannot know he can only know if i admit it so of course i never will probably he wouldnt understand anyway he wouldnt allow himself to he is too selfish too filled with selfpity yes despite his arrogant manner if he understood he could not play the martyr he would have no justification for his vileness and viciousness assuming that is that it could be justified for certainly whatever i may or may not have done such conduct could never be justified i dont know how such a a creature could be my son i dont know what to do about him i have no control over him whatsoever i cant and he knows i cant appeal to the authorities for help and no it isnt because of the scandalous fiendish lies he would tell i can be hurt by scandal of course in fact i have been hurt but not greatly i am too thoroughly entrenched here everyone knows too well where dr james ashton stands and what he stands for i have not taken the stringent measures because i love him i cant cause him hurt regardless of how much he deserves it also as you may have surmised i am afraid of him it is a hideous thing to live in terror of ones own son but i do i try to keep it concealed to carry on to maintain some semblance of fatherandson relationship but it is becoming increasingly difficult i am terrified of him more and more every day and he is very well aware of the fact i have the frightful feeling at times that he can read my mind at times i am almost sure that he can he seems to know what i am going to do even before i know it myself nonsensical as it sounds he does know so i have not taken the steps which i doubtless should have i have avoided seriously contemplating such steps he would kill me before i could carry them out he is capable of it he has threatened to to kill both hattie and me to be fair to him if that is the right word he has made no such threats recently there were occasions recently when i was hopeful that he might be coming to his senses but about three weeks ago i thought i saw signs that he was losing interest in that degrading yard work he was leaving later in the mornings returning earlier at night he apparently felt i thought that he had cheapened me all he could by doing such work and was now on the point of dropping it i asked him to do so not on my account i said i know its useless to appeal to you on those grounds just do it for yourself just think of what it looks like for a boy of your background and intelligence to im considering it he said i may possibly do it if you dont urge me to it well thats fine i said for god pity me there was some comfort a relative lot in even such an insolent heartless reply as that you dont have to do that kind of work or any work ill be delighted to give you any money that you need dont be offensive he said dont bother me he said it quite mildly i felt considerably encouraged then i came home the following night to find every drawer every cabinet in my office had been opened and rummaged through no he hadnt broken them open he had simply picked all the locks now he was seated in my chair his feet up on my desk absently smoking a cigarette i was so angry that for a moment i forgot my terror i told him that he had better explain himself and promptly or he would have serious cause to regret it where is the stuff he said in your safetydeposit box its where youll never what stuff i said ive warned you bobbie you i had an idea it was he nodded well it looks like ill just have to buy some he got up and started to leave i grabbed him and whirled him around you rotten filthy scum i said ill tell you what youll do and what will happen to you if you dont youll let go of me he said ill let go of you ill drag you straight down to the courthouse ill i let go of him suddenly the fiendish sadistic whelp had crushed his cigarette into my wrist dont ever do anything like that again he said calmly do you understand me father bobbie son i said for gods sake what do you want what are you trying to do that that girl dont interfere with me he said he drove into the city the next day he has made one other trip in since then for what purpose i neednt explain how he manages it i dont know how a seventeenyearold boy in a strange city can promptly locate a narcotics peddler and make a purchase i dont know perhaps he doesnt buy it god and i know im being ridiculous he may make it i have an insane notion that he could if he wanted to anything that is mean and vicious rotten cruel filthy senseless he is still doing the yard work of course degrading himself playing the flunkey to buy dope for her if i could discover his motive i might be able to do something but what possible motive could he have the girl is completely undesirable as intelligent and handsome as he is he could have his way with virtually any girl in town without the deadly risk he is running for it is a deadly one it would be so even without the complication of narcotics pete has only to find them together in a certain way and that will be the end pete will kill him pete might even kill me i have almost driven myself crazy wondering what to do but i can think of nothing i can only wait go on as i always have and wait watch helplessly while doom approaches and luane is responsible bobbie was always somewhat peculiar withdrawn but except for that sluttish old hypochondriac it would never have happened i broke with her last week i may have to tolerate him but i do not have to put up with her i told her there was nothing at all wrong with her that i would not under any circumstances visit her again that if she wanted a doctor she would have to call another then i walked out leaving her to whine and complain to her own filthy self i should have done that long ago i forebore only because it might seem that i was bothered by her slander and thus lend weight to it bobbie seemed pleased when i mentioned the matter casually at the dinner table that was very wise of you he said id expected you to do it sooner well i said as a matter of fact i had been con but no i can see that this way is bettei he said it eliminates you pretty conclusively from the potential list of suspects now if youd cut her off sooner let it be known that you were no longer going near her place before you established that you held no grudge against her stop it i said what are you talking about anyway i refuse to listen to any more such nonsense why of course he winked at me grinning it isnt very discreet is it and we dont need to talk do we dear father i have been wondering lately if he is really my son wondering idly wishfully perhaps but still speculating on the matter after all if she would hop into bed with me so quickly why not with another how do i know what she was doing during the hours when i was away from the house obviously she was of not much account a woman who would behave as shamelessly as she did tempting me until i could withstand it no longer playing upon my kindness and sense of honor well never mind he is my son i know it and i would be the last man in the world to attempt to evade my responsibilities but that changes nothing as far as she is concerned she had better not complain to me any more about bobbies abuse not one word or i personally will give her something to complain about i would send her packing if i dared to which regrettably i dont it would look bad as though the scandal had hit home it would look like i was afraid on the run so things stand to this sorry unbearable state i have come chained to a negro woman and i am not responsible to her inflicted with a son who who well at least he isnt a negro not really if a negro was only onesixteenth white would you call him a white man well its the same proposition its its unbearable maddening completely unjust i dont know what i would do without the comfort of hank williams friendship i spend much of my free time with him and he spends much of his with me we understand each other he admires and respects me he is glad that i have gotten ahead even though his own success has been somewhat modest true he seems unaware that he hasnt gotten on he seems to have forgotten that he ever talked of being senator or governor but no matter he is my friend and he has proved it in many ways if he wishes to be a little smug boastful i can bear with it easily never in any way do i let on that his success wears a striking resemblance to failure we were talking the other night about our early days here and he as he is wont to do passed some remark as to his progress since then i said that his was a career to be proud of that very few lawyers had risen so high in so brief a time he beamed and smirked and then with that earnest warmth which only he is capable of he said that he owed his success to me well i said ive certainly boosted you whenever i could but im afraid i remember our first talk together the day i was drawing up those papers for you why yes i said of course i remember you set me straight here saw that sure uhhah you sly old rascal you he threw back his head and laughed i set you straight a country bumpkin a small town lawyer set a big city doctor straight he told him how to get on in the world i didnt say anything i was too bewildered for i had told him nothing that day nothing until i had pretty well ascertained his own feelings oh i understood you all right he laughed naturally you couldnt come straight out with it you had to spar around a little make sure of how i felt first but he winked at me grinning i stared at him feeling my hands tighten on the arms of my chair then as the murderous hatred drained out of me feeling them slowly relax and grow limp he had done me no injury his intelligence his moral stamina that vaguely concrete thing called character all had been stunted at the outset perhaps they would have amounted to little regardless perhaps environment and heredity would have dwarfed them without the withering assistance of our longago initial conversation at any rate he had not harmed me he had not changed me one whit from what i essentially was others doubtless many others but not me if anything it was the other way around he was frowning slightly looking a little uncomfortable and puzzled he repeated his phrase about my having had to spar around with him until i was sure of how he felt and how did you feel hank i said basically deep down in your heart oh well he shrugged you dont need to ask that jim you know how i stand on those things but back then i insisted right back in the beginning tell me hank i really want to know weel he hesitated and spread his hands you know jim about like most people i guess a lot of people anyway kind of on the fence and wishing i could stay there but knowing i had to jump one way or the other and knowing i was pretty well stuck on the side i jumped to i well you know what i mean jim its kind of hard to put into words i see i said i hoped i mean i thought that was probably the way you felt well he said and after a moment again well he studied me a trifle nervously then unable to read my expression he gave out with that bluffly amiable givemeapproval laugh of his it was a hearty laugh but one that he was ready to immediately modulate his face was flushed with high good humor a mask of goodfellowish hilarity which could at the wink of an eye with practiced effortlessness become the essence of gravity sobriety seriousness i laughed along with him with him and at myself our laughter filled the room flowed out through the windows into the night echoing and reechoing sending endless ripples on and on through the darkness it remained with us the laughter and it departed from us floating out across the town across hill and dale across field and stream across mountain and prairie across the nightlost farm houses the hamlets and villages and towns the bustling towertwinkling cities across around the world and back again we laughed and the whole world laughed or should i say jeered suddenly i got up and went to the window stood there unseeing though my eyes were wider than they had ever been my back turned to him and where there had been uproar there was now silence almost absolute silence he could not stand that of course after almost twenty years it dawned on me that he could not whenever there is silence he must fill it with something with anything so after he had regained his guffawdrained breath after he had achieved a selfsatisfactory evaluation of my mood he spoke again went back to the subject of our conversation well anyway jim as i was saying im eternally grateful to you i hate to think what might have happened if we hadnt had that talk i winced unable to answer him for a moment immediately his voice tightened notched upward with anxiety jim jim dont you look at it that way too jim dont you kind of hate to think oh yes i found my voice yes indeed hank on the other hand yeah what were you going to say jim nothing i said just that i doubt that it would have changed anything not with men like us marmaduke goofy gannder when i awakened it was morning and i was lying on the green pavement of the city of wonderful people and a hideous hangover held me in its thrall i sat up by degrees shaking and shuddering i massaged my eyes wondering yea even marveling over the complete nonwonderment of the situation for lo i invariably have a hangover in the morning even as it is invariably morning when i awaken and likewise to complete the sequence of nonmarvelousness i invariably awaken in the city of wonderful people hell i thought the same today yesterday and ouch i said the last aloud adding a prayerful expletive for the sunlight had stabbed into my eyes speared fierily into my head like a crown of thorns in my agony i rocked back and forth for a moment and then i staggered to my feet and stumbled over to grandmas bed it was not a very nice bed compared to those of the citys other inhabitants untended except for my inept ministrations it was protected only by an oblong border of wine bottles which seemed constantly to be getting broken and it was sunken in uncomfortably and the grass was withered and brown yeah generously fertilized as it obviously was by untold numbers of dogs cats and rodents the headboard of the bedstead was of weathered wormeaten wood a dwarfed phalluslike object bearing only her name and the word spinster painfully or perhaps painlessly free of eulogy i studied the bleak inscription thinking as i often do when not occupied with other matters that i should do something about it i had considered substituting the words human being with possibly a suffixed believe it or not but grandma had not liked that she had considered it no compliment and she had made no bones no pun intended about letting me know it i sat facing her bed my head bowed against the sun staring down into the sunken hummock the grass rustled restlessly whispering in the wind and after a time there was a dry snorting chuckle well grandma said penny for your thoughts now that i forced a smile now that is the sort of thing that brings on inflation grandma snickered she asked me how i was getting along with my book i said fine that in fact i had finished it well lets hear some of it grandma said start right with the beginning certainly grandma i said certainly once upon a time there were two billion and a half bastards who lived in a jungle which weighed approximately six sextillion four hundred and fifty quintillion short tons though they were all brothers these bastards their sole occupation was fratricide though the jungle abounded in wondrous fruits their sole food was dirt though their potential for knowledge was unlimited they knew but one thing and what they knew was only what they did not know and what they did not know was what was enough i stopped speaking grandma stirred impatiently well go on thats all there is i said but i thought you said youd finished thats no more than you had before its all there is i repeated as i see it there is nothing more to say we were silent for a time without talk to divert me my hangover began to return crept slowly up through my body and over my head shaking me sickening me gnawing at me inside and out like some hateful and invisible reptile grandma snickered sympathetically pretty sick arent you a little i said something i took internally seems to have disagreed with me or i should say in all fairness i disagreed with it it was entirely friendly and tractable until i removed it from the bottle you know what to do about it grandma said you know what youve got to do i dont know whether i can make it i said rather i have a strong suspicion that i cant make it youve got to grandma said so stop wasting good breath stop talking and start moving i groaned piteously making futile motions of arising the flesh was willing but also weak and as for spirit i had none whatsoever verily grandma i moaned verily verily i would swap my soul to satan for one good drink cheapskate said grandma now cut out the gab and get on your way i nodded miserably somehow i managed to get to my feet i shall do as you say grandma i said grandma made no reply presumably she had returned to her wellearned sleep i turned and tried to tiptoe away from her i lost my balance and fell flat on my face and minutes passed before i could pick myself up again finally after several similar fallings and pickingsup i reached the road to town a truck was coming from the opposite direction it looked like joe hendersons and it was i swung an arm limply thumb upraised in the gesture as old as hitchhiking joe slowed down and came to a stop then as i reached for the door he jabbed one finger into the air and roared away i walked on more strengthened more firm in my purpose than otherwise i wondered what loss joe could suffer that could not be recouped by insurance and i decided that the tires of his truck would be a very good bet another farm truck drove up behind me dutch eatons dutch stopped and leaned out asked me solicitously if i was tired of walking yes i said but please spare me the suggestion that i run a while it was not very amusing even when i first heard it back during my cradle days his fat face reddened with anger he sputtered why you crazy lowdown listen i said listen listen mr eaton what is it that is gutless brainless and moves around on wheels a swine mr eaton a pig in overalls he had been easing the door open now he sprang out with a furious roar and whirling i also sprang i am almost always equal to such emergencies weak though i may have been a moment before the strength and the agility to save myself invariably come to me and they did now so i leaped the ditch and vaulted easily over the fence i walked on up into the orchard in the rear of the devore estate listening to dutch curse me and finally drive away temporarily i was so absorbed in thought that i almost forgot my hangover in a sense i had reason to be grateful to dutch eaton and joe henderson yet i must confess that the emotion i felt for them was very far from gratitude joe and dutch i thought they had been on bad terms with one another for years what would be the result say if joes tires should be slashed on the same night that dutchs barn burned down lord world forgive me i murmured for their minds are even as those of a paleolithic foetus and i know all too damned well what i do i had passed through the orchard by now and arrived at the barnyard moving boldly but quietly i went through the gate crossed the barnyard and backyard and entered the back door of the house no there was no danger i knew that having visited the place several times before ralph would be away luane would be in bed and her bedroom was on the front as long as i was quiet and no one can be more quiet than i i could prowl the downstairs at will i stopped inside the door a moment listening faintly from upstairs luanes voice drifted down to me as she talked over the telephone course i hate to say anything either far be it from me to say a word about anyone and you know it mabel but a thing like that a young girl lifting her skirts for a nigger and that father of hers always acting so high and mighty i hesitated feeling vaguely impelled to do something knowing that if anything could ever have been done it was too late now pete pavlov would soon hear the gossip as soon as he ascertained its truth he would act and there could be no doubt about how he would act what he would do i frowned shrugged and pushed the matter out of my mind mentally disconnecting the vicious whine of luanes voice i could not help the inevitable on the other hand i hoped i could help myself to a drink and my need for one was growing i opened the cupboard a familiar section of it i studied the several bottles of flavoring extract my mouth watering and then miserably having noted the labels i turned away there was no end apparently to ralphs skimping since my last visit he had substituted cheap nonalcoholic extracts for the fine invigorating brands he had previously stocked i looked through the other cupboards i hesitated over a large bottle of floor polish then insufficiently intrigued by its five per cent alcoholic content i turned away again finally i lifted a trap door in the floor and went down into the cellar i had no luck there either ralphs cider was freshly made still sweet and he had done his canning as expertly as he did everything else out of all the endless jars of fruit and vegetables there was not a one that was beginning to ferment i went back up into the kitchen sweat pouring off of me my nerves screaming for the balm of drink i went through the connecting door to the front hall and stood at the foot of the stairs there would be plenty to drink up there rubbing alcohol female tonic liniment perhaps even something that was made to be drunk and if luane would only go to sleep if she would cease her poisonous spewing for only a few minutes but obviously she would not already she had another party on the wire and when she had finished with that one she would immediately ring up another and so on throughout the day she would never stop unless she was stopped as well she deserved to be aside from my crying need but i could not envision myself now in the role of stopper and being unable to i could not act as such another day perhaps some other day or night when thirst and hopelessness brought me here again i left the house i retraced my steps through the orchard and walked toward town turning eventually into the alley that ran behind doctor ashtons house doctor ashton would not be at home at this hour nor would he assist me if he was as for his son bobbie who doubtless was also away i had accepted his help but once and that once was more than enough i still shuddered when i recalled the experience what he gave me that angelfaced phlegmatic fiend i do not know but it practically removed my bowels and nausea shook me like a terriershaken rat for the ensuing three days i could look for nothing then from ashton or his son but the negro woman hattie would be at home she never went anywhere and doubtless out of superstition a kind of awe of the socalled insane she had given me drink several times in the past i knocked on the back door there was a sluffsluff of house slippers and then she was standing at the screen looking out at me dully go way she said before i could speak go way and stay way dont want no more truck with you i read the tone of her voice the reason behind her attitude at least i believe i did i told her she was completely mistaken if she believed i was bad luck listen listen miss hattie i said you see this caul in my left eye now im sure you know that a man with a caul in his eye i knows you an at eye bettah be moving she said you an it want to go on keepin company get now you heah me get along crazy man please i said please do not refer to me as crazy i have a document in my pocket signed by the states chief psychiatrist certifying to my sanity now surely and even though our mental hospitals are crowded to twice their capacity he wouldnt have declared me sane if okay she cut in flatly okay you stays right there an i gives you a drink awright she turned away from the screen i could not see what she was doing but i heard water gushing into what apparently was a large flat pan hastily i got off the steps and moved back into the yard listen listen i said you dont need to do that im leaving right now she came to the door again eyes sparkling in malicious triumph she said that i had better leave and stay left but you had better not i said listen listen miss hattie leave the house at no time particularly do not leave it at night great evil will befall you if you do a trace of fear tightened the contours of her offivory face huh what make you think i goin anywhere listen listen i said because it is so written that you may and that great and dreadful evil will result so it is written but listen listen if i had a drink a very large one i could doubtless change the writing i had been too eager she let out a grunt of relief and unbelief and returned to the kitchen i continued on my dreary drinkless way frequently or i should say occasionally i have had some success at the courthouse there are always a number of loafers around also needless to say and if you will excuse the redundancy the county officeholders so i went there today hoping to amuse them as i sometimes had in the past to titillate and entertain them with my wisdom and thus obtain a few coins alas however alas and verily and lo seldom have i been appreciated less than on this day the day when my need was greatest i was chased out of office after office i was brushed aside cursed out elbowed and shoved along by one loafer after another i had been unwilling to call on pete pavlov except as a last resort for a couple of reasons for one thing it was quite a long walk across town to the beach area an almost intolerable walk for one in my condition for another i had called upon him so often in the past that further appeals would not only be embarrassing but were apt to prove fruitless there was nothing else to do now however and when there is nothing else to do i do what there is nothing else to do shaking and wobbling i walked the several blocks through town entered the dance pavilion and crossed the wide waxed floor to the door of his office he was bent over an account ledger cursing and mumbling to himself now and then as he turned its pages i waited nervously my hands twitching and trembling even as the leaves of an aspen not many people will agree with me but mr pavlov is a very kindly softhearted man on the other hand and everyone will agree with me on this he is no fool and the merest hint intentional or no that he might be will send him into an icy rage he looked up at last took the tobacco cud from his mouth and dropped it into a convenient gaboon what the hell you want he said wiping his hand on his pants as if i didnt know listen listen mr pavlov i said humiliated and embarrassed though i am i find myself impelled to he yanked open a desk drawer took out a bottle and glass and poured me a drink i gulped it and extended the glass he returned it and the bottle to the drawer tell you what ill do with you he said ill no you listen listen for a change you go back there in the john and wash up and use some soap by god get me and ill stake you to a square meal i said certainly certainly yessir i could certainly use a good meal you can give me the price of the meal now mr pavlov that will save time and time is money and and the farmer hauled another load away said mr pavlov just keep on standing there arguing with me and you wont get nothing but a kick in the butt he meant it mr pavlov always means what he says i departed hastily for the washroom after all this was the best offer i had had all day the meal i mean not the kick and i had a notion that it might be improved upon i washed thoroughly my hands wrists and those portions of my face that were not covered by beard it was probably as clean as i have been during the thirty years of my existence i returned to the office where mr pavlov complimented me reservedly looks like you got a few coats of rust off why dont you chop that damned hair and them whiskers off too ought to by god or else buy yourself a bedsheet and sandals listen mr pavlov i said i will do whatever you say if you would like to give me the money for a barber or a bedsheet and sandals along with the price of a meal i will i aint giving you a nickel said mr pavlov ill take you to a restaurant and pay your check myself i protested that he was being unfair it was implicit in our agreement that i should spend the money on liquor he grunted studying me with thoughtfully narrowed eyes shut up a minute he said goddammit if i give you another drink will you shut up and let me think listen mr pavlov i said for another drink i would would i broke off helplessly what wouldnt one do when he is slowly being crucified i snatched the drink from his hand i took it at a gulp noting that he had left the bottle on the desk in front of him huhuh he said as i extended my glass not now anyways i got something to say to you and i want to be damned sure you understand listen i said i understand much better when im drinking the more i drink the more my understanding increases shut up there was a whiplike crack to his voice now heres what i was going to say and youd better not repeat it see dont ever peep a word about it to anyone suppose i was to give you something of mine kind of let you take it away from me i mean nobody would know that it was you that took it but goddammit are you listening to me certainly certainly yessir i said if you were thinking about pouring a drink for yourself mr pavlov i will take one too dammit this is important to you he said thered be a nice piece of change in it for you and all youd have to do is he broke off with a disgusted grunt hell i must be going out of my mind to even think about it you appear very depressed mr pavlov i said allow me to pour a drink for you pour one for yourself he snarled with unaccustomed naivete then youre gettin the hell out of here to a restaurant it was a quart bottle and it was practically full i picked it up and ran i hated to do it naturally it was not only ungrateful but also shortsighted in eating the golden egg figuratively speaking i was destroying a future hen i did it because i could not help myself because it was another nothingelsetodo when a man is drowning he snatches at bottles i ran making a wild leap toward the door and i tripped over the doorsill the bottle shot from my hands and it and i crashed resoundingly against the ballroom floor i scrambled forward on my stomach began to lap at one of the precious puddles of liquor mr pavlov suddenly kicked me in the tail sent me scooting across the polished boards he yanked me to my feet eyes raging and jerked me around facing him a fine sonofabitch you turned out to be now get to hell out of here get out fast and take plenty of time about showing up again certainly i said but listen listen mr pavlov i listen hell i said to clear out i will i am i said backing out of his reach but please listen mr pavlov i will be glad to assist you in a fake holdup more than glad you have been very good to me and i will welcome the opportunity to do something for you he had been moving toward me threateningly now he stopped dead in his tracks his face flushing eyes wavering away from mine what the hell you talkin about he said with attempted roughness you better not go talkin that way to anyone else you know i wont i said i dont blame you for distrusting me after the exhibition i just put on but he snorted halfheartedly he said youre crazy crazy and drunk you dont know what youre sayin yes sir i said and i dont know what you said i didnt hear you i wasnt listening i turned and left i went out onto the boardwalk wondering if this after all was not the original sin the one we all suffer for the failure to attribute to others the motives which we claim for ourselves the inexcusable failure to do so true i was not very prepossessing either in appearance or actions i was not but neither was he he was every bit as unreassuring in his way as i was in mine and as you are in yours we were both disguised the materials were different but they had all come from the same loom my eccentricity and drunkenness his roughness rudeness and outright brutality we had to be disguised both of us all of us yet obvious as the fact was he would not see it he would not look through my guise as i had looked through his to the man beneath he would not look through his own which would have done practically as well it was too bad and he would be punished for it as who is not and i was in need of more much much more to drink down at the end of the walk a girl was standing at the rail looking idly out to sea i squinted my eyes shaded them with my hand after a moment she turned her head a little and i recognized her as the vocalist with the band she was clad in bathing garb but a robe was draped over the rail at her side it seemed reasonable to assume that the robe would have a pocket in it and that the pocket would have something in it also i walked down to where she stood i harrumphed for her attention and executed a low bow toppling momentarily to one knee in the process listen listen i said how beautiful are thy feet with shoes o my princess thy i broke off abruptly noting that her feet were bare i glanced at her midriff and began anew thy navel is like you get away from me you nasty thing you she said go on now i dont give money to beggars but who else would you give money to i said not surely to people with money you leave me alone her voice rose ill scream if you dont very well i said and i moved back up the boardwalk oh verily very well but beware the night madam lo and a hohoho beware the night the warning seemed justified molded as she was the night could hold quite as much danger for her as it did delight ahead of me i saw mr pavlov come out of the pavilion and swagger away toward town studying him his highheld head the proud set of his shoulders the hurt i had felt over his caution in talking to me was suddenly no more he had behaved thusly i knew i knew because he actually did not intend to perpetrate a fake holdup he neither intended to nor would he might think the contrary go so far as to plan the deed but he would never actually go through with it he was as incapable of dishonesty of anything but absolute uprightness as i was of sobriety he turned and entered the postoffice building i crossed to the other side of the street continued on for another block and suddenly lurched and remained lurched against a corner lamppost people passed by grinning and laughing at me i closed my eyes and murmured alternate threats and pleadings to the lord world halfway down the block there was a grocery store mr kossmeyer the lawyer who comes here every summer was parked in front of it loading some groceries into the back seat of his car i pushed myself away from the lamppost and stepped down into the gutter i walked down to where mr kossmeyer was and tapped him on the shoulder he jumped cursed and banged his head then he turned around and saw that it was i oh hello ganny he said i mean uh judas oh thats all right mr kossmeyer i laughed i know im not really judas that was just a crazy notion i had well thats fine glad youve snapped out of it mr kossmeyer said im really noah i said thats who i really am mr kossmeyer i see he said well you shouldnt have to travel very far to round up your animals he sounded rather wary disinterested his hand moved toward the front door of his car listen mr kossmeyer i said listen im accepting contributions for an ark materials or their monetary equivalent planks are a dollar each mr kossmeyer they aint the only thing said mr kossmeyer so is a quart of wine he seemed a lot smarter than he used to be summer a year ago i sold him a reservation to the last supper listen mr kossmeyer listen i said all the worlds a stage and all the actors audience and the wise man casteth no stink bombs doesnt that stir you mr kossmeyer i said only to a limited degree said mr kossmeyer only to a limited degree noah i feel nothing at all in the area of my hip pocket listen mr kossmeyer listen i said theyve got a new resident out in the city of wonderful people theyve got a man thats truly humble hes truly humble but he always acted like the snootiest most stuckup man in town you know why he acted that way you know why mr kossmeyer because he was so lonesome for company the planks are really only ninetyeight cents mr kossmeyer and i can bring back the change from a dollar a little more finesse said mr kossmeyer a little more english on the cue ball listen i said listen mr kossmeyer im thinking about digging him up and putting him on television there ought to be millions in it dont you think so a truly humble man just think of it mr kossmeyer i think ill drive you down to the library said mr kossmeyer and lead you to the history section i could put falsies on him mr kossmeyer i said i could teach him to sing and dance i could listen mr kossmeyer listen listen theres a couple of other new residents out in the city of wonderful people theyre mother and father and theyre the most wonderful of all listen mr kossmeyer listen theyre dutiful and loving parents theyre godfearing and loyal theyre honest and kindly and steadfast and generous and merciful and tolerant and wise and what the hell they got for gods sake said mr kossmeyer a tombstone or a billboard listen mr kossmeyer i said listen its the teensiest stone you ever saw not much bigger than a cigarette package i figure that fellow who writes on the heads of pins must have done the inscription its practically impossible to read it mr kossmeyer virtually impossible theyve got all those virtues yet no one can see them you know why its that way you know why mr kossmeyer listen listen listen its supposed to be symbolic its symbolic mr kossmeyer and i just remembered you can get a pretty good grade of plank for listen noah listen listen said mr kossmeyer which is the shortest way to that buildingsupply store hattie i guess i just dont think no more not no real thinking only little old keyhole kind reckon you know what i mean reckon you know what it does to a body may be a mighty big room but you sure aint going to see much of it and you keep looking through that keyhole long enough nothing aint never going to look big to you get to where that eye of yours just wont spread out used to think pretty tolerable way back when long long time ago back when mr doctor was talking to me and teaching me and telling me stuff seemed like i was just thinking all the time and thinking more all the time big thinking almost could fee my brain getting bigger then we comes here and that was the end of that and the beginning of the other mr doctor stopped stopped himself from pushing me on and stopped me from pushing just wouldnt do he said got to be in a certain place so i got to fit in that place dont do nothing that would maybe look like i dont belong in that place just sink down in it and dont never raise my head above it too bad and he sure hates it mr doctor said but thats the way its got to be and what goods it going to do me he said filling my head full of a lot of stuff i wasnt never going to use guess he right all right anyways he stop with me me i didnt put up no fuss about it catch me arguing with mr doctor never did it but the once long long time ago and maybe that used all my arguing up took all my fighting for the one battle maybe and maybe i just didnt see no call to fight dont work up no sweat going down hill awful easy thing to do and that little old keyhole at the bottom it dont bother you at all cant think no more aint got the words for it mr doctor he tell me one time back when he was telling me things he tell me the mind cant go no farther than a persons cabulary you got to have the words or you cant talk and you got to have em or you cant think no words no thinking just kind of feeling me i get hungry i get cold and hot i get scared and sick mostly i get scared and sick scaredsick kind of together and not doing no real thinking about it just feeling it and wishing it wasnt and knowing its going to go right on being a lot worse maybe because he that boy he acting nice now he trying to pretend being friendly and that boy he act that way you sure better watch out for him he sure about to get you then he come out in the kitchen other night after supper right there with me before i know it and he smile and sweettalk and say he going to help me with the dishes go way i said you lea me alone hear well well let the dishes go he said lets go in your bedroom mother i have something i want to talk to you about huhuh no suh i said you aint gettin me in no bedroom im sure you dont mean that he said youre my mother every mother is interested in her sons problems i go in the bedroom with him scared not to he got his mind made up and that boy make up his mind you sure better not get in his way meanest boy in the world that boy just plain lowdown rattlesnake mean i get on bed get way back against the wall with my legs drawn up under me he sit down on chair at side of bed he takes out a cigarette and then he looks at me and asks if its all right he could smoke i dont say nothing just keep my eyes on him just watching and waiting oh excuse me mother he said allow me he stick a cigarette at me he strike a match and hold it out and me i put that cigarette in my mouth and puff it lit had to scared to death if i dont and scared if i do i take a puff or two sos he wont go for me then he start talking aint watching me close i squeeze it down in my fingers and let it go out now its a money problem i wanted to discuss with you mother he said largely one of money i dont suppose you have a considerable sum you might lend me huh i said where i get any money id probably need several thousand dollars he said thered be some traveling to do id need enough to get reestablished for two people to live on for an extended period whynt you go away i said how i get any money i dont draw no wages you want money you knows who to go to he look at me a little while he look right on through my head it seem like and i figure hes really about to come after me figure i really make one big mistake in kind of talking back to him but what else i do anyhow cant be nothing much but backtalk when you talk to him cant think no more cant do nothing and cant do something scared if i do and scared if i dont he go on looking at me and i know my time really come then he say thats perfectly all right mother say he really didnt expect me to have any money but he thought he should ask say it mightve hurt my feelings him needing money and not giving his mother the tunity to help crazymean that boy he nice and polite that way he crazymeaner than ever but youre quite right mother he said i do know where to get it or more accurately i know where i could lay my hands on a large amount of money the difficulty is that there is another person who needs it who will need it i should say his situation is quite similar to my own and it would place him in a position practically as difficult as mine if he didnt have it so under the circumstances what do you think i should do mother huh i said what what you talkin about boy im sorry he said please dont feel i dont trust you mother it isnt that at all its just that you might be placed in a very compromising situation if i gave you any details spoke in anything but the most general terms and i believe you can advise me quite as well on that basis whats your best opinion mother if you were in my place would you feel justified in extricating yourself from an untenable position at this other mans expense what i think me what i think what i got to think with or listen with or talk with that mean boy i see him too welln too close plenty too close a meancrazy boy like him but i sure dont hear him might as well be talking a zillion miles away lea me alone i said why you all the time devilin me i aint done nothin to you relatively he nodded yes i see relatively you have done nothing and of course you meant that as an answer to my question you did mean it so didnt you mother fo gods sake i said fo gods sake jus i suppose its always that way dont you mother its inevitable there are certain rigid requirements for being ones self a tenable self they may not be violated despite any exigencies regardless of the temptation and the nominal ease with which violations could be accomplished otherwise he becomes another and how if he cannot cope with the problems of his own self live in pride and contentment within its framework can he dwell in that other obviously he cant he loses identity he may have been little but now he is nothing he doesnt know what he is yes youre absolutely right mother im so glad you could advise me out of the background of your experience dont know what he talking about dont want to know now theres another thing i wanted to ask you about mother he said since i cant help myself am past the point of help lets say should i help this other man should i remove an obstacle in the path to the solution of his problem i have nothing to lose it would help him immensely in fact he might not be able to bring himself to do it or if he did he might suffer from regrets it might cast a pall over the goal he achieves by so doing how do you feel about it mother do you think i should help him or not how do i feel what he care what do i think think nothing just think nothing cant him he might be talkin about killing someone and i wouldnt know it he look at me one of them prettysmooth eyebrows cocked up them even prettywhite teeth showing kind of smiling and kind of frowning and i know he as meancrazy as they come you just look at that boy and you see he is but for maybe a second or two i dont see it what i see is sort of a picture that all at once just popped up out of nowhere that kinda seemed to wooze out of my eyes and spread itself over him and me i i almost laugh out loud i think thought why my heavens hattie what in the world has come over you how can you be afraid of this fine young man your son what the picture go away back wherever crazy place it come from me she the me thatd thought them words go back to the same place nothing but the regular me now and it dont do no thinking dont see nothing but through that bitty old keyhole just sees meanest boy that ever lived he been that way for years i watch it coming on him oh sure he dont do nothing with it for a long time he wait until he big and strong but i see it all right he let you see it he nice and polite all the time but he let you see it make you know what you can spect poke it right at you yes mother he said can you answer my question go way i said how i know i me why of course he said naturally you wouldnt know its not something a person can advise another about is it the individual concerned has to make his own decision thank you very much mother i cant tell you what a comfort its been to talk over my problems with you now i see youre looking a little tired so perhaps id better he stand up he put one knee on the bed and start to lean over toward me smiling that pretty whiteteeth smile fastening on to me with them soft brown eyes an knew i was going to get it then he had been playing around all politey and smiley and now he going to do it something mean something bad had to be because there couldnt be no other be couldnt think of no other couldnt think no more but little old keyhole stuff dont know what i going to do house almost in a block by itself and i yell my lungs out and no one hear me no good yelling couldnt do it nohow scaredysick as i was couldnt do nothing nohow just aint nothing to do but wait and hope he wont be too mean no meaner than i can stand cant move feel like i frozen i that stiff and cold cant hardly see nothing just kind of a white blur moving toward me pushing right against my face then i cant really see nothing just feel something sort of soft and warm pressing me on the forehead it go away i get my eyes open somehow and he standing back on the floor again goodnight mother he said i hope you sleep well and please dont worry about anything after all theres no longer anything to worry about is there he stand there and smile and i figure he really going to get me now he just been playing around so far but now he through cant scare me no worse so now he going to get me he turn around and leave he close the door real gentlelike but me i aint being fooled aint going to get me out there where he probably hiding all set and waiting for me just about bound to be why he act like he do if he aint up to something why he make all that talk at me why he keep calling me mother and be so niceynice and an kiss me goodnight huh me i know that boy seen that meanness coming on him a long long time he up to something all right fixing to get me i hear front door open hear it close i hear his car starting up going away and all at once i just flop over on my face and cry because he aint got me and he aint going to him or nobody else cant just aint nothing to get luane devore it was monday night the dance pavilion is closed for business that night but of course ralph still has things to do there or things to do somewhere it was a little after eight a little after dark i heard the front door open quietly i hadnt heard ralphs car but i naturally assumed it was ralph the house is wellinsulated if he had driven up the old lane from the rear as he sometimes does i wouldnt have heard the car i turned around slightly in the bed i waited a second listening and then i called ralph there wasnt any answer i called again and there still wasnt any i made myself smile forced a laugh into my voice ralph is such a tease you know hes always playing funny little jokes doing things to make you laugh i suppose he seems pretty dull and stodgy to most people but hes really worlds of fun and its always that sweet silly puppyish kind even while youre laughing you get a lump in your throat and you want to take him in your arms and pet him oh i can understand his attraction for women his looks and youthfulness are only part of it mostly its because you enjoy being around him because hes so funny and sweet and simple and ralph i called you answer me now you bad bad boy luane will be terribly angry with you if you dont he didnt answer he whoever it was didnt but i heard the floor creak i heard more creaks coming nearer moving slowly up the stairs just the creaks sounds not footsteps nothing i could identify i called one more time then i swung my feet out of bed and and sat there motionless half paralyzed with fear helpless even if i was not so badly frightened the phone was out of order as he this person doubtless knew it was useless to yell and if i locked the door well it could be forced and then i would be trapped in here in this one crowded cluttered room with even less chance of saving myself than i had now i got up took an uncertain step toward the door i hesitated stared slowly around the room and suddenly i was almost calm save myself i thought save myself now surely i should know how to do that kossy came to see me the first sunday of the season i had called him indicating that there was something i wanted to talk to him about when he had the time strictly at his own convenience and he raced right over he didnt hurry on my account of course catch one of those people doing anything for you unless theres a dollar in it probably he thought ralph would be here and he could load up on a lot of free eggs and fruit and vegetables oh well i suppose i am exaggerating a little kossy really doesnt seem to care about money hell treat you just about the same way whether hes getting a fat fee or nothing and i suppose my call may have sounded rather urgent but but why should he care about money i wouldnt either if i had all hes got why should he blame me a poor helpless sick old woman for sounding a little excited he was very mean and insulting not that he usually isnt as soon as i was convinced that there was nothing to worry about i ordered him out of the house i should have done it long before because id heard some pretty unpleasant stories about that man how hed cheated and swindled people right out of their eyeteeth i cant say just who i heard them from but theyre all over town and where theres so much smoke there must be some fire at any rate he not only insulted me but he gave me some very bad advice because i most certainly did have something to worry about he convinced me temporarily and against my will that i hadnt but i knew better the season was only two days old and id already seen it in ralph seen it in the way he talked and acted and looked and that was only the beginning he came home late that night very late i should say since he is always out working as long as he can find work to do i sleep a lot during the day however so i was awake he fixed a snack for me he was too tired to eat himself he said he was going to go straight to bed in fact he got a little stubborn about it but i cried a little and pointed out how lonesome it was for me all day by myself so we talked a while i studied him listening to what he said noticing what he didnt i began to worry again i began to get frightened i hardly slept a wink all night i hardly slept a wink any night because ralph didnt change back to what he had been he kept going farther and farther the other way i was practically out of my mind by the end of the week i was going to call kossy but i didnt have to he came to see me as of course i should have known he would catch him letting go of a good thing hes probably building up his bill so that he can attach this property anyway he was afraid not to come he knew what i could do if i took the notion ive never said anything about him yet mind you hardly anything but if he wanted to be mean and ugly i certainly had a right to defend myself i cried a little and told him about ralph he sat and stared at me like i was some strange kind of animal instead of a poor sick helpless old woman who needed comfort and sympathy and then he said that hed be goddamned kossy darling i said ive asked you so many times please not to use i tell you what i wont use he said i wont use any words you aint used ten thousand times yourself i hadnt ought to bother with you at all but as long as i am ill all right kossy dear i said im just an old woman i cant stop you if you insist luane he said for gods sake aaah nuts he said and threw up his hands never mind let me see if i got this straight ralph is seeing this girl every night youre sure of that but he isnt sleeping with her and youre bothered because he isnt i said no ralph wasnt he always has before i said hes aalways been honest before ccome home and told me about it afterwards but but he waved his hands again you mean you want it that way you want him to make these babes wwell i dont really want him to i said but it wouldnt be fair to stop him since i well you know and as long as he tells me about it he gave me an odd look as if he was a little sick at his stomach he said something about yes he could see how i might enjoy that well never mind he went on it kind of knocked me over for a minute but i guess i get the picture ralph is playing it clean with this gal in your book that makes him in love with her suppose he does a switch goes after what he always has what does that make him please i said please dont joke about it kossy okay he shrugged say hes in love with her say hes going to stay in love and you dont like it naturally but it dont add up to his planning to kill you but it does i mean it could i said i well yeah he waited frowning at me how does it i seem to remember that we were all over that the other day ralph could get a divorce he could just up and leave we agreed that he could well i said i guess he could i mean i know he could but but yeah he stared at me he and that shows what a crook he is honest people move their eyes around they dont have a guilty conscience so they dont feel they have to brazen someone down its only crooks who do that okay he said you want to hold out something go ahead it aint my neck but im not i said i its just that when i talked to you the other day i didnt know he was so serious about this girl i so now you know and he can still walk away or get a divorce so it still dont shape up to a murder i well heres what i was thinking i said the season will end in a couple months and of course the girl will be leaving so whatever if ralph is going to do anything hell have to do it by then and and kossy waited a moment then he grimaced and reached for his hat dont i said im trying to tell you kossy after all it isnt easy for me to discuss ralph this way to think of some reason why my own husband would wwant tto to well sure he cleared his throat uncomfortably i dont suppose it is but but there is a reason why he might kossy this property isnt worth nearly what it used to be but it would still bring five or six thousand dollars maybe as much as ten and if ralph needed money if he was so mean and selfish that he couldnt wait until i died kossys eyes narrowed blinked he nodded slowly yeah he said could be that would seem like a world of dough to ralph particularly now that hes been so hard hit in the job department i dont suppose theres any use pointing out to you that if ralph is planning something youre at least partly at fault i am not i said i havent said a single solitary word about anyone anyway ralph doesnt blame me in the least he knows i havent said half as much as i could have and okay okay kossy sighed forget it ralph wants to kill you maybe hes got a double motive maybe to clear his way for the girl and to cash in on whats left of the estate say that thats the situation what do you want me to do about it well i i didnt know how should i know what to do that was his job and hed been plenty well paid for it i hadnt ever actually caught him stealing from me but thered been a great deal of talk about you think it over he said see what develops and well talk again in a few days meanwhile i want to say something about these lies of yours shut up dont interrupt me and i want you to take it to heart if but i havent said a word i said honestly kossy i and i just hope someone does try to start something ill youll damned probably get killed he said i mean it luane its the law of averages you get enough people sore enough to kill you and youve got just about the whole damned town one of them is almost certain to do the job so cut it out get me better still see if you cant undo some of the damage try to do it admit youve been lying apologize to the people youve harmed use that phone for something decent for a change well of course i wasnt going to do anything like that id die before i just wasnt going to do it in the first place i hadnt said anything he was just irritated by the few harmless little jokes id told about him in the second place it was all true what id said and i guessed that if anyone was cowardly enough to harm someone for telling the truth theyd have done so by now and just what was i supposed to do all day pray tell just lie here all day like a bump on a log and never have a little harmless chat with anyone i tried to explain to kossy how absolutely ridiculous it all was but just try to tell that man anything he looked at me not really listening to what i was saying and then he sighed and shook his head okay maybe you cant help it he said take it easy and ill see you in a few days i was just a little worried after hed gone i mean about someone wanting to kill me besides ralph then i just shoved it out of my mind almost because a person can only worry about so much and thats all and i had more than my limit with ralph because i hadnt told kossy everything i hadnt told him the most important thing he came back the latter part of that week he kept coming back week after week he was here the last time this morning but it didnt help any i certainly couldnt do any of the silly things he suggested ralph hadnt said or done anything out of the way he was different but it wasnt something you could put your finger on outwardly he was just as nice and considerate as ever so how could i have put him under peace bond obviously i couldnt i wouldnt have even if i had a concrete reason to because that would have fixed things up it would have brought everything to a showdown killed the last bit of hope i had and the same thing would happen if i let kossy speak to him or if i had one of the county authorities do it ralph wouldnt feel sorry for me any more he wouldnt pity me hed just go ahead and do what he wanted to do what he wasnt yet nervedup to doing as you can see kossy has been absolutely no help to me none whatsoever here i am a sick old woman whom nobody loves and i can get no help from my own attorney a man who has stolen thousands of dollars from me the foolish little squirt even brought a gun here a revolver and wanted me to keep it i refused even to touch it oh no you dont i said no siree people have accidents with guns accidentallyonpurpose accidents as soon as ralph or anyone found out i had that thing theyd fix up a little accident for me but dammit luane he said what the hell else can you do what can i do for you now you keep it keep it where you can get to it fast and if anyone goes for you use it whaat i said youre suggesting that i should shoot someone wwhy why how dare you kossy what kind of woman do you think i am god he almost shouted i dont know why the hell i dont kill you myself he said some other very mean nasty things and then he slammed out of the house he came back for the last time this morning he said that he still thought i was in much more danger from others than i was from ralph then when i said he simply didnt know what he was talking about he began to get ugly and nosy yknow luane he said the more i think about it the less i can see ralph committing murder for the few thousand bucks this estate would bring its hard for me to see him as a murderer anyway and for that kind of dough it just dont seem to figure at all well youre absolutely wrong i said for a man like ralph whos never really had anything uhhuh because hes cautious ultraconservative ralph wouldnt bet that the sun comes up in the east unless he got a thousandtoone odds hed take no chance except for something big he no now wait a minute lets take a good look at ralph hes been oddjobbing around this town for more than twenty years working around people who are hipdeep in dough who are almost disappointed if they dont get chiseled but did ralph ever clip one of em did he ever pad a bill or walk off with a few tools or steal gasoline and oil or pull any of the stunts that a guy in his place ordinarily would huhuh never in all those years he oh yes he did i said he most certainly did how do you think he got that car pray tell not by killing anyone not by running any real risk at all in all those years he pulls just one perfectly safe bit of chiseling and he collects a highpriced car kossy shook his head slowly giving me that mean narroweyed grin who are you kidding sister you know goddamned well ralph wouldnt kill you for this estate if you really thought he would youd just sign it over to him why i would not i said thered be nothing to stop him then it would be just like throwing him in that girls arms well he shrugged what choice you got what choice has ralph got how you going to get by if he stays here why well get by just fine i said well uh yeah how will you out with it goddammit well well you leave me alone i said you stop it youre jjust as mean and hateful as as and i broke down and began to cry undignified as it was and as much as i despise weepy women thats probably how that girl holds onto ralph by crying all over him making him feel sorry for her ralph is so goodhearted you know he hates to see anyone unhappy and he just wont let them be and they just about cant be when hes around hes so much fun so sweet and funny at the same time and at least he was the mean selfish thing why even this morning he was carrying on pretty much as he used to and it was just pretense of course but i almost forgot that it was and and it was nice come on luane kossy said lets have it i ccant i said i dont know what youre talking about you leave me alone you mean hateful thing you look luane he put his hand on my shoulder and i shook it off dont you see it honey dont you see that you cant hold ralph in a trap without being in it yourself of course you do thats why youre so frightened as you have every right to be let him go luane let him out of that corner youve got him in if you dont kkossy i said kossy ddarling you dont really think he would do you yyou said you didnt couldnt see him kkilling god he slapped his forehead oh god i look tell me what it is what youre squeezing ralph with i have to know dont you understand that i kknow i mean i cant i said there isnt anything and dont you dare say there is dont you dare tell anyone theres something that im he sighed and stood up he said something about my being his client god help him whatever that meant probably that it wouldnt be ethical for him to say anything not that that would stop him of course hes always talking saying mean things about me i havent said anything half as mean about him as he has about me every time he leaves here he goes around laughing and telling people how old and ugly i look anyway he certainly doesnt know anything hes always contradicting himself saying one thing one minute and something else the next first he tells me that ralph wont kill me and then he says he will he says that ralph wont but that theres plenty of others who might and if that doesnt prove hes crazy what would kill me a bunch of cowardly lying lowdown sneaks like they are they dont have the nerve they have no reason to ive never done anything to harm them ive never harmed anyone ralph least of all but now now ralph is it ralph on the stairs but why wont he answer me what can he gain by not answering why is he doing it if it is he if he is going to this way to lure me out there maybe i shouldnt go but if i dont it must be someone else it simply wouldnt make sense for ralph to do it this way as for someone else why would they he she theyre afraid unsure they havent made up their mind theyre waiting to see what i do theyre trying to lure me out of the room like ralph would is might if i only knew i might save myself if i knew who it was before the person becomes sure i might save myself if if i go out if i dont go out save me i prayed just let me save myself thats all i want its all ive ever wanted and thats certainly not very much to ask is it i went out i saw who it was danny lee although i am but of a humble station in life i come from a proud old southern family which was directly descended from that proud old southern warrior robert e lee and we lived in a proud southern village which shall here be nameless then when i was but a slip of a girl i loved unwisely and not too well and my proud old father drove me out into the storm one bitter night so i went to a large city where i stumbled anew into a new pitfall i mean i didnt do anything wrong really never again did i repeat my first and only fatal mistake but there was this place i worked in where you could hustle drinks and where if you could sing a little or dance or something like that you could keep whatever the customers gave you and one night an orchestra leader entered its portals and i innocently agreed to accompany him to his room i didnt have the slightest idea of what evil designs he wanted i simply went because i felt sorry for him and i had to send some money back to my invalid mother and my two brothers and oh i did not im making all of this up i dont have any mother or brothers or any family except my father and if he has anything to be proud of i dont know what it is the last time i heard he was in jail again for bootlegging back in our home town he had a little twobyfour restaurant i used to serve drinks to the customers and two or three times when it was someone i liked real well and i simply had to have something to wear or go naked i let them youknow i finally picked up a dose from one of them pa said that as long as i got it i could figure out how to get rid of it so i stole ten dollars he had hidden and went to a place near fort worth i couldnt get a restaurant job which was the only kind of work i knew since i couldnt get a health certificate and i couldnt get that of course until i got over the dose so practically flat broke as i was without even money enough for a room it looked like i was really in a pickle i said it looked that way because actually i guess it was lucky i didnt have room money otherwise i wouldnt have gone into that cheap little burlesque house just to rest a while and try to think there were four chorus girls in the line pretty old girls it looked like i didnt think they could sing half as good as i could and the dancing they did was mostly just wiggling and shaking i watched and listened to them a while finally i got up enough nerve to go to the manager and ask him for a job he took me into his office i sang and wiggled for him and he said i was okay but he didnt have a job open right then then he winked and asked me how about it you know and said there was a fast ten bucks in it for me i told him i couldnt he offered me twenty and i told him no again and i told him why because it would be a dirty trick on him he was awfully appreciative he said most girls in my position would have taken the money and not given a damn whether they dosed some poor sonofabitch he appreciated my telling him so much that he gave me a job after all he had to fire another girl to do it and naturally i was sorry for that but she was really too old to be working anyway i told her so when she started cursing me out and she didnt have much to say after that i started seeing a doctor right away as soon as i got a paycheck he got me cleared up fast and things were pretty nice from then on for quite a while all the men who came to the show you hardly ever saw a woman liked me theyd start clapping and whistling and calling for me even while the other girls were doing their numbers then when i went on stage they wouldnt let me go they were really crazy about me even if it doesnt sound nice for me to say so and i couldnt begin to tell you how many of them tried to date me up if id been willing to youknow for money like some of the other girls did i could have made all kinds i wouldnt have had to just barely skimp by like i was doing because that manager could really squeeze a quarter until the eagle screamed but anyway i didnt do it not even once as much as i was tempted i remember one time when i just about had to have a new pair of shoes and i saw an absolutely darling pair in a window marked down from twentythree ninetynine to fourteen ninetyeight it was such a wonderful bargain i just didnt see how i could pass it up i felt like id die if i didnt have those shoes and while i was standing there a man who came to the show all the time came along and offered to buy them for me but i turned him down i hesitated a moment first but i did my real name is agnes tuttle but i changed it when i went to work at the show i was going to make it something kind of unusual like dolores du bois but the other girls had given themselves fancy names fanchon rose and charlotte montclair and so on so i decided to make mine simple it seemed best to you know it stood out more and if id had the same sort of name as those other girls people might have thought i was cheap and shoddy too id been at the show about six months when the police raided it and closed it down the manager got a big fine and had to leave town the girls went back to doing what they had been doing which was you know what i hardly knew what to do i felt it would be kind of a step down to take a waitress job theres nothing wrong with being a waitress of course but it doesnt pay much and its darned hard work and in view of my experience i felt that i simply ought to and had to have something better i was like that then awfully ambitious i mean willing to do almost anything to be a bigname singer or something like that now i feel just about the opposite in the first place i know im not much good as a singer and never will be like rags mcguire says in the second place i just dont care all i want now is just to be with ralph forever and always and by golly i will be and but ill tell you about that later i didnt have money to travel on and there werent any jobs like i wanted in fort worth oh there were a few of course but i couldnt get them all the talent for them was hired through new york agencies so i didnt stand a chance even if id had the training and the presence and the clothes i guess i was pretty awful then and i dont just mean my voice i tried to wear nice things without being flashy and i tried to be careful about makeup and using good english but trying isnt enough when you dont have money to work with and youre not sure of what youre trying for i guess i couldnt really blame rags for thinking i was something that i wasnt i was working in a beer garden at the time i met him it wasnt a very nice place and it wasnt a real job i just hung out there like several other girls did i got to keep any money a customer gave me for drinking with him and i also got a commission on what he bought then a few times a night id sing a number and the orchestra and i divided the change that the customers tossed up on the bandstand well rags dropped into the place one night and a waitress tipped me off that he was a big spender so after id done a number i went over to his table i didnt know who he was just about the greatest jazz musician of all time i just thought you know that if he was going to throw money around he might as well throw some my way and i thought he looked awfully interesting too well i guess i did just about everything wrong that i could i just botched everything up not only that night but the next day when he gave me a singing tryout and offered me a contract i i just dont know i still squirm inside when i think about it but i know i didnt act that way just because of the money i wanted to get ahead of course but mostly i wanted to please him i thought i was doing what he wanted me to do and he seemed so terribly unhappy i felt that i should but he had no use for me from then on from then on i was just dirt to him he wouldnt let me explain or try to straighten things out i was just dirt and he was going to keep it that way i tried to excuse him i told myself that if id had a family like his and the same terrible thing happened to mine that happened to his though he wont admit it did why i might be pretty hard to get along with too but well you cant keep excusing people forever if theyre simply determined to despise you you just have to let them and all you can do about it is to despise them back rags has just done one nice thing for me in all the months ive worked for him that was when we came here and he introduced me to ralph he didnt mean to be nice of course he meant it as a mean joke on me telling me that ralph was a very wealthy man and so on but that was one time mr rags got fooled ralph told me the truth about himself that very first night and i told him the truth about myself and instead of being mad and disappointed with each other like rags thought we would we fell in love ralph was so cute when he told me about himself just like a darling little boy all the time he was talking i could hardly keep from taking him in my arms and squeezing him he couldnt make a living any more in this town it seemed because everyone was mad at his wife on the other hand hed lived here all his life and he wouldnt know what to do anywhere else not by himself i mean and the idea he kind of had in mind in meeting me was well he got pretty mixed up at that point but i understood him the poor darling he didnt need to put it into words for me to understand any more than hes had to put certain other things into words while he was hesitating not knowing quite how to go on i patted him on the hand and told him to never mind i said i was awfully glad he seemed to think so much of me because i liked him a lot too but maybe if he knew the truth hed change his opinion of me well he didnt try to shut me up like most men would have you know just say to forget it and that it didnt matter he just nodded kind of grave and fatherlylike and said is that a fact well maybe you better tell me about it then i told him everything there was to tell although i may possibly have forgotten a few little things when i finally stopped he waited a minute and then he told me to go on ggo on i said but thats all there is but i thought you were supposed to have done something bad he said something that might change my mind about you well my eyes misted over i could feel my face puckering up like some big old babys i sat there looking and feeling that way and not knowing what to do and ralph reached out and pulled my head against his chest you go right ahead honey he said you just cry all you want to well i cried and i cried and i cried it just seemed like i could never stop and ralph told me not to try so i cried and i cried and everything that was in me that wasnt really me that didnt really belong there was kind of washed away and i felt all clean and nice and peaceful and i was never as happy in my life ralph i know i get pretty silly whenever i start talking about him but i just cant help it and i just dont care because however much i rave i still dont do him justice hes the handsomest thing you ever saw in your life for one thing a lot handsomer than most anyone in pictures and dont think i wont make him try out for pictures when we get away from here but thats only one thing along with it hes just the nicest kindest understandingest well everything hes mature and yet hes awfully boyish the most wonderful sweetheart a girl ever had but kind of fatherly too we saw each other every night after that we talked about what we were going to do kind of talking around the subject because it looked like there was just about only one thing we could do and things like that theyre not something you can very well talk about yes that mean old hen he was married to would give him a divorce all right or he could just leave like id suggested and to hell with the divorce shed let him know that those things although she hadnt said so in so many words the trouble was she wouldnt let him take the money that belonged to him money hed worked for and saved dollar by dollar she wouldnt even let him take half of it she kept it under the mattress of her bed and she made it clear to him that anyone who got it would have to kill her first ralph was afraid to sue her he had a record book of his savings showing when and how much he put away but that wouldnt necessarily prove that the money was his would it she might have told him to keep the record for her and anyway those lawsuits drag on forever and the only ones that get anything out of em are the lawyers at first i told ralph to let her keep the money the old bag but ralph didnt want to do that wed need it ourselves to get a decent start in life and after i thought about it a while i wouldnt have let him if he had wanted to it was his money wasnt it his and mine when something belongs to a person they ought to have it and if someone tries to stop them they ought to have something i told ralph that he ought to speak up to her instead of just beating around the bush i said that id be glad to talk to her myself and if that didnt do any good id slap some sense into her but ralph didnt think that would be a very good idea and i guess it wasnt shed probably put the money in the bank and tell the police shed been threatened then if anything happened why you know where wed be i was sorry afterwards that id said anything like that to ralph because i was perfectly willing to do what i said i would and heck of a lot more but it might have sounded a little shocking to say so i mean even if i wasnt a woman if i was ralph say and i said something like that to me why id oh well you know what i mean it was best to keep things the way theyd been except for that once talking about what had to be done but not really talking about it not actually admitting that we were talking about it by doing that you see wed never really know thered never be anything to make us uncomfortable about each other after all she was a pretty old woman her health was bad and everyone in town hated her guts and well all sorts of things could happen to her without us having a thing to do with them and neither of us would need to know that we had unless the weeks raced by they went by like days and before we knew it the season was almost over and we were still talking and nothing had happened then that monday night came the dance hall was closed that night ralph was working there not any regular hours but just until he got through we werent seeing each other afterwards because i had a sore throat i dont know how i got it exactly maybe from sleeping in a draft anyway it wasnt really bad and if id been anything but a singer i wouldnt have bothered to call a doctor i was sitting out on the stoop when he came he painted my throat looking kind of nervous and haggard and then he asked me why i hadnt been in the first time he called i spend thirty minutes finding the right cottage he said and then when i finally locate it im so sorry about that doctor i said you see i was taking a shower and it was some time before i heard you calling and pounding at the cottage next door i came right out as soon as i did but wwhat he said the cottage next uhhuh its unoccupied so many of them are but i thought you saw me doctor i ran out on the stoop and called to you just as you were driving away and i thought you called and motioned to me i supposed you meant you had no more time right then and youd have to come back later he looked at me blankly for a moment then his eyes flickered in a kind of funny way and he snapped his fingers why of course he said now that i see you in the light i can you had a robe on didnt you and a uh did you have a bathing cap thats right i said a robe and a bathing cap because id just come out of the shower i suppose i looked quite a bit different than not a bit he said firmly not a particle id have recognized you instantly if it hadnt been so fixed in my mind that you were in the other cottage lets see now about what time was that i told him i guessed it was a little after eight somewhere along in there just about the time it was getting dark youre right he said youre absolutely right miss lee let me compliment you on your memory now thats real sweet of you doctor i said but after all why shouldnt i remember i mean a girl just about couldnt forget anything connected with a distinguished looking gentleman like you i smiled at him looking up from under the lids of my eyes he beamed and harrumphed his throat and said i was a very fine young lady he repeated that several times while he was repacking his medicine kit he said he wanted me to take very good care of myself and any time i needed him regardless of the hour i was to let him know i thought he was awfully sweet and nice kind of distinguished and mature like ralph he asked if he might use my phone and i said why certainly and he called a number hank he said jim just wanted to tell you that its you know all right i remembered where i mean i can account positively for the time theres a young lady who saw me recognized my car and my voice and who well that one the one we were discussing she what why yes i suppose thats true i hadnt thought about it that way but id gone over by the door to be polite so that it wouldnt look like i was snooping you know he turned around and looked at me kind of frowning as he went on talking yes yes i see naturally unless i was sure that she unless there was an observer i could hardly be observed but yes hank thats the way i feel on the one hand absolutely had to be no reason to consider it anything else exactly hank and as long as thats the case fine ha ha fine see you hank he hung up the receiver he picked up his medicine kit gave me a funny little nod and started out the door on the stoop he paused for a moment and turned around facing me allow me to compliment you again he said youre a very smart young woman miss lee now that is sweet i said thats a real compliment coming from a smart man like you i gave him another undertheeyelids smile he turned suddenly and left i thought he seemed a little cranky i wondered if he thought i hadnt really seen him that first time because actually i hadnt i said i had because hed started off being so cross and i was afraid he might think i hadnt been at home when he called but all id really seen was his car driving away or a car that looked like his oh well probably i was just imagining things after all he remembered seeing me perfectly so why should he think i hadnt seen him i put on some makeup and went out on the beach i sat down with my back to the ocean after a while i saw a light come on in rags mcguires cottage i walked down to it and knocked on the door he was sitting on the side of the bed drinking out of a bottle hes been drinking a lot lately but on mondays he drinks more than usual well he said if it isnt little miss bosoms the girl with the tinplated tonsils how come they let you out baby or aint you been in yet i dont know what youre talking about and i dont care i said and all ive got to say to you is im quitting you mean hateful dirty old old bastard sonofabitch whoremonger he said now you sit right down there honey and ill think up some more for you ill do that an you tell me where you were around eight oclock tonight if its any of your business i said i was in my cottage at eight oclock and for all the rest of the evening i had a sore throat and the doctor saw me about eight and again just a little while ago if its any possible concern of yours his eyes widened he broke out laughing suddenly slapping his knee doc ashton oh brother you two you and doc ashton will this burn a certain little lawyer i know who dreamed it up baby you or doc i havent the faintest notion of what youre talking about i said but since you seem to be so curious as to my whereabouts at certain times perhaps i might inquire about yours his laugh went away he put the bottle on the floor sat staring into the neck of it as if there was something there besides the whiskey i dont know he said i dont know where i was but i was all alone danny i was all alone it seemed awful silent then the only sound was the waves laplapping whispering against the sand i began to get sort of a funny feeling in my throat i was just about to say id work out the rest of the season these last two weeks but he spoke first so youre quitting huh well thats something thats at least one break youve given me then he got up and came over to me and took my face between his hands you didnt mean it danny and i didnt mean it besides i dont want you to leave danny besides i love you danny he stooped and kissed me on the forehead i said rags oh ggosh rags i i couldnt keep you any longer he said i couldnt pay you understand but i think youre one of the finest girls ive ever known and i think you have one of the very finest voices ive ever heard i wished youd go on with it i did wish that but now now i know you mustnt it would never do because the one thing is all you can have danny the music is all you can have danny and if it isnt enough he took his hands away from my face let them slide down my arms then he scowled suddenly and gave me a shake posture he said goddammit how many times do i have to tell you youve got two feet havent you youre not an obstetrical case are you well stand on them then by god i said i was sorry i stood like hed told me to like hed taught me to all right he said lets have it make it stardust even you cant bitch that one well what are you waiting for i i ccant i said oh rrags i he ran his hands through his hair okay go on get the hell no wait a minute sit down over there right there dammit ill let you hear stardust like it ought to be sung almost i sat down by his desk he sat down in the other chair and put in a longdistance call to his wife the call went through and he held the receiver a little away from his ear hi janie he said hows it going how are the boys i couldnt understand what she said because it was just kind of sounds instead of words a sort of quackquacking like a duck would make theyre asleep eh well thats fine dont bother to wake them up the boys couldnt be waked up never ever listen janie ive got a kid here i want you to sing for i janie i said i wanted you to sing understand well get with it then give me stardust and give it loud this kid here is pretty tonedeaf she couldnt sing of course how can you sing when you dont have a nose and only part of a tongue and no teeth and hardly any place to put teeth but there was a click and a scratch and her voice came over the wire it was pretty wonderful her singing stardust a platter has to be pretty wonderful to sell three million copies but rags had started frowning he squirmed in his chair and the cigarette in the corner of his mouth began a kind of nervous upanddown moving he held the receiver away from him he looked at it frowning and then he lowered it slowly toward the hook and the farther down it went the farther it was away from him the more his frown faded and when it was completely down when the connection was broken he wasnt frowning any more he was smiling it was a kind of smile id never seen before a dreamy faroff smile one of his hands moved slowly back and forth up and down and one of his feet taptapped silently against the floor do you hear it danny he said softly do you hear the music yes i said yes i hear the music rags the music he said the music never goes away danny the music never goes away henry clay williams i knew from the moment i sat down at the table that morning that i was in for trouble i knew it before lily had said a word probably most men wouldnt have even if they had lived in the same house with a sister as long as i have with lily but im an unusually close observer i notice little things no matter how small it is ill see it and interpret it and nine times out of ten my interpretation will be correct ive trained myself to do it a man has to as i see it if he wants to get ahead of course if he doesnt if he wants to remain a smalltown lawyer all his life instead of becoming the chief legal officer of the sixteenthlargest county in the state why thats his privilege i began to eat knowing that lily was going to land on me and why and trying to prepare myself for it finally when she still held back i gave her a little prod i notice youre running low on pepper i said remind me to bring some home tonight what pepper she said what makes you think im running low why i just supposed you were i said you have plenty theres still plenty in your kitchen shaker she sighed and pursed her lips together she sat looking at me silently her glasses twinkling and flashing in the morning sunlight i just wondered i said i noticed that you only peppered one of my eggs when you cooked them so is there a peppershaker in front of you she said well is there or isnt there or hadnt you noticed she sounded unusually irritable for some reason i said why of course id noticed the shaker and it didnt matter at all about the eggs i was simply curious about them i said you always pepper them each one the same amount so naturally i wondered why you hadnt i see she said yes i can see how you might get pretty excited about it it would be a pretty big thing to a big man like you now i didnt say i was excited i said i said nothing of the kind lily if my memory serves me correctly and i think youll agree that it usually does the words i used were curious and wonder i nodded to her and put a bite of egg in my mouth her lips tightened then she spoke shakyvoiced so you were curious were you you were wondering you were curious and wondering about why i hadnt peppered an egg well ill tell you something im curious and wondering about and thats what you intend to do when you are no longer the chief legal officer of the sixteenth largest county in the state for after the elections this fall mr henry clay williams youre going to be out of a job she deliberately timed that last with the moment when i was taking a swallow of coffee to wash the egg down i coughed and choked feeling my face turn red the egg tried to go one way and the coffee another and for a long moment i was certain id strangle now goddammit i said when i was able to speak why what the hell henry henry dont you use that language in this house lily said but its its crazy outrageous why ive always been i mean ive been county attorney since very well she said very well henry but dont forget that i warned you she got up and started to clear off the table i hadnt finished breakfast yet although i certainly didnt feel like eating any more but she went right ahead regardless the bulge under her apron seemed larger today i glanced quickly away from it as her eyes shifted toward me it was very annoying that tumor having to live with it constantly and yet never daring to look at it let alone to discuss it perhaps it wouldnt have been for most men but when you have trained yourself as i have when you are used to observing and i observed that her glasses had an unusually high sparkle this morning obviously then i was immediately aware there must be some dust on them she couldnt keep her glasses clean and yet she was trying to pass herself off as a prophet i was about to make some pointed reference to these facts but she left for the kitchen at that moment with a load of dishes and when she returned i decided it wasnt wise after all you dont cure a trouble by adding to it thats always been my policy at least and its worked out very well if out of a job lose the election she was seated at the table again she looked at me nodded slowly as if i had spoken out loud yes henry yes and if you had any brains at all you wouldnt need me to tell you so now see here lily i said i any brains at all henry or if you were even capable of listening hearing anything besides the sound of your own voice or your own thoughts anything that might deflate the largest ego in the sixteenth largest county in the state youre a fool henry youre a i am am i i said well i guess i know how to keep my glasses clean anyway the glasses flickered and flashed her eyes squeezed shut behind them for a moment then she opened them again keeping them narrowed and her nostrils twitched and flared and i knew the explosion was coming listen to me henry what im saying is not for myself i dont expect you to have any consideration for me your own sister who has practically given up her life for you taken care of you since you were wet behind the ears i dont expect you to care if im so slandered and gossiped about that im almost ashamed to go out in public im only concerned about you as ive always been and thats why im saying you are going to lose the election unless you get up a little spunk and act like a man for a change instead of a fat blind stupid egotistical jellyfish she paused breathing heavily her bosom heaving up and down i was going to say something back to her but i decided it wasnt worthwhile i couldnt lose the election i why i just couldnt and when a person cant do something yes she said yes you can henry you know im right you know you dont have good sense you shut up when im speaking to you henry henry im not saying anything i said all i was going to say was nothing that would make any sense thats what you were going to say you were going to say that no one in this town pays any attention to luane devore but they do all right perhaps they dont believe what she says but they remember it and they wonder about it and when a man is a spineless incompetent to begin with it doesnt take a deal of wondering to dump him out of his sinecure at any rate you seem to have forgotten that it takes more than the town vote to elect you you have to have the farm people and they dont know that when luane devore says you we that shes lying well they will i said after all youve had that tumor quite a while now and when you dont have a i mean when nothing happens why i swallowed back the words i looked down at my plate tried to keep my eyes there but something seemed to pull them back up she stared at me silently she sat there staring and waiting waiting waiting waiting and waiting i threw my napkin on the table and jumped up i marched to the telephone and asked for the devore residence there was a lot of clicking and clattering then the operator said that the devore line was out of order out of order eh i said well lily took the phone out of my hands she said did you say the devore line was out of order operator thank you very much she hung up and put the phone back on its stand it seemed to me that she owed me an apology for doubting my word but naturally i didnt get one instead she asked me what i was going to do about the line being out of order why im going to fix it of course i said im a telephone repair man aint i please she put her fingers to her forehead please spare me your attempts at humor henry well ill wait until its in order naturally i said ill call her later on from the office but suppose it isnt repaired today she shook her head i think it would be best to go and see her henry lay down the law to her in person tell her that if she doesnt stop her lies and if she doesnt issue a public retraction immediately youll have her indicted for criminal slander but but look i said i cant do that i mean going out and jumping all over a sick old woman and and it wouldnt look right no matter what shes done why shes a woman a sick old woman and im a man are you lily said then why dont you act like one anyway its its probably illegal i said might get into a lot of trouble im a public official if i use my public office in a personal matter why all right i said go ahead and shake your head youre doggone good at telling someone else what to do but when it comes to doing it yourself thats something else again aint it very well henry she turned away from me could i impose on you to the extent of driving me out there why certainly i said im always gl what ill see her myself ill guarantee that by the time im through shell have told her last lie and if you dont want to drive me out ill walk ill suddenly she was crying weeping wildly suddenly all the coldness and calmness were gone and she was a different woman it was like that time years ago when we were kids out on the farm shed taken me down in the meadow that day to search out some hens nests we came to one halffilled with eggs and just as she reached for it a rattlesnake reared up on the opposite side and what happened then my god she busted out bawling but it wasnt the usual kind not the way people cry when theyre frightened or hurt or something like that it was well wild crazy more like real mean cussing than bawling it scared hell out of me a sixyearold kid and i guess it did the same to the snake because he tried to whip away but she wouldnt let him she grabbed up that deadly rattler in her bare hands and yanked him in two then she threw the pieces down and began to jump on them bawling in that wild crazy way and she didnt stop until there wasnt enough left of that snake to make a grease spot ive never forgotten how she acted that day i dont think i ever will if id had any idea that my harmless little remark at breakfast would have started anything like this ill take care of her ill fix that filthy slut ill tteach her how tto lily i said listen to me lily im going to you you dont ccare you dont know what it means to a woman tto ill claw her eyes out ill pull her filthy tongue out of her throat ill let go of me yyou let i didnt let go i held on tight shaking her as hard as i could and i didnt like doing it you know but i was more afraid not to as soon as she was quieted enough to listen i began to talk to tell her and keep telling her that id see luane devore myself that i definitely and positively promised i would i kept repeating it until it finally sank in on her and she snapped out of her fit all rright henry she shuddered and blew her nose i certainly hope i can depend on you if i thought for a moment that i told you i would i said ill do it this evening right after i close the office after but why cant you because i said its a personal matter you cant get around that even seeing her after office hours could put me in a pretty awkward position if someone chose to make anything out of it but i certainly cant do it on the countys time she hesitated studying me at last she sighed and turned away again all right she said but if you dont really intend to i wish youd say so in fact the more i think about it the less i care whether you do talk to her im perfectly willing to do it myself id like doing it i said id do it i said immediately after five tonight now its all settled so forget it i left before she could say anything more i drove down to the courthouse and went up to my office it was a pretty busy morning all in all i had a long talk with judge shively about the coming election then sheriff jameson dropped in with a legal matter and i had another long conference with him as you may or may not know a sheriff gets part of his income from feeding prisoners this county pays jameson fifty cents per meal fed and what he wanted to know was could he feed them one double meal a day instead of two and still collect a dollar well it was a pretty fine legal point you know something you might say was this way or that and you could make a case out either way i finally decided however that there might be just a leetle danger in the doublemeal proposition but i pointed out that the word meal could mean just about whatever he wanted to a bowl of beans could be a meal or a plate of fried potatoes or even a hunk of bread it was eleven oclock before i got jameson straightened out i was hoping id have time to take a deep breath maybe get out and see a few voters but it just wasnt in the cards because now that id gotten all those other things cleared up why nellie otis my secretary needed me oh i didnt really mind nellie is an attractive young woman as well as an excellent secretary and there are twelve votes in the otis family and shes always so appreciative of everything i do for her she stood by watching all the time i was untangling the ribbon on her typewriter she said she just didnt know how i did it shed tried and tried herself and shed just made it worse i said there was nothing to it really it was just a matter of going straight to the source of the trouble like it would be in any other problem i passed it off lightly that way but it was a pretty bad snarl just about the worst id ever untangled for her and thats really saying something by the time id finished with it and gotten washed up it was five minutes after twelve the whole morning was gone and i was already into my lunch hour i was turning away from the washroom sink when i happened to glance out the window and i just stood there for a moment staring wondering well what the hell next now there i thought thats really something kossmeyer and goofy gannder one great man talking to another great man yes sir i thought water really finds its level mind you i have nothing against kossmeyer ive never said a word against him to anyone but i do feel yes and im justified that if hes whats supposed to be smart why i dont want to be the way i look at it if hes so damned smart why isnt he rich wheres the proof that hes smart why half the time he dont even use good english i had him figured right from the beginning hes one of those jury jaybirds one of those howlers and pleaders all the law he knows you could put in your right eye and hes just been lucky so far if he ever came up against a man who dealt in facts and details i guess you know how long he would last i went to lunch the afternoon was even busier than the morning the way the work was piling up it began to look like i might be so tied up i couldnt get out to see luane devore tonight but then i thought about the way sis had acted and i decided id better work or no work i was on my way out of the courthouse when sheriff j ameson called to me and asked me to step into his office hed confiscated a batch of evidence and he wanted my opinion of it before he went into court on it i tested it i told him i wouldnt hesitate to go before the supreme court with evidence like that so he laughed and gave me a bottle to take with me it was a little after five when i got in my car and headed out of town just before i got to the devore place i took a right fork in the road and drove up toward the hills the land up there isnt much good any more either worn out or eroded and gullied of its topsoil all the farms have been abandoned including the one where i was born and raised i turned into the lane that led up to our house i stopped in the yard all grown up to weeds now and looked around one side of the barnloft was caved in all the windows of the house were broken and the kitchen door creaked back and forth on one hinge and the chimneys had toppled scattering brick across the rotting and broken shingles of the roof it was kind of sad somehow it made me think of that poem the deserted village i used to give at friday afternoon school recitals it was sad but it was nice because everything had gone to hell now but in my mind it hadnt in my mind nothing had changed everything was as it used to be and the way it used to be nothing was ever nicer or finer than that no worries no one fussing at you always knowing just what to do and what not to do and knowing that it would be all right if you made a mistake not like it is now when you mean well but you aint real sure of yourself and theres no one to come straight out and set you straight not like it is now when people cant understand that youre truly sorry about something and being sorry is about all you can do and they wouldnt give a damn if they did understand i took a big drink of the whiskey i guessed i ought to be seeing luane devore but it was so nice and peaceful here and i had all evening to do it so i got out and went up the back walk to the kitchen the big old range was still there lily had said what was the sense of moving an old woodburner into town for pity sake so wed left it behind and consequently fine stove that it was it was rusting into junk it looked like junk but in my mind i could see it like it had been like id used to keep it when i was a kid and mama and papa were still alive that was my job keeping the stove blacked and polished i did it every saturday morning as soon as it was cooled off from breakfast and no one was allowed in the kitchen while i was doing it first id take a wire brush and dryscrub it all over then id get busy with the blacking rags and polish id rub it in good get it wiped so clean you couldnt raise a smudge on your finger after that id take a little kindling splinter and tip it with the blacking and get down in all the little cracks and curlycues we didnt do any farm work on saturdays except for just the milking and feeding of course so when i was through id roll back the doors to the living room and mama and papa and lily would come in mama would take a look and kind of throw up her hands shed say why i just cant believe my eyes if i didnt know better id think it was a new stove and papa would shake his head and say i couldnt fool him it was a new stove id gone out and snuck one in from somewhere and no one could tell him different so well id have to take and show him that it was really just the same old stove and lily hardly ever said anything i used to wonder about it wanting to ask her why but somehow kind of shy about doing it and one time when id saved up a lot of nickels i got a nickel every time i polished the stove i took them all and bought her a big red hairribbon i brought it home from town inside my blouse not telling anyone about it that night when she was out in the kitchen alone doing dishes i gave it to her she looked at it and then she looked at me smiling at her then she doused it down in the dishwater and threw it into the slop pail i watched it sink down under the scummy surface and i didnt know quite what to do what to say i didnt feel much like smiling any more but i was kind of afraid to stop i was kind of well just afraid mama and papa always said if you were nice to others why they would be nice to you but id done the nicest thing i knew how i thought so all i could think of was that mama and papa must be wrong or maybe i didnt know what was nice and what wasnt what was bad and what was good and for a minute i felt all scared and bewildered and lost well though lily grabbed me up in her arms suddenly and hugged me and kissed me she said shed just been joking and she was just mixedup and absentminded and not thinking what she was doing so everything turned out all right i never said anything to mama or papa about it i even lied to mama and said id lost all my nickels when she asked me what had happened to them that was about the only time i can ever remember her scolding me or papa saying anything real sharp to me because she felt he had to be told about it but i still didnt tell about the ribbon i knew theyd be terribly upset and sad if they knew what lily had done and idve cut off my tongue before i told them its funny how dammit its not funny theres nothing funny about it and why the hell does it have to be that way why is it when you feel so much one way you have to act just the opposite so much the opposite why cant people leave you alone why cant you leave them alone why cant you just all live together and be the way you are knowing that its all right with the others however you are because however they are is all right with you i wandered through the house drinking and thinking feeling happy and sad i went up the stairs and into my little room under the eaves dusk was coming on filling the room with shadows i could see things like they had been almost without closing my eyes it all came back to me the checked calico curtains at the windows the circular rag rug the bookcase made out of a fruitbox the high quilted bed the picture above it a picture of a boy and his mother titled his best girl the little rocking chair the chair was still there lily hadnt mentioned moving it and i kind of didnt like to i hesitated and then i tried to sit down in it i was a lot too big for it of course because san because mama and papa had given it to me the christmas i was seven i kept squeezing and pushing though and finally the arms cracked and split off and i went down on the seat that was pretty small for me too but i could sit on it all right i could even rock a little if i was careful so i sat there rocking back and forth my knees almost touching my chin and for a while i was back to the days that had been and i was what i had been in those days then some rats scurried across the attic and i started and sighed and stood up i stood staring blankly out the window wondering what the hell id better do dammit all what was i going to say to luane shed just start screaming and crying the minute i opened my mouth and id wind up making a fool of myself like lily says i always do it wouldnt do any good to ask her for a retraction because i wouldnt be able to make myself heard in the first place and in the second place shed know there wasnt a damned thing could do shed know i wouldnt take her into court trials cost money and voters dont want money spent unless it has to be and they sure wouldnt see it as having to be in this case they might be sore at her they might want her to catch it in the neck but using county money to do it just wouldnt go down with them besides that besides dammit i couldnt bring her to trial i didnt dare do it she was kossmeyers client hed fight for her to the last ditch regardless of what he thought of her personally hed fight one of the best trial lawyers in the country would be fighting me hed put me on the witness stand and mimic me and get everyone to laughing and shoot questions faster than i could think and i took a drink i took a couple more right behind it my shoulders sort of braced up and i thought well who the hell is kossmeyer anyway he aint so goddamned much i took another drink and another one i let out a belch he kossmeyer he didnt really know anything he was just a fast talker more of an actor a clown than he was a lawyer no good outside of a courtroom where he couldnt pull any of his tricks outside of a courtroom where he had to deal strictly in facts hed be no good at all i could make a fool out of him with the right kind of facts it would be all over the county all over the state how hank williams had shown kossmeyer what was what maybe oh hell i just couldnt talk to luane she wouldnt listen to me and damn her she ought to be made to to listen or else and what by god could she do about it if she was what could kossmeyer do about it youd have your facts all ready you know so youd just smile very sweetly and say why there must be some mistake the poor woman must have gone completely out of her mind why ive been right here at home with my sister all evening and lily would swear that i had been and god almighty what was i thinking about i couldnt do anything like like that i wouldnt any more think of of hurting anyone than i would of flying so but they kept hurting me didnt they they wouldnt leave me alone would they and if i didnt do something what would i tell lily could i get away with lying to her again if i could give her a real good story and make it sound convincing why that would give me some time and maybe i could think of something to do or maybe i wouldnt have to do anything at all you know how it is lots of times if you can put something off long enough it just kind of takes care of itself but i sure hated to try lying to lily remembering the way she acted this morning it almost made me shiver to think about lying to her and why should i have to anyway why not do the other as long as it was perfectly safe god i didnt know what to do i knew what i ought and wanted to do but actually doing it was something else i looked at the whiskey bottle it was only a third full i lifted it to my mouth and started gulping i took three long gulps stopped a second for breath and took three more gulps i coughed swayed a little on my feet and let the bottle drop from my fingers it was empty my eyelids fluttered and popped open and i shuddered all over then my shoulders reared way back and i seemed to have a ramrod where my spine had been i gave the bottle a hard kick i laughed and made a pass in the air with my fist i went down the stairs and drove away it was about a quarter of nine when i got home lily met me in the hall all ready it looked like to open up on me so i opened up first now just one minute please i said you listen for a change and then if youve got any questions you can ask em now youll recall that hhenry henry she said i im youll recall i raised my voice youll recall that i was against seeing luane i told you it was highly inadvisable occupying the position that i do but you insisted so hhenry she said shakily you you did see her naturally where do you think ive been all evening i said now it didnt turn out at all well much worse even than i expected so whatever you do dont let on to anyone that i whats the matter with you she took a step back from me her hand fluttered to her mouth yyouve been drinking she said you ddont didnt know what you were ive had a drink i said just a swallow or two and i dont want to hear anything about it i shut up her voice cracked out suddenly like a whip listen to me henry the sheriff called here a few minutes ago i was positive you were up to something foolish staying away like this so i didnt tell him you werent here i said you were taking a bath and youd have to call him back now bbut why my stomach was sinking it was oozing right down into my shoes wwhat ddoes you know why what going out there so drunk you you you killed her understand luanes dead doctor jim ashton arrived at the devore place right behind me and we went in the house together jim looked pretty drawn sickish surprisingly or maybe it wasnt surprising id never felt better or more selfconfident in my life id been kind of set back on my heels for a second but i snapped right out of it the fogginess washed out of my mind taking all of the old foggy unsureness with it i had a keyedup coiledtight feeling and yet i was perfectly at ease sheriff jameson and a couple of his deputies were inside i talked to jameson and then i went into the living room and talked to ralph devore he appeared a little stunned but not greatly upset he answered all my questions promptly and lucidly and i should add most satisfactorily i clapped him on the back offered him my condolences and told him not to worry about a thing then i went back out into the hall luane devore lay at the foot of the stairs in her nightgown although she was sprawled on her stomach her legs back up on the steps her head was twisted completely around so that her face was turned upward her lips were bruised and swollen smeared with drying blood there were several other bad bruises on her face and of course her neck was broken jim finished his examination and we stepped into the dining room to confer i told him about ralph why ralph had to be completely above any suspicion he was pretty startled naturally i had been myself when i saw the proof of ralphs innocence but then he shrugged and nodded id call it an accident myself he said thats a long fall from the top of those stairs a fall like that could easily have bruised her up much more than she is of course when someone has lived in hot water all her life you hardly expect her to die of chilblains but i laughed i said it was odd that an accident should get her when so many people had motives for doing so but there it was wasnt it he said it was an accident i said it was so did the sheriff that made it an accident and anyone would have a hell of a time proving that it wasnt i laughed again he gave me an odd searching look i hesitated my laugh had sounded pretty loud i guess and then i asked him what was on his mind well uh nothing he frowned uncomfortably you were the sheriff reached you at home tonight why yes i said what of it nothing lily was there with you i suppose well he shook his head thats good im glad to hear it and bobbies out with the pavlov girl and im glad of that for once but oh i said slowly as if i was just beginning to see what he meant look jim dont take this the wrong way but where were you quiet he said sharply i dont want to talk about it here but look i said the time of death cant be fixed absolutely so whether you i said i didnt want to talk about it here he snapped can you meet me down in front of the courthouse in about fifteen minutes why sure i said even sooner but good do it then he left i went back out into the hall the nearest undertaking service was thirty miles away so it would be some time before luanes body could be removed sheriff jameson agreed to stick around until the job was over also to see that ralph was taken care of comfortably for the night he had one of his deputies put a couple of things of ralphs into my car things i was taking custody of temporarily and then i left for town jim ashton was parked in front of the courthouse he got out of his car as i drove up started talking while i was still climbing out of mine you asked me a question about fixing the time of death hank heres the answer when a fatality is discovered as quickly as this one was you can come damned close to fixing the time it occurred oh you cant pin it down to a matter of minutes and seconds but you can place it within a very narrow period and hank i cant account for my time during that period in this case but it was an accident i said anyway youre not the only one who who else is there my son is in the clear you and lily are ralph is theres that girl hes been chasing around with of course but if hes out of the picture she just about has to be too anyway shes in a lot better spot than i am and damn her its her fault that im but let it go the time of luanes death can be placed within a certain period and everyone but me can just a minute i put a hand on his arm calm down jim you were the one who examined luane whats to stop you from saying she died during a period that you can account for he looked at me blankly jims supposed to be a very intelligent man and im sure he is but he certainly couldnt keep up with me tonight no one could have oh he said at last why yes i guess i could couldnt i why not i winked and nudged him whats to stop you a relieved smile spread over his face then he glanced over my shoulder and the smile went away there he nodded grimly and i turned around and looked thats whats to stop me id expected kossmeyer to be tipped off and i knew hed move fast as soon as he was but i hadnt thought he would move this fast and i hadnt planned on his doing what he had done or rather what he was preparing to do his convertible was just about in the middle of the block opposite us just passing under a streetlight we could see him plain as day and the man he had with him the doctor who sometimes came here from out of town they passed on by took the road that led toward the devore place jim sighed and said well that was that he guessed i told him i was sure everything would work out all right but it didnt seem to help much he drove away still looking mighty sickish and i took the stuff out of my car and carried it up to my office i was feeling a mite letdown myself kind of you know like someone had given me a little punch in the stomach and it wasnt because i was worried about jim jim hadnt killed luane i was positive of it so unless he confessed and i doubted if even kossmeyer could break jim ashton down he couldnt be convicted he could be put to plenty of grief of course so much that he might just about as well be guilty as innocent but dammit he almost deserved to be if he hadnt been so careless or unlucky or dumb or something id have had kossmeyer against a stone wall i could have put that little louse in his place and made him like it i cussed and took a kick at my wastebasket i got busy on the telephone trying to make the best of the situation about thirty minutes passed id just hung up after a call when the phone rang it was jim he had an alibi for the time of luanes death after all not only that but the lee girl also had one they were each others alibi i almost let out a war whoop when he told me the news i think i would have if i hadnt glanced out the window and seen kossmeyer coming up the walk i hung up the phone thinking by god that this made everything perfect hell better than perfect i listened grinning as kossmeyer came up the steps and down the hall as he neared the door i wiped off my grin and stood up i was very polite to him oh extremely i said it was a great honor to have such a distinguished visitor and that i would feel privileged to assist him in any poor way that i could he looked a little startled then embarrassed then as he sat down across from me he laughed sort of shyly im sorry he said i just supposed that since we knew each other so well and since its pretty common practice to call in an outside doctor im delighted that you did i said nothing could have pleased me more now as long as youre taking such an extraordinary interest in the case extraordinary its extraordinary to be interested in the death of a client if you please i said perhaps if you will not interrupt we can conclude our business quickly now i have here a canvas sack containing approximately fiftyseven thousand dollars it belongs to ralph devore and here is conclusive proof in the form of a ledger i think youll agree with me that sure i will he nodded id sure as hell agree anyway that the guy could never be convicted luane couldnt have kept him from leaving her he had no monetary motive for killing her he was on the scene right about the time of her death but yeah counsellor go right ahead go right ahead hell there was hardly anything to go ahead with id been all set to surprise him id had it all planned just how hed look and what hed say and what id say and and everything and then that damned stupid jameson or one of his deputies had had to spoil it all well i said as long as youve already been told ought to have known without being told he shook his head ought to have been able to guess how things stood on the other hand whodve ever thought that a guy like devore would have that kind of dough or any considerable sum whats the difference i said it was his money he certainly wouldnt have had to kill her to get his own money would he youre quite right he said gravely he would not have had to i have no grounds for thinking that he did kill her or for that matter that anyone did you i paused you dont think that anyone did you mean you think it was an accident well he shrugged why not theres that broken telephone line of course but you cant make anything out of that yeah id be willing to let it go as an accident he looked at me frowning a little i looked down at my desk feeling my face turn red hardly knowing what to do or say next hed spoiled everything everything id planned to say why why now i couldnt all i could do was just sit there like a bump on a log looking like a damned fool and knowing that he thought i was one he cleared his throat he murmured something about not envying me my job and a prosecutors really having a hard row to hoe used to be on that side of the desk myself yknow he added guess a lot of trial lawyers start off as prosecutors gives em all around experience and the longer they stick to it the better they get you know what i always say mr county attorney i say you show me an experienced prosecutor and ill show you a topflight lawyer i didnt say anything i couldnt even make myself look up at him he cleared his throat again im afraid ive interrupted you so much that ive broken your chain of thought were you going to uh may i see that list i shoved it toward him the list of people who had a good reason for wanting luane dead and who they had been with at the time of her death he went down the doublecolumn of names murmuring aloud kind of talking to himself but also speaking to me bobbie ashton and myra pavlov lily and henry c will oh now really i hope you dont think that was necessary on my account doctor ashton and danny lee hmm hmm well what the hell though he laid the list back on my desk he murmured that i had certainly done a firstrate job of investigation then after a long awkward pause he suddenly laughed my head came up it was such a warmsounding friendly laugh that it was hard for me to keep from joining in yknow mr county attorney he chuckled sometimes i feel like one of those characters in a western movie the guy that gets such an exaggerated reputation for toughness that he cant hardly tip his hat without someone thinking hes going for a gun sure i try to take care of my clients and maybe im overly conscientious about it but i certainly dont go hunting for trouble i dont like trouble yknow theres too damned much of it already without creating any he laughed again giving me a sidewise glance trying to draw me into his laughter i looked back at him coldly letting him squirm for a change letting him feel as foolish as i had well he stood up awkwardly i guess uh i guess id better be going see you around huh and my compliments on your thoroughness in handling this investigation he nodded and started for the door i let him get halfway there before i spoke just a moment mr kossmeyer yeah he turned around come back here i said i havent told you you could leave yet whaat he laughed kind of frowning what the hell is this i stared at him silently he came slowly back and again sat down across from me you complimented me on my thoroughness i said it suddenly occurred to me that i havent been thorough enough where were you at the time of luane devores death where was aw now luane said a great many ugly things about you whether they were true or not i dont know but then maybe wed better stick to your question he said quietly i was with my wife at the time oh your wife eh i shook my head kind of grinning down my nose just your wife you have no one else to support your story no one theres only the one person im in the same boat with those other people on your list with you for example well i shrugged i suppose ill have to accept that then i cant say that im completely satisfied but uh his face had gone white the pale had pushed up spread over the summers tan and all his color seemed concentrated in his burning black eyes why aint you satisfied he said whats there about me or my wife that makes our word less reliable than that of these other people his voice was kind of a low quivering purr a kind of woundup coiledtight undertone he spoke again repeating his question and the quiver became stronger the tenseness the coiling seemed to extend to his body i began to get a little nervous but i couldnt stop now not the way he was looking at me the way he sounded the way in so many words he was threatening me if hed just laughed again or even smiled a little given me an opening to say oh hell of course i was just joking youve been kicking me in the teeth all evening he said and i took it but i aint taking that last when you tell me that my wifes word is no good that she and i aint as decent and upright as other people then you throw the door wide open you got a hell of a lot more tellin to do then buster and by god youd better not clown around when you do it because if you do now wwait a minute i said i i what are you trying to cover up williams why did you go to such lengths to prove that this was an accident you felt you had to right you had a guilty conscience right you knew you sit there now knowing that it was not an accident but murder and knowing full well who the murderer is thats right isnt it williams answer me you know who killed luane devore and by god i think i do too youve as good as admitted it youve put the finger right on yourself youve nno no i said i wwas with my sister i suppose i told you id talked with your sister suppose i told you shes admitted that you werent with her suppose i told you ive only been playing with you all evening getting you out on a limb with this oneperson alibi deal suppose his voice had uncoiled he had uncoiled he was in front of me leaning toward me pounding on the desk he was there but he was also behind me to the side of me above me he seemed to surround me like his voice closing in shutting out everything else chasing me further and further into a black bewildering labyrinth where only he and the voice could follow i couldnt think i i i thought isnt it funny how when you feel so much one way you act just the opposite i thought she never said nothin mama and papa said i did real good and she hated it she hated me all her life shes she did it it was me screaming sshe said she was going to sshe she she says i wasnt to home why she wasnt either sshe she then she cant alibi for you can she you cant prove you were at home and you werent were you williams you were at the devore house werent you williams you were killing luane werent you williams killing her and then faking nnno no dont you ssee i couldnt i i couldnt hurt no one hhonest mr kossmeyer i i aint that way i kknow it looks like like but that aint me i couldnt do it i didnt ddidnt didnt didnt he was making little motions with his hands motioning for me to stop the whiteness was gone from his face giving way to a deep flush he looked ashamed and embarrassed and kind of sick im sorry he said i didnt really think you killed luane i just got sore and he didnt kill her said a voice from the doorway i did myra pavlov p apa just about scared me to death when he came home for lunch he didnt act much different or say anything much more out of the way than he usually does i guess he really didnt actually but i kept feeling like he knew about bobbie and me and that that was why he was acting and talking the way he was and finally i just got so nervous and scared that i jumped up from the table and ran up to my room afterwards sitting up on the edge of my bed i was scared even more i thought oh golly now i have done it now he will know theres something wrong if he doesnt already i shivered and shook i began to get sick to my stomach kind of a morning sickness like ive had a lot lately but i didnt dare go to the bathroom he might hear me and come upstairs he might start asking mama questions and that would be just as bad because shes even scareder of him than i am its funny how we feel about him i mean the way were always so scared of him because theres actually no real reason to be hes never hit mama or me hes never threatened us or cussed us out hes never done anything of the things that mean men are supposed to do to their families and yet weve always been scared of him almost as far back as i can remember anyway well after a moment or so mama left the table too and came upstairs stopped in the doorway of my room i held my hand over my mouth and pointed she pointed to my shoes i slipped them off and followed her down the hall to the bathroom and golly was it a relief to get in there i used the sink to vomit in and mama kept running the water to cover up the noise it was sure a relief we went back to my room she in her shoes and me in my stocking feet we sat down on my bed and she put her arms around me and held me she was kind of stiff and awkward about it since weve never done much kissing and hugging or anything like that in our family but it was nice just the same it wasnt much later but it seemed like hours before papa left mamas arms slid away from me and we both heaved a big sigh and then we laughed kind of weakly because it was sort of funny you know how are you feeling girl mama said girl is about as close as she ever comes to calling me a pet name i said i was feeling pretty good now stand up and let me take a look at you mama said i stood up i pulled my dress up above my waist and mama looked at me then she motioned for me to sit down again it doesnt show none at all she said you couldnt tell theres a thing wrong by looking at you of course it wouldnt need to show if hes hes do you think he has mama i started to tremble a little yyou dont think he has heard anything do you mama well sure now mama said quickly of course he hasnt i reckon hed sure let us know if he had but but what makes him act so funny then mean you mean mama said when did he ever act any other way she sat turning her hands in her lap looking down at the big blue veins in the rough red flesh her legs were bare and they were red and rough too bruisedlooking where the varicose veins were broken she was just kind of a mass of redness and roughness from her face to her feet and all at once i began to cry there there girl she said giving me an awkward pat want me to get you something to eat nno i shook my head she said id better eat id hardly touched my lunch she said she could bake me up something real quick some puff bread or something else real tasty oh mama i wiped my eyes suddenly smiling a little thats all you ever think of ill bet if a person had a broken leg youd try to feed them well she smiled kind of embarrassed i guess i would probably at that well i said i guess i could probably eat a couple of those fresh crullers you made this morning maybe a couple of cups of good strong coffee too all at once im actually really pretty hungry mama you know i kind of am myself girl mama said you just stay here and rest and ill bring us up a bite she brought up some coffee and a halfdozen crullers and a couple of big thick potroast sandwiches we were both pretty full when we finished at least i couldnt have eaten anything more and i felt kind of peaceful dull peaceful you know like you do when youre full a fly buzzed against the screen a nice little breeze drifted through the window bringing the smell of alfalfa blossoms i guess nothing smells quite as good as alfalfa unless its freshbaked bread i wondered why mama wasnt baking today because she almost always puts dough to set on sunday night and bakes bread on monday guess i just didnt have the will for it she said when i asked her about it you bake all day in this weather and it takes the house a week to cool off it wouldnt if you cooked with gas i said you ought to make him put in gas mama mama made a sort of sourfunny face she asked me if id ever known of anyone to make papa do anything anyway she added slowly i dont think he could do it now even if he wanted to i dont think hes burning coal any more just to bother the neighbors i said that well i thought so i knew so why did you ever marry him anyway mama you must have known what he was like there certainly must have been some signs of it well she brushed a wisp of hair back from her forehead i told you the why of it about a hundred times already girl he was older than me so he got out of the orphanage first and then he started dropping back to visit after he was making money so but you just didnt marry him to get away from the place i said that wasnt the only reason was it no of course not mama said he was different then mama you were in love with him she looked down in her lap again twisting her hands words like love always embarrass mama and her face was a little flushed it wasnt the only reason i married him she said just to get away from the orphanage but maybe i kind of think maybe he thought it was we shouldnt talk about him like we do girl shouldnt even think things like we do hes pretty sensitive you know quick to catch on to what someone else is thinkin and well its his own fault i said what else can he expect anyway mama shook her head she didnt say anything mama i said what did you mean a minute ago when you said papa probably couldnt have the house piped for gas even if he wanted to you didnt mean he didnt have the money did you no of course not i didnt mean anything just thinking nonsense and i said it out loud mama said quickly dont you ever breathe a word around about your papa not having money girl i said i wouldnt in the first place it would be silly and a lie and then it would make papa awfully mad hes got all kinds of money i said and mama i just ggot to i started crying again right out of a clear blue sky without any warning i cant stand it any longer i said im getting so scared and could you get some money from him mama make him give you enough for me and bobbie to i didnt finish the question it was too foolish i wouldnt even have started to ask it if i hadnt been halfscared to death i dont know why he has to be so hateful i said if he wants to to why doesnt he do something to that dirty old luane devore shes the one thats causing all the trouble there there girl mama mumbled no use in getting yourself well why doesnt he i said why doesnt he do something to her he wouldnt see no call to mama said as long as it was the truth why papa wouldnt she frowned her voice trailing off into silence i spoke to her a couple times saying that it wasnt fair and that i just couldnt go on any longer but she didnt say anything back to me finally when i was about ready to yell i was getting so nervous she sighed and shook her head i i guess not girl i thought i had a notion about some place i might get some money for you but i guess i cant but maybe i could i said bobbie and me who you keep out of it mama said sharply you couldnt get it even if it could be got i thought for a moment i might get it part of it anyway because im your papas wife but but i could try i said please mama just tell me who it is and i told you you couldnt get it mama said and trying wouldnt get you anything but trouble this party would tell papa about it and you know what would happen then well i hesitated i guess youre probably right mama if you couldnt get it why i dont see how i could is it an old debt someone owes papa mama said it was kind of a debt it was and it wasnt and there was no way that the party could be forced to pay it for one thing she added the partys got no money to pay with that i know of papa thinks different i kind of got the notion he does from some things hes let slip but you know him someone says something is white why hell say its black just to be contrary i just cant imagine i said i just cant see papa letting someone get away without paying him what they owe i told you mama said they this party dont really owe it i mean they do and they ought to pay but tell me who it is mama i said please please mama i ive got to do something i ccant be any worse off than i am now if you wont see the party do anything to help me at least i cant girl mama bit her lip you know i would if cant what i said you cant help me or you cant let me help myself i i just she pushed herself to her feet started loading dishes back onto the tray ill tell you how you can help yourself she said looking hurt and sullen you can just stay away from that bobbie ashton until hes ready to marry you i started crying again burying my face in my hands i said what good would that do for heavens sake bobbie might get mad or interested in someone else anyway even if i did stop seeing him it wouldnt change anything when papa found out about us you kknow im right mama i sobbed hhed still hell kill us mama hhes going to kill me and and ive got no one to turn to you wont hhelp me aand you wwont let me do anything all you can do is just fuss around and mumble aand ask mme if i want something to eat aand the dishes rattled on the tray one of the cups toppled over into its saucer then i heard her turn and shuffle toward the door all right girl she said dully ill do it tonight mmama i took my hands away from my face you know i didnt mean what i said mama its all right mama said you didnt say anything that wasnt true but i didnt youll do what mama ill see that party tonight it wont do no good im pretty sure but ill do it she went on out of the room and down the stairs i sat forward on the bed studying myself in the dresser mirror i certainly looked a fright my eyes were all red and my face blotched and my nose swollen up like a sweet potato i hadnt put up my hair last night either and now what with the heat and my nervous sweating it was as limp and drablooking as a dishrag i went to the bathroom soaked my face in cold water and dabbed it with astringent then i took a nice long lukewarm bath putting up my hair as i sat in the tub i tried to tell myself that i hadnt said anything out of the way to mama that shed certainly never done much of anything else for me and that it was no more than right that she should do this i told myself that those things and i guess there was a lot of truth to it but still i began to feel awful bad awful ashamed of myself shed always done as much for me as she could i guessed it wasnt her fault that papa had just about taken everything out of her that she had to do with there was last spring for example when i graduated from high school shed gone way out on a limb to help me then to try to help me i should say id told her that she simply couldnt let papa come to the graduation exercises id simply die if he did i told her because none of the other kids had any use for me now and if he came it would be ten times worse you know how itll be mama i said kind of crying and storming he wont be dressed right and hell go around snorting and sneering and being sarcastic to the other parents and and just acting as awful as he knows how i just wont go if he goes mama id be so embarrassed id sink right through the floor well mama mumbled and massaged her hands together and looked bewildered she said it really wasnt right for me to feel that way about papa and maybe she could drop him a few hints so that hed look nice and behave himself i dont hardly know what else i can do she said he means to go and i dont see how i told you how mama i said you can pretend like youre sick and you dont want to be left alone you can do it just as well as not and you know it mama mumbled and massaged her hands some more she said she guessed she could do what i was asking but shed sure hate to hed be awfully disappointed girl hed try to cover it up but he would be i just bet he would i said naturally hed be disappointed missing a chance to make me feel nervous and cheap i just cant stand it if he goes mama but it means so much to him girl mama said you see he hardly had any education himself not even as much as i did now to have his own daughter graduating from high school why oh pooh i said i wont go if he goes mama ill run away from home ill ill kkill myself ill i really ranted and raved on id been feeling awfully upset and nervous anyway because id just started going with bobbie ashton at the time and he wasnt nice to me like he is now and but never mind that that was a long time ago and i dont like to think it ever even happened anyway to get back to the subject i kept insisting that papa just couldnt go to the graduation exercises i ranted and raved and cried until finally mama gave in she agreed to play sick and keep papa at home she was upstairs in bed that evening when he came in i was out in the kitchen getting dinner ready i heard him come through the living room and dining room i could feel those eyes of his boring into the back of my neck as he stood in the kitchen doorway he didnt say anything just stood there staring at me i dropped a spoon to the floor i was so nervous and scared and when i picked it up i had to turn away from the stove facing him i really didnt recognize him for a second actually i really didnt hed changed clothes down at the pavilion and the way he was dressed now well i just didnt think he could be id never seen him look like this before and i never did again he was wearing a brand new blue suit a real stylish one he had on a new hat too a gray homburg and new black dress shoes the first hed ever worn i guess and a new white shirt and a tie that matched his suit he looked so smart and kind of distinguished that i actually didnt know him for a second i was so surprised that i almost forgot to be scared wwhy why papa i stammered why where he grinned looking embarrassed stopped by a rummage sale he said gruffly picked this up while i was there too he pushed a little package at me i fumbled it open and there was a velvet box inside and inside the box was a wristwatch a platinum wristwatch with diamonds in it i stared at it i told him thank you i guess but if id had the nerve idve told him something else i might have even thrown the watch at him you see id been hinting for a watch for months hinting as much as a person dares to with papa and all hed ever do was just laugh or grunt and laugh at me hed say things like well what the hell do you want a watch for or what you need is a good alarm clock or them damned wristwatches aint nothing but junk thats the way he talked acted and all the time he was planning to buy me a watch all the time he was planning on buying these new clothes dressing himself up so people would hardly know him heres something else he said tossing a glassinetopped box on the table a box with an orchid in it stole it out at the graveyard i said thank you again i guess i was so mixed up mad and not mad kind of ashamed and nervous and scared that i dont know what i said or whether i actually said anything really wheres your mother he said didnt throw herself out with the trash did she sshes upstairs i said sheshes lying lyin about what he laughed broke off suddenly whats the matter spit it out she aint sick is she i nodded said yes that she was sick id been working myself up to saying it all day and now it just popped out before i could stop it anyway what else could i have said mama wouldnt know that i didnt want her to play sick now that id just as soon she didnt if i tried to change our story it might get her into trouble with papa get us both in trouble well naturally i looked awfully pale and draggedout and of course he thought i looked that way on account of mama he cursed turning a little pale himself whats the matter with her he said whend she take sick why didnt you call me whatd the doc say about her nnothing i stammered i i ddont think shes very sick papa think he said you mean you aint called the doctor your mothers sick in bed and for gods sake he ran to the hall telephone and called doctor ashton told him to get over to the house as fast as he could then he started upstairs hurrying but kind of dragging his feet too the doctor arrived papa came back downstairs and out into the kitchen where i was he paced back and forth nervously cursing and grumbling and asking questions goddammit he said you ought to have called me you ought tove called the doctor right away i dont know why the hell you ppapa i said i ddont think i mean im sure shes not very sick how the hell would you know he cursed again then he said what the hell does she have to go and get sick for she aint had a sick day in twenty years so why does she got to do it now papa she better cut it out by god he said she gets sick on me ill put her in a hospital make her stay there until i say she can leave get some real doctors to look after her and yeah dammit if you got something to say say it i tried to say it to tell him the truth but i didnt get very far he broke in cursing when i said mama wasnt really sick then he stopped scolding and cursing and said well maybe i was right sure she wasnt really sick probably just overet he said probably just been workin too hard thats about the size of it dont you think so myra couldnt be nothin serious could it no papa i said ppapa i keep trying to tell you why sure sure he said were youre getting all upset over nothing you just calm down now and everything will be fine theres not a thing in the world to worry about doc will get mama up on her feet and well all go to the graduation together and now cut out that goddamn bawling will you you sound like a calf in a hailstorm ppapa i sobbed oh papa i jjust feel so bad that well you just cut it out he said because there aint a damned lick of sense to it mamas going to be just dandy and an doctor ashton was coming down the stairs papa kind of swallowed and then went out to the foot of the staircase to meet him how how is she doc i heard him say is she your wife doctor ashton said is in excellent physical condition for a woman her age she is as healthy as the proverbial horse papa let out a grunt i could almost see his eyes clouding over like they do when hes angry what the hell you talkin about anyway what kind of a doctor are you my wifes your wife is not sick she has not been sick said doctor ashton and ooh did he sound mean he had everything pretty well figured out i guess and the way he dislikes papa it tickled him to death thats a very hand some outfit youre wearing pavlov i take it that you planned on attending the graduation exercises tonight well sure naturally papa said now what do you mean it must have come as quite a surprise to your family the screen door opened and doctor ashton stepped out on the porch yes quite a surprise the apparel that is not your plans for attending the exercises papa said now listen goddammit what then he said oh just the one word slowly dully yes the doctor said well theres no reason at all why you cant attend pavlov none at all that is of course if you still want to he laughed softly he went on out to his car and drove away and minutes latei it seemed like i could still hear that laugh of his i waited in the kitchen stood right where i had been standing not moving except for the trembling hardly even breathing and papa stayed out in the hallway not moving either it seemed just standing and waiting like i was standing and waiting i was sure he was just working up to an explosion putting all the mean ugly things together in his mind so he could cloud up and rain all over me and mama that was what he was going to do i was sure because hed done the same thing before made us wait you know wait and wait knowing that he was going to do something and getting so jumpy we were about to fall apart and then suddenly cutting loose on us i wished that hed cut loose now and get it over with i wished hed just do it you know not because it was so hard to go on waiting but because it would kind of even things up and maybe hed stop feeling the way he must be feeling now it sounds funny or no i guess it doesnt but id never really cared about how he felt before i mean id never actually thought about his having any feelings about being able to hurt his feelings because youd never have thought it from the way hed always acted hed always gone out of his way to show that he didnt care how anyone felt about him or acted toward him so maybe mama is right she was an awfully pretty girl back when she married papa and papa was kind of short and stocky like he is now and about as homely as a mud fence so since she never could express herself very well and shes always been so kind of frozenfaced and shy just embarrassed all to pieces just by the mention of love or anything like that why maybe papa did think she married him just to get away from the orphanage and maybe thats the reason partly the reason anyway oh i dont know and the way things are now i couldnt care less because he certainly doesnt care anything about me even if he might have at one time how could he a father that would actually kill his own daughter if he found out a certain thing about her bobbie says i have things all wrong papa would do it because he cares so much but that just doesnt make any sense does it and as sweet and smart as bobbie is he can say some awfully foolish things well anyway getting back to that night papa didnt do what i expected him to he started for the kitchen once but he stopped after a step or two then he took a couple of steps toward the stairs and stopped again finally he went to the screen door and pushed it open paused with one foot inside the house and the other on the porch got to go back to the office he called wont want any supper wont be able to go to the graduation you and mama have a good you two watch out for the squirrels i called ppapa wait but the screen door slammed drowning out the words by the time i got to the door he was a block up the street he never wore those clothes again i saw goofy gannder in the homburg one day so i guess papa probably gave him the whole outfit and goofy traded the other things for booze well as i was saying mama really had tried to help me that one time at least and it wasnt fair to say that she hadnt also as i was about to say it wasnt very nice of me to get her to try anything again shed have to face papa afterwards hed take out on her what he couldnt take out on me and an old woman like that she was fortysix her last birthday she just wouldnt be able to take it aside from that it probably wouldnt do any good i mean she probably wouldnt get away with whatever she was thinking about doing shed be so scared and unsure of herself that shed make a botch of it get herself into a lot of trouble without making me any better off than i was now so so i finished putting up my hair and went back to my bedroom i put on a robe went downstairs and told mama i was sorry about the way i talked to her she didnt answer me just turned away looking hurt sullenhurt i put my arms around her and kissed her and tried to pet her a little that got her all redfaced and embarrassed and kind of broke the ice its all right girl she said i dont blame you for being upset and ill do what i said i would no mama i said i dont want you to honestly i dont after all you said you were sure it wouldnt do any good so why take chances for nothing well im pretty sure that it wouldnt that i couldnt get any money from this party but she paused relieved that i was letting her off but a little suspicious along with it look girl youre not planning on on on what i laughed now what in the world could i do mama hold up a bank actually i wasnt planning on doing anything the idea didnt come to me until later when i went back upstairs it seems kind of funny that i hadnt thought of it before under the circumstances i mean but i guess it actually really wasnt so strange i just hadnt been desperate enough until now so you just forget all about it mama i said dont do anything tonight anyway if something else doesnt turn up in a few days why but ill have to do it tonight girl have to if im goin to at all why do you i said if its waited all these years why cant it wait a little longer because it cant this partys telephone will will she broke off abruptly turning to stir something on the stove my heavens girl i get to jabbering with you and ill burn up everything in the house what about the telephone mama i said what were you going to say nothing how do i know anyway mama said lord what a day im getting so rattled i dont know what im saying i laughed and said i wouldnt worry again i told her i really didnt want her to see the party shed mentioned that id really be very angry if she did and she nodded and mumbled so that took care of that i went back up to my room i took off my robe put on some fresh underthings and stretched out on the bed it was nice and cool id left the bedroom door open and the draft sucked the alfalfasmelling breeze through the window i closed my eyes really relaxing for about the first time all day my mind seemed to go completely empty for a moment just cleared out of everything and then all sorts of things images began to drift through it mama papa bobbie the pavilion me me going into the pavilion unlocking the ticket booth going into daddys office and opening the safe taking out the change box and my eyes popped open and i sat up suddenly then i remembered that this was monday that there wouldnt be any dance tonight so i wouldnt have to work i sighed and started to lay back down again i sat back up slowly feeling my eyes get wider and wider feeling my stomach sort of squeeze together inside then gradually unsqueeze i got my purse off the dresser i took out my key ring stared at it for a moment and dropped it back in the purse it was almost four oclock i undid my hair even though it had only been up a little while and then i began to dress mama came upstairs while i was putting my face on she started to go on by to her own room but she saw me dressed and fixing my face so she turned back and came in she asked me where in the world i thought i was going at this time of day oh i thought id meet bobbie in town tonight i said i think it might be better than having him come here to the house if people are doing any talking but it aint tonight yet mama said you havent even had your supper yet what i dont want any supper mama i said heavens i just got through stuffing myself just a little while ago didnt i anyway the real reason i want to leave early is so i wont have to see papa i just cant face him again so soon after the way he acted at lunch mama started getting nervous she said papa would be sure to wonder about my being away at supper time and what was she going to tell him i turned around from the mirror looking pretty exasperated i guess because i certainly felt that way why for heavens sake just tell him the truth mama i said i mean tell him i ate late and i didnt want any supper dinner so i just went on into town ill just walk around or drink a malted or something until its time to meet bobbie good grief theres nothing wrong with that is there cant i even go down town without explaining and arguing and arguing and explaining until what you getting so excited about girl mama looked at me suspiciously you up to something i drew in my breath real deep giving her a good hard stare and then i turned back to the mirror again look girl mama mumbled apologetically im just worried about you if youve got some notion of well i dont know what you might be thinking about doing but mama i said im going to get awfully mad in a minute but girl you just cant all right mama i said all right ive argued and explained just as much as im going to and now im not going to say another word not another word mama i told you why i was leaving early i told you i couldnt bear to face papa tonight and i cant i simply cant mama and theres no reason why i should and i havent the slightest intention of making the slightest effort to do so and and im not going to say another word about it and i dont want to hear another word about it she twitched and rubbed her hands together ill bet they wouldnt be so red and bigveined if she wasnt always rubbing them together she started to argue again but i told her id cry if she did so that stopped her right at the start well she mumbled youre going to drink a cup of coffee first anyway im not going to let you leave this house without at least something hot on your stomach oh mama i sighed well hurry up and get it if youre going to i cant drink it after i put my lipstick on she hurried downstairs and brought me up some coffee i drank it and started fixing my mouth she watched me twitching and massaging her hands i caught her eye in the mirror gave her a good hard look believe me and she shifted her eyes quickly she didnt look at me again until i was all through well i said i guess id better run along now if i want to miss papa all right girl she got up from the bed where shed been sitting take care of yourself now and dont stay out too late she started to kiss me goodbye and that was kind of funny you know because she doesnt go in much for kissing i pretended i didnt know what she meant to do turning my head so as not to get my face smeared after all i didnt have time to fix it again did i and if she wanted to kiss someone why did she have to wait until they were in a hurry and all ready to go somewhere girl she said nervously i dont want you getting upset again but promise me girl promise you wont now mama i have promised i said ive told you and told you and im not going to tell you again now will you please stop harping on the subject you dont have to do anything girl ill go ill think of something somethings bound to turn up well all right i said all right for heavens sake and i snatched up my purse and left she called after me but i kept right on going down the stairs and out the door then as i was going out the gate she called to me again waved to me from the bedroom window so well i gave her a smile and waved back i honestly wasnt mad you know and naturally i didnt mean to do anything that would make her feel bad it was just that i had so much on my mind that i simply couldnt stand any more it was a little after five when i got downtown about fivefifteen i wanted papa to get clear home before i went to his office so that meant i had almost fortyfive minutes to kill well thirtyfive minutes anyway figuring that it would take ten minutes to walk down to the pavilion i sauntered around the courthouse square a couple of times looking in the store windows i stopped in front of the jewelry store pretending like i was interested in the jewelry display but actually looking at myself in the big panelmirrors behind it i thought i looked pretty good tonight considering all id been through i honestly looked especially good in spite of everything i had on a white cashmere sweater id bought two weeks before i guessed it wasnt rushing the season too much to wear it i had on a new blue flannel skirt and extrasheer stockings and my practically new handmade suede shoes i studied myself in the mirror thinking that whatever else you could say about him you certainly couldnt say he was stingy mama and i could buy just about anything we wanted to and hed never say a word all he ever insisted on was that we pay cash mama always kept a hundred dollars cash on hand as far back as i could remember she did whenever she or i bought anything why shed tell him and hed give her enough to bring her back up to a hundred dollars actually she or i should say i hadnt spent much until this summer i was actually scared to death of going in a store afraid you know that the clerks might be laughing at me or talking about me behind my back and mama was even worse than i was we never bought anything until we just had to when we couldnt put it off any longer wed just take the first thing that was showed to us and practically run out of the place papa just talked awful about us i never will forget some of the mean things he said he said hed rent mama out as a scarecrow if it wouldntve been so hard on the crows and he said i looked like a leaky sack of bran that was about to fall over well he certainly hasnt had any cause to talk that way since i started going with bobbie not about me anyhow i simply couldnt look dowdy around bobbie so i just made myself shop like a person should and after id done it a few times i didnt mind it at all i mean i actually really liked it and i really did do some shopping from then on nowadays i hardly ever go into town without buying something why not anyway papa has plenty of money if he cant treat me decent why at least he can let me look decent i glanced at my wristwatch saw that it was getting close to six i started for the pavilion walking fast wondering how much money thered be in his strongbox i never touched the strongbox ordinarily i had no reason to in my ticketselling job so i didnt know how much was in it but i knew thered be a lot papa didnt do any business with the banks that he didnt absolutely have to hed always paid cash on the barrelhead as he says for practically everything and when you have as many interests as papa that takes a lot of cash of course the dance business had fallen off quite a bit and some of his other things werent doing so well but goodness what of it look at all the property he owned look at all the money hed made when business was good papa could lose money for years and hed still be rich everyone in town said so maybe there wouldnt be as much in the strongbox as there used to be but thered still be plenty two or three thousand dollars at least i was about a half block from the pavilion when i saw ralph devore come out of the rear exit and climb up into the airconditioner shed i stopped dead in my tracks i thought oh golly how could i have forgot about him why does he have to be working all the time i was actually sick for a moment i was so disappointed then i just tossed my head and kept right on going because it suddenly dawned on me that it didnt make a bit of difference whether ralph was there or not even if he saw me which wasnt likely it wouldnt matter ralph wouldnt think anything of my going into papas office after all i was the owners daughter and it just wouldnt occur to him to try to stop me or ask me what i was doing of course hed talk later when papa missed the money but i didnt care about that bobbie and i would be gone by that time and wed never come back i went through the door of the pavilion i started across the floor my knees just a little shaky ralph was pounding on something back in the airconditioner shed hammering on something the noise came out through the ballroom airvents thudbang thudbang and i kind of walked marched in time to it my feet began to drag that crazy pounding it was just awful it made me feel like i was in a funeral procession or something and it kept right on going on after it wasnt going on i mean i realized suddenly that ralph wasnt pounding any more and all that noise was coming from my heart i took a deep breath i told myself to stop acting so silly because there just wasnt any sense to it bobbie and i would be a long way from here in another hour papa would know id taken his money i wanted him to know it but he wouldnt be able to catch up with us himself and hed never call on the police hed have too much pride to let anyone know that his own daughter had stolen from him i was at the door of his office i opened my purse and took out my keys fumbled through them until i found the right one i unlocked the door i stepped inside closed it behind me and flicked on the light and screamed because papa was there he was sitting at his desk his face buried in his arms there was a halffull bottle of whiskey in front of him he sat up with a start when i screamed he jumped up cursing asking me what the hell was the idea and so on and then when i just stood staring at him my mouth hanging open he slowly sat down again and stared at me ralph came running across the ballroom floor he stopped in the doorway of the office and asked if something was wrong papa didnt say anything even look at him ralph said oh uh excuse me and went away again papa and i went on staring at each other he didnt need to ask why i was here he knew idve bet a million dollars that he did hed been scheming and planning all along figuring out ways to get me so scared and desperate that id finally try this and then when i did try when hed let me get my hopes all up thinking that id found a way out oh he knew all right hed planned it this way what else would he be doing there if he hadnt why hadnt he gone on home to supper like he always did i backed toward the door i thought oh how i hate you how i hate you i hate you so much that that i hate you hate you hate you papa nodded figured you probably did he said well you got a lot of company i turned and ran it didnt occur to me until later that i must have said what i was thinking that id actually yelled it at him pete pavlov id gotten the letter from doc ashton the week before i didnt answer it so that monday he phoned me i told him to go to hell and hung up only thing to do as i saw it and wrong or right a mans got to go by what he sees hes got a chance that way its a lot handier for him any time a butt needs kicking he knows whose it is i punched out a few letters on my old threerow typewriter i carried them down to the postoffice thinking that they didnt make typewriters like they used to thinking that they didnt make nothing like they used to from bread to chewing tobacco then kind of snorting to myself and thinking well by god look whos talking maybe they dont make nothing like they used to because theres no one to do the making nothing but a lot of whining old guys with weepbags in place of guts i guessed i must be slipping if id been like this back at the time i built the postoffice building well maybe it wouldve been a hell of a lot better i thought i wouldnt be in the spot im in now and thered be quite a few less bastards around town to give me trouble yeah the postoffice job was mine built it under contract for old commodore stuyvesant luane devores father its still the biggest building in town four stories and it was a pretty fancy one for those days the upper three floors were offices each with its own toilet and lavatory all the plumbing the water and drain pipes was concealed well we were about through with the job except for the interior decorating when i discovered a hell of a thing ill never forget the day that it happened i was up on the fourth floor at the time id taken the chaw out of my mouth and tossed it in the toilet then id flushed it down and drawn myself a drink from the lavatory and i was just about to toss it down when i noticed something in the water a few little brown specks so tiny you could hardly see them i cussed and dumped out the water i got myself a can of stain and went through the building from top to bottom flushing toilets and turning on faucets they all turned out the same as the first they were all crossconnected to use the plumbing term you had to be looking for the stain in the water and looking damned hard but it was there some of the waste water was coming out through the lavatory taps you see well you know what the inside of a toilet bowl looks like it has a water inlet built into it it has to have to flush and it also has a sewage outlet it has the two right together flowing together if the plumbing aint exactly right some of the sewage can get into the water inlet into the water you drink and wash with well the first thing i did was to cut off the water at the main shut off every drop in the building i told the workmen theyd been screwing around too much on the job that they could do their washing and drinking on their own time from now on and they didnt exactly love me for that naturally but it was the way it had to be i couldnt tell them the truth if i had it would have got all over town people would always have been leery of the building you could fix the trouble and take an oath on it but theyd never really believe that you had i spent the rest of the day checking the blueprints on the job tracing out the miles of piping foot by foot finally i spotted what was wrong it was in the blueprints the drawings themselves not something that was my fault i took the drawings and went to see the commodore luane was right in the living room with him and they sure were two damned sick people i told em i didnt see what they had to feel bad about its the architects fault i said youve got something pretty new here in this concealed plumbing but you aint got a newstyle building to put it in the architects should have known that with all this angling and turning the water pipes were just about bound to get a vacuum in em yeah commodore i said he said kind of deadvoiced that the architects arent responsible the blueprints were drawn up from a rough design i made myself i insisted on having my own way despite their objections and theyve got a waiver in writing i asked him why the hell hed done it why pay for expert advice and then not listen to it he grimaced almost crying i thought they were trying to run up their bill on me pete he said the architect gets six percent of the cost of a job you know and since im not exactly a trusting person he broke off grimacing again not that ive had much reason to trust people offhand id say that you were the only completely honest man ive ever met pete well well thanks commodore i said i have you told anyone about this difficulty pete none of the workmen know well do you suppose that if it wasnt corrected uh do you suppose the result might be uh very serious i dont know i said maybe some of the tenants wouldnt be hurt at all maybe it might be quite a while before the others came down with anything i dont know how many might get sick or how many might die but theres one thing i do know commodore i know i aint drinking no sewer water myself and i aint letting anyone else do it so i broke off he was looking so shocked and hurt that i apologized for what i said yeah by god i apologized to him quite all right pete he said your concern for the public welfare is wholly commendable now getting back to our problem just what if anything can be done about it i told him the whole building would have to be repiped of course we could use the same piping but it would have to come out of the walls and be put on the outside what it actually added up to was ripping out the interior of the building and doing it over again i see he bit his lip what about your men pete how will you explain to them well i shrugged ill tell em i pulled a boner and im making good on it that wont hurt me none and theyll be glad to believe it i see he said again pete pete i have no right to ask it but everything i have is tied up in that building everything ive exhausted my credit if i attempt to get any more the building will be plastered with liens from basement to roof once its finished ill be in fine shape the government will lease the ground floor and i have tenants signed up for most of the offices but i cant finish it pete unless and i have no right at all to ask you luane was sniffling he put his arm around her looking at me apologetically and after a moment she turned and put her arms around him it seemed pretty pitiful you know i took out my notebook and did some figuring i didnt have hardly any ready cash myself but my credit was firstclass by stretching it right to the limit i could finance the rework that had to be done which would probably tot up to about eight thousand dollars well the commodore practically wrung my hand off when i told him id do it and i thought for a minute that luane was going to kiss me then the commodore gave me his note for ten thousand ten thousand instead of eight because id literally saved his and luanes lives he said and even with the two thousand bonus theyd still be eternally in my debt well i guess i probably dont need to tell you the rest of it but ill do it anyway just in case youre as dumb as i was the commodore denied that he owed me a red cent for the rework he said it was due to my own errors as id publicly stated and that he was contemplating suit against me for failing to follow the architects specifications naturally id hate to do it he said smoothly sort of smiling down his nose i imagine you have quite enough problems as it is i told him that wasnt the only thing i had i had his note for ten thousand and id collect every penny of it he shook his head chuckling im afraid not pavlov you see i have no assets ive transferred everything i owned to my daughter luane luane didnt seem too happy about the deal i looked at her and she dropped her eyes and then she turned suddenly to the commodore lets not do this father she said i know you mean it for my benefit but yes the commodore nodded so the choice is yours my feeling is that a woman untrained for any work an unemployable unmarriageable spinster to state the case succinctly is going to need every dollar she can get but if you feel differently he spread his hands giving her that downthenose smile luane got up and left the room i left too and i never went back because what the hell was the use i couldnt get anything from her he didnt have anything to get he even had me staved off on giving him a beating him being as old as he was so that was that that was how i made out dealing with an oldschool gentleman and a true aristocrat and the towns first citizen and so on it took me five years working night and day to get out of debt ralph was sweeping up the dance floor when i got back to the pavilion i kidded around with him a few minutes and then i went for a walk down the beach it was a good walk sort of looking at all the things id built and knowing that no one had ever built better in another way it wasnt so good the looking gave me a royal pain because i could have collected just as much on cheaper buildings and if id built cheaper i wouldnt have been in the spot i was in i wondered what the hell id been thinking about to sink so much dough into seasonal structures i guessed i hadnt been thinking at all id just done it automatically building in the only way i knew how to build i ran into macs singer danny lee on the beach she was in a bathing suit sunning herself and i sat down by her and talked a while but not as long as i wanted to it couldnt do me any good you know not just chatting about things in general and i was afraid if i hung around very long i might do more than that because that little girl she was the kind that comes few and far between she was my kind of woman that danny if she went for you shed go all the way shed kill for you even if she knew it might get her killed you could see it in her anyways i could see it and it was all wrapped up in such a pretty package well though maybe she was my kind of woman but i wasnt her kind of man she wouldnt have wanted no part of an old potbellied bastard like me even if she hadnt had ralph devore on the string so i shoved off before i said or did something to make a damned fool of myself i circled back toward the pavilion rags called to me from his cottage so i went in and had coffee with him he asked me how the money situation was with me and i said that it was just about like it had been he said he was in just about the worst shape hed ever been in himself dont know what the hell im going to do pete i wont have no band after we close here and i dont feel like going out single any more i would if there was a decent living in it but its hard to break even with me on the road and janie and the boys in new york yeah i said looking down at the floor feeling kind of awkward like i always did when he mentioned those boys yeah uh i mean what about recordings rags cant you get some of them to do he snorted and let out a string of cuss words he said he wasnt making any more recordings until he was allowed to do the job right which would be just about never unless he owned his own record company i wished you did i said if i was in a little bit better shape id yeah yeah he cut me off forget it pete its really the only damned thing i want to do but i know its impossible he drained the coffee from his cup and filled it up with whiskey he took a sip smacked his lips and shuddered after a minute or two he asked me what i thought about the setup between danny and ralph devore i mean what can come of it pete how do you think it will wind up i shrugged i said i guessed i hadnt done much thinking about it ive been wondering he frowned it looks like the real thing between em but that pair ralph in particular well they aint just a couple of lovesick kids they wouldnt go way out on a limb unless they saw some way off of it no i said i dont figure they would i wonder he said ive been thinking yknow when i first introduced them i told her he was a rich man and lately ive been thinking wouldnt it be a hell of a joke if yeah nothing what the hell he laughed just a crazy notion i had well i guess i better be going i said getting to be about my lunch time i headed back into town and across to the far side i started to pass by the neighborhood church and then i slowed down and went back a few steps i stopped in front of the vacant lot between the church and the parsonage i stood there and stared at it making myself look thoughtful and interested finally i took a rule out of my pocket and did a little measuring the curtain moved at one of the parsonage windows i took out a notebook and jotted a few figures into it pretended to make some calculations ive had a lot of sport with that vacant lot once i made out like id found some marijuana growing on it and another time i pretended i was going to buy it for a shooting gallery what with one stunt and another ive kept the preacher of that church worried for years i knew he was peeking through the curtains at me now watching and wondering and working up to another worryspell he came out of the parsonage finally he didnt want to but he just couldnt help it i went on with my measuring and figuring acting like i didnt see him he hesitated in the yard and then he came over to the corner of the fence yes he said yes mr pavlov yes i said yes sir i think this will do just fine fine he looked at me watereyed his lips starting to tremble mr pavlov what what do you want of me im an old man and remember when you wasnt i said remember real well but talking about this lot here i was just wondering if it wouldnt be a good spot for a laundry thought maybe you could throw some business my way he knew what i was driving at all right no wonder either after all these years he looked at me his eyes watering his mouth opening and closing and i told him what i had in mind was the bedsheet business tell you what ill do i said you tip off your pals to send their sheets to me and any patching they need like buckshot holes you know ill do it for nothing probably no more than fair anyways since i maybe put em there mr ppavlov he said cant you ever guess you didnt need many seats in your church for a while did you i said guess most of the fellows didnt feel like settin down not much more like it maybe than some of the folks they visited with bullwhips i grinned and winked at him he stood leaning against the fence his mouth quivering his hands gripping and ungripping the pickets mr pavlov he said it that was such a long time ago mr pavlov dont seem long to me i said but me i got a long memory if you know how sorry i was how often ive begged gods forgiveness yeah i said well i guess i better be going i stand around here much longer i might lose my appetite my house was in the next block a big twostory job with plenty of yard space it was probably the bestbuilt house in town but it sure didnt look like much what it looked like was hell id been pretty busy at the time i finished it fifteen years ago had four or five contract jobs running jobs id taken money on figured i had to take care of them and do it right before i prettied up my own place so i did that and while i was doing it my neighbors hit me with a petition i tore it up and threw it at em they took me into court and i fought em to a standstill if theyd just left me alone stopped to consider that they didnt have no monopoly on wanting things nice but they just wouldnt do that they tried to make me do something no one makes me do anything the house has never been painted the yard has never been cleaned up its littered with odds and ends of lumber sawhorses leftover brick and so on theres a couple of old wheelbarrows almost rusted and rotted to bits and a big mixing trough caked with cement theres but i already said it it looks like hell it aint ever going to look any other way at least it aint going to look any better as long as im alive it was a couple of minutes after twelve when i went in so lunch was already on the table and myra and my wife gretchen were standing by their chairs waiting for me i said hello they mumbled and ducked their heads i said well lets sit and we all sat down i filled their plates and mine i took a couple bites it was beef and potato dumplings and then i mentioned the matter of doc ashton dug up a big building job for me over in atlantic center i said howd you feel about us all going there to live for four or five months gretchen didnt look up but i saw her eyes slant toward myra a kind of red flush spread over myras face and her hand shook as she raised her fork half way to her mouth the fork slipped out of her fingers landed with a clatter on her plate she and gretchen jumped i laughed dont worry i said we aint going i never had no notion of going just thought id tell you about it i took a big bite of grub staring at them while i chewed it myras face got redder and redder and then she jumped up suddenly and ran out of the room i laughed i didnt feel much like it but i did gretchen looked up at last why dont you leave her alone she said not mumbling or whining like she usually does aint you done enough taking all the spirit out of her beatin her down until she goes around like a whipped dog do you have to go on and on seeing how miserable huhuh i said thats something i aint going to do i sure aint going on and on what she hesitated what do you mean by that i shrugged after a moment or so she turned and left headed up the stairs toward myras room i finished eating wiping my plate clean with a piece of bread afterwards i dug my teeth a little with a toothpick and after that i took a big chaw of tobacco i looked at my watch then saw that it was two minutes to one oclock i went on looking until the hands pointed to one sharp then i got my hat off the hallrack and started back toward town i did everything just like always you know seemed like i hadnt ought to but id never had but one way of doing things and i stuck to it now right or wrong it was my way and to me it seemed right take the spirit out of em why hell i tried to put spirit into em i gave em something to be proud of something to hold their heads high about i built something out of nothing just my head and my two bare hands and i never bent my back to no man while i was doing it i never let no one take the spirit out of me and believe me there was plenty of them that tried why those two gretchen and myra if theyd taken just half of what i took i got back to my office i finished my chaw and took a big drink of whiskey and i kind of laughed to myself and thought well hell what you got to show for it all pieter pavlovski a wife gretchens a wife a daughter myra that sheepeyed slut is your daughter well what then besides the buildings aside from your buildings because them buildings aint yours no more youve held onto them as long as you can and i took another big drink i tried to laugh again because it was a hell of a joke on me you know but i just wasnt up to laughing not when it was about losing this pavilion and the hotels and the restaurants and the cottages and and everything i had all the things that took the place of what i didnt have i couldnt hardly think about it let alone laugh i took the gun out of my desk i checked it over and put it back in the drawer again i thought her fault his fault theirs mine the whole goddamned worlds what the hells the difference its a bad job its got your name on it so theres just one thing to do about it it was about ninethirty when bobbie ashton showed up at my office id been drinking quite a bit and it gave me a pretty bad jar when i looked up and saw him in the doorway i didnt cuss him out though just grunted a how are you bobbie and he smiled and sat down i said i thought him and myra were out on a date tonight we were he nodded i mean we still are i just drove by to see you for a minute yeah i said wasnt going to ask me if it was all right for you to go with her was you no he said i was going to ask if had you heard that mrs devore was dead well yeah i sat up a little in my chair ralph called and told me what about it anyway perhaps nothing he said on the other hand he took a long white envelope out of his pocket and laid it on my desk he stood up again smiling a cool funny little smile i want you to read that he said if it becomes necessary that is to protect an innocent person and you may interpret the word liberally i want you to use it use it what the hell is it i said why not use it yourself his smile widened he shook his head gently and then before i could say anything more he was gone i opened the envelope and began to read it was a confession written in his own handwriting to the murder of luane devore it told how hed figured out that ralph must have had a pile of money saved and how he needed a pile himself and it went on to say just how the murder had come about hed had a handkerchief tied over his face hed kept quiet not saying anything i mean so she couldnt recognize his voice hed slipped upstairs not intending to really hurt her just to give her a shove or maybe a sock sos he could grab the money and it wasnt his intention to steal it outright he was going to send it back anonymously as soon as he could but well everything went wrong and nothing worked out like hed planned luane was waiting for him at the head of the stairs she piled into him and he tried to fight her off and the next thing he knew she was lying at the foot of the stairs dead he forgot all about the money and beat it he was too scared to do anything else i finished reading the confession i glanced back over it again kind of marveling over it wondering how the thing could sound so true unless it was there was just one hole in it that i could see that part about him being scared if it was possible to scare that kid i didnt know how the hell it would be i took another drink i struck a match to the confession and tossed it into the spittoon because nothing had changed killing luane was one crime hed never be punished for and probably he knew it too that was why hed written the confession probably he knew he was going to die anyway so the confession couldnt hurt him and it might help someone else a lot i got my gun out and slid it into my hip pocket i turned off the lights and went out to my car it was no trouble finding them bobbie and myra just a matter of driving a while and then getting out and walking a while creeping along a winding trail all i had to do was think of where id go if i was in his place and the place idve gone to was the place hed taken her they were stretched out on a patch of sand in a little clearing and they were locked together i couldnt really see her just him and that made it pretty hard because him he was all i really cared about i didnt know how hed got to her or why i was afraid to even think about it for fear i might try to excuse him and it couldnt be that way i was pretty sure he wouldnt want it that way but it was damned hard just the same me and him we were so much alike we thought so much alike that was how hed been able to confess to a killing id done yeah i killed luane and have his facts almost completely straight i had planned on sticking luane up for the money i had worn a handkerchief over my face and i hadnt answered when she called downstairs so that she couldnt recognize my voice then right at the last minute i changed my mind i couldnt go through with the stunt id never pulled anything sneaky in my life and i couldnt do it now and by god there was no reason why i should she owed me money ten thousand dollars with almost twentyfive years interest i jerked the handkerchief down off my face and put the gun in my pocket and told her i was there to collect and dont tell me you aint got it i said when she started jabbering and squawking ninety to the minute ralphs made it and he aint spent it and he aint got it either youre keeping it to keep him if ralph had it hedve jumped town with that singer long ago i went on up the stairs walking slowly and keeping a sharp eye on her she begged and then she began yelling threats id never get away with it she yelled shed have me arrested i wouldnt get to keep the money and id go to prison besides maybe i said but i figure not everyone thinks i got plenty of money and even my worst enemy wouldnt never accuse me of stealing so i figure ill get away with it itll be as easy as it was for you and your pa to cheat me well i thought for a minute that she was going to give up because she stopped yelling and stood back against the wall as if to let me pass then just as i took the last step she screamed and lunged at me i flung my arm out trying to ward her off it caught her a sweeping blow and being off balance like she was she went down the stairs headfirst i went down and took a quick look at her i got out of there i didnt need money no more i kind of sighed i took the gun out of my pocket staring across to the patch of sand where bobbie and myra were i hesitated wondering if i ought to toss a rock at them give em a chance you know like you do when youre out hunting and you see a setting rabbit but they werent rabbits he wasnt anyway and if i didnt get them now id just have to do the job later and there wasnt going to be any later for me i wouldnt be roaming around after tonight so i raised the gun and took aim i waited a second two or three seconds he turned his head suddenly and kissed her and then right at that moment i started shooting i figure they died happy i blew the smoke out of my gun went back to my car and headed for town i drove to the courthouse and turned myself in for the three killings kossy was my lawyer at the trial but there wasnt nothing a lawyer could do for me there wasnt nothing idve let him do so now its all over or it damned soon will be and now that it is i kind of wonder i wonder if i really did kill luane devore she was a pretty tough old bag could be that the fall downstairs just knocked her out and someone else came along and finished the job could be that someone was hiding in the house right at the time i was there it would be just about a perfect murder you know they this party could do the killing and id take the blame for it anyone who knew me knew that i would who do i think did it that is if i didnt well i dont figure it was anyone you might ordinarily suspect the people who seemed to have the best motives the very fact that they had good reasons for wanting luane dead and that everyone knew it would be the thing that would keep them from killing her theyd be too afraid you know that the job might be pinned on them aside from that and maybe excepting danny lee all the prime suspects were too fond of living to commit murder theyd proved it over and over through the years proved it by the way they lived theyd give up their principles their good name everything they had just as long as they could go on living living any damned old way and people like that they aint going to take the risk of killing me now im not that way just in case you havent discovered it i have to live a certain way or id rather be dead which im just about to be putting it in a nutshell i never had but one thing to live for and if i thought i was going to lose that like i did lose it why i guess you see what im driving at whoever killed luane was a onereasonforliving person whoever killed luane was someone who didnt seem to have a motive who could do it with a good chance of never being suspected and theres only one person i can think of who fits that description she was smart and efficient but shed stuck to the same cheap dull job for years she was pretty as a picture and a damned nice girl to boot but shed never gotten married she stuck to her job and shed never gotten married for the same reason because she was in love with her boss she never showed it in any of the usual ways she never made any passes at him she wasnt that kind and she never stepped out with him there wasnt a thing she did that could cause gossip about her but hell it was plain as day how she felt it was clear to me anyway id seen the way she kowtowed to him and made over him and it kind of made me squirm id think now why the hell does she do it a gal that could have her pick of jobs and men and of course there couldnt be but one reason why she did it she must have known that he was nothing but a fatmouthed dunce she must have known he wasnt ever going to marry her that he was too selfcentered to marry anyone and that his sister probably wouldnt let him if he wanted to but that didnt change anything maybe women being like they are it might have made her love him all the more anyway she was crazy about him she had to be you know crazy enough to kill anyone who hurt him and someone was hurting him it was getting to the point where he might lose his job the only one he could hold and if he did theyd be separated and yeah thats right im talking about nellie otis the county attorneys secretary i figure that nellie killed luane if i didnt do it i guess i aint ever likely to know for sure and i dont know as i give a damn i was just wondering you know thinking and now that ive thought it through to hell with it end
