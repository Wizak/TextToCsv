theological essays and other papers vol contents secession from the church of scotland toilette of the hebrew lady milton charlemagne modern greece lord carlisle on pope secession from the church of scotland a great revolution has taken place in scotland a greater has been threatened nor is that danger even yet certainly gone by upon the accidents of such events as may arise for the next five years whether fitted or not fitted to revive discussions in which many of the nonseceders went in various degrees along with the seceders depends the final and in a strict sense the very awful question what is to be the fate of the scottish church lord aberdeens act is well qualified to tranquillize the agitations of that body and at an earlier stage if not intercepted by lord melbourne might have prevented them in part but lord aberdeen has no power to stifle a conflagration once thoroughly kindled that must depend in a great degree upon the favorable aspect of events yet in the rear meantime these great disturbances are not understood in england and chiefly from the differences between the two nations as to the language of their several churches and law courts the process of ordination and induction is totally different under the different ecclesiastical administrations of the two kingdoms and the church courts of scotland do not exist in england we write therefore with an express view to the better information of england proper and with this purpose we shall lead the discussion through four capital questions i what is it that has been done by the moving party ii how was it done by what agencies and influence iii what were the immediate results of these acts iv what are the remote results yet to be apprehended i first then what is it that has been done up to the month of may in the fathers and brothers of the kirk were in harmony as great as humanity can hope to see since may the church has been a fierce crater of volcanic agencies throwing out of her bosom onethird of her children and these children are no sooner born into their earthly atmosphere than they turn with unnatural passions to the destruction of their brethren what can be the grounds upon which an acharnement so deadly has arisen it will read to the ears of a stranger almost as an experiment upon his credulity if we tell the simple truth being incredible however it is not the less true and being monstrous it will yet be recorded in history that the scottish church has split into mortal feuds upon two points absolutely without interest to the nation first upon a demand for creating clergymen by a new process secondly upon a demand for papal latitude of jurisdiction even the order of succession in these things is not without meaning had the second demand stood first it would have seemed possible that the two demands might have grown up independently and so far conscientiously but according to the realities of the case this is not possible the second demand grew out of the first the interest of the seceders as locked up in their earliest requisition was that which prompted their second almost everybody was contented with the existing mode of creating the pastoral relation search through christendom lengthways and breadthways there was not a public usage an institution an economy which more profoundly slept in the sunshine of divine favor or of civil prosperity than the peculiar mode authorized and practised in scotland of appointing to every parish its several pastor here and there an ultrapresbyterian spirit might prompt a murmur against it but the wise and intelligent approved and those who had the appropriate that is the religious interest confessed that it was practically successful from whom then came the attempt to change why from those only who had an alien interest an indirect interest an interest of ambition in its subversion as matters stood in the spring of the patron of each benefice acting under the severest restraints restraints which if the church courts did their duty left no room or possibility for an unfit man to creep in nominated the incumbent in a spiritual sense the church had all power by refusing first of all to license unqualified persons secondly by refusing to admit out of these licensed persons such as might have become warped from the proper standard of pastoral fitness the church had a negative voice allpotential in the creation of clergymen the church could exclude whom she pleased but this contented her not simply to shut out was an ungracious office though mighty for the interests of orthodoxy through the land the children of this world who became the agitators of the church clamored for something more they desired for the church that she should become a lady patroness that she should give as well as take away that she should wield a sceptre courted for its bounties and not merely feared for its austerities yet how should this be accomplished openly to translate upon the church the present power of patrons that were too revolutionary that would have exposed its own object for the present therefore let this device prevail let the power nominally be transferred to congregations let this be done upon the plea that each congregation understands best what mode of ministrations tends to its own edification there lies the semblance of a christian plea the congregation it is said has become anxious for itself the church has become anxious for the congregation and then if the translation should be effected the church has already devised a means for appropriating the power which she has unsettled for she limits this power to the communicants at the sacramental table now in scotland though not in england the character of communicant is notoriously created or suspended by the clergyman of each parish so that by the briefest of circuits the church causes the power to revolve into her own hands that was the first change a change full of jacobinism and for which to be published was to be denounced it was necessary therefore to place this jacobin change upon a basis privileged from attack how should that be done the object was to create a new clerical power to shift the election of clergymen from the lay hands in which law and usage had lodged it and under a plausible mask of making the election popular circuitously to make it ecclesiastical yet if the existing patrons of church benefices should see themselves suddenly denuded of their rights and within a year or two should see these rights settling determinately into the hands of the clergy the fraud the fraudulent purpose and the fraudulent machinery would have stood out in gross proportions too palpably revealed in this dilemma the reverend agitators devised a second scheme it was a scheme bearing triple harvests for at one and the same time it furnished the motive which gave a constructive coherency and meaning to the original purpose it threw a solemn shadow over the rank worldliness of that purpose and it opened a diffusive tendency towards other purposes of the same nature as yet undeveloped the device was this in scotland as in england the total process by which a parish clergyman is created subdivides itself into several successive acts the initial act belongs to the patron of the benefice he must present that is he notifies the fact of his having conferred the benefice upon a b to a public body which officially takes cognizance of this act and that body is not the particular parish concerned but the presbytery of the district in which the parish is seated thus far the steps merely legal of the proceedings were too definite to be easily disturbed these steps are sustained by lord aberdeen as realities and even by the nonintrusionists were tolerated as formalities but at this point commence other steps not so rigorously defined by law or usage nor so absolutely within one uniform interpretation of their value in practice they had long sunk into forms but ancient forms easily lend themselves to a revivification by meanings and applications new or old under the galvanism of democratic forces the disturbers of the church passing by the act of presentation as an obstacle too formidable to be separately attacked on its own account made their stand upon one of the two acts which lie next in succession it is the regular routine that the presbytery having been warned of the patrons appointment and having received in technical language the presentee that is having formally recognised him in that character next appoint a day on which he is to preach before the congregation this sermon together with the prayers by which it is accompanied constitute the probationary act according to some views but according to the general theory simply the inaugural act by which the new pastor places himself officially before his future parishioners decorum and the sense of proportion seem to require that to every commencement of a very weighty relation imposing new duties there should be a corresponding and ceremonial entrance the new pastor until this public introduction could not be legitimately assumed for known to the parishioners and accordingly at this point it was viz subsequently to his authentic publication as we may call it that in the case of any grievous scandal known to the parish as outstanding against him arose the proper opportunity furnished by the church for lodging the accusation and for investigating it before the church court in default however of any grave objection to the presentee he was next summoned by the presbytery to what really was a probationary act at their bar viz an examination of his theological sufficiency but in this it could not be expected that he should fail because he must previously have satisfied the requisitions of the church in his original examination for a license to preach once dismissed with credit from this bar he was now beyond all further probation whatsoever in technical phrase he was entitled to admission such were the steps according to their orderly succession by which a man consummated the pastoral tie with any particular parish and all of these steps subsequent to the reception and inaugural preaching were now summarily characterized by the revolutionists as spiritual for the sake of sequestering them into their own hands as to the initiatory act of presentation that might be secular and to be dealt with by a secular law but the rest were acts which belonged not to a kingdom of this world these with a newborn scrupulosity never heard of until the revolution of clamored for new casuistries these said the agitators we cannot consent any longer to leave in their state of collapse as mere inert or ceremonial forms they must be revivified by all means let the patron present as heretofore but the acts of examination and admission together with the power of altogether refusing to enter upon either under a protest against the candidate from a clear majority of the parishioners these are acts falling within the spiritual jurisdiction of the church and these powers we must for the future see exercised according to spiritual views here then suddenly emerged a perfect ratification for their own previous revolutionary doctrine upon the creation of parish clergymen this new scruple was in relation to former scruples a perfect linchpin for locking their machinery into cohesion for vainly would they have sought to defeat the patrons right of presenting unless through this sudden pause and interdict imposed upon the latter acts in the process of induction under the pretext that these were acts competent only to a spiritual jurisdiction this plea by its tendency rounded and secured all that they had yet advanced in the way of claim but at the same time though indispensable negatively positively it stretched so much further than any necessity or interest inherent in their present innovations that not improbably they faltered and shrank back at first from the immeasurable field of consequences upon which it opened they would willingly have accepted less but unfortunately it sometimes happens that to gain as much as is needful in one direction you must take a great deal more than you wish for in another any principle which could carry them over the immediate difficulty would by a mere necessity carry them incalculably beyond it for if every act bearing in any one direction a spiritual aspect showing at any angle a relation to spiritual things is therefore to be held spiritual in a sense excluding the interference of the civil power there falls to the ground at once the whole fabric of civil authority in any independent form accordingly we are satisfied that the claim to a spiritual jurisdiction in collision with the claims of the state would not probably have offered itself to the ambition of the agitators otherwise than as a measure ancillary to their earlier pretension of appointing virtually all parish clergymen the one claim was found to be the integration or sine qua non complement of the other in order to sustain the power of appointment in their own courts it was necessary that they should defeat the patrons power and in order to defeat the patrons power ranging itself as sooner or later it would under the law of the land it was necessary that they should decline that struggle by attempting to take the question out of all secular jurisdictions whatever in this way grew up that twofold revolution which has been convulsing the scottish church since first the audacious attempt to disturb the settled mode of appointing the parish clergy through a silent robbery perpetrated on the crown and great landed aristocracy secondly and in prosecution of that primary purpose the far more frantic attempt to renew in a practical shape the old disputes so often agitating the forum of christendom as to the bounds of civil and spiritual power in our rehearsal of the stages through which the process of induction ordinarily travels we have purposely omitted one possible interlude or parenthesis in the series not as wishing to conceal it but for the very opposite reason it is right to withdraw from a representative account of any transaction such varieties of the routine as occur but seldom in this way they are more pointedly exposed now having made that explanation we go on to inform the southern reader that an old traditionary usage has prevailed in scotland but not systematically or uniformly of sending to the presentee through the presbytery what is designated a call subscribed by members of the parish congregation this call is simply an invitation to the office of their pastor it arose in the disorders of the seventeenth century but in practice it is generally admitted to have sunk into a mere formality throughout the eighteenth century and the very position which it holds in the succession of steps not usually coming forward until after the presentation has been notified supposing that it comes forward at all compels us to regard it in that light apparently it bears the same relation to the patrons act as the address of the two houses to the speech from the throne it is rather a courteous echo to the personal compliment involved in the presentation than capable of being regarded as any original act of invitation and yet in defiance of that notorious fact some people go so far as to assert that a call is not good unless where it is subscribed by a clear majority of the congregation this is amusing we have already explained that except as a liberal courtesy the very idea of a call destined to be inoperative is and must be moonshine yet between two moonshines some people it seems can tell which is the denser we have all heard of barmecide banquets where out of tureens filled to the brim with nothings the fortunate guest was helped to vast messes of air for a hungry guest to take this tantalization in good part was the sure way to win the esteem of the noble barmecide but the barmecide himself would hardly approve of a duel turning upon a comparison between two of his tureens question being which had been the fuller or of two nihilities which had been seasoned the more judiciously yet this in effect is the reasoning of those who say that a call signed by fiftyone persons out of a hundred is more valid than another signed only by twentysix or by nobody it being in the mean time fully understood that neither is valid in the least possible degree but if the call was a barmecide call there was another act open to the congregation which was not so for the english reader must now understand that over and above the passive and less invidious mode of discountenancing or forbearing to countenance a presentee by withdrawing from the direct call upon him usage has sanctioned another and stronger sort of protest one which takes the shape of distinct and clamorous objections we are speaking of the routine in this place according to the course which it did travel or could travel under that law and that practice which furnished the pleas for complaint now it was upon these objections as may well be supposed that the main battle arose simply to want the call being a mere zero could not much lay hold upon public feeling it was a case not fitted for effect you cannot bring a blank privation strongly before the public eye the call did not take place last week well perhaps it will take place next week or again if it should never take place perhaps it may be religious carelessness on the part of the parish many parishes notoriously feel no interest in their pastor except as a quiet member of their community consequently in two of three cases that might occur there was nothing to excite the public the parish had either agreed with the patron or had not noticeably dissented but in the third case of positive objections which in order to justify themselves as not frivolous and vexatious were urged with peculiar emphasis the attention of all men was arrested newspapers reverberated the fact sympathetic groans arose the patron was an oppressor the parish was under persecution and the poor clergyman whose case was the most to be pitied as being in a measure endowed with a lasting fund of dislike had the mortification to find over and above this resistance from within that he bore the name of intruder from without he was supposed by the fiction of the case to be in league with his patron for the persecution of a godly parish whilst in reality the godly parish was persecuting him and hallooing the world ab extra to join in the hunt in such cases of pretended objections to men who have not been tried we need scarcely tell the reader that usually they are mere cabals and worldly intrigues it is next to impossible that any parish or congregation should sincerely agree in their opinion of a clergyman what one man likes in such cases another man detests mr a with an ardent nature and something of a histrionic turn doats upon a fine rhetorical display mr b with more simplicity of taste pronounces this little better than theatrical ostenostentation mr c requires a good deal of critical scholarship mr d quarrels with this as unsuitable to a rustic congregation mrs x who is under concern for sin demands a searching and as she expresses it a faithful style of dealing with consciences mrs y an aristocratic lady who cannot bear to be mixed up in any common charge together with low people abominates such words as sin and wills that the parson should confine his observations to the shocking demoralization of the lower orders now having stated the practice of scottish induction as it was formerly sustained in its first stage by law in its second stage by usage let us finish that part of the subject by reporting the existing practice as regulated in all its stages by law what law the law as laid down in lord aberdeens late act of parliament this statement should historically speaking have found itself under our third head as being one amongst the consequences immediately following the final rupture but it is better placed at this point because it closes the whole review of that topic and because it reflects light upon the former practice the practice which led to the whole mutinous tumult every alteration forcing more keenly upon the readers attention what had been the previous custom and in what respect it was held by any man to be a grievance this act then of lord aberdeens removes all legal effect from the call common sense required that for what was to be done with patronage was it to be sustained or was it not if not then why quarrel with the nonintrusionists why suffer a schism to take place in the church give legal effect to the call and the original cause of quarrel is gone for with respect to the opponents of the nonintrusionists they would bow to the law on the other hand if patronage is to be sustained then why allow of any lingering or doubtful force to what must often operate as a conflicting claim a call which carries with it any legal force annihilates patronage patronage would thus be exercised only on sufferance do we mean then that a call should sink into a pure fiction of ceremony like the english congedelire addressed to a dean and chapter calling on them to elect a bishop when all the world knows that already the see has been filled by a nomination from the crown not at all a moral weight will still attach to the call though no legal coercion and what is chiefly important all those doubts will be removed by express legislation which could not but arise between a practice pointing sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another between legal decisions again upholding one view whilst something very like legal prescription was occasionally pleaded for the other behold the evil of written laws not rigorously in harmony with that sort of customary law founded upon vague tradition or irregular practice and here by the way arises the place for explaining to the reader that irreconcilable dispute amongst parliamentary lawyers as to the question whether lord aberdeens bill were enactory that is created a new law or declaratory that is simply expounded an old one if enactory then why did the house of lords give judgment against those who allowed weight to the call that might need altering that might be highly inexpedient but if it required a new law to make it illegal how could those parties be held in the wrong previously to the new act of legislation on the other hand if declaratory then show us any old law which made the call illegal the fact is that no man can decide whether the act established a new law or merely expounded an old one and the reason why he cannot is this the practice the usage which often is the law had grown up variously during the troubles of the seventeenth century in many places political reasons had dictated that the elders should nominate the incumbent but the ancient practice had authorized patronage by the act of queen anne th chap it was even formally restored and yet the patron in known instances was said to have waived his right in deference to the call but why did he do so in courteous compliance with the parish as a party whose reasonable wishes ought for the sake of all parties to meet with attention or did he do so in humble submission to the parish as having by their majorities a legal right to the presentation there lay the question the presumptions from antiquity were all against the call the more modern practice had occasionally been for it now we all know how many colorable claims of right are created by prescription what was the exact force of the call no man could say in like manner the exact character and limit of allowable objections had been illdefined in practice and rested more on a vague tradition than on any settled rule this also made it hard to say whether lord aberdeens act were enactory or declaratory a predicament however which equally affects all statutes for removing doubts the call then we consider as no longer recognised by law but did lord aberdeen by that change establish the right of the patron as an unconditional right by no means he made it strictly a conditional right the presentee is now a candidate and no more he has the most important vote in his favor it is true but that vote may still be set aside though still only with the effect of compelling the patron to a new choice calls are no longer doubtful in their meaning but objections have a fair field laid open to them all reasonable objections are to be weighed but who is to judge whether they are reasonable the presbytery of the district and now pursue the action of the law and see how little ground it leaves upon which to hang a complaint everybodys rights are secured whatever be the event first of all the presentee cannot complain if he is rejected only for proved insufficiency he is put on his trial as to these points only is he orthodox is he of good moral reputation is he sufficiently learned and note this which in fact sir james graham remarked in his official letter to the assembly strictly speaking he ought not to be under challenge as respects the third point for it is your own fault the fault of your own licensing courts the presbyteries if he is not qualified so far you should not have created him a licentiate should not have given him a license to preach as must have been done in an earlier stage of his progress if he were not learned enough once learned a man is learned for life as to the other points he may change and therefore it is that an examination is requisite but how can he complain if he is found by an impartial court of venerable men objectionable on any score if it were possible however that he should be wronged he has his appeal secondly how can the patron complain his case is the same as his presentees case his injuries the same his relief the same besides if his man is rejected it is not the parish man that takes his place no but a second man of his own choice and if again he chooses amiss who is to blame for that thirdly can the congregation complain they have a general interest in their spiritual guide but as to the preference for oratory for loud or musical voice for peculiar views in religion these things are special they interest but an exceedingly small minority in any parish and what is worse that which pleases one is often offensive to another there are cases in which a parish would reject a man for being a married man some of the parish have unmarried daughters but this case clearly belongs to the small minority and we have little doubt that where the objections lay for cause not shown it was often for this cause fourthly can the church complain her interest is represented not by the presentee not by the patron not by the congregation but by the presbytery and whatever the presbytery say that is supported speaking either for the patron for the presentee for the congregation or for themselves as conservators of the church that court is heard what more would they have and thus in turn every interest is protected now the point to be remarked isthat each party in turn has a separate influence but on any other plan giving to one party out of the four an absolute or unconditional power no matter which of the four it be all the rest have none at all lord aberdeen has reconciled the rights of patrons for the first time with those of all other parties interested nobody has more than a conditional power everybody has that and the patron as necessity requires if property is to be protected has in all circumstances the revisionary power ii secondly how were these things don by what means were the hands of any party strengthened so as to find this revolution possible we seek not to refine but all moral power issues out of moral forces and it may be well therefore rapidly to sketch the history of religion which is the greatest of moral forces as it sank and rose in this island through the last two hundred years it is well known that the two great revolutions of the seventeenth century that in accomplished by the parliament armies including its reaction in and secondly that in did much to unsettle the religious tone of public morals historians and satirists ascribe a large effect in this change to the personal influence of charles ii and the foreign character of his court we do not share in their views and one eminent proof that they are wrong lies in the following fact viz that the sublimest act of selfsacrifice which the world has ever seen arose precisely in the most triumphant season of charless career a time when the reaction of hatred had not yet neutralized the sunny joyousness of his restoration surely the reader cannot be at a loss to know what we mean the renunciation in one hour on st bartholomews day in of two thousand benefices by the nonconforming clergymen of england in the same year occurred a similar renunciation of three hundred and sixty benefices in scotland these great sacrifices whether called for or not argue a great strength in the religious principle at that era yet the decay of external religion towards the close of that century is proved incontestably we ourselves are inclined to charge this upon two causes first that the times were controversial and usually it happens that where too much energy is carried into the controversies or intellectual part of religion a very diminished fervor attends the culture of its moral and practical part this was perhaps one reason for the dispute with the papal church partly perhaps with a secret reference to the rumored apostasy of the royal family was pursued more eagerly in the latter half of the seventeenth than even in any section of the sixteenth century but doubtless the main reason was the revolutionary character of the times morality is at all periods fearfully shaken by intestine wars and by instability in a government the actual duration of war in england was not indeed longer than three and a half years viz from edgehill fight in the autumn of to the defeat of the kings last force under sir jacob astley at stowinthewalds in the spring of any other fighting in that century belonged to mere insulated and discontinuous war but the insecurity of every government between and kept the popular mind in a state of fermentation accordingly queen annes reign might be said to open upon an irreligious people the condition of things was further strengthened by the unavoidable interweaving at that time of politics with religion they could not be kept separate and the favor shown even by religious people to such partisan zealots as dr sacheverell evidenced and at the same time promoted the public irreligion this was the period in which the clergy thought too little of their duties but too much of their professional rights and if we may credit the indirect report of the contemporary literature all apostolic or missionary zeal for the extension of religion was in those days a thing unknown it may seem unaccountable to many that the same state of things should have spread in those days to scotland but this is no more than the analogies of all experience entitled us to expect thus we know that the instincts of religious reformation ripened everywhere at the same period of the sixteenth century from one end of europe to the other although between most of the european kingdoms there was nothing like so much intercourse as between england and scotland in the eighteenth century in both countries a cold and lifeless state of public religion prevailed up to the american and french revolutions these great events gave a shock everywhere to the meditative and consequently to the religious impulses of men and in the mean time an irregular channel had been already opened to these impulses by the two founders of methodism a century has now passed since wesley and whitefield organized a more spiritual machinery of preaching than could then be found in england for the benefit of the poor and laboring classes these methodist institutions prospered as they were sure of doing amongst the poor and the neglected at any time much more when contrasted with the deep slumbers of the established church and another ground of prosperity soon arose out of the now expanding manufacturing system vast multitudes of men grew up under that system humble enough by the quality of their education to accept with thankfulness the ministrations of methodism and rich enough to react upon that beneficent institution by continued endowments in money gradually even the church herself that mighty establishment under the cold shade of which methodism had grown up as a neglected weed began to acknowledge the power of an extending methodistic influence which originally she had haughtily despised first she murmured then she grew anxious or fearful and finally she began to find herself invaded or modified from within by influences springing up from methodism this last effect became more conspicuously evident after the french revolution the church of scotland which as a whole had exhibited with much unobtrusive piety the same outward torpor as the church of england during the eighteenth century betrayed a corresponding resuscitation about the same time at the opening of this present century both of these national churches began to show a marked rekindling of religious fervor in what extent this change in the scottish church had been due mediately or immediately to methodism we do not pretend to calculate that is we do not pretend to settle the proportions but mediately the scottish church must have been affected because she was greatly affected by her intercourse with the english church as eg in bible societies missionary societies c and the english church had been previously affected by methodism immediately she must also have been affected by methodism because whitefield had been invited to preach in scotland and did preach in scotland but whatever may have been the cause of this awakening from slumber in the two established churches of this island the fact is so little to be denied that in both its aspects it is acknowledged by those most interested in denying it the two churches slept the sleep of torpor through the eighteenth century so much of the fact is acknowledged by their own members the two churches awoke as from a trance in or just before the dawning of the nineteenth century this second half of the fact is acknowledged by their opponents the wesleyan methodists that formidable power in england and wales who once reviled the establishment as the dormitory of spiritual drones have for many years hailed a very large section in that establishment viz the section technically known by the name of the evangelical clergy as brothers after their own hearts and corresponding to their own strictest model of a spiritual clergy that section again the evangelical section in the english church as men more highly educated took a direct interest in the scottish clergy upon general principles of liberal interest in all that could affect religion beyond what could be expected from the methodists and in this way grew up a considerable action and reaction between the two classical churches of the british soil such was the varying condition when sketched in outline of the scottish and english churches two centuries ago and for half a century beyond that we find both churches in a state of trial of turbulent agitation and of sacrifices for conscience which involved every fifth or sixth beneficiary then came a century of languor and the carelessness which belongs to settled prosperity and finally for both has arisen a half century of new light new zeal and spiritually speaking of new prosperity this deduction it was necessary to bring down in order to explain the new power which arose to the scottish church during the last generation of suppose thirty years when two powerful establishments each separately fitted to the genius and needs of its several people are pulling together powerfully towards one great spiritual object vast must be the results our ancestors would have stood aghast as at some fabulous legend or some mighty miracle could they have heard of the scale on which our modern contributions proceed for the purposes of missions to barbarous nations of circulating the scriptures whether through the bible society that is the national society or provincial societies of translating the scriptures into languages scarcely known by name to scholars of converting jews of organizing and propagating education towards these great objects the scottish clergy had worked with energy and with little disturbance to their unanimity confidence was universally felt in their piety and in their discretion this confidence even reached the supreme rulers of the state very much through ecclesiastical influence new plans for extending the religious power of the scottish church and indirectly of extending their secular power were countenanced by the government jealousy had been disarmed by the upright conduct of the scottish clergy and their remarkable freedom hitherto from all taint of ambition it was felt besides that the temper of the scottish nation was radically indisposed to all intriguing or modes of temporal ascendency in ecclesiastical bodies the nation therefore was in some degree held as a guarantee for the discretion of their clergy and hence it arose that much less caution was applied to the first encroachment of the nonintrusionists than would have been applied under circumstances of more apparent doubt hence it arose that a confidence from the scottish nation was extended to this clergy which too certainly has been abused in the years parliament had passed acts for building additional places of worship in the highlands and islands of scotland these acts may be looked upon as one section in that general extension of religious machinery which the british people by their government and their legislature have for many years been promoting not as is ordinarily said that the weight of this duty had grown upon them simply through their own treacherous neglect of it during the latter half of the eighteenth century but that no reasonable attention to that duty could have kept pace with the scale upon which the claims of a new manufacturing population had increased in mere equity we must admit not that the british nation had fallen behind its duties though naturally it might have done so under the religious torpor prevalent at the original era of manufacturing extension but that the duties had outstripped all human power of overtaking them the efforts however have been prodigious in this direction for many years amongst those applied to scotland it had been settled by parliament that fortytwo new churches should be raised in the highlands with an endowment from the government of pound symbol annually for each incumbent there were besides more than two hundred chapels of ease to be founded and towards this scheme the scottish public subscribed largely the money was intrusted to the clergy that was right but mark what followed it had been expressly provided by parliament that any district or circumjacent territory allotted to such parliamentary churches as the range within which the incumbent was to exercise his spiritual ministration should not be separate parishes for any civil or legal effects here surely the intentions and directions of the legislature were plain enough and decisive enough how did the scottish clergy obey them they erected all these jurisdictions into bona fide parishes enjoying the plenary rights as to church government of the other parishes and distinguished from them in a merely nominal way as parishes quoad sacra there were added at once to the presbyteries which are the organs of the church power two hundred and three clerical persons for the chapels of ease and fortytwo for the highland churches making a total of two hundred and fortyfive new members by the constitution of the scottish church an equal number of lay elders called ruling elders accompany the clerical elders consequently four hundred and ninety new members were introduced at once into that particular class of courts presbyteries which form the electoral bodies in relation to the highest court of general assembly the effect of this change made in the very teeth of the law was twofold first it threw into many separate presbyteries a considerable accession of voters all owing their appointments to the general assembly this would at once give a large bias favorable to their party views in every election for members to serve in the assembly even upon an assembly numerically limited this innovation would have told most abusively but the assembly was not limited and therefore the whole effect was at the same moment greatly to extend the electors and the elected here then was the machinery by which the faction worked they drew that power from scotland rekindled into a temper of religious anxiety which they never could have drawn from scotland lying torpid as she had lain through the eighteenth century the new machinery created by parliament in order to meet the wishes of the scottish nation the money of that nation the awakened zeal of that nation all these were employed honorably in one sense that is not turned aside into private channels for purposes of individuals but factiously in the result as being for the benefit of a faction honorably as regarded the open mode of applying such influence a mode which did not shrink from exposure but most dishonorably in so far as privileges which had been conceded altogether for a spiritual object were abusively transferred to the furtherance of a temporal intrigue such were the methods by which the newborn ambition of the clergy moved and that ambition had become active simply because it had suddenly seemed to become practicable the presbyteries as being the effectual electoral bodies are really the main springs of the ecclesiastical administration to govern them was in effect to govern the church a new scheme for extending religion had opened a new avenue to this control over the presbyteries that opening was notoriously unlawful but not the less the church faction precipitated themselves ardently upon it and but for the faithfulness of the civil courts they would never have been dislodged from what they had so suddenly acquired such was the extraordinary leap taken by the scottish clergy into a power of which hitherto they had never enjoyed a fraction it was a movement per saltum beyond all that history has recorded at cockcrow they had no power at all when the sun went down they had gained if they could have held a papal supremacy and a thing not less memorably strange is that even yet the ambitious leaders were not disturbed what they had gained was viewed by the public as a collateral gain indirectly adhering to a higher object but forming no part at all of what the clergy had sought it required the scrutiny of law courts to unmask and decompose their true object the obstinacy of the defence betrayed the real animus of the attempt it was an attempt which in connection with the veto act supposing that to have prospered would have laid the whole power of the church at their feet what the law had distributed amongst three powers patron parish and presbyter would have been concentrated in themselves the quoad sacra parishes would have riveted their majorities in the presbyteries and the presbyteries under the real action of the veto would have appointed nearly every incumbent in scotland and this is the answer to the question when treated merely in outline how were these things done the religion of the times had created new machineries for propagating a new religious influence these fell into the hands of the clergy and the temptation to abuse these advantages led them into revolution iii having now stated what was done as well as how it was done let us estimate the consequences of these acts under this present or third section reviewing the immediate consequences which have taken effect already and under the next section anticipating the more remote consequences yet to be expected in the spring of as we have sufficiently explained the general assembly ventured on the fatal attempt to revolutionize the church and as a preliminary towards that on the attempt to revolutionize the property of patronage there lay the extravagance of the attempt its shortsightedness if they did not see its civil tendencies its audacity if they did it was one revolution marching to its object through another it was a vote which if at all sustained must entail a long inheritance of contests with the whole civil polity of scotland heu quantum fati parva tabella vehit it might seem to strangers a trivial thing that an obscure court like the presbytery should proceed in the business of induction by one routine rather than by another but was it a trivial thing that the power of appointing clergymen should lapse into this perilous dilemma either that it should be intercepted by the scottish clerical order and thus that a lordly hierarchy should be suddenly created disposing of incomes which in the aggregate approach to half a million annually or on the other hand that this dangerous power if defeated as a clerical power should settle into a tenure exquisitely democratic was that trivial doubtless the scottish ecclesiastical revenues are not equal nor nearly equal to the english still it is true that scotland supposing all her benefices equalized gives a larger average to each incumbent than england of the year england in that year gave an average of pound symbol to each beneficiary scotland gave an average of pound symbol that body therefore which wields patronage in scotland wields a greater relative power than the corresponding body in england now this body in scotland must finally have been the clerus but supposing the patronage to have settled nominally where the veto act had placed it then it would have settled into the keeping of a fierce democracy mr forsyth has justly remarked that in such a case the hired ploughmen of a parish mercenary hands that quit their engagements at martinmas and can have no filial interest in the parish would generally succeed in electing the clergyman that man would be elected generally who had canvassed the parish with the arts and means of an electioneering candidate or else the struggle would lie between the property and the jacobinism of the district in respect to jacobinism the condition of scotland is much altered from what it was pauperism and great towns have worked strange defeatures in scottish society a vast capital has arisen in the west on a level with the firstrate capitalists of the continent with vienna or with naples far superior in size to madrid to lisbon to berlin more than equal to rome and milan or again to munich and dresden taken by couples and in this point beyond comparison with any one of these capitals that whilst they are connected by slight ties with the circumjacent country glasgow keeps open a communication with the whole land vast laboratories of encouragement to manual skill too often dissociated from consideration of character armies of mechanics gloomy and restless having no interfusion amongst their endless files of any gradations corresponding to a system of controlling officers these spectacles which are permanently offered by the castra stativa of combined mechanics in glasgow and its dependencies paisley greenock c supported by similar districts and by turbulent collieries in other parts of that kingdom make scotland when now developing her strength no longer the safe and docile arena for popular movements which once she was with a people that were scattered and habits that were pastoral and at this moment so fearfully increased is the overbearance of democratic impulses in scotland that perhaps in no european nation hardly excepting france has it become more important to hang weights and retarding forces upon popular movements amongst the laboring classes this being so we have never been able to understand the apparent apathy with which the landed body met the first promulgation of the veto act in may of this apathy two insufficient explanations suggest themselves st it seemed a matter of delicacy to confront the general assembly upon a field which they had clamorously challenged for their own the question at issue was tempestuously published to scotland as a question exclusively spiritual and by whom was it thus published the southern reader must here not be careless of dates at present viz in those who fulminate such views of spiritual jurisdiction are simply dissenters and those who vehemently withstand them are the church armed with the powers of the church such are the relations between the parties in but in the revolutionary party were not only in the church but being the majority they came forward as the church the new doctrines presented themselves at first not as those of a faction but of the scottish kirk assembled in her highest court the prestige of that advantage has vanished since then for this faction after first of all falling into a minority afterwards ceased to be any part or section of the church but in that year such a prestige did really operate and this must be received as one of the reasons which partially explain the torpor of the landed body no one liked to move first even amongst those who meant to move but another reason we find in the conscientious scruples of many landholders who hesitated to move at all upon a question then insufficiently discussed and in which their own interest was by so many degrees the largest these reasons however though sufficient for suspense seem hardly sufficient for not having solemnly protested against the veto act immediately upon its passing the assembly whatever doubts a few persons might harbor upon the expediency of such an act evidently it was contrary to the law of the land the general assembly could have no power to abrogate a law passed by the three estates of the realm but probably it was the deep sense of that truth which reined up the national resistance sure of a speedy collision between some patron and the infringers of his right other parties stood back for the present to watch the form which such a collision might assume in that same year of not many months after the passing of the assemblys act came on the first case of collision and some time subsequently a second these two cases auchterarder and marnoch commenced in the very same steps but immediately afterwards diverged as widely as was possible in both cases the rights of the patron and of the presentee were challenged peremptorily that is to say in both cases parishioners objected to the presentee without reason shown the conduct of the people was the same in one case as in the other that of the two presbyteries travelled upon lines diametrically opposite the first case was that of auchterarder the parish and the presbytery concerned both belonged to auchterarder and there the presbytery obeyed the new law of the assembly they rejected the presentee refusing to take him on trial of his qualifications and why we cannot too often repeat simply because a majority of a rustic congregation had rejected him without attempting to show reason for his rejection the auchterarder presbytery for their part in this affair were prosecuted in the court of session by the injured parties lord kinnoul the patron and mr young the presentee twice upon a different form of action the court of session gave judgment against the presbytery twice the case went up by appeal to the lords twice the lords affirmed the judgment of the court below in the other case of marnoch the presbytery of strathbogie took precisely the opposite course so far from abetting the unjust congregation of rustics they rebelled against the new law of the assembly and declared by seven of their number against three that they were ready to proceed with the trial of the presentee and to induct him if found qualified into the benefice upon this the general assembly suspended the seven members of presbytery by that mode of proceeding the assembly fancied that they should be able to elude the intentions of the presbytery it being supposed that whilst suspended the presbytery had no power to ordain and that without ordination there was no possibility of giving induction but here the assembly had miscalculated suspension would indeed have had the effects ascribed to it but in the mean time the suspension as being originally illegal was found to be void and the presentee on that ground obtained a decree from the court of session ordaining the presbytery of strathbogie to proceed with the settlement three of the ten members composing this presbytery resisted and they were found liable in expenses the other seven completed the settlement in the usual form here was plain rebellion and rebellion triumphant if this were allowed all was gone what should the assembly do for the vindication of their authority upon deliberation they deposed the contumacious presbytery from their functions as clergymen and declared their churches vacant but this sentence was found to be a brutum fulmen the crime was no crime the punishment turned out no punishment and a minority even in this very assembly declared publicly that they would not consent to regard this sentence as any sentence at all but would act in all respects as if no such sentence had been carried by vote within their own high court of assembly it is however difficult to see how this refusal to recognise a sentence voted by a majority could be valid outside the civil courts came into play but within the assembly surely its own laws and votes prevailed however this distinction could bring little comfort to the assembly at present for the illegality of the deposal was now past all dispute and the attempt to punish or even ruin a number of professional brethren for not enforcing a bylaw when the bylaw itself had been found irreconcilable to the law of the land greatly displeased the public as vindictive oppressive and useless to the purposes of the assembly nothing was gained except the putting on record an implacability that was confessedly impotent this was the very lunacy of malice mortifying it might certainly seem for the members of a supreme court like the general assembly to be baffled by those of a subordinate court but still since each party must be regarded as representing far larger interests than any personal to themselves trying on either side not the energies of their separate wits but the available resources of law in one of its obscurer chapters there really seemed no more room for humiliation to the one party or for triumph to the other than there is amongst reasonable men in the result from a game where the game is one exclusively of chance from this period it is probable that the faction of nonintrusionists resolved upon abandoning the church it was the one sole resource left for sustaining their own importance to men who were now sinking fast in public estimation at the latter end of they summoned a convocation in edinburgh the discussions were private but it was generally understood that at this time they concerted a plan for going out from the church in the event of their failing to alarm the government by the notification of this design we do not pretend to any knowledge of secrets what is known to everybody is that on the annual meeting of the general assembly in may the great body of the nonintrusionists moved out in procession the sort of theatrical interest which gathered round the seceders for a few hurried days in may was of a kind which should naturally have made wise men both ashamed and disgusted it was the merest effervescence from that state of excitement which is nursed by novelty by expectation by the vague anticipation of a scene possibly of a quarrel together with the natural interest in seeing men whose names had been long before the public in books and periodical journals the first measure of the seceders was to form themselves into a pseudogeneral assembly when there are two suns visible or two moons the real one and its duplicate we call the mock sun a parhelios and the mock moon a paraselene on that principle we must call this mock assembly a parasynodos rarely indeed can we applaud the seceders in the fabrication of names they distinguish as quoad sacra parishes those which were peculiarly quoad politica parishes for in that view only they had been interesting to the nonintrusionists again they style themselves the free church by way of taunting the other side with being a servile church but how are they any church at all by the courtesies of europe and according to usage a church means a religious incorporation protected and privileged by the state those who are not so privileged are usually content with the title of separatists dissenters or nonconformists no wise man will see either good sense or dignity in assuming titles not appropriate the very position and aspect towards the church legally so called which has been assumed by the nonintrusionists viz the position of protesters against that body not merely as bearing amongst other features a certain relation to the state but specifically because they bear that relation makes it incongruous and even absurd for these dissenters to denominate themselves a church but there is another objection to this denomination the free church have no peculiar and separate confession of faith nobody knows what are their credenda what they hold indispensable for fellowmembership either as to faith in mysteries or in moral doctrines now if they reply oh as to that we adopt for our faith all that ever we did profess when members of the scottish kirk then in effect they are hardly so much as a dissenting body except in some elliptic sense there is a grievous hiatus in their own titledeeds and archives they supply it by referring people to the muniment chest of the kirk would it not be a scandal to a protestant church if she should say to communicants we have no sacramental vessels or even ritual but you may borrow both from papal rome not only however is the kirk to lend her confession c but even then a plain rustic will not be able to guess how many parts in his confession are or may be affected by the reformation of the nonintrusionists surely he will think if this reformation were so vast that it drove them out of the national church absolutely exploded them then it follows that it must have intervened and indirectly modified innumerable questions a difference that was punctually limited to this one or these two clauses could not be such a difference as justified a rupture besides if they have altered this one or these two clauses or have altered their interpretation how is any man to know except from a distinct confession of faith that they have not even directly altered much more notoriety through newspapers is surely no ground to stand upon in religion and now it appears that the unlettered rustic needs two guides one to show him exactly how much they have altered whether two points or two hundred as well as which two or two hundred another to teach him how far these original changes may have carried with them secondary changes as consequences into other parts of the christian system one of the known changes viz the doctrine of popular election as the proper qualification for parish clergymen possibly is not fitted to expand itself or ramify except by analogy but the other change the infinity which has been suddenly turned off like a jet of gas or like the rushing of wind through the tubes of an organ upon the doctrine and application of spirituality seems fitted for derivative effects that are innumerable consequently we say of the nonitrusionists not only that they are no church but that they are not even any separate body of dissenters until they have published a confession or a revised edition of the scottish confession iv lastly we have to sum and to appreciate the ultimate consequences of these things let us pursue them to the end of the vista first in order stands the dreadful shock to the national church establishment and that is twofold it is a shock from without acting through opinion and a shock from within acting through the contagion of example each case is separately perfect through the opinion of men standing outside of the church the church herself suffers wrong in her authority through the contagion of sympathy stealing over men inside of the church peril arises of other shocks in a second series which would so exhaust the church by reiterated convulsions as to leave her virtually dismembered and shattered for all her great national functions as to that evil which acts through opinion it acts by a machinery viz the press and social centralization in great cities which in these days is perfect right or wrong justified or not justified by the acts of the majority it is certain that every public body how much more then a body charged with the responsibility of upholding the truth in its standard suffers dreadfully in the worlds opinion by any feud schism or shadow of change among its members this is what the new testament a code of philosophy fertile in new ideas first introduced under the name of scandal that is any occasion of serious offence ministered to the weak or to the sceptical by differences irreconcilable in the acts or the opinions of those whom they are bound to regard as spiritual authorities now here in scotland is a feud past all arbitration here is a schism no longer theoretic neither beginning nor ending in mere speculation here is a change of doctrine on one side or the other which throws a sad umbrage of doubt and perplexity over the pastoral relation of the church to every parish in scotland less confidence there must always be henceforward in great religious incorporations was there any such incorporation reputed to be more internally harmonious than the scottish church none has been so tempestuously agitated was any church more deeply pledged to the spirit of meekness none has split asunder so irreconcilably as to the grounds of quarrel could any questions or speculations be found so little fitted for a popular intemperance yet no breach of unity has ever propagated itself by steps so sudden and irrevocable one short decennium has comprehended within its circuit the beginning and the end of this unparalleled hurricane in the first light augury of mischief skirted the horizon a cloud no bigger than a mans hand in the evil had travelled on from birth to birth already it had failed in what may be called one conspiracy already it had entered upon a second viz to rear up an antikirk or spurious establishment which should twist itself with snakelike folds about the legal establishment surmount it as a roman vinea surmounted the fortifications which it beleaguered and which under whatsoever practical issue for the contest should at any rate overlook molest and insult the true church for ever even this brief period of development would have been briefer had not the law courts interposed many delays demurs of law process imposed checks upon the uncharitable haste of the odium theologicum and though in a question of schism it would be a petitio principii for a neutral censor to assume that either party had been originally in error yet it is within our competence to say that the seceders it was whose bigotry carried the dispute to that sad issue of a final separation the establishment would have been well content to stop short of that consummation and temperaments might have been found compromises both safe and honorable had the minority built less of their reversionary hopes upon the policy of a fanciful martyrdom martyrs they insisted upon becoming and that they might be martyrs it was necessary for them to secede that europe thinks at present with less reverence of protestant institutions than it did ten years ago is due to one of these institutions in particular viz to the scottish kirk and specifically to the minority in that body they it was who spurned all mutual toleration all brotherly indulgence from either side to what it regarded as error in the other consequently upon their consciences lies the responsibility of having weakened the pillars of the reformed churches throughout christendom had those abuses been really such which the seceders denounced were it possible that a primary law of pure christianity had been set aside for generations how came it that evils so gross had stirred no whispers of reproach before how came it that no aurora of early light no prelusive murmurs of scrupulosity even from themselves had run before this wild levanter of change heretofore or now there must have been huge error on their own showing heretofore they must have been traitorously below their duty or now mutinously beyond it such conclusions are irresistible and upon any path seceding or not seceding they menace the worldly credit of ecclesiastical bodies that evil is now past remedy as for the other evil that which acts upon church establishments not through simple failure in the guarantees of public opinion but through their own internal vices of composition here undeniably we see a chasm traversing the scottish church from the very gates to the centre and unhappily the same chasm which marks a division of the church internally is a link connecting it externally with the seceders for how stands the case did the scottish kirk at the late crisis divide broadly into two mutually excluding sections was there one of these bisections which said yes whilst the other responded no was the affirmative and negative shared between them as between the black chessmen and the white not so and unhappily not so the two extremes there were but these shaded off into each other many were the nuances multiplied the combinations here stood a section that had voted for all the changes with two or three exceptions there stood another that went the whole length as to this change but no part of the way as to that between these sections arose others that had voted arbitrarily or eclectically that is by no law generally recognised and behind this eclectic school were grouped others who had voted for all novelties up to a certain day but after that had refused to go further with a movement party whose tendencies they had begun to distrust in this last case therefore the divisional line fell upon no principle but upon the accident of having at that particular moment first seen grounds of conscientious alarm the principles upon which men had divided were various and these various principles were variously combined but on the other hand those who have gone out were the men who approved totally not partially unconditionally not within limits up to the end and not to a given day consequently those who stayed in comprehended all the shades and degrees which the men of violence excluded the seceders were unanimous to a man and of necessity for he who approves the last act the extreme act which is naturally the most violent act a fortiori approves all lesser acts but the establishment by parity of reason retained upon its rolls all the degrees all the modifications all who had exercised a wise discretion who in so great a cause had thought it a point of religion to be cautious whose casuistry had moved in the harness of peace and who had preferred an interest of conscience to a triumph of partisanship we honor them for that policy but we cannot hide from ourselves that the very principle which makes such a policy honorable at the moment makes it dangerous in reversion for he who avows that upon public motives he once resisted a temptation to schism makes known by that avowal that he still harbors in his mind the germ of such a temptation and to that scruple which once he resisted hereafter he may see reason for yielding the principles of schism which for the moment were suppressed are still latent in the church it is urged that in quest of unity many of these men succeeded in resisting the instincts of dissension at the moment of crisis true but this might be because they presumed on winning from their own party equal concessions by means less violent than schism or because they attached less weight to the principle concerned than they may see cause for attaching upon future considerations or because they would not allow themselves to sanction the cause of the late secession by going out in company with men whose principles they adopted only in part or whose manner of supporting those principles they abhorred universally it is evident that little stress is to be laid on a negative act simply to have declined going out with the seceders proves nothing for it is equivocal it is an act which may cover indifferently a marked hostility to the secession party or an absolute friendliness but a friendliness not quite equal to so extreme a test and again this negative act may be equivocal in a different way the friendliness may not only have existed but may have existed in sufficient strength for any test whatever not the principles of the seceders but their jacobinical mode of asserting them may have proved the true nerve of the repulsion to many what is it that we wish the english reader to collect from these distinctions simply that the danger is not yet gone past the earthquake says a great poet when speaking of the general tendency in all dangers to come round by successive and reiterated shocks the earthquake is not satisfied at once all dangers which lie deeply seated are recurrent dangers they intermit only as the revolving lamps of a lighthouse are periodically eclipsed the general assembly of when closing her gates upon the seceders shut in perhaps more of the infected than at the time she succeeded in shutting out as respected the opinion of the world outside it seemed advisable to shut out the least number possible for in proportion to the number of the seceders was the danger that they should carry with them an authentic impression in their favor on the other hand as respected a greater danger the danger from internal contagion it seemed advisable that the church should have shut out if she could very many of those who for the present adhered to her the broader the separation and the more absolute between the church and the secession so much the less anxiety there would have survived lest the rent should spread that the anxiety in this respect is not visionary the reader may satisfy himself by looking over a remarkable pamphlet which professes by its title to separate the wheat from the chaff by the wheat in the view of this writer is meant the aggregate of those who persevered in their recusant policy up to the practical result of secession all who stopped short of that consummation on whatever plea are the chaff the writer is something of an incendiary or something of a fanatic but he is consistent with regard to his own principles and so elaborately careful in his details as to extort admiration of his energy and of his patience in research but the reason for which we notice this pamphlet is with a view to the proof of that large intestine mischief which still lingers behind in the vitals of the scottish establishment no proof in a question of that nature can be so showy and ostensive to a stranger as that which is supplied by this vindictive pamphlet for every past vote recording a scruple is the pledge of a scruple still existing though for the moment suppressed since the secession nearly four hundred and fifty new men may have entered the church this supplementary body has probably diluted the strength of the revolutionary principles but they also may perhaps have partaken to some extent in the contagion of these principles true there is this guarantee for caution on the part of these new men that as yet they are pledged to nothing and that seeing experimentally how fearfully many of their older brethren are now likely to be fettered by the past they have every possible motive for reserve in committing themselves either by their votes or by their pens in their situation there is a special inducement to prudence because there is a prospect that for them prudence is in time to be effectual but for many of the older men prudence comes too late they are already fettered and what we are now pointing out to the attention of our readers is that by the past by the absolute votes of the past too sorrowfully it is made evident that the scottish church is deeply tainted with the principles of the secession these germs of evil and of revolution speaking of them in a personal sense cannot be purged off entirely until one generation shall have passed away but speaking of them as principles capable of vegetation these germs may or may not expand into whole forests of evil according to the accidents of coming events whether fitted to tranquillize our billowy aspects of society or on the other hand largely to fertilize the many occasions of agitation which political fermentations are too sure to throw off let this chance turn out as it may we repeat for the information of southerns that the church by shutting off the persons of particular agitators has not shut off the principles of agitation and that the cordon sanataire supposing the spontaneous exile of the nonintrusionists to be regarded in that light was not drawn about the church until the disease had spread widely within the lines past votes may not absolutely pledge a man to a future course of action warned in time such a man may stand neutral in practice but thus far they poison the fountains of wholesome unanimity that if a man can evade the necessity of squaring particular actions to his past opinions at least he must find himself tempted to square his opinions themselves or his counsels to such past opinions as he may too notoriously have placed on record by his votes but if such are the continual dangers from reactions in the establishment so long as men survive in that establishment who feel upbraided by past votes and so long as enemies survive who will not suffer these upbraidings to slumber dangers which much mutual forbearance and charity can alone disarm on the other hand how much profounder is the inconsistency to which the free church is doomed they have rent the unity of that church to which they had pledged their faith but on what plea on the plea that in cases purely spiritual they could not in conscience submit to the award of the secular magistrate yet how merely impracticable is this principle as an abiding principle of action churches that is the charge of particular congregations will be with them as with other religious communities the means of livelihood grounds innumerable will arise for excluding or attempting to exclude each other from these official stations no possible form regulating the business of ordination or of induction can anticipate the infinite objections which may arise but no man interested in such a case will submit to a judge appointed by insufficient authority daily bread for his family is what few men will resign without a struggle and that struggle will of necessity come for final adjudication to the law courts of the land whose interference in any question affecting a spiritual interest the free church has for ever pledged herself to refuse but in the case supposed she will not have the power to refuse it she will be cited before the tribunals and can elude that citation in no way but by surrendering the point in litigation and if she should adopt the notion that it is better for her to do that than to acknowledge a sufficient authority in the court by pleading at its bar upon this principle once made public she will soon be stripped of everything and will cease to be a church at all she cannot continue to be a depository of any faith or a champion of any doctrines if she lose the means of defending her own incorporations but how can she maintain the defenders of her rights or the dispensers of her truths if she refuses upon immutable principle to call in the aid of the magistrate on behalf of rights which under any aspect regard spiritual relations attempting to maintain these rights by private arbitration within a forum of her own she will soon find such arbitration not binding at all upon the party who conceives himself aggrieved the issue will be as in mr oconnells courts where the parties played at going to law from the moment when they ceased to play and no longer made believe to be disputing the award of the judge became as entire a mockery as any stage mimicry of such a transaction this should be the natural catastrophe of the case and the probable evasion of that destructive consummation to which she is carried by her principles will be that as soon as her feelings of rancor shall have cooled down these principles will silently drop out of use and the very reason will be suffered to perish for which she ever became a dissenting body with this however we that stand outside are noways concerned but an evil in which we are concerned is the headlong tendency of the free church and of all churches adulterating with her principle to an issue not merely dangerous in a political sense but ruinous in an antisocial sense the artifice of the free church lies in pleading a spiritual relation of any case whatever whether of doing or suffering whether positive or negative as a reason for taking it out of all civil control now we may illustrate the peril of this artifice by a reality at this time impending over society in ireland dr higgins titular bishop of ardagh has undertaken upon this very plea of a spiritual power not amenable to civil control a sort of warfare with government upon the question of their power to suspend or defeat the oconnell agitation for says he if government should succeed in thus intercepting the direct power of haranguing mobs in open assemblies then will i harangue them and cause them to be harangued in the same spirit upon the same topics from the altar or the pulpit an immediate extension of this principle would be that every disaffected clergyman in the three kingdoms would lecture his congregation upon the duty of paying no taxes this he would denominate passive resistance and resistance to bad government would become in his language the most sacred of duties in any argument with such a man he would be found immediately falling back upon the principle of the free church he would insist upon it as a spiritual right as a ease entirely between his conscience and god whether he should press to an extremity any and every doctrine though tending to the instant disorganization of society to lecture against war and against taxes as directly supporting war would wear a most colorable air of truth amongst all weakminded persons and these would soon appear to have been but the first elements of confusion under the improved views of spiritual rights the doctrines of the levellers in cromwells time of the anabaptists in luthers time would exalt themselves upon the ruins of society if governments were weak enough to recognise these spiritual claims in the feeblest of their initial advances if it were possible to suppose such chimeras prevailing the natural redress would soon be seen to lie through secret tribunals like those of the dreadful fehmgericht in the middle ages it would be absurd however seriously to pursue these antisocial chimeras through their consequences stern remedies would summarily crush so monstrous an evil our purpose is answered when the necessity of such insupportable consequences is shown to link itself with that distinction upon which the free church has laid the foundations of its own establishment once for all there is no act or function belonging to an officer of a church which is not spiritual by one of its two janus faces and every examination of the case convinces us more and more that the seceders took up the old papal distinction as to acts spiritual or not spiritual not under any delusion less or more but under a simple necessity of finding some evasion or other which should meet and embody the whole rancor of the moment but beyond any other evil consequence prepared by the free church is the appalling spirit of jacobinism which accompanies their whole conduct and which latterly has avowed itself in their words the case began jacobinically for it began in attacks upon the rights of property but since the defeat of this faction by the law courts language seems to fail them for the expression of their hatred and affected scorn towards the leading nobility of scotland yet why the case lies in the narrowest compass the duke of sutherland and other great landholders had refused sites for their new churches upon this occurred a strong fact and strong in both directions first for the seceders secondly upon better information against them the record newspaper a religious journal ably and conscientiously conducted took part with the secession and very energetically for they denounced the noble dukes refusal of land as an act of persecution and upon this principle that in a county where his grace was pretty nearly the sole landed proprietor to refuse land assuming that a fair price had been tendered for it was in effect to show such intolerance as might easily tend to the suppression of truth intolerance however is not persecution and if it were the casuistry of the question is open still to much discussion but this is not necessary for the ground is altogether shifted when the dukes reason for refusing the land comes to be stated he had refused it not unconditionally not in the spirit of nonintrusion courts without reason shown but on this unanswerable argument that the whole efforts of the new church were pointed and professedly pointed to the one object of destroying the establishment and sweeping it from the land could any guardian of public interests under so wicked a threat hesitate as to the line of his duty by granting the land to parties uttering such menaces the duke of sutherland would have made himself an accomplice in the unchristian conspiracy meantime next after this fact it is the strongest defence which we can offer for the duke that in a day or two after this charge of persecution the record was forced to attack the seceders in terms which indirectly defended the duke and this not in any spirit of levity but under mere conscientious constraint for no journal has entered so powerfully or so eloquently into the defence of the general principle involved in the secession although questioning its expediency as this particular record consequently any word of condemnation from so earnest a friend comes against the seceders with triple emphasis and this is shown in the tone of the expostulations addressed to the record by some of the secession leaders it spares us indeed all necessity of quoting the vile language uttered by members of the free church assembly if we say that the neutral witnesses of such unchristian outrages have murmured remonstrated protested in every direction and that dr macfarlane who has since corresponded with the duke of sutherland upon the whole case viz upon the petition for land as affected by the shocking menaces of the seceders has in no other way been able to evade the double mischief of undertaking a defence for the indefensible and at the same time of losing the land irretrievably than by affecting an unconsciousness of language used by his party little suited to his own sacred calling or to the noble simplicities of christianity certainly it is unhappy for the seceders that the only disavowal of the most fiendish sentiments heard in our days has come from an individual not authorized or at all commissioned by his party from an individual not showing any readiness to face the whole charges disingenuously dissembling the worst of them and finally offering his very feeble disclaimer which equivocates between a denial and a palliation not until after he found himself in the position of a petitioner for favors specifically the great evil of our days is the abiding temptation in every direction to popular discontent to agitation and to systematic sedition now we say it with sorrow that from no other incendiaries have we heard sentiments so wild fierce or maliciously democratic as from the leaders of the secession it was the reform bill of and the accompanying agitation which first suggested the veto agitation of and prescribed its tone from all classes of our population in turn there have come forward individuals to disgrace themselves by volunteering their aid to the chief conspirators of the age we have earls we have marquesses coming forward as cornleague agents we have magistrates by scores angling for popularity as repealers but these have been private parties insulated disconnected disowned when we hear of christianity prostituted to the service of jacobinism of divinity becoming the handmaid to insurrection and of clergymen in masses offering themselves as promoters of anarchy we go back in thought to that ominous organization of irreligion which gave its most fearful aspects to the french revolution other evils are in the rear as likely to arise out of the funds provided for the new seceders were the distribution of those funds confessedly unobjectionable but more immediately under the present murmurs against that distribution there are two funds one subscribed expressly for the building of churches the other limited to the sustentation of incumbents and the complaint is that this latter fund has been invaded for purposes connected with the first the reader can easily see the motive to this injustice it is a motive of ambition far more display of power is made by the annunciation to the world of six hundred churches built than of any difference this way or that in the comfort and decorous condition of the clergy this last is a domestic feature of the case not fitted for public effect but the number of the churches will resound through europe meantime at present the allowance to the great body of seceding clergy averages but pound symbol ayear and the allegation is that but for the improper interference with the fund on the motive stated it would have averaged pound symbol ayear if anywhere a town parish has raised a much larger provision for its pastor even that has now become a part of the general grievance for it is said that all such special contributions ought to have been thrown into one general fund liable to one general principle of distribution yet again will even this fund partially as it seems to have been divided continue to be available much of it lies in annual subscriptions now in the next generation of subscribers a son will possibly not adopt the views of his father but assuredly he will not adopt his fathers zeal here however though this is not probable there may arise some compensatory cases of subscribers altogether new but another question is pressing for decision which menaces a frightful shock to the schismatical church female agency has been hitherto all potent in promoting the subscriptions and a demand has been made in consequence that women shall be allowed to vote in the church courts grant this demand for it cannot be evaded and what becomes of the model for church government as handed down from john knox and calvin refuse it and what becomes of the future subscriptions but these are evils it may be said only for the seceders not so we are all interested in the respectability of the national teachers whatever be their denomination we are all interested in the maintenance of a high standard for theological education these objects are likely to suffer at any rate but it is even a worse result which we may count on from the changes that a practical approximation is thus already made to what is technically known as voluntaryism the united secession that is the old collective body of scottish dissenters who having no regular provision are carried into this voluntary system already exult that this consummation of the case cannot be far off indeed so far as the seceders are dependent upon annual subscriptions and coupling that relation to the public with the great doctrine of these seceders that congregations are universally to appoint their own pastors we do not see how such an issue is open to evasion the leaders of the new secession all protest against voluntaryism but to that complexion of things they travel rapidly by the mere mechanic action of their dependent or semidependent situation combined with one of their two characteristic principles the same united secession journal openly anticipates another and more diffusive result from this great movement viz the general disruption of church establishments we trust that this anticipation will be signally defeated and yet there is one view of the case which saddens us when we turn our eyes in that direction among the reasonings and expostulations of the schismatic church one that struck us as the most eminently hypocritical and ludicrously so was this you ought said they when addressing the government and exposing the error of the law proceedings to have stripped us of the temporalities arising from the church stipend glebe parsonage but not of the spiritual functions we had no right to the emoluments of our stations when the law courts had decided against us but we had a right to the laborious duties of the stations no gravity could refuse to smile at this complaint verbally so much in the spirit of primitive christianity yet in its tendency so insidious for could it be possible that a competitor introduced by the law and leaving the duties of the pastoral office to the old incumbent but pocketing the salary should not be hooted on the public roads by many who might otherwise have taken no part in the feud this specious claim was a sure and brief way to secure the hatefulness of their successors now we cannot conceal from ourselves that something like this invidious condition of things might be realized under two further revolutions we have said that a second schism in the scottish church is not impossible it is also but too possible that puseyism may yet rend the english establishment by a similar convulsion but in such contingencies we should see a very large proportion of the spiritual teachers in both nations actually parading to the public eye and rehearsing something very like the treacherous proposal of the late seceders viz the spectacle of one party performing much of the difficult duties and another party enjoying the main emoluments this would be a most unfair mode of recommending voluntaryism falling in with the infirmities of many in these days such a spectacle would give probably a fatal bias to that system in our popular and parliamentary counsels this would move the sorrow of the seceders themselves for they have protested against the theory of all voluntaries with a vehemence which that party even complain of as excessive their leaders have many times avowed that any system which should leave to men in general the estimate of their own religious wants as a pecuniary interest would be fatal to the christian tone of our national morals checked and overawed by the example of an establishment the voluntaries themselves are far more fervent in their christian exertions than they could be when liberated from that contrast the religious spirit of both england and scotland under such a change would droop for generations and in that one evil let us hope the remotest and least probable of the many evils threatened by the late schism these nations would have reason by comparison almost to forget the rest toilette of the hebrew lady exhibited in six scenes to the editor of blackwoods magazine sir some years ago you published a translation of bottigers sabina a learned account of the roman toilette i here send you a companion to that work not a direct translation but a very minute abstract from a similar dissertation by hartmann weeded of the wordiness which has made the original unreadable and in consequence unread on the toilette and the wardrobe of the ladies of ancient palestine hartmann was a respectable oriental scholar and he published his researches which occupy three thick octavos making in all one thousand four hundred and eightyeight pages under the title of die hebraerin am putztische und als braut amsterdam the hebrew woman at her toilette and in her bridal character i understand that the poor man is now gone to hades where let us hope that it is considered no crime in a learned man to be exceedingly tedious and to repeat the same thing ten times over or even upon occasion fifteen times provided that his own upright heart should incline him to think that course the most advisable certainly mr hartmann has the most excellent gifts at verbal expansion and at tautology that ever came within my knowledge and i found no particular difficulty in compressing every tittle of what relates to his subject into a compass which i imagine will fill about twelve of your pages or fifty at the utmost of the original work it was not to be expected with the scanty materials before him that an illustrator of the hebrew costume should be as full and explicit as bottiger with the advantage of writing upon a theme more familiar to us europeans of this day than any parallel theme even in our own national archaeologies of two centuries back united however with his great reading this barrenness of the subject is so far an advantage for hartmann as it yields a strong presumption that he has exhausted it the male costume of ancient palestine is yet to be illustrated but for the female it is probable that little could be added to what hartmann has collected footnote and that any clever dressmaker would with the indications here given especially if you could persuade mr blackwood to adopt one or two of mr hartmanns seven outlines enable any lady at the next great masquerade in london to support the part of one of the ancient daughters of palestine and to call back after eighteen centuries of sleep the buried pomps of jerusalem as to the talking there would be no difficulty at all in that point bishops and other sacred people if they ever go amasquing for their own sakes will not be likely to betray themselves by putting impertinent questions in hebrew and for profane people who might like the impertinence they would very much dislike the hebrew indeed of uncircumcised hebrews barring always the clergy it is not thought that any are extant in other respects and as a spectacle the hebrew masque would infallibly eclipse every other in the room the upper and under chemise if managed properly and either you or i mr north would be most proud to communicate our private advice on that subject would transcend in gorgeous display the coronation robes of queens nosependants would cause the masque to be immediately and unerringly recognised or if those were not thought advisable the silver anklebells with their melodious chimes the sandals with their jewelled network and the golden diadem binding the forehead and dropping from each extremity of the polished temples a rouleau of pearls which after traversing the cheeks unite below the chin are all so unique and exclusively hebraic that each and all would have the same advantageous effect proclaiming and notifying the character without putting the fair supporter to any disagreeable expense of hebrew or chaldee the silver bells alone would bear the bell from every competitor in the room and she might besides carry a cymbal a dulcimer or a timbrel in her hands in conclusion my dear north let me congratulate you that mr hartmann is now in hades as i said before rather than in edinburgh for had he been in this latter place he would have been the ruin of you it was his intention as i am well assured just about the time that he took his flight for hades to have commenced regular contributor to your journal so great was his admiration of you and also of the terms which you offer to the literary world as a learned orientalist you could not decorously have rejected him and yet once admitted he would have beggared you before any means could have been discovered by the learned for putting a stop to him greek text aperantologia was his forte upon this he piqued himself and most justly since for covering the ground rapidly and yet not advancing an inch those who knew and valued him as he deserved would have backed him against the whole field of the gens de plume now in europe had he lived and fortunately for himself communicated his hebrew toilette to the world through you instead of foundering as he did at amsterdam he would have flourished upon your exchequer and you would not have heard the last of him or his toilette for the next twenty years he dates you see from amsterdam and had you been weak enough to take him on board he would have proved that flying dutchman that would infallibly have sunk your vessel the more is your obligation to me i think for sweating him down to such slender dimensions and speaking seriously both of us perhaps will rejoice that even with his talents for telling everything he was obliged on this subject to leave many things untold for though it might be gratifying to a mere interest of curiosity yet i believe that we should both be grieved if anything were to unsettle in our feelings the mysterious sanctities of jerusalem or to disturb that awful twilight which will for ever brood over judea by letting in upon it the common light of day and this effect would infallibly take place if any one department of daily life as it existed in judea were brought with all the degrading minutiae of its details within the petty finishing of a domestic portrait farewell my dear north and believe me to be always your old friend and admirer greek text cap omega cap phi scene the first i that simple bodycloth framed of leaves skins flax wool c which modesty had first introduced for many centuries perhaps sufficed as the common attire of both sexes amongst the hebrew bedouins it extended downwards to the knees and upwards to the hips about which it was fastened such a dress is seen upon many of the figures in the sculptures of persepolis even in modern times niebuhr found it the ordinary costume of the lower arabians in hedsjas and shaw assures us that from its commodious shape it is still a favorite dishabille of the arabian women when they are behind the curtains of the tent from this early rudiment was derived by gradual elongation that wellknown under habiliment which in hebrew is called chtonet and in greek and latin by words of similar sound footnote in this stage of its progress when extended to the neck and the shoulders it represents pretty accurately the modern shirt or chemise except that the sleeves are wanting and during the first period of jewish history it was probably worn as the sole undergarment by women of all ranks both amongst the bedouin hebrews and those who lived in cities a very little further extension to the elbows and the calves of the legs and it takes a shape which survives even to this day in asia now as then the female habiliment was distinguished from the corresponding male one by its greater length and through all antiquity we find long clothes a subject of reproach to men as an argument of effeminacy according to the rank or vanity of the wearer this tunic was made of more or less costly materials for wool and flax was often substituted the finest byssus or other silky substance and perhaps in the latter periods amongst families of distinction in jerusalem even silk itself splendor of coloring was not neglected and the opening at the throat was eagerly turned to account as an occasion for displaying fringe or rich embroidery bottiger remarks that even in the age of augustus the morning dress of roman ladies when at home was nothing more than this very tunic which if it sate close did not even require a girdle the same remark applies to the hebrew women who during the nomadic period of their history had been accustomed to wear no nightchemises at all but slept quite naked or at the utmost with a cestus or zone by way of bedclothes however it must be observed that they swathed their person in the folds of a robe or shawl up to the time of solomon this practice obtained through all ranks and so long the universal household dress of a hebrew lady in her harem was the tunic as here described and in this she dressed herself the very moment that she rose from bed indeed so long as the hebrew women were content with a single tunic it flowed loose in liberal folds about the body and was fastened by a belt or a clasp just as we find it at this day amongst all asiatic nations but when a second undergarment was introduced the inner one fitted close to the shape whilst the outer one remained full and free as before ii no fashion of the female toilette is of higher antiquity than that of dyeing the margin of the eyelids and the eyebrows with a black pigment it is mentioned or alluded to kings ix jerem iv ezek xxiii to which may be added isaiah iii the practice had its origin in a discovery made accidentally in egypt for it happens that the substance used for this purpose in ancient times is a powerful remedy in cases of ophthalmia and inflammation of the eyes complaints to which egypt is from local causes peculiarly exposed this endemic infirmity in connection with the medical science for which egypt was so distinguished easily account for their discovering the uses of antimony which is the principal ingredient in the pigments of this class egypt was famous for the fashion of painting the face from an early period and in some remarkable curiosities illustrating the egyptian toilette which were discovered in the catacombs of sahara in middle egypt there was a single joint of a common reed containing an ounce or more of the coloring powder and one of the needles for applying it the entire process was as follows the mineral powder finely prepared was mixed up with a preparation of vinegar and gallapples sometimes with oil of almonds or other oils sometimes by very luxurious women with costly gums and balsams footnote and perhaps as sonnini describes the practice among the mussulman women at present the whole mass thus compounded was dried and again reduced to an impalpable powder and consistency then given to it by the vapors of some odorous and unctuous substance thus prepared the pigment was applied to the tip or pointed ferule of a little metallic pencil called in hebrew makachol and made of silver gold or ivory the eyelids were then closed and the little pencil or probe held horizontally was inserted between them a process which is briefly and picturesquely described in the bible the effect of the black rim which the pigment traced about the eyelid was to throw a dark and majestic shadow over the eye to give it a languishing and yet a lustrous expression to increase its apparent size and to apply the force of contrast to the white of the eye together with the eyelids the hebrew women colored the eyebrows the point aimed at being twofold to curve them into a beautiful arch of brilliant ebony and at the same time to make the inner ends meet or flow into each other iii earrings of gold silver inferior metals or even horn were worn by the hebrew women in all ages and in the flourishing period of the jewish kingdom probably by men and so essential an ornament were they deemed that in the idolatrous times even the images of their false gods were not considered becomingly attired without them their earrings were larger according to the asiatic taste but whether quite large enough to admit the hand is doubtful in a later age as we collect from the thalmud part vi the jewish ladies wore gold or silver pendants of which the upper part was shaped like a lentil and the lower hollowed like a little cup or pipkin it is probable also that even in the oldest ages it was a practice amongst them to suspend gold and silver rings not merely from the lower but also from the upper end of the ear which was perforated like a sieve the tinkling sound with which upon the slightest motion two or three tiers of rings would be set adancing about the cheeks was very agreeable to the baby taste of the asiatics from a very early age the ears of hebrew women were prepared for this load of trinketry for according to the thalmud ii they kept open the little holes after they were pierced by threads or slips of wood a fact which may show the importance they attached to this ornament iv noserings at an early period became a universal ornament in palestine we learn from biblical and from arabic authority that it was a practice of patriarchal descent amongst both the african and asiatic bedouins to suspend rings of iron wood or braided hair from the nostrils of camels oxen c the rope by which the animal was guided being attached to these rings it is probable therefore that the early hebrews who dwelt in tents and who in the barrenness of desert scenery drew most of their hints for improving their personal embellishment from the objects immediately about them were indebted for their noserings to this precedent of their camels sometimes a ring depended from both nostrils and the size of it was equal to that of the earring so that at times its compass included both upper and under lip as in the frame of a picture and in the age succeeding to solomons reign we hear of rings which were not less than three inches in diameter hebrew ladies of distinction had sometimes a cluster of noserings as well for the tinkling sound which they were contrived to emit as for the shining light which they threw off upon the face that the nosering possessed no unimportant place in the jewish toilette is evident from its being ranked during the nomadic state of the israelites as one of the most valuable presents that a young hebrew woman could receive from her lover amongst the midianites who were enriched by the caravan commerce even men adopted this ornament and this appears to have been the case in the family to which job belonged chap xli under these circumstances we should naturally presume that the jewish courtezans in the cities of palestine would not omit so conspicuous a trinket with its glancing lights and its tinkling sound this we might presume even without the authority of the bible but in fact both isaiah and ezekiel expressly mention it amongst their artifices of attraction judith when she appeared before the tent of holofernes in the whole pomp of her charms and appareled with the most elaborate attention to splendor of effect for the purpose of captivating the hostile general did not omit this ornament even the jewish proverbs show how highly it was valued and that it continued to be valued in later times appears from the ordinances of the thalmud ii in respect to the parts of the female wardrobe which were allowed to be worn on the sabbath v the hebrew women of high rank in the flourishing period of their state wore necklaces composed of multiple rows of pearls the thread on which the pearls were strung was of flax or woollen and sometimes colored as we learn from the thalmud vi and the different rows were not exactly concentric but whilst some invested the throat others descended to the bosom and in many cases even to the zone on this part of the dress was lavished the greatest expense and the roman reproach was sometimes true of a hebrew family that its whole estate was locked up in a necklace tertullian complains heavily of a particular pearl necklace which had cost about ten thousand pounds of english money as of an enormity of extravagance but after making every allowance for greater proximity to the pearl fisheries and for other advantages enjoyed by the people of palestine there is reason to believe that some hebrew ladies possessed single pearls which had cost at least five times that sum footnote so much may be affirmed without meaning to compare the most lavish of the ladies of jerusalem with those of rome where it is recorded of some elegantes that they actually slept with little bags of pearls suspended from their necks that even when sleeping they might have mementos of their pomp but the hebrew necklaces were not always composed of pearls or of pearls only sometimes it was the custom to interchange the pearls with little golden bulbs or berries sometimes they were blended with the precious stones and at other times the pearls were strung two and two and their beautiful whiteness relieved by the interposition of red coral vi next came the bracelets of gold or ivory and fitted up at the open side with a buckle or enamelled clasp of elaborate workmanship these bracelets were also occasionally composed of gold or silver thread and it was not unusual for a series of them to ascend from the wrist to the elbow from the clasp or other fastening of the bracelet depended a delicate chainwork or netting of gold and in some instances miniature festoons of pearls sometimes the gold chainwork was exchanged for little silver bells which could be used upon occasion as signals of warning or invitation to a lover vii this bijouterie for the arms naturally reminded the hebrew lady of the anklebells and other similar ornaments for the feet and legs these ornaments consisted partly in golden belts or rings which descending from above the ankle compressed the foot in various parts and partly in shells and little jingling chains which depended so as to strike against clappers fixed into the metallic belts the pleasant tinkle of the golden belts in collision the chains rattling and the melodious chime of little silver anklebells keeping time with the motions of the foot made an accompaniment so agreeable to female vanity that the stately daughters of jerusalem with their sweeping trains flowing after them appear to have adopted a sort of measured tread by way of impressing a regular cadence upon the music of their feet the chains of gold were exchanged as luxury advanced for strings of pearls and jewels which swept in snaky folds about the feet and ankles this like many other peculiarities in the hebrew dress had its origin in a circumstance of their early nomadic life it is usual with the bedouins to lead the camel when disposed to be restive by a rope or a belt fastened to one of the fore feet sometimes to both and it is also a familiar practice to soothe and to cheer the longsuffering animal with the sound of little bells attached either to the neck or to one of the fore legs girls are commonly employed to lead the camels to water and it naturally happened that with their lively fancies some hebrew or arabian girl should be prompted to repeat on her own person what had so often been connected with an agreeable impression in her mule companions to the well it is probable however that afterwards having once been introduced this fashion was supported and extended by oriental jealousy for it rendered all clandestine movements very difficult in women and by giving notice of their approach it had the effect of preparing men for their presence and keeping the road free from all spectacles that could be offensive to female delicacy from the hebrew bedouins this custom passed to all the nations of asia medes persians lydians arabs c and is dwelt on with peculiar delight by the elder arabic poets that it had spread to the westernmost parts of africa early in the christian times we learn from tertullian who cannot suppress his astonishment that the foolish women of his time should bear to inflict such compression upon their tender feet even as early as the times of herodotus we find from his account of a lybian nation that the women and girls universally wore copper rings about their ankles and at an after period these ornaments were so much cherished by the egyptian ladies that sooner than appear in public without their tinkling anklechimes they preferred to bury themselves in the loneliest apartments of the harem finally the fashion spread partially into europe to greece even and to polished rome in so far as regarded the anklebelts and the other ornamental appendages with the single exception of the silver bells these were too entirely in the barbaresque taste to support themselves under the frown of european culture viii the first rude sketch of the hebrew sandal may be traced in that little tablet of undrest hide which the arabs are in the habit of tying beneath the feet of their camels this primitive form after all the modifications and improvements it has received still betrays itself to an attentive observer in the verylatest fashions of the sandal which palestine has adopted to raw hides succeeded tanned leather made of goatskin deerskin c this after being accurately cut out to the shape of the sole was fastened on the bare upper surface of the foot by two thongs of which one was usually carried within the great toe and the other in many circumvolutions round about the ankles so that both finally met and tied just above the instep the laced sole or sandal of this form continued in palestine to be the universal outofdoors protection for the feet up to the christianera and it served for both sexes alike it was not however worn within doors at the threshold of the inner apartments the sandals were laid aside and visitors from a distance were presented with a vessel of water to cleanse the feet from the soiling of dust and perspiration footnote with this extreme simplicity in the form of the foot apparel there was no great field for improvement the article contained two parts the sole and the fastening the first as a subject for decoration was absolutely desperate coarse leather being exchanged for fine all was done that could be done and the wit of man was able to devise no further improvement hence it happened that the whole power of the inventive faculty was accumulated upon the fastenings as the only subject that remained these were infinitely varied belts of bright yellow of purple and of crimson were adopted by ladies of distinction especially those of palestine and it was a trial of art to throw these into the greatest possible varieties of convolution and to carry them on to a nexus of the happiest form by which means a reticulation or trelliswork was accomplished of the most brilliant coloring which brought into powerful relief the dazzling color of the skin it is possible that in the general rage for ornaments of gold which possessed the people of palestine during the ages of excessive luxury the beauties of jerusalem may have adopted gilt sandals with gilt fastenings as the ladies of egypt did it is possible also that the hebrew ladies adopted at one time in exchange for the sandal slippers that covered the entire foot such as were once worn at babylon and are still to be seen on many of the principal figures on the monuments of persepolis and if this were really so ample scope would in that case have been obtained for inventive art variations without end might then have been devised on the fashion or the materials of the subject and by means of color embroidery and infinite combinations of jewellery and pearls an unceasing stimulation of novelty applied to the taste of the gorgeous asiatic ix the veil of various texture coarse or fine according to circumstances was thrown over the head by the hebrew lady when she was unexpectedly surprised or when a sudden noise gave reason to expect the approach of a stranger this beautiful piece of drapery which flowed back in massy folds over the shoulders is particularly noticed by isaiah as holding an indispensable place in the wardrobe of his haughty countrywomen and in this it was that the enamored hebrew woman sought the beloved of her heart addenda to scene the first i of the hebrew ornaments for the throat some were true necklaces in the modern sense of several rows the outermost of which descended to the breast and had little pendulous cylinders of gold in the poorer classes of copper so contrived as to make a jingling sound on the least motion of the person others were more properly golden stocks or throatbands fitted so close as to produce in the spectator an unpleasant imagination and in the wearer as we learn from the thalmud vi until reconciled by use an actual feeling of constriction approaching to suffocation necklaces were from the earliest times a favorite ornament of the male sex in the east and expressed the dignity of the wearer as we see in the instances of joseph of daniel c indeed the gold chain of office still the badge of civic and until lately of military dignities is no more than the outermost row of the oriental necklace philo of alexandria and the other arabian poets give us some idea of the importance attached by the women of asia to this beautiful ornament and of the extraordinary money value which it sometimes bore and from the case of the necklace of gold and amber in the th odyssey v combined with many other instances of the same kind there can be no doubt that it was the neighboring land of phoenicia from which the hebrew women obtained their necklaces and the practice of wearing them ii the fashion however of adorning the necklace with golden suns and moons so agreeable to the hebrew ladies of isaiahs time chap iii was not derived from phoenicia but from arabia at an earlier period judges viii the camels of the midianites were adorned with golden moons which also decorated the necks of the emirs of that nomadic tribe these appendages were not used merely by way of ornament but originally as talismans or amulets against sickness danger and every species of calamity to which the desert was liable the particular form of the amulet is to be explained out of the primitive religion which prevailed in arabia up to the rise of mahometanism in the seventh century of christianity viz the sabean religion or worship of the heavenly host sun moon and stars the most natural of all modes of idolatry and especially to a nomadic people in flat and pathless deserts without a single waymark or guidance for their wanderings except what they drew from the silent heavens above them it is certain therefore that long before their emigration into palestine the israelites had received the practice of wearing suns and moons from the midianites even after their settlement in palestine it is certain that the worship of the starry host struck root pretty deeply at different periods and that to the sun and moon in particular were offered incense and libations from arabia this fashion diffused itself over many countries footnote and it was not without great displeasure that in a remote age jerome and tertullian discovered this idolatrous ornament upon the bosoms of their countrywomen the crescents or halfmoons of silver in connection with the golden suns footnote were sometimes set in a brilliant frame that represented a halo and still keep their ground on the persian and turkish toilette as a favorite ornament iii the golden snakes worn as one of the hebrew appendages to the necklace had the same idolatrous derivation and originally were applied to the same superstitious use as an amulet or prophylactic ornament to minds predisposed to this sort of superstition the serpent came specially recommended under the circumstances of the hebrews from the conspicuous part which this reptile sustains in the mythologies of the east from the earliest periods to which tradition ascends serpents of various species were consecrated to the religious feelings of egypt by temples sacrifices and formal rites of worship this mode of idolatry had at various periods infected palestine according to kings xviii at the accession of king hezekiah the israelites had raised peculiar altars to a great brazen serpent and burned incense upon them even at this day the abyssinians have an unlimited reverence for serpents and the blacks in general regard them as fit subjects for divine honors sonnini ii tells us that a serpents skin is still looked upon in egypt as a prophylactic against complaints of the head and also as a certain cure for them and of the same origin no doubt was the general belief of antiquity according to pliny that the serpents skin was a remedy for spasms that the golden serpent kept its place as an ornament of the throat and bosom after the christian era we learn from clement of alexandria that zealous father so intolerant of superstitious mummery under every shape directs his efforts against this fashion as against a device of the devil iv to the lowest of the several concentric circles which composed the necklace was attached a little box exquisitely wrought in silver or gold sometimes an onyx phial of dazzling whiteness depending to the bosom or even to the cincture and filled with the rarest aromas and odorous spices of the east what were the favorite essences preserved in this beautiful appendage to the female costume of palestine it is not possible at this distance of time to determine with certainty isaiah having altogether neglected the case and hosea who appears to allude to it ii having only once distinctly mentioned it ii however the thalmud particularizes musk and the delightful oil distilled from the leaf of the aromatic malabathrum of hindostan to these we may venture to add oil of spikenard myrrh balsams attar of roses and rosewater as the perfumes usually contained in the hebrew scentpendants rosewater which i am the first to mention as a hebrew perfume had as i presume a foremost place on the toilette of a hebrew belle express scriptural authority for it undoubtedly there is none but it is notorious that palestine availed itself of all the advantages of egypt amongst which the rose in every variety was one fium a province of central egypt which the ancients called the garden of egypt was distinguished for innumerable species of the rose and especially for those of the most balsamic order and for the most costly preparations from it the thalmud not only speaks generally of the mixtures made by tempering it with oil i but expressly cites ii a peculiar rosewater as so costly an essence that from its high price alone it became impossible to introduce the use of it into the ordinary medical practice indeed this last consideration and the fact that the highlyprized quintessence cannot be obtained except from an extraordinary multitude of the rarest roses forbid us to suppose that women of the first rank in jerusalem could have made a very liberal use of rosewater in our times savary found a single phial of it in the place of its manufacture valued at four francs as to the oil of roses properly so called which floats in a very inconsiderable quantity upon the surface of distilled rosewater it is certain that the hebrew ladies were not acquainted with it this preparation can be obtained only from the balsamic roses of fium of shiras of kerman and of kashmire which surpass all the roses of the earth in power and delicacy of odor and it is matter of absolute certainty and incontrovertibly established by the celebrated langles that this oil which even in the four asiatic countries just mentioned ranks with the greatest rarities and in shiras itself is valued at its weight in gold was discovered by mere accident on occasion of some festival solemnity in the year v to what i said in the first scene of my exhibition about the hebrew earornaments i may add that sometimes as best remarked of the hindoo dancinggirls their ears were swollen from the innumerable perforations drilled into them to support their loads of trinketry that in the large pendants of coral which the hebrew ladies were accustomed to attach to their ears either in preference to jewels or in alternation with jewels they particularly delighted in that configuration which imitated a cluster of grapes that in earrings made of gold they preferred the form of drops or of globes and bulbs that of all varieties however of this appendage pearls maintained the preference amongst the ladies of palestine and were either strung upon a thread or attached by little hooks singly or in groups according to their size this taste was very early established amongst the jews and chiefly perhaps through their intercourse with the midianites amongst whom we find the great emirs wearing pearl ornaments of this class mutatis mutandis these four remarks apply to the case of the nose ornaments scene the second i the hair this section i omit altogether though with more room at my disposal it would be well worth translating as a curiosity it is the essay of a finished and perfect knave who not merely being rather bare of facts but having literally not one solitary fact of any kind or degree sits down to write a treatise on the mode of dressing hair amongst hebrew ladies samsons hair and the dressing it got from the philistines is the nearest approach that he ever makes to his subject and being conscious that this case of samson and the philistines is the one sole allusion to the subject of hebrew hair that he is possessed of he brings it round upon the reader as often perhaps as it will bear viz not oftener than once every sixth page the rest is one continued shuffle to avoid coming upon the ground and upon the whole though too barefaced yet really not without ingenuity take by way of specimen his very satisfactory dissertation on the particular sort of combs which the hebrew ladies were pleased to patronize combs whether the ladies of palestine had upon their toilette a peculiar comb for parting the hair another for turning it up c as likewise whether their combs were as in ancient rome made of boxwood or of ivory or other costly and appropriate material all these are questions upon which i am not able upon my honor to communicate the least information but from the general silence of antiquity prophets and all footnote upon the subject of hebrew combs my own private opinion is that the ladies used their fingers for this purpose in which case there needs no more to be said on the subject of hebrew combs ii perfumes before however the hair received its final arrangement from the hands of the waiting maid it was held open and dishevelled to receive the fumes of frankincense aloeswood cassia costmary and other odorous woods gums balsams and spices of india arabia or palestine placed upon glowing embers in vessels of golden fretwork it is probable also that the hebrew ladies used amber bisam and the musk of thibet and when fully arranged the hair was sprinkled with oil of nard myrrh oil of cinnamon c the importance attached to this part of the hebrew toilette may be collected indeed from an ordinance of the thalmud iii which directs that the bridegroom shall set apart onetenth of the income which the bride brings him for the purchase of perfumes essences precious ointments c all these articles were preserved either in golden boxes or in little oval narrownecked phials of dazzling white alabaster which bore the name of onyx from its resemblance to the precious stone of that name but was in fact a very costly sort of marble obtained in the quarries of upper egypt or those of the libanus in syria indeed long before the birth of christ alabaster was in such general use for purposes of this kind in palestine that it became the generic name for valuable boxes no matter of what material to prevent the evaporation of the contents the narrow neck of the phial was resealed every time that it was opened it is probable also that the myrrhine cups about which there has been so much disputing were no strangers to the jewish toilette iii the mirror was not made of glass for glass mirrors cannot be shown to have existed before the thirteenth century but of polished metals and amongst these silver was in the greatest esteem as being capable of a higher burnish than other metals and less liable to tarnish metallic mirrors are alluded to by job xxxvii but it appears from the second book of moses xxxviii that in that age copper must have been the metal employed throughout the harems of palestine for a general contribution of mirrors being made upon one occasion by the israelitish women they were melted down and recast into washing vessels for the priestly service now the sacred utensils as we know from other sources were undeniably of copper there is reason to think however that the copper was alloyed according to the prevailing practice in that age with some proportions of lead or tin in after ages when silver was chiefly employed it gave place occasionally to gold mines of this metal were well known in palestine but there is no evidence that precious stones which were used for this purpose in the ages of european luxury were ever so used in palestine or in any part of asia as to shape the hebrew mirrors were always either circular or oval and cast indifferently flat or concave they were framed in superb settings often of pearls and jewels and when tarnished were cleaned with a sponge of hyssop the universal cleansing material in palestine scene the third headdresses the headdresses of the hebrew ladies may be brought under three principal classes the first was a network cap made of fine wool or cotton and worked with purple or crimson flowers sometimes the meshes of the net were of gold thread the rim or border of the cap generally of variegated coloring was often studded with jewellery or pearls and at the back was ornamented with a bow having a few ends or tassels flying loose secondly a turban managed in the following way first of all one or more caps in the form of a half oval such are still to be seen upon the monuments of egyptian and persepolitan art was fastened round the head by a ribbon or fillet tied behind this cap was of linen sometimes perhaps of cotton and in the inferior ranks of leather or according to the prevailing fashion of some kind of metal and in any case it had ornaments worked into its substance round this white or glittering ground were carried in snaky windings ribbons of the finest tiffany or of lawn resembling our cambric and to conceal the joinings a silky substance was carried in folds which pursued the opposite direction and crossed the tiffany at right angles for the purpose of calling out and relieving the dazzling whiteness of the ground colors of the most brilliant class were chosen for the ribbons and these ribbons were either embroidered with flowers in gold thread or had ornaments of that description interwoven with their texture thirdly the helmet adorned pretty nearly as the turban and in imitation of the helmets worn by chaldean generals having long tails or tassels depending from the hinder part and flowing loosely between the shoulders according to the oriental taste for perfumes all the ribbons or fillets used in these helmets and turbans were previously steeped in perfumes finally in connection with the turban and often with the veil was a beautiful ornament for the forehead and the face which the ladies of this day would do well to recall round the brow ran a brandeau or tiara of gold or silver three fingers breadth and usually set with jewels or pearls from this at each of the temples depended a chain of pearls or of coral which following the margin of the cheeks either hung loose or united below the chin scene the fourth i the reader has been already made acquainted with the chemise or innermost underdress the hebrew ladies however usually wore two underdresses the upper of which it now remains to describe in substance it was generally of a fine transparent texture like the muslins if we may so call them of cos in the later ages it was no doubt of silk the chemise sate up close to the throat and we have already mentioned the elaborate work which adorned it about the opening but the opening of the robe which we are now describing was of much larger compass being cut down to the bosom and the embroidery c which enriched it was still more magnificent the chemise reached down only to the calf of the leg and the sleeve of it to the elbow but the upper chemise or tunic if we may so call it descended in ample draperies to the feet scarcely allowing the point of the foot to discover itself and the sleeves enveloped the hands to their middle great pomp was lavished on the folds of the sleeves but still greater on the hem of the robe and the fringe attached to it the hem was formed by a broad border of purple shaded and relieved according to patterns and sometimes embroidered in gold thread with the most elegant objects from the animal or vegetable kingdoms to that part which fell immediately behind the heels there were attached thin plates of gold or by way of variety it was studded with golden stars and filigreework sometimes with jewels and pearls interchangeably ii on this upper tunic to confine the exorbitance of its draperies and to prevent their interfering with the free motions of the limbs a superb girdle was bound about the hips here if anywhere the hebrew ladies endeavored to pour out the whole pomp of their splendor both as to materials and workmanship belts from three to four inches broad of the most delicate cottony substance were chosen as the ground of this important part of female attire the finest flowers of palestine were here exhibited in rich relief and in their native colors either woven in the loom or by the needle of the embroiderer the belts being thirty or forty feet long and carried round and round the person it was in the power of the wearer to exhibit an infinite variety of forms by allowing any fold or number of folds at pleasure to rise up more or less to view just as fans or the colored edges of books with us are made to exhibit landscapes c capable of great varieties of expansion as they are more or less unfolded the fastening was by a knot below the bosom and the two ends descended below the fringe which if not the only fashion in use was however the prevailing one as we learn both from the sculptures at persepolis and from the costume of the high priest great as the cost was of these girdles it would have been far greater had the knot been exchanged for a clasp and in fact at a later period when this fashion did really take place there was no limit to the profusion with which pearls of the largest size and jewellery were accumulated upon this conspicuous centre of the dress latterly the girdles were fitted up with beautiful chains by means of which they could be contracted or enlarged and with gold buckles and large bosses and clasps that gradually became the basis for a ruinous display of expenditure in conclusion i must remark that in palestine as elsewhere the girdle was sometimes used as a purse whether it were that the girdle itself was made hollow as is expressly affirmed of the high priests girdle or that without being hollow its numerous foldings afforded a secure depository for articles of small size even in our day it is the custom to conceal the dagger the handkerchief for wiping the face and other bagatelles of personal convenience in the folds of the girdle however the richer and more distinguished classes in palestine appear to have had a peculiar and separate article of that kind and this was iii a purse made either of metal usually gold or silver or of the softest leather c which was attached by a lace to the girdle or kept amongst its folds and which even in the eyes of isaiah was important enough to merit a distinct mention it was of a conical shape and at the broader end was usually enriched with ornaments of the most elaborate and exquisite workmanship no long time after the christian era the cost of these purses had risen to such a height that tertullian complains with great displeasure of the ladies of his time that in the mere purse apart from its contents they carried about with them the price of a considerable estate the girdle however still continued to be the appropriate depository for the napkin to use the old english word or suclatory i e handkerchief for clearing the forehead of perspiration as to pockethandkerchiefs in our northern use of them it has been satisfactorily shown by bottiger in a german journal that the greek and roman ladies knew nothing of that modern appendage to the pocket footnote however indispensable it may appear to us and the same argument apply with equal force to the climate of palestine iv the glittering rings with which according to isaiah iii the hebrew ladies adorned their hands seem to me originally to have been derived from the sealrings which whether suspended from the neck or worn upon the finger have in all ages been the most favorite ornament of asiatics these splendid baubles were naturally in the highest degree attractive to women both from the beauty of the stones which were usually selected for this purpose and from the richness of the setting to say nothing of the exquisite art which the ancient lapidaries displayed in cutting them the stones chiefly valued by the ladies of palestine were rubies emeralds and chrysolithes and these set in gold sparkled on the middle or little finger of the right hand and in the luxurious times upon all the fingers even the thumb nay in some cases upon the great toe scene the fifth upper garment the upper or outer garments which for both sexes under all varieties and modifications the hebrews expressed by the comprehensive denomination of simlah have hi every age and through all parts of the hot climates in asia and africa alike been of such voluminous compass as not only to envelop the whole person but to be fitted for a wide range of miscellaneous purposes sometimes as in the triumphal entry of christ into jerusalem they were used as carpets sometimes as coverings for the backs of camels horses or asses to render the riders seat less incommodious sometimes as a bed coverlid or counterpane at other times as sacks for carrying articles of value or finally as curtains hangings of parlors occasionally tapestry or even as sails for boats from these illustrations of the uses to which it was applicable we may collect the form of this robe that it was nothing more than a shawl of large dimensions or long square of cloth just as it came from the weavers loom which was immediately thrown round the person without receiving any artificial adjustment to the human shape so much for the form with regard to the material there was less uniformity originally it was of goats or camels hair but as civilization and the luxury of cities increased these coarse substances were rejected for the finest wool and indian cotton indeed through all antiquity we find that pure unsullied white was the festal color and more especially in palestine where the indigenous soaps and other cleaning materials gave them peculiar advantages for adopting a dress of that delicate and perishable lustre with the advance of luxury however came a love of variety and this added to the desire for more stimulating impressions than could be derived from blank unadorned white gradually introduced all sorts of innovations both in form and color though with respect to the first amidst all the changes through which it travelled the old original outline still manifestly predominated an account of the leading varieties we find in the celebrated third chapter of isaiah the most opulent women of palestine beyond all other colors for the upper robe preferred purple or if not purple throughout the entire robe at any rate purple flowers upon a white ground the winter clothing of the very richest families in palestine was manufactured in their own houses and for winter clothing more especially the hebrew taste no less than the grecian and the roman preferred the warm and sunny scarlet the puce color the violet and the regal purple footnote very probable it is that the hebrew ladies like those of greece were no strangers to the halfmantle fastened by a clasp in front of each shoulder and suffered to flow in free draperies down the back this was an occasional and supernumerary garment flung over the regular upper robe properly so called there was also a longer mantle reaching to the ankles usually of a violet color which having no sleeves was meant to expose to view the beauty not only of the upper robe but even of the outer tunic formerly described by the way it should be mentioned that in order to steep them in fine odor all parts of the wardrobe were stretched on a reticulated or grated vessel called by the thalmud vi kanklin from which the steams of rich perfumes were made to ascend in what way the upper robe was worn and fastened may be collected perhaps with sufficient probability from the modern oriental practice as described by travellers but as we have no direct authority on the subject i shall not detain the reader with any conjectural speculations scene the sixth dress of ceremony one magnificent dress remains yet to be mentioned viz the dress of honor or festival dress which answers in every respect to the modern caftan this was used on all occasions of ceremony as splendid weddings presentations at the courts of kings sumptuous entertainments c and all persons who stood in close connection with the throne as favorites crownofficers distinguished military commanders c received such a dress as a gift from the royal treasury in order to prepare them at all times for the royal presence according to the universal custom of asia the trains were proportioned in length to the rank of the wearer whence it is that the robes of the highpriest were adorned with a train of superb dimensions and even jehovah is represented isaiah vi as filling the heavenly palace with the length of his train footnote another distinction of this festival robe was the ordinary fulness and length of the sleeves these descended to the knee and often ran to the ankle or to the ground in the sleeves and in the trains but especially in the latter lay the chief pride of a hebrew belle when dressed for any great solemnity or occasion of public display notes note it is one great advantage to the illustrator of ancient costume that when almost everything in this sort of usages was fixed and determined either by religion and state policy as with the jews or by state policy alone as with the romans or by superstition and by settled climate as with both and when there was no stimulation to vanity in the love of change from an inventive condition of art and manufacturing skill and where the system and interests of the government relied for no part of its power on such a condition dress was stationary for ages both as to materials and fashion rebecca the bedouin was drest pretty nearly as mariamne in the age of the caesars and thus the labors of a learned investigator for one age are valid for those which follow and precede note chiton in greek and by inversion of the syllables tunica in latin note cheaper materials were used by the poorer hebrews especially of the bedouin tribes burnt almonds lampblack soot the ashes of particular woods the gallapple boiled and pulverized or any dark powder made into an unguent by suitable liquors the modern grecian women in some districts as sonnini tells us use the spine of the seapolypus calcined and finely pulverized for this purpose boxes of horn were used for keeping the pigment by the poorer hebrews of onyx or alabaster by the richer note cleopatra had a couple of that value and julius caesar had one which he gave to servilia the beautiful mother of brutus note washing the feet was a ceremony of ancient times adopted not merely with a view st to personal comfort in hotter climates or d to decorum of appearance where people walked about barefooted but also d to the reclining posture in use at meals which necessarily brought the feet into immediate contact with the cushions squabs c of couches note chemistry had its first origin in arabia and it is not impossible that the chemical nomenclature for gold and silver viz sol and luna were derived from this early superstition of the bedouin dress note the thalmud is the only jewish authority which mentions such a utensil of the toilette as a comb vi but without any particular description hartmann adds two remarks worth quoting that the hebrew style of the coiffure may probably be collected from the syrian coins and that black hair being admired in palestine and the jewish hair being naturally black it is probable that the jewish ladies did not color their hair as the romans did note or rather it was required only in a catarrh or other cases of checked perspiration which in those climates was not a case of common occurrence note by which was probably meant a color nearer to crimson than to the blue class of purples note it has been doubted whether these trains were supported by trainbearers but one argument makes it probable that they were not viz that they were particularly favorable to the peacock walk or strut which was an express object of imitation in the gait of the hebrew women final notes i the syndon mentioned by isaiah c was a delicate and transparent substance like our tiffany and in point of money value was fully on a level with the caftan but whether imported from egypt or imitated in the looms of the hebrews and phoenicians is doubtful it was worn next to the skin and consequently in the harems of the great occupied the place of the under tunic or chemise previously described and as luxury advanced there is reason to think that it was used as a night chemise ii the caftan is the kalaat of the east so often mentioned by modern travellers thus for example thevenot tom iii p says le roi fait assez souvent des presens a ses khans c lon appelle ces presens kalaat chardin iii on appelle calaat les habits que le roi donne par honeur and lately in lord amhersts progress through the northern provinces of our indian empire c we read continually of the khelawt or robe of state as a present made by the native princes to distinguished officers the caftan or festival robe of the hebrews was in my opinion the greek text peaelos of the greeks or palla of the romans among the points of resemblance are these the palla was flung like a cloak or mantle over the stola or uppermost robe ad talos stola demissa et circundata palla the palla not only descended in flowing draperies to the feet thus tibullus i vii c fusa sed ad teneros lutea palla pedes but absolutely swept the ground verrit humum tyrio saturata murice palla the palla was of the same wide compass and equally distinguished for its splendor like the hebrew festival garment the palla was a vestis seposita and reserved for rare solemnities with respect to the greek text peplos eustathius describes it as greek text megan xai peoixallea xai poixilon peobolaion and it would be easy in other respects to prove its identity with the palla salmasius by the way in commenting upon tertullian de pallio is quite wrong where he says palla nunquam de virili pallio dicitur tibullus tom iii iv sufficiently contradicts that opinion milton we have two ideas which we are anxious to bring under public notice with regard to milton the reader whom providence shall send us will not measure the value of these ideas we trust and hope by their bulk the reader indeed that great idea is very often a more important person towards the fortune of an essay than the writer even the prosperity of a jest as shakespeare tells us lies less in its own merit than in the ear of him that hears it if he should happen to be unusually obtuse the wittiest jest perishes the most pointed is found blunt so with regard to books should the reader on whom we build prove a sandy and treacherous foundation the whole edifice temple and tower must come to the ground should it happen for instance that the reader inflicted upon ourselves for our sins belongs to that class of people who listen to books in the ratio of their much speaking find no eloquence in mo and little force of argument except in such a folio as might knock him down upon occasion of his proving restive against its logic in that case he will despise our present essay will despise it he does despise it already for already he sees that it is short his contempt is a high a priori contempt for he measures us by anticipation and needs to wait for no experience in order to vindicate his sentence against us yet in one view this brevity of an essayist does seem to warrant his reader in some little indignation we the writer expect to bring over the reader to our opinion else wherefore do we write but within so small a compass of ground is it reasonable to look for such a result bear witness to the presumption of this essay we hear the reader complaining it measures about fourteen inches by two twentyeight square inches at the most and is it within human belief that i simply as i stand here shall be converted in so narrow an area here am i in a state of nature as you may say an acre of sound argument might do something but here is a man who flatters himself that before i am advanced seven inches further in my studies he is to work a notable change in my creed by castor and pollux he must think very superbly of himself or very meanly of me too true we reply too true but perhaps there are faults on both sides the writer is too peremptory and exacting the reader is too restive the writer is too full of his office which he fancies is that of a teacher or a professor speaking ex cathedra the rebellious reader is oftentimes too determined that he will not learn the one conceits himself booted and spurred and mounted on his readers back with an express commission for riding him the other is vicious apt to bolt out of the course at every opening and resolute in this point that he will not be ridden there are some meantime who take a very different view of the relations existing between those wellknown parties to a book writer and reader so far from regarding the writer as entitled to the homage of his reader as if he were some feudal superior they hold him little better than an actor bowing before the reader as his audience the feudal relation of fealty fidelitas may subsist between them but the places are inverted the writer is the liegeman the reader it is who claims to be the sovereign our own opinion inclines this way it is clear that the writer exists for the sake of the reader not the reader for the sake of the writer besides the writer bears all sorts of characters whilst the reader universally has credit for the best possible we have all heard of the courteous reader the candid reader the enlightened reader but which of us ever heard of the discourteous reader the mulish reader the barbarous reader doubtless there is no such person the goths and vandals are all confined to the writers the reader that great character is ever wise ever learned ever courteous even in the worst of times this great man preserved his purity even in the tenth and eleventh centuries which we usually account the very noontide of darkness he shone like a mould candle amongst basest dips and perhaps it is our duty to presume all other virtues and graces as no less essential to him than his glorious candor his courtesy surpassing that of sir gawain and his truly enlightened understanding indeed we very much question whether a writer who carries with him a just feeling of his allegiance a truly loyal writer can lawfully suppose his sovereign the reader peccable or capable of error and whether there is not even a shade of impiety in conceiving him liable to the affections of sleep or of yawning having thus upon our knees as it were done feudal homage to our great suzerain the reader having propitiated him with persian adorations and with phrygian genuflexions let us now crave leave to convert him a little convert him that sounds un pen fort does it not no not at all a cat may look at a king and upon this or that outoftheway point a writer may presume to be more knowing than his reader the serf may undertake to convert his lord the reader is a great being a great nounsubstantive but still like a mere adjective he is liable to the three degrees of comparison he may rise above himself he may transcend the ordinary level of readers however exalted that level be being great he may become greater full of light he may yet labor with a spot or two of darkness and such a spot we hold the prevalent opinion upon milton in two particular questions of taste questions that are not insulated but diffusive spreading themselves over the entire surface of the paradise lost and also of the paradise regained insomuch that if milton is wrong once then he is wrong by many scores of times nay which transcends all counting of cases or numerical estimates of error if in the separate instances be they few or be they many he is truly and indeed wrong then he has erred not by the case but by the principle and that is a thousand times worse for a separate case or instance of error may escape any man may have been overlooked amongst the press of objects crowding on his eye or if not overlooked if passed deliberately may plead the ordinary privilege of human frailty the man erred and his error terminates in itself but an error of principle does not terminate in itself it is a fountain it is selfdiffusive and it has a life of its own the faults of a great man are in any case contagious they are dazzling and delusive by means of the great mans general example but his false principles have a worse contagion they operate not only through the general haze and halo which invests a shining example but even if transplanted where that example is unknown they propagate themselves by the vitality inherent in all selfconsistent principles whether true or false before we notice these two cases of milton first of all let us ask who and what is milton dr johnson was furiously incensed with a certain man by trade an author and manufacturer of books wholesale and retail for introducing miltons name into a certain index thus milton mr john that mister undoubtedly was hard to digest yet very often it happens to the best of us to men who are far enough from thinking small beer of themselves that about ten oclock a m an official bigwig sitting at bow street calls upon the man to account for his sprees of the last night for his feats in knocking down lampposts and extinguishing watchmen by this ugly demand of who and what are you sir and perhaps the poor man sick and penitential for want of soda water really finds a considerable difficulty in replying satisfactorily to the worthy beeks apostrophe although at five oclock in the evening should the culprit be returning into the country in the same coach as his awful interrogator he might be very apt to look fierce and retort this amiable inquiry and with equal thirst for knowledge to demand d your eyes if you come to that who and what are you and the beek in his turn though so apt to indulge his own curiosity at the expense of the public might find it very difficult to satisfy that of others the same thing happens to authors and to great authors beyond all others so accustomed are we to survey a great man through the cloud of years that has gathered round him so impossible is it to detach him from the pomp and equipage of all who have quoted him copied him echoed him lectured about him disputed about him quarrelled about him that in the case of any anacharsis the scythian coming amongst us any savage that is to say uninstructed in our literature but speaking our language and feeling an interest in our great men a man could hardly believe at first how perplexed he would feel how utterly at a loss for any adequate answer to this question suddenly proposedwho and what was milton that is to say what is the place which he fills in his own vernacular literature what station does he hold in universal literature we if abruptly called upon in that summary fashion to convey a commensurate idea of milton one which might at once correspond to his pretensions and yet be readily intelligible to the savage should answer perhaps thus milton is not an author amongst authors not a poet amongst poets but a power amongst powers and the paradise lost is not a book amongst books not a poem amongst poems but a central force amongst forces let us explain there is this great distinction amongst books some though possibly the best in their class are still no more than books not indispensable not incapable of supplementary representation by other books if they had never been if their place had continued for ages unfilled not the less upon a sufficient excitement arising there would always have been found the ability either directly to fill up the vacancy or at least to meet the same passion virtually though by a work differing in form thus supposing butler to have died in youth and the hudibras to have been intercepted by his premature death still the ludicrous aspects of the parliamentary war and its fighting saints were too striking to have perished if not in a narrative form the case would have come forward in the drama puritanical sanctity in collision with the ordinary interests of life and with its militant propensities offered too striking a field for the satiric muse in any case to have passed in total neglect the impulse was too strong for repression it was a volcanic agency that by some opening or other must have worked a way for itself to the upper air yet butler was a most original poet and a creator within his own province but like many another original mind there is little doubt that he quelled and repressed by his own excellence other minds of the same cast mere despair of excelling him so far as not after all to seem imitators drove back others who would have pressed into that arena if not already brilliantly filled butler failing there would have been another butler either in the same or in some analogous form but with regard to milton and the miltonic power the case is far otherwise if the man had failed the power would have failed in that mode of power which he wielded the function was exhausted in the man species was identified with the individual the poetry was incarnated in the poet let it be remembered that of all powers which act upon man through his intellectual nature the very rarest is that which we moderns call the sublime the grecians had apparently no word for it unless it were that which they meant by greek text to ogchodes for greek text upsos was a comprehensive expression for all qualities which gave a character of grace or animation to the composition such even as were philosophically opposed to the sublime in the roman poetry and especially in lucan at times also juvenal there is an exhibition of a moral sublime perfectly distinct from anything known to the greek poetry the delineations of republican grandeur as expressing itself through the principal leaders in the roman camps or the trampling under foot of ordinary superstitions as given in the reasons assigned to labienus for passing the oracle of the lybian jupiter unconsulted are in a style to which there is nothing corresponding in the whole grecian literature nor would they have been comprehensible to an athenian the famous line jupiter est quodcunque vides quodcunque moveris and the brief review of such questions as might be worthy of an oracular god with the summary declaration that every one of those points we know already by the light of nature and could not know them better though jupiter ammon himself were to impress them on our attention scimus et haec nobis non altius inseret ammon all this is truly roman in its sublimity and so exclusively roman that there and not in poets like the augustan expressly modelling their poems on grecian types ought the roman mind to be studied on the other hand for that species of the sublime which does not rest purely and merely on moral energies but on a synthesis between man and nature for what may properly be called the ethicophysical sublime there is but one great model surviving in the greek poetry viz the gigantic drama of the prometheus crucified on mount elborus and this drama differs so much from everything else even in the poetry of aeschylus as the mythus itself differs so much from all the rest of the grecian mythology belonging apparently to an age and a people more gloomy austere and nearer to the incunabula mundi than those which bred the gay and sunny superstitions of greece that much curiosity and speculation have naturally gathered round the subject of late years laying this one insulated case apart and considering that the hebrew poetry of isaiah and ezekiel as having the benefit of inspiration does not lie within the just limits of competition we may affirm that there is no human composition which can be challenged as constitutionally sublime sublime equally by its conception and by its execution or as uniformly sublime from first to last excepting the paradise lost in milton only first and last is the power of the sublime revealed in milton only does this great agency blaze and glow as a furnace kept up to a white heat without intermission and without collapse if therefore milton occupies this unique position and let the reader question himself closely whether he can cite any other book than the paradise lost as continuously sublime or sublime even by its prevailing character in that case there is a peculiarity of importance investing that one book which belongs to no other and it must be important to dissipate any erroneous notions which affect the integrity of that books estimation now there are two notions countenanced by addison and by dr johnson which tend greatly to disparage the character of its composition if the two critics one friendly the other very malignant but both meaning to be just have in reality built upon sound principles or at least upon a sound appreciation of miltons principles in that case there is a mortal taint diffused over the whole of the paradise lost for not a single book is clear of one or other of the two errors which they charge upon him we will briefly state the objections and then as briefly reply to them by exposing the true philosophy of miltons practice for we are very sure that in doing as he did this mighty poet was governed by no carelessness or oversight as is imagined but by a most refined theory of poetic effects i the first of these two charges respects a supposed pedantry or too ambitious a display of erudition it is surprising to us that such an objection should have occurred to any man both because after all the quantity of learning cannot be great for which any poem can find an opening and because in any poem burning with concentrated fire like the miltonic the passion becomes a law to itself and will not receive into connection with itself any parts so deficient in harmony as a cold ostentation of learned illustrations must always have been found still it is alleged that such words as frieze architrave cornice zenith c are words of art out of place amongst the primitive simplicities of paradise and at war with miltons purpose of exhibiting the paradisaical state now here is displayed broadly the very perfection of ignorance as measured against the very perfection of what may be called poetic science we will lay open the true purpose of milton by a single illustration in describing impressive scenery as occurring in a hilly or a woody country everybody must have noticed the habit which young ladies have of using the word amphitheatre amphitheatre of woods amphitheatre of hills these are their constant expressions why is it because the word amphitheatre is a grecian word we question if one young lady in twenty knows that it is and very certain we are that no word would recommend itself to her use by that origin if she happened to be aware of it the reason lurks here in the word theatre is contained an evanescent image of a great audience of a populous multitude now this image half withdrawn halfflashed upon the eye and combined with the word hills or forests is thrown into powerful collision with the silence of hills with the solitude of forests each image from reciprocal contradiction brightens and vivifies the other the two images act and react by strong repulsion and antagonism this principle we might exemplify and explain at great length but we impose a law of severe brevity upon ourselves and we have said enough out of this one principle of subtle and lurking antagonism may be explained everything which has been denounced under the idea of pedantry in milton it is the key to all that lavish pomp of art and knowledge which is sometimes put forward by milton in situations of intense solitude and in the bosom of primitive nature as for example in the eden of his great poem and in the wilderness of his paradise regained the shadowy exhibition of a regal banquet in the desert draws out and stimulates the sense of its utter solitude and remotion from men or cities the images of architectural splendor suddenly raised in the very centre of paradise as vanishing shows by the wand of a magician bring into powerful relief the depth of silence and the unpopulous solitude which possess this sanctuary of man whilst yet happy and innocent paradise could not in any other way or by any artifice less profound have been made to give up its essential and differential characteristics in a form palpable to the imagination as a place of rest it was necessary that it should be placed in close collision with the unresting strife of cities as a place of solitude with the image of tumultuous crowds as the centre of mere natural beauty in its gorgeous prime with the images of elaborate architecture and of human workmanship as a place of perfect innocence in seclusion that it should be exhibited as the antagonist pole to the sin and misery of social man such is the covert philosophy which governs miltons practice and which might be illustrated by many scores of passages from both the paradise lost and the paradise regained footnote for instance this is the key to that image in the paradise regained where satan on first emerging into sight is compared to an old man gathering sticks to warm him on a winters day this image at first sight seems little in harmony with the wild and awful character of the supreme fiend no it is not in harmony nor is it meant to be in harmony on the contrary it is meant to be in antagonism and intense repulsion the household image of old age of human infirmity and of domestic hearths are all meant as a machinery for provoking and soliciting the fearful idea to which they are placed in collision and as so many repelling poles in fact a volume might be composed on this one chapter and yet from the blindness or inconsiderate examination of his critics this latent wisdom this cryptical science of poetic effects in the mighty poet has been misinterpreted and set down to the account of defective skill or even of puerile ostentation ii the second great charge against milton is prima facie even more difficult to meet it is the charge of having blended the pagan and christian forms the great realities of angels and archangels are continually combined into the same groups with the fabulous impersonations of the greek mythology eve is interlinked in comparisons with pandora sometimes again with eurynome those impersonations however may be thought to have something of allegoric meaning in their conceptions which in a measure corrects this paganism of the idea but eve is also compared with ceres with hebe and other fixed forms of pagan superstition other allusions to the greek mythologic forms or direct combination of them with the real existences of the christian heavens might be produced by scores were it not that we decline to swell our paper beyond the necessity of the case now surely this at least is an error can there be any answer to this at one time we were ourselves inclined to fear that milton had been here caught tripping in this instance at least he seems to be in error but there is no trusting to appearances in meditating upon the question we happened to remember that the most colossal and miltonic of painters had fallen into the very same fault if fault it were in his last judgment michael angelo has introduced the pagan deities in connection with the hierarchy of the christian heavens now it is very true that one great man cannot palliate the error of another great man by committing the same error himself but though it cannot avail as an excuse such a conformity of ideas serves as a summons to a much more vigilant examination of the case than might else be instituted one man might err from inadvertency but that two and both men trained to habits of constant meditation should fall into the same error makes the marvel tenfold greater now we confess that as to michael angelo we do not pretend to assign the precise key to the practice which he adopted and to our feelings after all that might be said in apology there still remains an impression of incongruity in the visual exhibition and direct juxtaposition of the two orders of supernatural existence so potently repelling each other but as regards milton the justification is complete it rests upon the following principle in all other parts of christianity the two orders of superior beings the christian heaven and the pagan pantheon are felt to be incongruous not as the pure opposed to the impure for if that were the reason then the christian fiends should be incongruous with the angels which they are not but as the unreal opposed to the real in all the hands of other poets we feel that jupiter mercury apollo diana are not merely impure conceptions but that they are baseless conceptions phantoms of air nonentities and there is much the same objection in point of just taste to the combination of such fabulous beings in the same groups with glorified saints and angels as there is to the combination by a painter or a sculptor of real fleshandblood creatures with allegoric abstractions this is the objection to such combination in all other poets but this objection does not apply to milton it glances past him and for the following reason milton has himself laid an early foundation for his introduction of the pagan pantheon into christian groups the false gods of the heathen world were according to milton the fallen angels they are not false therefore in the sense of being unreal baseless and having a merely fantastical existence like our european fairies but as having drawn aside mankind from a pure worship as ruined angels under other names they are no less real than the faithful and loyal angels of the christian heavens and in that one difference of the miltonic creed which the poet has brought pointedly and elaborately under his readers notice by his matchless catalogue of the rebellious angels and of their pagan transformations in the very first book of the paradise lost is laid beforehand the amplest foundation for his subsequent practice and at the same time therefore the amplest answer to the charge preferred against him by dr johnson and by so many other critics who had not sufficiently penetrated the latent theory on which he acted charlemagne footnote the history of charlemagne with a sketch and history of france from the fall of the roman empire to the rise of the carlovingian dynasty by gpr james esq vol ii history is sometimes treated under the splendid conception of philosophy teaching by example and sometimes as an old almanac and agreeably to this latter estimate we once heard a celebrated living professor of medicine who has been since distinguished by royal favor and honored with a title making it his boast that he had never charged his memory with one single historical fact that on the contrary he had out of profound contempt for a sort of knowledge so utterly without value in his eyes anxiously sought to extirpate from his remembrance or if that were impossible to perplex and confound any relics of historical records which might happen to survive from his youthful studies and i am happy to say added he and it is consoling to have it in my power conscientiously to declare that although i have not been able to dismiss entirely from my mind some ridiculous fact about a succession of four great monarchies for human infirmity still clings to our best efforts and will forever prevent our attaining perfection still i have happily succeeded in so far confounding all distinctions of things and persons of time and of places that i could not assign the era of any one transaction as i humbly trust within a thousand years the whole vast series of history is become a wilderness to me and my mind as to all such absurd knowledge under the blessing of heaven is pretty nearly a tabula rasa in this gothic expression of selfcongratulation upon the extent of his own ignorance though doubtless founded upon what the germans call an einseitig or onesided estimate there was however that sort of truth which is apprehended only by strong minds and such as naturally adhere to extreme courses certainly the blank knowledge of facts which is all that most readers gather from their historical studies is a mere deposition of rubbish without cohesion and resting upon no basis of theory that is of general comprehensive survey applied to the political development of nations and accounting for the great stages of their internal movements rightly and profitably to understand history it ought to be studied in as many ways as it may be written history as a composition falls into three separate arrangements obeying three distinct laws and addressing itself to three distinct objects its first and humblest office is to deliver a naked unadorned exposition of public events and their circumstances this form of history may be styled the purely narrative the second form is that which may be styled the scenical and the third the philosophic what is meant by philosophic history is well understood in our present advanced state of society and few histories are written except in the simplest condition of human culture which do not in part assume its functions or which are content to rest their entire attraction upon the abstract interest of facts the privileges of this form have however been greatly abused and the truth of facts has been so much forced to bend before preconceived theories whereas every valid theory ought to be abstracted from the facts that mr southey and others in this day have set themselves to decry the whole genus and class as essentially at war with the very primary purposes of the art but under whatever name it is evident that philosophy or an investigation of the true moving forces in every great train and sequence of national events and an exhibition of the motives and the moral consequences in their largest extent which have concurred with these events cannot be omitted in any history above the level of a childish understanding mr southey himself will be found to illustrate this necessity by his practice whilst assailing it in principle as to the other mode of history history treated scenically it is upon the whole the most delightful to the reader and the most susceptible of art and ornament in the hands of a skilful composer the most celebrated specimen in this department is the decline and fall of gibbon and to this class may in part footnote be referred the historical sketches of voltaire histories of this class proceed upon principles of selection presupposing in the reader a general knowledge of the great cardinal incidents and bringing forward into especial notice those only which are susceptible of being treated with distinguished effect these are the three separate modes of treating history each has its distinct purposes and all must contribute to make up a comprehensive total of historical knowledge the first furnishes the facts the second opens a thousand opportunities for pictures of manners and national temper in every stage of their growth whilst the third abstracts the political or the ethical moral and unfolds the philosophy which knits the history of one nation to that of others and exhibits the whole under their internal connection as parts of one great process carrying on the great economy of human improvement by many stages in many regions at one and the same time pursued upon this comprehensive scale the study of history is the study of human nature but some have continued to reject it not upon any objection to the quality of the knowledge gained but simply on the ground of its limited extent contending that in public and political transactions such as compose the matter of history human nature exhibits itself upon too narrow a scale and under too monotonous an aspect that under different names and in connection with different dates and regions events virtually the same are continually revolving that whatever novelty may strike the ear in passages of history taken from periods widely remote affects the names only and circumstances that are extraessential that the passions meantime the motives and allowing for difference of manners the means even are subject to no variety that in ancient or in modern history there is no real accession made to our knowledge of human nature but that all proceeds by cycles of endless repetition and in fact that according to the old complaint there is nothing new under the sun it is not true that there is nothing new under the sun this is the complaint as all men know of a jaded voluptuary seeking for a new pleasure and finding none for reasons which lay in his own vitiated nature why did he seek for novelty because old pleasures had ceased to stimulate his exhausted organs and that was reason enough why no new pleasure had any been found would operate as such for him the weariness of spirit and the poverty of pleasure which he bemoaned as belonging to our human condition were not in reality objective as a german philosopher would express himself or laid in the nature of things and thus pressing upon all alike but subjective that is to say derived from the peculiar state and affections of his own organs for apprehending pleasure not the apprehensibile but the apprehendens was in fault not the pleasures or the dewy freshness of pleasures had decayed but the sensibilities of him who thus undertook to appraise them more truly and more philosophically it may be said that there is nothing old under the sun no absolute repetition it is the wellknown doctrine of leibnitz footnote that amongst the familiar objects of our daily experience there is no perfect identity all in external nature proceeds by endless variety infinite change illimitable novelty inexhaustible difference these are the foundations upon which nature builds and ratifies her purpose of individuality so indispensable amongst a thousand other great uses to the very elements of social distinctions and social rights but for the endless circumstances of difference which characterize external objects the rights of property for instance would have stood upon no certain basis nor admitted of any general or comprehensive guarantee as with external objects so with human actions amidst their infinite approximations and affinities they are separated by circumstances of neverending diversity history may furnish her striking correspondences biography her splendid parallels rome may in certain cases appear but the mirror of athens england of rome and yet after all no character can be cited no great transaction no revolution of highviced cities no catastrophe of nations which in the midst of its resemblances to distant correspondences in other ages docs not include features of abundant distinction and individualizing characteristics so many and so important as to yield its own peculiar matter for philosophical meditation and its own separate moral rare is the case in history or to speak with suitable boldness there is none which does not involve circumstances capable to a learned eye without any external aid from chronology of referring it to its own age the doctrine of leibnitz on the grounds of individuality in the objects of sense may in fact be profitably extended to all the great political actions of mankind many pass in a popular sense for pure transcripts or duplicates of similar cases in past times but accurately speaking none are such truly and substantially neither are the differences by which they are severally marked and featured interesting only to the curiosity or to the spirit of minute research all public acts in the degree in which they are great and comprehensive are steeped in living feelings and saturated with the spirit of their own age and the features of their individuality that is the circumstances which chiefly distinguish them from their nearest parallels in other times and chiefly prevent them from lapsing into blank repetitions of the same identical case are generally the very cardinal points the organs and the depositories which lodge whatever best expresses the temper and tendencies of the age to which they belong so far are these special points of distinction from being slight or trivial that in them par excellence is gathered and concentrated whatever a political philosopher would be best pleased to insulate and to converge within his field of view this indeed is evident upon consideration and is in some sense implied in the very verbal enunciation of the proposition vi termini it should strike every man who reflects that in great national transactions of different ages so far resembling each other as to merit the description of parallels all the circumstances of agreement all those which compose the resemblance for the very reason that they are common to both periods of time specially and characteristically belong to neither it is the differential and not the common the points of special dissimilitude not those of general similitude which manifestly must be looked to for the philosophic valuation of the times or the people for the adjudication of their peculiar claims in a comparison with other times and other people and for the appraisement of the progress made whether positively for its total amount or relatively to itself for its rate of advance at each separate stage it is in this way of critical examination that comparison and the collation of apparent parallels from being a pure amusement of ingenuity rises to a philosophic labor and that the study of history becomes at once dignified and in a most practical sense profitable it is the opinion of the subtlest and the most combining if not the most useful philosopher whom england has produced that a true knowledge of history confers the gift of prophecy or that intelligently and sagaciously to have looked backwards is potentially to have looked forwards for example he is of opinion that any student of the great english civil war in the reign of charles i who should duly have noted the signs precurrent and concurrent of those days and should also have read the contemporary political pamphlets coming thus prepared could not have failed after a corresponding study of the french literature from to and in particular after collecting the general sense and temper of the french people from the cahiers or codes of instruction transmitted by the electoral bodies to the members of the first national assembly to foresee in clear succession the long career of revolutionary frenzy which soon afterwards deluged europe with tears and blood this may perhaps be conceded and without prejudice to the doctrine just now delivered of endless diversity in political events for it is certain that the political movements of nations obey everlasting laws and travel through the stages of known cycles which thus insure enough of resemblance to guarantee the general outline of a sagacious prophecy whilst on the other hand the times the people and the extraordinary minds which in such critical eras soon reveal themselves at the head of affairs never fail of producing their appropriate and characteristic results of difference sameness enough there will always be to encourage the true political seer with difference enough to confer upon each revolution its separate character and its peculiar interest all this is strikingly illustrated in the history of those great revolutionary events which belong to the life and times of the emperor charlemagne if any one period in history might be supposed to offer a barren and unprofitable picture of war rapine and bloodshed unfeatured by characteristic differences and unimproved by any peculiar moral it is this section of the european annals removed from our present times by a thousand years divided from us by the profound gulf of what we usually denominate the dark ages placed in fact entirely upon the farther footnote side of that great barrier this period of history can hardly be expected to receive much light from contemporary documents in an age so generally illiterate not from national archives or state papers when diplomacy was so rare when so large a proportion of its simple transactions was conducted by personal intercourse and after the destruction wrought amongst its slender chancery of written memorials by the revolution of one entire millenium still less could we have reason to hope for much light from private memoirs at a period when the means of writing were as slenderly diffused as the motives when the rare endowments natural and acquired for composing history could so seldom happen to coincide with the opportunities for obtaining accurate information when the writers were so few and the audience so limited and so widely dispersed to which they could then profitably address themselves with or without illustration however the age itself and its rapid succession of wars between barbarous and semibarbarous tribes might if any one chapter in history be presumed barren of either interest or instruction wearisomely monotonous and by comparison with any parallel section from the records of other nations in the earliest stages of dawning civilization offering no one feature of novelty beyond the names of the combatants their local and chronological relations and the peculiar accidents and unimportant circumstances of variety in the conduct or issue of the several battles which they fought yet in contradiction to all these very plausible presumptions even this remote period teems with its own peculiar and separate instruction it is the first great station so to speak which we reach after entering the portals of modern footnote history it presents us with the evolution and propagation of christianity in its present central abodes with the great march of civilization and the gathering within the pale of that mighty agency for elevating human nature and beneath the gentle yoke of the only true and beneficent religion of the last rebellious recusants among the european family of nations we meet also in conjunction with the other steps of the vast humanizing process then going on the earliest efforts at legislation recording at the same time the barbarous condition of those for whom they were designed and the antibarbarous views and aspirations of the legislator in the midst of his condescensions to the infirmities of his subjects here also we meet with the elementary state growing and as yet imperfectly rooted of feudalism here too we behold in their incunabula forming and arranging themselves under the pressure of circumstances the existing kingdoms of christendom so far then from being a mere echo or repetition of other passages in history the period of charlemagne is rich and novel in its instruction and almost we might say unique in the quality of that instruction for here only perhaps we see the social system forming itself in the mine and the very process as it were of crystallization going on beneath our eyes mr james therefore may be regarded as not less fortunate in the choice of his subject than meritorious in its treatment indeed his work is not so much the best as the only history of charlemagne which will hereafter be cited for it reposes upon a far greater body of research and collation than has hitherto been applied footnote even in france to this interesting theme and in effect it is the first account of the great emperor and his times which can with a due valuation of the term be complimented with the title of a critical memoir charlemagne the greatest man of the middle ages in the judgment of his present biographer was born a d seven years before his father assumed the name of king this date has been disputed but on the whole we may take it as settled upon various collateral computations that the year now assigned is the true one the place is less certain but we do not think mr james warranted in saying that it is unknown if every thing is to be pronounced unknown for which there is no absolute proof of a kind to satisfy forensic rules of evidence or which has ever been made a question for debate in that case we may apply a sponge to the greater part of history before the era of printing aixlachapelle mr james goes on to tell us is implied as the birthplace of one of the chief authorities but our own impression is that according to the general belief of succeeding ages it was not aixlachapelle but ingelheim a village near mentz to which that honor belonged some have supposed that carlsburg in bavaria was the true place of his birth and indeed that it drew its name from that distinguished event frantzius in particular says that in his day the castle of that place was still shown to travellers with the reverential interest attached to such a pretension but after all he gives his own vote for ingelheim and it is singular that he does not so much as mention aixlachapelle of his education and his early years mr james is of opinion that we know as little as of his birthplace certainly our information upon these particulars is neither full nor circumstantial yet we know as much perhaps in these respects of charlemagne as of napoleon bonaparte and remarkable enough it is that not relatively or making allowances for the age but absolutely charlemagne was much more accomplished than napoleon in the ordinary business of a modern education charlemagne in the middle of the th century than napoleon in the latter end of the th charlemagne was in fact the most accomplished man of his age napoleon a sciolist for any age the tutor of charlemagne was peter of pisa a man eminent at that time for his attainments in literature in re grammatica from him it was that charlemagne learned latin and greek greek in such a degree ut sufficienter intelligeret and latin to the extent of using it familiarly and fluently in conversation now as to the man of the th century greek was to him as much a sealed language as chinese and even with regard to latin his own secretary doubts upon one occasion whether he were sufficiently master of it to translate juvenals expressive words of panem et circenses yet he had enjoyed the benefits of an education in a royal college in a country which regards itself selfcomplacently as at the head of civilization again there is a pretty strong tradition which could hardly arise but upon some foundation that charlemagne had cultivated the arabic so far as to talk it footnote having no motive to that attainment more urgent than that political considerations made it eligible for him to undertake an expedition against those who could negotiate in no other language now let it be considered how very much more powerful arguments there were in napoleons position for mastering the german and the english his continental policy moved entirely upon the pivot of central europe that is the german system of nations the great federation of powers upon the rhine and the danube and as to england his policy and his passions alike pointed in that direction as uniformly and as inevitably as the needle to the pole every morning we are told tossing aside the paris journals as so many babbling echoes of his own public illusions expressing rather what was desired than what was probable he required of his secretary that he should read off into french the leading newspapers of england and many were the times when he started up in fury and passionately taxed his interpreter with mistranslation sometimes as softening the expressions sometimes as overcoloring their violence evidently he lay at the mercy of one whom he knew to be wanting in honor and who had it in his power either by way of abetting any sinister views of his own or in collusion with others to suppress to add to garble and in every possible way to color and distort what he was interpreting yet neither could this humiliating sense of dependency on the one hand nor the instant pressure of political interest on the other ever urge napoleon to the effort of learning english in the first case german or spanish in the second charlemagne again cultivated most strenuously and successfully as an accomplishment peculiarly belonging to the functions of his high station the art and practice of eloquence and he had this reward of his exertions that he was accounted the most eloquent man of his age totis viribus ad orationem exercendam conversus naturalem facundiam ita roboravit studio ut praeter l propter promptum ac profluens sermonis genus facile aevi sui eloquentissimus crederetur turn to bonaparte it was a saying of his sycophants that he sometimes spoke like a god and sometimes worse than the feeblest of mortals but says one who knew him well the mortal i have often heard unfortunately never yet the god he who sent down this sneer to posterity was at napoleons right hand on the most memorable occasion of his whole career that cardinal occasion as we may aptly term it for upon that his whole fortunes hinged when he intruded violently upon the legislative body dissolved the directory and effected the revolution of the th brumaire that revolution it was which raised him to the consular power and by that revolution considered in its manner and style we may judge of napoleon in several of his chief pretensions courage presence of mind dignity and eloquence for then if ever these qualities were all in instant requisition one word effectually urged by the antagonist parties a breath a gesture a nod suitably followed up would have made the total difference between ruler of france and a traitor hurried away a la lanterne it is true that the miserable imbecility of all who should have led the hostile parties the irresolution and the quietloving temper of moreau the base timidity of bernadotte in fact the total defect of heroic minds amongst the french of that day neutralized the defects and more than compensated the blunders of napoleon but these were advantages that could not be depended on a glass of brandy extraordinary might have emboldened the greatest poltroon to do that which by once rousing a movement of popular enthusiasm once making a beginning in that direction would have precipitated the whole affair into hands which must have carried it far beyond the power of any party to control never according to all human calculation were eloquence and presence of mind so requisite never was either so deplorably wanting a passionate exposition of the national degradations inflicted by the imbecility of the directors an appeal to the assembly as frenchmen contrasting the glories of with the humiliating campaigns that had followed might by connecting the new candidate for power with the public glory and the existing rulers with all the dishonors which had settled on the french banners have given an electric shock to the patriotism of the audience such as would have been capable for the moment of absorbing their feelings as partisans in a french assembly movements of that nature under a momentary impulse are far from being uncommon here then if never before and never again the grandeur of the occasion demanded almost we might say implored and clamorously invoked the effectual powers of eloquence and perfect selfpossession how was the occasion met let us turn to the actual scene as painted in lively colors by a friend and an eyewitness footnote the accounts brought every instant to general bonaparte determined him to enter the hall of the ancients and take part in the debate his entrance was hasty and in anger no favorable prognostics of what he would say the passage by which we entered led directly forward into the middle of the house our backs were towards the door bonaparte had the president on his right he could not see him quite in front i found myself on the generals right our clothes touched berthier was on his left all the harangues composed for bonaparte after the event differ from each other no miracle that there was in fact none pronounced to the ancients unless a broken conversation with the president carried on without nobleness propriety or dignity may be called a speech we heard only these words brothers in arms frankness of a soldier the interrogatories of the president were clear nothing could be more confused or worse enounced than the ambiguous and disjointed replies of bonaparte he spoke incoherently of volcanoes secret agitations victories constitution violated he found fault even with the th fructidor of which he had himself been the prime instigator and most powerful upholder not reader observe from bold timeserving neglect of his own principles but from absolute distraction of mind and incoherency of purpose then came caesar cromwell tyrant allusions which of all others were the most unseasonable for that crisis and for his position he repeated several times i have no more than that to tell you and he had told them nothing then out came the words liberty equality for these every one saw he had not come to st cloud then his action became animated and we lost him comprehending nothing beyond th fructidor prairial hypocrites intriguers i am not so i shall declare all i will abdicate the power when the danger which threatens the republic has passed then after further instances of napoleons falsehood and the selfcontradictory movements of his disjointed babble the secretary goes on thus these interruptions apostrophes and interrogations overwhelmed him he believed himself lost the disapprobation became more violent and his discourse still more wanting in method and coherence sometimes he addressed the representatives quite stultified sometimes the military in the court i e outside who were beyond hearing then without any transition he spoke of the thunder of war saying i am accompanied by the god of war and fortune the president then calmly observed to him that he found nothing absolutely nothing upon which they could deliberate that all he had said was vague explain yourself unfold the plots into which you have been invited to enter bonaparte repeated the same things and in what style no idea in truth can be formed of the whole scene unless by those present there was not the least order in all he stammered out to speak sincerely with the most inconceivable incoherence bonaparte was no orator perceiving the bad effect produced upon the meeting by this rhapsody and the progressive confusion of the speaker i whispered pulling his coat gently at the same time retire general you no longer know what you are saying i made a sign to berthier to second me in persuading him to leave the place when suddenly after stammering out a few words more he turned round saying let all who love me follow so ended this famous scene in which more than in any other upon record eloquence and presence of mind were needful and if it should be said that vagueness was not altogether the least eligible feature in a speech whose very purpose was to confuse and to leave no room for answer we reply true but then it was the vagueness of art which promised to be serviceable and that of preconcerted perplexity not the vagueness of incoherence and a rhapsody of utter contradiction footnote what a contrast all this to the indefeasible majesty of charlemagne to his courage and presence of mind which always rose with the occasion and above all to his promptitude of winning eloquence that promptum ac praftuens genus sermonis which caused him to be accounted evi sui eloquentissimus passing for a moment to minor accomplishments we find that charlemagne excelled in athletic and gymnastic exercises he was a pancratiast bonaparte wanted those even which were essential to his own daily security charlemagne swam well bonaparte not at all charlemagne was a firstrate horseman even amongst the franks napoleon rode ill originally and no practice availed to give him a firm seat a graceful equestrian deportment or a skilful bridle hand in a barbarous age the one possessed all the elegances and ornamental accomplishments of a gentleman the other in a most polished age and in a nation of even false refinement was the sole barbarian of his time presenting in his deficiencies the picture of a low mechanic and in his positive qualities the violence and brutality of a savage footnote hence by the way the extreme folly of those who have attempted to trace a parallel between napoleon and the first caesar the heavenborn julius as beyond all dispute the greatest man of ancient history in moral grandeur and therefore raised unspeakably above comparison with one who was eminent even amongst ordinary men for the pettiness of his passions so also upon an intellectual trial will be found to challenge pretty nearly an equal precedency meantime allowing for the inequality of their advantages even caesar would not have disdained a comparison with charlemagne all the knowledge current in rome athens or rhodes at the period of caesars youth the entire cycle of a noblemans education in a republic where all noblemen were from their birth dedicated to public services this together with much and various knowledge peculiar to himself and his own separate objects had caesar mastered whilst in an age of science and in a country where the fundamental science of mathematics was generally diffused in unrivalled perfection it is well ascertained that bonapartes knowledge did not go beyond an elementary acquaintance with the first six books of euclid but on the other hand charlemagne even in that early age was familiar with the intricate mathematics and the elaborate computus of practical astronomy but these collations it will be said are upon questions not primarily affecting their peculiar functions they are questions more or less extrajudicial the true point of comparison is upon the talents of policy in the first place and strategies in the second a trial between two celebrated performers in these departments is at any rate difficult and much more so when they are separated by vast intervals of time allowances must be made so many and so various compensations or balances struck upon so many diversities of situation there is so much difference in the modes of warfare offensive and defensive the financial means the available alliances and other resources are with so much difficulty appraised in order to raise ourselves to that station from which the whole question can be overlooked that nothing short of a general acquaintance with the history statistics and diplomacy of the two periods can lay a ground for the solid adjudication of so large a comparison meantime in the absence of such an investigation pursued upon a scale of suitable proportions what if we should sketch a rapid outline greek text os en tupo pexilabeln of its elements to speak by a metaphor borrowed from practical astronomy i e of the principal and most conspicuous points which its path would traverse how much these two men each central to a mighty system in his own days how largely and essentially they differed whether in kind or in degree of merit will appear in the course even of the hastiest sketch the circumstances in which they agreed and that these were sufficient to challenge an inquiry into their characteristic differences and to support the interest of such an inquiry will probably be familiar to most readers as among the common places of general history which survive even in the daily records of conversation few people can fail to know that each of these memorable men stood at the head of a new era in european history and of a great movement in the social development of nations that each laid the foundations for a new dynasty in his own family the one by building forwards upon a basis already formed by his two immediate progenitors the other by dexterously applying to a great political crisis his own military preponderance and finally that each forfeited within a very brief period the one in his own person the other in the persons of his immediate descendants the giddy ascent which he had mastered and all the distinctions which it conferred in short that time which gave did his own gifts confound footnote but with this mighty difference that time cooperated in the one case with extravagant folly in the individual and in the other with the irresistible decrees of providence napoleon bonaparte and charlemagne were both in a memorable degree the favorites of fortune it is true that the latter found himself by inheritance in possession of a throne which the other ascended by the fortunate use of his own military advantages but the throne of charlemagne had been recently won by his family and in a way so nearly corresponding to that which was afterwards pursued by napoleon that in effect considering how little this usurpation had been hallowed by time the throne might in each case if not won precisely on the same terms be considered to be held by the same tenure charlemagne not less than napoleon was the privileged child of revolution he was required by the times and indispensable to the crisis which had arisen for the franks and he was himself protected by the necessities to which he ministered clouds had risen or were rising at that era on every quarter of france from every side she was menaced by hostile demonstrations and without the counsels of a charlemagne and with an energy of action inferior to his it is probable that she would have experienced misfortunes which whilst they depressed herself could not but have altered the destinies of christendom for many ages to come the resources of france it is true were immense and as regarded the positions of her enemies they were admirably concentrated but to be made available in the whole extent which the times demanded it was essential that they should be wielded by a firstrate statesman supported by a firstrate soldier the statesman and the soldier were fortunately found united in the person of one man and that man by the rarest of combinations the same who was clothed with the supreme power of the state less power or power less harmonious or power the most consummate administered with less absolute skill would doubtless have been found incompetent to struggle with the tempestuous assaults which then lowered over the entire frontier of france it was natural and upon the known constitution of human nature pretty nearly inevitable that in the course of the very extended warfare which followed love for that glorious trade so irritating and so contagious should be largely developed in a mind as aspiring as charlemagnes and stirred by such generous sensibilities yet is it in no one instance recorded that these sympathies with the pomp and circumstance of war moved him to undertake so much as a single campaign or an expedition which was not otherwise demanded by his judgment or that they interfered even to bias or give an impulse to his judgment where it had previously wavered in every case he tried the force of negotiation before he appealed to arms nay sometimes he condescended so far in his love of peace as to attempt purchasing with gold rights or concessions of expediency which he knew himself in a situation amply to extort by arms nor where these courses were unavailing and where peace was no longer to be maintained by any sacrifices is it ever found that charlemagne in adopting the course of war suffered himself to pursue it as an end valuable in and for itself and yet that is a result not uncommon for a long and conscientious resistance to a measure originally tempting to the feelings once being renounced as utterly unavailing not seldom issues in a headlong surrender of the heart to purposes so violently thwarted for a time and even as a means war was such in the eyes of charlemagne to something beyond the customary ends of victory and domestic security of all conquerors whose history is known sufficiently to throw light upon their motives charlemagne is the only one who looked forward to the benefit of those he conquered as a principal element amongst the fruits of conquest doubtless says his present biographer to defend his own infringed territory and to punish the aggressors formed a part of his design but beyond that he aimed at civilizing a people whose barbarism had been for centuries the curse of the neighboring countries and at the same time communicating to the cruel savages who shed the blood of their enemies less in the battle than in the sacrifice the bland and mitigating spirit of the christian religion this applies more particularly and circumstantially to his saxon campaigns but the spirit of the remark is of general application at that time a weak light of literature was beginning to diffuse improvement in italy in france and in england france by situation geographically and politically speaking by the prodigious advantage which she enjoyed exclusively of an undivided government and consequently of entire unity in her counsels was peculiarly fitted for communicating the benefits of intellectual culture to the rest of the european continent and for sustaining the great mission of civilizing conquest above all as the great central depository of christian knowledge she seemed specially stationed by providence as a martial apostle for carrying by the sword that mighty blessing which even in an earthly sense charlemagne could not but value as the best engine of civilization to the potent infidel nations on her southern and eastern frontier a vast revolution was at hand for europe all her tribes were destined to be fused in a new crucible to be recast in happier moulds and to form one family of enlightened nations to compose one great collective brotherhood united by the tie of a common faith and a common hope and hereafter to be known to the rest of the world and to proclaim this unity under the comprehensive name of christendom baptism therefore was the indispensable condition and forerunner of civilization and from the peculiar ferocity and the sanguinary superstitions which disfigured the pagan nations in central europe of which the leaders and the nearest to france were the saxons and from the bigotry and arrogant intolerance of the mahometan nations who menaced her spanish frontier it was evident that by the sword only it was possible that baptism should be effectually propagated war therefore for the highest purposes of peace became the present and instant policy of france bloodshed for the sake of a religion the most benign and desolation with a view to permanent security the frankish emperor was thus invited to indulge in this most captivating of luxuries in the royal tigerhunt of war as being also at this time and for a special purpose the sternest of duties he had a special dispensation for wielding at times a barbarian and exterminating sword but for the extermination of barbarism and he was privileged to be in a single instance an attila in order that attilas might no more arise simply as the enemies bitter and perfidious of france the saxons were a legitimate object of war as the standing enemies of civilization who would neither receive it for themselves nor tolerate its peaceable enjoyment in others they and charlemagne stood opposed to each other as it were by hostile instincts and this most merciful of conquerors was fully justified in departing for once and in such a quarrel from his general rule of conduct and for a paramount purpose of comprehensive service to all mankind we entirely agree with mr james that charlemagne had a sufficient plea and that he has been censured only by calumnious libellers or by the feeble minded for applying a roman severity of punishment to treachery continually repeated the question is one purely of policy and it may be as mr james is disposed to think that in point of judgment the emperor erred but certainly the case was one of great difficulty for the very infirmity even of maternal indulgence if obstinately and continually abused must find its ultimate limit and we have no right to suppose that charlemagne made his election for the harsher course without a violent selfconflict his former conduct towards those very people his infinite forbearance his longsuffering his monitory threats all make it a duty to presume that he suffered the acutest pangs in deciding upon a vindictive punishment that he adopted this course as being virtually by its consequences the least sanguinary and finally that if he erred it was not through his heart but by resisting its very strongest impulses it is remarkable that both charlemagne and bonaparte succeeded as by inheritance to one great element of their enormous power each found ready to his hands that vast development of martial enthusiasm upon which as its first condition their victorious career reposed each also found the great armory of resources opened which such a spirit diffused over so vast a territory must in any age ensure of charlemagne in an age when as yet the use of infantry was but imperfectly known it may be said symbollically that he found the universal people patrician and plebeian chieftain and vassal with the left foot footnote in the stirrup of napoleon in an age when the use of artillery was first understood that he found every man standing to his gun both in short found war in procinctu both found the people whom they governed willing to support the privations and sacrifices which war imposes hungering and thirsting for its glories its pomps and triumphs entering even with lively sympathy of pleasure into its hardships and its trials and thus from within and from without prepared for military purposes so far both had the same good fortune footnote neither had much merit the enthusiasm of napoleons days was the birth of republican sentiments and built on a reaction of civic and patriotic ardor in the very plenitude of their rage against kings the french republic were threatened with attack and with the desolation of their capital by a banded crusade of kings and they rose in frenzy to meet the aggressors the allied powers had themselves kindled the popular excitement which provoked this vast development of martial power amongst the french and first brought their own warlike strength within their own knowledge in the days of charlemagne the same martial character was the result of ancient habits and training encouraged and effectually organized by the energy of the aspiring mayors of the palace or great lieutenants of the merovingian kings but agreeing in this that they were indebted to others for the martial spirit which they found and that they turned to their account a power not created by themselves charlemagne and napoleon differed however in the utmost possible extent as to the final application of their borrowed advantages napoleon applied them to purposes the very opposite of those which had originally given them birth nothing less than patriotic ardor in defence of what had at one time appeared to be the cause of civil liberty could have availed to evoke those mighty hosts which gathered in the early years of the revolution on the german and italian frontiers of france yet were these hosts applied under the perfect despotism of napoleon to the final extinction of liberty and the armies of jacobinism who had gone forth on a mission of liberation for europe were at last employed in riveting the chains of their compatriots and forging others for the greater part of christendom far otherwise was the conduct of charlemagne the frankish government though we are not circumstantially acquainted with its forms is known to have been tempered by a large infusion of popular influence this is proved as mr james observes by the deposition of chilperic by the grand national assemblies of the champ de mars and by other great historical facts now the situation of charlemagne successor to a throne already firmly established and in his own person a mighty amplifier of its glories and a leader in whom the franks had unlimited confidence threw into his hands an unexampled power of modifying the popular restraints upon himself in any degree he might desire nunquam libertas gratior exit quam sub rege pio is the general doctrine but as to the franks in particular if they resembled their modern representatives in their most conspicuous moral feature it would be more true to say that the bribe and the almost magical seduction for them capable of charming away their sternest resolutions and of relaxing the hand of the patriot when grasping his noblest birthright has ever lain in great military success in the power of bringing victory to the national standards and in continued offerings on the altar of public vanity in their estimate for above a thousand years it has been found true that the harvest of a few splendid campaigns reaped upon the fields of neighboring nations far outweighs any amount of humbler blessings in the shape of civil and political privileges charlemagne as a conqueror and by far the greatest illustrator of the frankish name might easily have conciliated their gratitude and admiration into a surrender of popular rights or profiting by his high situation and the confidence reposed in him he might have undermined their props or by a direct exertion of his power he might have peremptorily resumed them slowly and surely or summarily and with violence this great emperor had the national privileges in his power but the beneficence of his purposes required no such aggression on the rights of his subjects war brought with it naturally some extension of power and a military jurisdiction is necessarily armed with some discretionary license but in the civil exercise of his authority the emperor was content with the powers awarded to him by law and custom his great schemes of policy were all of a nature to prepare his subjects for a condition of larger political influence he could not in consistency be adverse to an end towards which he so anxiously prepared the means and it is certain that although some german writers have attempted to fasten upon charlemagne a charge of vexatious inquisition into the minor police of domestic life and into petty details of economy below the majesty of his official character even their vigilance of research sharpened by malice has been unable to detect throughout his long reign and in the hurry of sudden exigencies natural to a state of uninterrupted warfare and alarm one single act of tyranny personal revenge or violation of the existing laws charlemagne like napoleon had bitter enemies some who were such to his government and his public purposes some again to his person upon motives of private revenge tassilo for example the duke of bavaria and desiderius the king of the lombards acted against him upon the bitterest instigations of feminine resentment each of these princes conceiving himself concerned in a family quarrel pursued the cause which he had adopted in the most ferocious spirit of revenge and would undoubtedly have inflicted death upon charlemagne had he fallen into their power of this he must himself have been sensible and yet when the chance of war threw both of them into his power he forbore to exercise even those rights of retaliation for their many provocations which the custom of that age sanctioned universally he neither mutilated nor deprived them of sight confinement to religious seclusion was all that he inflicted and in the case of tassilo where mercy could be more safely exercised he pardoned him so often that it became evident in what current his feelings ran wherever the cruel necessities of the public service allowed him to indulge them in the conspiracy formed against him upon the provocations offered to the frankish nobility by his third wife he showed the same spirit of excessive clemency a clemency which again reminds us of the first caesar and which was not merely parental but often recalls to us the longsuffering and tenderness of spirit which belong to the infirmity of maternal affection here are no palms executed for no real offence known to the laws of his country and without a trial such as any laws in any country would have conceded no innocent denghiens murdered without the shadow of provocation and purely on account of his own reversionary rights not for doing or meditating wrong but because the claims which unfortunately he inherited might by possibility become available in his person not therefore even as an enemy by intention or premeditation not even as an apparent competitor but in the rare character of a competitor presumptive one who might become an ideal competitor by the extinction of a whole family and even then no substantial competitor until after a revolution in france which must already have undermined the throne of bonaparte to his own subjects and his own kinsmen never did charlemagne forget to be in acts as well as words a parent in his foreign relations it is true for one single purpose of effectual warning charlemagne put forth a solitary trait of roman harshness this is the case which we have already noticed and defended and with a view to the comparison with napoleon remarkable enough it is that the numbers sacrificed on this occasion are pretty nearly the same as on the celebrated massacre at jaffa perpetrated by napoleon in council footnote in the saxon as in the syrian massacre the numbers were between four and five thousand not that the numbers or the scale of the transaction can affect its principle but it is well to know it because then to its author as now to us who sit as judges upon it that circumstance cannot be supposed to have failed in drawing the very keenest attention to its previous consideration a butchery that was in a numerical sense so vast cannot be supposed to have escaped its author in a hurry or to be open to any of the usual palliations from precipitance or inattention charlemagne and napoleon must equally be presumed to have regarded this act on all sides to have weighed it in and for itself and to have traversed by anticipation the whole sum of its consequences in the one case we find a general the leader of a soidisant christian army the representative of the most christian nation and as amongst infidels specially charged with the duty of supporting the sanctity of christian good faith unfortunately pledged by his own most confidential and accredited agents officers bearing on their persons the known ensigns of his aidesdecamp to a comprehensive promise of mercy to a large body of turkish troops having arms in their hands and otherwise welldisposed and well able to have made a desperate defence this promise was peculiarly embarrassing provisions ran short and to detain them as prisoners would draw murmurs from his own troops now suffering hardships themselves on the other hand to have turned them adrift would have insured their speedy reappearance as active enemies to a diminished and debilitated army for as to sending them off by sea that measure was impracticable as well from want of shipping as from the presence of the english such was the dilemma doubtless perplexing enough but not more so than in ten thousand other cases for which their own appropriate ten thousand remedies have been found what was the issue the entire body of gallant many doubtless young and innocent soldiers disarmed upon the faith of a solemn guarantee from a christian general standing in the very steps of the noble and the more noble because bigoted crusaders were all mowed down by the musketry of their thrice accursed enemy and by way of crowning treachery with treachery some few who had swum off to a point of rock in the sea were lured back to destruction under a second series of promises violated almost at the very instant when uttered a larger or more damnable murder does not stain the memory of any brigand buccaneer or pirate nor has any army huns vandals or mogul tartars ever polluted itself by so base a perfidy for in this memorable tragedy the whole army were accomplices now as to charlemagne he had tried the effect of forgiveness and lenity often in vain clemency was misinterpreted it had been and it would be construed into conscious weakness under these circumstances with a view undoubtedly to the final extinction of rebellions which involved infinite bloodshed on both sides he permitted one trial to be made of a severe and sanguinary chastisement it failed insurrections proceeded as before and it was not repeated but the main difference in the principle of the two cases is this that charlemagne had exacted no penalty but one which the laws of war in that age conferred and even in this age the laws of allegiance however bloody therefore this tragedy was no murder it was a judicial punishment built upon known acts and admitted laws designed in mercy consented to unwillingly and finally repented lastly instead of being one in a multitude of acts bearing the same character it stood alone in a long career of intercourse with wild and ferocious nations owning no control but that of the spear and sword many are the points of comparison and some of them remarkable enough in the other circumstances of the two careers separated by a thousand years both effected the passage of the great st bernard footnote but the one in an age when mechanical forces and the aids of art were yet imperfectly developed the other in an age when science had armed the arts of war and of locomotion with the fabulous powers of the titans and with the whole resources of a mighty nation at his immediate disposal both by means of this extraordinary feat achieved the conquest of lombardy in a single hour but charlemagne without once risking the original impression of this coup declat napoleon on the other hand so entirely squandering and forfeiting his own success that in the battle which followed he was at first utterly defeated and but for the blunder of his enemy and the sudden aid of an accomplished friend irretrievably both suffered politically by the repudiation of a wife but charlemagne under adequate provocation and with no final result of evil bonaparte under heavy aggravations of ingratitude and indiscretion both assumed the character of a patron to learning and learned men but napoleon in an age when knowledge of every kind was selfpatronized when no possible exertions of power could avail to crush it and yet under these circumstances with utter insincerity charlemagne on the other hand at a time when the countenance of a powerful protector made the whole difference between revival and a long extinction and what was still more to the purpose of doing honor to his memory not merely in a spirit of sincerity but of fervid activity not content with drawing counsel and aid from the cells of northumberland even the short time which he passed at rome he had collected a number of grammarians that is litterateurs and arithmeticians the poor remains of the orators and philosophers of the past and engaged them to accompany him from italy to france what resulted in each case from these great efforts and prodigious successes each failed in laying the foundations of any permanent inheritance to his own glory in his own family but bonaparte lived to lay in ruins even his personal interest in this great edifice of empire and that entirely by his own desperate presumption precipitance and absolute defect of selfcommand charlemagne on his part lost nothing of what he had gained if his posterity did not long maintain the elevation to which he had raised them that did but the more proclaim the grandeur of the mind which had reared a colossal empire that sunk under any powers inferior to his own if the empire itself lost its unity and divided into sections even thus it did not lose the splendor and prosperity of its separate parts and the praise remains entire let succeeding princes as conservators have failed as much and as excusably as they might that he erected the following splendid empire the whole of france and belgium with their natural boundaries of the alps the pyrenees the ocean the mediterranean to the south spain between the ebro and the pyrenees and to the north the whole of germany up to the banks of the elbe italy as far as the lower calabria was either governed by his son or tributary to his crown dalmatia croatia liburnia and istria with the exception of the maritime cities were joined to the territories which he had himself conquered of hungary and bohemia as far as the conflux of the danube with the teyss and the save the east of europe acknowledged his power most of the sclavonian tribes between the elbe and the vistula paid tribute and professed obedience and corsica sardinia with the balearic islands were dependent upon his possessions in italy and spain his moral were yet greater than his territorial conquests in the eloquent language of his present historian he snatched from darkness all the lands he conquered and may be said to have added the whole of germany to the world wherever he moved civilization followed his footsteps what he conquered was emphatically the conquest of his own genius and his vast empire was in a peculiar sense his own creation and what under general circumstances would have exposed the hollowness and insufficiency of his establishment was for him in particular the seal and attestation of his extraordinary grandeur of mind his empire dissolved after he had departed his dominions lost their cohesion and slipped away from the nerveless hands which succeeded a sufficient evidence were there no other that all the vast resources of the frankish throne wielded by imbecile minds were inadequate to maintain that which in the hands of a charlemagne they had availed to conquer and cement notes note in part we say because in part also the characteristic differences of these works depend upon the particular mode of the narrative for narration itself as applied to history admits of a triple arrangement dogmatic sceptical and critical dogmatic which adopts the current records without examination sceptical as horace walpoles richard iii laings dissertation on perkin warbeck or on the gowrie conspiracy which expressly undertakes to probe and try the unsound parts of the story and critical which after an examination of this nature selects from the whole body of materials such as are coherent there is besides another ground of difference in the quality of historical narratives viz between those which move by means of great public events and those which like the caesars of suetonius and the french memoirs referring to such events as are already known and keeping them in the background crowd their foreground with those personal and domestic notices which we call anecdotes note leibnitz who was twice in england when walking in kensington gardens with the princess of wales whose admiration oscillated between this great countryman of her own and sir isaac newton the corresponding idol of her adopted country took occasion from the beautiful scene about them to explain in a lively way and at the same time to illustrate and verify this favorite thesis turning to a gentleman in attendance upon her royal highness he challenged him to produce two leaves from any tree or shrub which should be exact duplicates or facsimiles of each other in those lines which variegate the surface the challenge was accepted but the result justified leibnitz it is in fact upon this infinite variety in the superficial lines of the human palm that palmistry is grounded or the science of divination by the hieroglyphics written on each mans hand and has its prima facie justification were it otherwise this mode of divination would not have even a plausible sanction for without the inexhaustible varieties which are actually found in the combinations of these lines and which give to each separate individual his own separate type the same identical fortunes must be often repeated and there would be no foundation for assigning to each his peculiar and characteristic destiny note according to the general estimate of philosophical history the tenth century or perhaps the tenth and the eleventh conjointly must be regarded as the meridian or the perfect midnight of the dark ages note it has repeatedly been made a question at what era we are to date the transition from ancient to modern history this question merits a separate dissertation meantime it is sufficient to say in this place that justinian in the th century will unanimously be referred to the ancient division charlemagne in the th to the modern these then are two limits fixed in each direction and somewhere between them must lie the frontier line now the era of mahomet in the th century is evidently the exact and perfect line of demarcation not only as pretty nearly bisecting the debatable ground but also because the rise of the mohammedan power as operating so powerfully upon the christian kingdoms of the south and through them upon the whole of christendom at that time beginning to mould themselves and to knit marks in the most eminent sense the birth of a new era note or in fact than is likely to manifest itself to an unlearned reader of mr jamess own book for he has omitted to load his margin with references to authorities in many scores of instances where he might and perhaps where he ought to have accredited his narrative by those indications of research note arabice loquutum esse aigolando saracenorum regulo turpinus the famous archbishop auctor est nec id fide indignum dum enim

tenses that eternal stumblingblock to bad french scholars is uniformly mistranslated as an instance of ignoble language at p vol i he says josephine was delighted with the disposition of her goodman a

in speaking thus harshly we are far from meaning any thing unkind to dr m whom on the contrary for his honorable sentiments in relation to the merits of bonaparte we greatly respect but that as nothing to do with french translation the condition of which in this country is perfectly scandalous note some people may fancy that this scene of that days drama was got up merely to save appearances by a semblance of discussion and that in effect it mattered not how the performance was conducted where all was scenical and the ultimate reliance after all on the bayonet but it is certain that this view is erroneous and that the final decision of the soldiery even up to the very moment of the crisis was still doubtful some time after this exhibition the hesitation reigning among the troops says bourrienne still continued and in reality it was a mere accident of pantomime and a claptrap of sentiment which finally gave a sudden turn in napoleons favor to their wavering resolutions note we have occasionally such expressions as when wild in woods the noble savage ran these descriptions rest upon false conceptions in fact no such combination anywhere exists as a man having the training of a savage or occupying the exposed and naked situation of a savage who is at the same time in any moral sense at liberty to be nobleminded men are moulded by the circumstances in which they stand habitually and the insecurity of savage life by making it impossible to forego any sort of advantages obliterates the very idea of honor hence with all savages alike the point of honor lies in treachery in stratagem and the utmost excess of what is dishonorable according to the estimate of cultivated man note shakespeares sonnets note or perhaps the right for the prussian cavalry who drew their custom from some regiments in the service of gustavus adolphus and they again traditionally from others are always trained to mount in this way note it is painful to any man of honorable feelings that whilst a great rival nation is pursuing the ennobling profession of arms his own should be reproached contemptuously with a sordid dedication to commerce however on the one hand things are not always as they seem commerce has its ennobling effects direct or indirect war its barbarizing degradations and on the other hand the facts even are not exactly as prima facie they were supposed for the truth is that in proportion to its total population england had more men in arms during the last war than france but generally speaking the case may be stated thus the british nation is by original constitution of mind and by long enjoyment of liberty a far nobler people than the french and hence we see the reason and necessity that the french should with a view to something like a final balance in the effect be trained to a nobler profession compensations are every where produced or encouraged by nature and by providence and a nobler discipline in the one nation is doubtless some equilibrium to a nobler nature in the other note in council we say purposely and in candor for the only pleas in palliation ever set up by napoleons apologists are these two necessity the devils plea in the first place secondly that the guilt of the transaction whether more or less was divided between the general and his council note and from the fact of that corps in charlemagnes army which effected the passage having been commanded by his uncle duke bernard this mountain previously known as the mons jovis and by corruption mont le joux very justly obtained the name which it still retains modern greece journal of a tour in greece and the ionian islands by william mure of caldwell what are the nuisances special to greece which repel tourists from that country they are three robbers fleas and dogs it is remarkable that all are in one sense respectable nuisances they are ancient and of classical descent the monuments still existing from prechristian ages in memory of honest travellers assassinated by brigands of klephts kleptai show that the old respectable calling of freebooters by sea and land which thucydides in a wellknown passage describes as so reputable an investment for capital during the times preceding his own and as to northern greece even during his own had never entirely languished as with us it has done for two generations on the heaths of bagshot hounslow or finchley well situated as these grounds were for doing business lying at such convenient distances from the metropolis and studying the convenience of all parties since if a man were destined to lose a burden on his road surely it was pleasing to his feelings that he had not been suffered to act as porter over ninety or a hundred miles in the service of one who would neither pay him nor thank him yet finally what through banks and what through policemen the concern has dwindled to nothing in england we believe this concern was technically known amongst men of business and family men as the low toby in greece it was called greek laeseia and homericaliy speaking it was perhaps the only profession thoroughly respectable a few other callings are mentioned in the odyssey as furnishing regular bread to decent men viz the doctors the fortunetellers or conjurers and the armorers indeed it is clear from the offer made to ulysses of a job in the way of hedging and ditching that sturdy bigboned beggars or what used to be called abraham men in southern england were not held to have forfeited any heraldic dignity attached to the rank of pauper which was considerable by taking a farmers pay where mendicancy happened to be looking downwards even honest labor was tolerated though of course disgraceful but the corinthian order of society to borrow burkes image was the bold searover the buccaneer or if you will call him so the robber in all his varieties titles were at that time not much in use honorary titles we mean but had our prefix of right honorable existed it would have been assigned to burglars and by no means to privycouncillors as again our english prefix of venerable would have been settled not on so sheepish a character as the archdeacon but on the spirited appropriator of church plate we were surprised lately to find in a german work of some authority so gross a misconception of thucydides as that of supposing him to be in jest nothing of the sort the question which he represents as once current on speaking a ship in the mediterranean pray gentlemen are you robbers actually occurs in homer and to homer no doubt the historian alludes it neither was nor could be conceived as other than complimentary for the alternative supposition presumed him that mean and wellknown character the merchant who basely paid for what he took it was plainly asking are you a knight grandcross of some martial order or a sort of costermonger and we give it as no hasty or fanciful opinion that the south sea islands which bougainville held to be in a state of considerable civilization had in fact reached the precise stage of homeric greece the power of levying war as yet not sequestered by the ruling power of each community was a private right inherent in every individual of any one state against all individuals of any other captain cooks ship the resolution and her consort the adventure were as much independent states and objects of lawful war to the islanders as owyhee in the sandwich group was to tongataboo in the friendly group so that to have taken an old bailey view of the thefts committed was unjust and besides inefectual the true remedy being by way of treaty or convention with the chiefs of every island and perhaps if homer had tried it the same remedy in effect regular payments of blackmail might have been found available in his day it is too late to suggest that idea now the princely pirates are gone and the last dividend has been paid upon their booty so that whether he gained or lost by them homers estate is not liable to any future inquisitions from commissioners of bankruptcy or other sharks he whether amongst the plundered or as is more probable a considerable shareholder in the jointstock privateers from tenedos c is safe both from further funding and refunding we are not and the first question of moment to any future tourist is what may be the present value at a british insurance office of any given life risked upon a tour in greece much will of course depend upon the extent and the particular route a late prime minister of greece under the reigning king otho actually perished by means of one days pleasure excursion from athens though meeting neither thief nor robber he lost his way and this being scandalous in an exchancellor of the exchequer having ladies under his guidance who were obliged like those in the midsummer nights dream to pass the night in an athenian wood his excellency died of vexation where may not men find a death but we ask after the calculation of any office which takes extra risks and as a basis for such a calculation we submit the range of tour sketched by pausanius more than sixteen centuries back that greek pansapachae periodos as colonel leake describes it which carries a man through the heart of all that can chiefly interest in greece where are the chances upon such a compass of greek travelling having only the ordinary escort and arms or having no arms which the learned agree in thinking the safer plan at present that a given traveller will revisit the glimpses of an english moon or again embrace his placens uxor as with regard to ireland it is one stock trick of whiggery to treat the chances of assassination in the light of an english hypochondriacal chimaera so for a different reason it has been with regard to italy and soon will be for greece twenty years ago it was a fine subject for jesting the english idea of stilettos in rome and masqued bravos and assassins who charged so much an inch for the depth of their wounds but all the laughter did not save a youthful english marriage party from being atrociously massacred a grave english professional man with his wife from being carried off to a mountainous captivity and reserved from slaughter only by the prospect of ransom a british noblemans son from death or the consequences of italian barbarity or a prince the brother of napoleon from having the security of his mansion violated and the most valuable captives carried off by daylight from his household in greece apparently the state of things is worse because absolutely worse under a far slighter temptation but mr mure is of opinion that greek robbers have private reasons as yet for sparing english tourists so far then is certain viz that the positive danger is greater in povertystricken greece than in rich and splendid italy but as to the valuation of the danger it is probably as yet imperfect from mere defect of experience the total amount of travellers is unknown and it may be argued that at least colonel leake mr dodwell and our present mr mure with as many more as have written books cannot be among the killed wounded or missing there is evidence in octavo that they are yet to the fore still with respect to books after all they may have been posthumous works or to put the case in another form who knows how many excellent works in medium quarto not less than crown octavo may have been suppressed and intercepted in their rudiments by these expurgatorial ruffians mr mure mentions as the exquisite reason for the present fashion of shooting from an ambush first and settling accounts afterwards that by this means they evade the chances of a contest the greek robber it seems knows as well as cicero that non semper viator a latrone nonnunquam etiam latro a viatore occiditur a disappointment that makes one laugh exceedingly now this rule as to armed travellers is likely to bear hard upon our countrymen who being rich else how come they in greece will surely be brilliantly armed and thus again it may be said in a sense somewhat different from juvenals et vacuus cantat coram latrone viator vacuus not of money but of pistols yet on the other hand though possibly sound law for the thickets of mount cithaeron this would be too unsafe a policy as a general rule too often it is the exposure of a helpless exterior which first suggests the outrage and perhaps the best suggestion for the present would be that travellers should carry in their hands an apparent telescope or a reputed walkingcane which peaceful and natural part of his appointments will first operate to draw out his lurking forest friend from his advantage and on closer colloquy if this friend should turn restive then the tuscan artists tube contrived of course a double debt to pay will suddenly reveal another sort of tube insinuating an argument sufficient for the refutation of any sophism whatever this is the best compromise which we can put forward with the present dilemma in greece where it seems that to be armed or to be unarmed is almost equally perilous but our secret opinion is that in all countries alike the only absolute safeguard against highway robbery is a railway for then the tables are turned not he who is stopped incurs the risk but he who stops we question whether samson himself could have pulled up his namesake on the liverpool railway recently indeed in the court of common pleas on a motion to show cause by sergeant bompas in hewitt v price tindal chiefjustice said we cannot call a railway a public footnote security i think laughter but we think otherwise in spite of laughter we consider it a specific against the low toby and en attendant there is but one step towards amelioration of things for greece which lies in summary ejecting of the bavarian locusts where all offices of profit or honor are engrossed by needy aliens you cannot expect a cheerful temper in the people and unhappily from moody discontent in greece to the taking of purses is a short transition thus have we disposed of st nicholass clerks next we come to fleas and dogs have we a remedy for these we have but as to fleas applicable or not according to the purpose with which a man travels if as happened at times to mr mure a natural and for his readers a beneficial anxiety to see something of domestic habits overcomes all sense of personal inconvenience he will wish at any cost to sleep in grecian bedrooms and to sit by german hearths on the other hand though sensible of the honor attached to being bit by a flea lineally descended from an athenian flea that in one day may possibly have bit three such men as pericles phidias and euripides many quiet unambitious travellers might choose to dispense with glory and content themselves with the view of greek external nature to these persons we would recommend the plan of carrying amongst their baggage a tent with portable campbeds one of those as originally invented upon the encouragement of the peninsular campaigns from to and subsequently improved would meet all ordinary wants it is objected indeed that by this time the grecian fleas must have colonized the very hills and woods as once we remember upon westminster bridge to a person who proposed bathing in the thames by way of a ready ablution from the july dust another replied my dear sir by no means the river itself is dusty consider what it is to have received the dust of london for nineteen hundred years since caesars invasion but in any case the water cups in which the bedposts rest forbid the transit of creatures not able to swim or to fly a flea indeed leaps and by all report in a way that far beats a tiger taking the standard of measurement from the bodies of the competitors but even this may be remedied giving the maximum leap of a normal flea it is always easy to raise the bed indefinitely from the ground space upwards is unlimited and the supporters of the bed may be made to meet in one pillar coated with so viscous a substance as to put even a flea into chancery as to dogs the case is not so easily settled and before the reader is in a condition to judge of our remedy he ought to know the evil in its whole extent after all allowances for vermin that waken you before your time or assassins that send you to sleep before your time no single greek nuisance can be placed on the same scale with the dogs attached to every menage whether household or pastoral surely as a stranger approaches to any inhospitable door of the peasantry often before he knows of such a door as in rerum natura out bounds upon him by huge careering leaps a horrid infuriated ruffian of a dog oftentimes a huge moloss big as an english cow active as a leopard fierce as a hyena but more powerful by much and quite as little disposed to hear reason so situated seeing an enemy in motion with whom it would be as idle to negotiate as with an earthquake what is the bravest man to do shoot him ay that was pretty much the course taken by a young man who lived before troy and see what came of it this man in fact a boy of seventeen had walked out to see the city of mycenae leaving his elder cousin at the hotel sipping his wine out sprang a huge dog from the principal house in what you might call the high street of mycenae the young mans heart began to palpitate he was in that state of excitement which affects most people when fear mingles with excessive anger what was he to do pistols he had none and as nobody came out to his aid he put his hand to the ground seized a chermadion or pavingstone smashed the skull of the odious brute and with quite as much merit as count robert of paris was entitled to have claimed from his lucky hit in the dungeon then walked off to report his little exploit to his cousin at the hotel but what followed the wretches in the house who never cared to show themselves so long as it might only be the dog killing a boy all came tumbling out by crowds when it became clear that a boy had killed the dog a la lanterne they yelled out valiantly charged en masse and among them they managed to kill the boy but there was a reckoning to pay for this had they known who it was that sat drinking at the hotel they would have thought twice before they backed their brute that cousin whom the poor boy had left at his wine happened to be an ugly customer hercules incog it is needless to specify the result the child unborn had reason to rue the murder of the boy for his cousin proved quite as deaf to all argument or submission as their own foul thief of a dog or themselves suffice it that the royal house of mycenae in the language of napoleons edicts ceased to reign but here is the evil few men leave a hercules at their hotel and all will have to stand the vindictive fury of the natives for their canine friends if you should pistol them be it in deliverance of your own life or even of a ladys by your side no apology would be listened to in fact besides the disproportionate annoyance to a travellers nerves that he shall be kept uneasy at every turn of the road in mere anxiety as to the next recurrence of struggles so desperate it arms the indignation of a bold briton beforehand that a horrid brute shall be thought entitled to kill him and if he does it is pronounced an accident but if he a son of the mighty island kills the brute instantly a little hybrid greek peasant shall treat it as murder many years ago we experienced the selfsame annoyance in the north of england let no man talk of courage in such cases most justly did marechal saxe ask an officer sneeringly who protested that he had never known the sensation of fear and could not well imagine what it was like had he never snuffed a candle with his fingers because in that case said the veteran i fancy you must have felt afraid of burning your thumb a brave man on a service of known danger braces up his mind by a distinct effort to the necessities of his duty the great sentiment that it is his duty the sentiments of honor and of country reconcile him to the service while it lasts no use besides in ducking before shot or dodging or skulking he that faces the storm most cheerfully has after all the best chance of escaping were that the object of consideration but as soon as this trial is over and the energy called forth by a high tension of duty has relaxed the very same man often shrinks from ordinary trials of his prowess having perhaps little reason for confidence in his own bodily strength seeing no honor in the struggle and sure that no duty would be hallowed by any result he shrinks from it in a way which surprises those who have heard of his martial character brave men in extremities are many times the most nervous and the shyest under perils of a mean order we without claiming the benefit of these particular distinctions happened to be specially soft on this one danger from dogs not from the mere terror of a bite but from the shocking doubt besieging such a case for four or five months that hydrophobia may supervene think excellent reader if we should suddenly prove hydrophobous in the middle of this paper how would you distinguish the hydrophobous from the nonhydrophobous parts you would say as voltaire of rousseau sa plume apparemment brulera le papier such being the horror ever before our mind images of eyeballs starting from their sockets spasms suffocating the throat we could not see a dog starting off into a yell of sudden discovery bound for the foot of our legs but that undoubtedly a mixed sensation of panic and fury overshadowed us a greek chermadion was not always at hand and without practice we could have little confidence in our power of sending it home else many is the head we should have crushed sometimes where more than one dog happened to be accomplices in the outrage we were not altogether out of danger euripides we said was really torn to pieces by the dogs of a sovereign prince in hounslow but a month since a little girl was all but worried by the buckhounds of a greater sovereign than archelaus and why not we by the dogs of a farmer the scene lay in westmorland and cumberland oftentimes it would happen that in summer we had turned aside from the road or perhaps the road itself forced us to pass a farmhouse from which the family might be absent in the hayfield unhappily the dogs in such a case are often left behind and many have been the fierce contests in which we have embarked for as to retreating be it known that there as in greece the murderous savages will pursue you sometimes far into the high road that result it was which uniformly brought us back to a sense of our own wrong and finally of our rights come we used to say this is too much here at least is the kings highway and things are come to a pretty pass indeed if we who partake of a common nature with the king and write good latin whereas all the world knows what sort of latin is found among dogs may not have as good a right to standingroom as a lowbred quadruped with a tail like you non usque adeo summis permiscuit ima longa dies c we remember no instance which ever so powerfully illustrated the courage given by the consciousness of rectitude so long as we felt that we were trespassing on the grounds of a stranger we certainly sneaked we seek not to deny it but once landed on the highroad where we knew our own title to be as good as the dogs not all the world should have persuaded us to budge one foot our reason for going back to these old cumbrian remembrances will be found in what follows deeply incensed at the insults we had been obliged to put up with for years brooding oftentimes over wrongs unredressd and insults unavengd we asked ourselves is vengeance hopeless and at length we hit upon the following scheme of retribution this it is which we propose as applicable to greece well acquainted with the indomitable spirit of the bulldog and the fidelity of the mastiff we determined to obtain two such companions to retraverse our old ground to make a point of visiting every house where we had been grossly insulted by dogs and to commit our cause to the management of these new allies let us see said we if they will speak in the same bullying tone this time but with what ulterior views the dispassionate reader asks the same we answer which mr pitt professed as the objects of the revolutionary war indemnity for the past and security for the future years however passed on charles x fell from his throne the reform bill passed other things occurred and as last this change struck us that the dogs on whom our vengeance would alight generally speaking must belong to a second generation or even a third in descent from our personal enemies now this vengeance by procuration seemed no vengeance at all but a plan which failed as regarded our own past wrongs may yet apply admirably to a wrong current and in progress if we englishmen may not pistol greek canine ruffians at any rate we suppose an english bulldog has a right to make a tour in greece a mastiff if he pays for his food and lodgings possesses as good a title to see athens and the peloponnesus as a bavarian and a better than a turk and if he cannot be suffered to pass quietly along the roads on his own private affairs the more is the pity but assuredly the consequences will not fall on him we know enough of the sublime courage bestowed on that heroic animal to be satisfied that he will shake the life out of any enemy that greece can show the embassy sent by napoleon to the schah of persia about the year complained much and often of the huge dogs scattered over all parts of western asia whether turkish or persian and by later travels amongst the himalayas it seems that the same gigantic ruffians prevail in central asia but the noble english bulldogs who being but three in number did not hesitate for one instant to rush upon the enormous lion at warwick will face any enemy in the world and will come off victors unless hyperbolically overweighted a peril which need not be apprehended except perhaps in laconia or messenia here therefore we should be disposed to leave the subject but as it is curious for itself is confessedly of importance to the traveller and has thrown light upon a passage in the odyssey that had previously been unintelligible we go on to one other suggestion furnished by the author before us it is really a discovery and is more worthy of a place in annotations upon homer than nine in ten of all that we read among the numerous points of resemblance with which the classical traveller cannot fail to be struck between the habits of pastoral and agricultural life as still exemplified in greece and those which formerly prevailed in the same country there is none more calculated to arrest his attention than the correspondence of the shepherds encampments scattered on the face of the less cultivated districts with the settlements of the same kind whose concerns are so frequently brought forward in the imagery of the iliad and odyssey accordingly the passage of homer to which the existing peculiarity above described viz of pelting off dogs by large jagged stones affords themost appropriate commentary is the scene where ulysses disguised as a beggar in approaching the farm of the swineherd is fiercely assaulted by the dogs but delivered by the master of the establishment popes translation with the exception of one or two expressions amongst which mr mure notices mastiff as not a good term for a sheepdog here conveys with tolerable fidelity the spirit of the original soon as ulysses near the enclosure drew with open mouths the furious mastiffs flew down sate the sage and cautious to withstand let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand sudden the master runs aloud he calls and from his hasty hand the leather falls with showrs of stones he drives them far away the scatterd dogs around at distance bay odyss xiv first however let us state the personal adventure which occasions this reference to homer as it illustrates a feature in greek scenery and in the composition of greek society in the early part of his travels on a day when mr mure was within a few hours of the immortal mesolonghi he as better mounted had ridden ahead of his suite suddenly he came upon an encampment of small low reed wigwams which in form resembled the pastoral capanne of the roman plain but were vastly inferior in size and structure women and children were sitting outside but finally there crawled forth from the little miserable hovels two or three male figures of such gigantic dimensions as seemed beyond the capacity of the entire dwellings several others joined them all remarkable for size and beauty and one whose air of authority bespoke his real rank of chief mr mure pronounces a most magnificentlooking barbarian this was a nomad tribe of wallachian shepherds descended it is supposed from the dacian colonies romans intermingled with natives founded by the later caesars the prevalent features of their faces are it seems italian their language is powerfully veined with latin their dress differing from that of all their albanian neighbors resembles the dress of dacian captives sculptured on the triumphal monuments of rome and lastly their peculiar name vlack wallachian indicates in the sclavonic language pretty much the same relation to a foreign origin as in german is indicated by the word welsh an affinity of which word is said to exist in our word walnut where wall as the late mr coleridge thinks means alien outlandish the evidence therefore is as direct for their nongrecian descent as could be desired but they are interesting to greece at this time because annually migrating from thessaly in the summer and diffusing themselves in the patriarchal style with their wives their children and their flocks over the sunny vales of boeotia of peloponnesus and in general of southern greece their men are huge but they are the mildest of the human race their dogs are huge also so far the parallel holds we regret that strict regard to truth forbids us to pursue the comparison i found myself on a sudden says mr mure surrounded by a fierce pack of dogs of size proportioned to that of their masters and which rushed forth on every side as if bent on devouring both myself and beast being altogether unprovided with any means of defence but the ropeend of the same halter that supplied my stirrups i was i confess not a little disconcerted by the assault of so unexpected an enemy from this he was soon delivered at the moment by some of the gentle giants who pelted off the animals with the large loose stones that lay scattered over the rocky surface of the heath but upon the character of the nuisance and upon the particular remedy employed both of which are classical and older than troy mr mure makes the following explanations the number and ferocity of the dogs that guard the greek hamlets and sheepfolds as compared with those kept for similar purposes in other parts of the world is one of the peculiarities of this country which not only first attracts the attention of the tourist but is chiefly calculated to excite his alarm and call into exercise his prowess or presence of mind it is also amongst the features of modern greek life that supply the most curious illustrations of classical antiquity their attacks are not confined to those who approach the premises of which they are the appointed guardians they do not limit themselves to defensive war in many districts they are in the habit of rushing from a considerable distance to torment the traveller passing along the public track and when the pastoral colonies as is often the case occur at frequent intervals the nuisance becomes quite intolerable but in cases where the succession is less continuous we should imagine that the nuisance was in the same proportion more dangerous and mr mure acknowledges that under certain circumstances to a solitary stranger the risk would be serious though generally and in the case of cavalcades the dogs fasten chiefly upon the horses but endless are the compensations which we find in the distributions of nature is there a bane near it lies an antidote is there a disease look for a specific in that same neighborhood here also the universal rule prevails as it was destined that greece in all ages should be scourged by this intestine enemy it was provided that a twofold specific should travel concurrently with the evil and because the vegetable specific in the shape of oaken cudgels was liable to local failure at this moment in fact from the wreck of her woods by means of incendiary armies greece is for a season disafforested there exists a second specific of a mineral character which please heaven shall never fail so long as greece is greece the usual weapons of defence employed in such cases by the natives are the large loose stones with which the soil is everywhere strewed a natural feature of this region to which also belongs its own proper share of classic interest the character of the rocks prevailing in those mountain ridges which intersect the whole of greece is that whilst in its interior texture of ironhard consistency yet at the surface it is broken into detached fragments of infinitely varied dimensions balls bullets grape and canister shot have all been parked in inexhaustible magazines whilst the leading feature which strikes the mind with amazement in this natural artillery is its fine retail distribution everywhere you may meet an enemy stoop and everywhere there is shot piled for use we see a leibnitzian preestablished harmony between the character of the stratification and the character of the dogs cardinal de retz explains why that war in the minority of louis xiv was called the fronde and it seems that in greece where an immortal fronde was inevitable an immortal magazine was supplied for it one which has been and will continue to be under all revolutions for the uncultured tracts present the missiles equally diffused and the first rudiments of culture show themselves in collections of these missiles along the roads hence in fact a general mistake of tourists it is certain says mr mure that many of the circular mounds which are noticed in the itineraries under the rubric of ancient tumulus have been heaped up in this manner it is to these stones that travellers and the population at large instinctively have recourse as the most effectual weapon against the assaults of the dogs the small shot of pebbles however or even stones equal to pigeons eggs would avail nothing those selected are seldom smaller than a man exerting his whole force can conveniently lift and throw with one hand thence in fact and from no other cause comes as mr mure observes the homeric designation of such stones viz chermadion or handful of which he also cites the definition given by lucian greek text lithos cheiroplaethaes a handfilling stone ninety generations have passed since the trojan war and each of the ninety has used the same bountiful magazine all readers of the iliad must remember how often ajax or hector took up chermadia such as twice five men in our degenerate days could barely lift launching them at lightarmed foes who positively would not come nearer to take their just share of the sword or spear the weapon is the more effectual owing to the nature of the rock itself broken as it is in its whole surface into angular and sharppointed inequalities which add greatly to the severity of the wound inflicted hence as most travellers will have experienced a fall amongst the greek rocks is unusually painful it is pleasing to find homer familiar not only with the use of the weapon but with its finest external developments not only the stone must be a bouncer a chermadion with some of the properties we believe marking a good cricketball but it ought to be greek text ochxioeis such is the homeric epithet of endearment his caressing description of a good brainer viz splintingjagged this fact of the chermadic weight attached to the good warstone explains as mr mure ingeniously remarks a simile of homers which ought to have been pure nonsense for pope and cowper viz that in describing a dense mist such as we foolishly imagine peculiar to our own british climate and meaning to say that a man could scarcely descry an object somewhat ahead of his own station he says greek text tosson tis tep leussel oson tepi laan iaesi so far does man see as lie hurls a stone now in the skirmish of bickering this would argue no great limitation of eyesight why man how far would you see would you see round a corner a shot of several hundred yards says mr mure were no great feat for a country lad well skilled in the art of stonethrowing but this is not homers meaning the cloud of dust which went before an army advancing and which it is that homer compares to a mist on the hills perplexing the shepherd was certainly much denser than to admit of the view extending to such a distance in the homeric sense as allusive to the hurling of the ponderous chermadion the figure is correct and expressive and here as everywhere we see the horatian parenthesis upon homer as one qui nil molitur inepte who never speaks vaguely never wants a reason and never loses sight of a reality amply sustained here then is a local resource to the british tourist besides the imported one of the bulldog and it is remarkable that except where the dogs are preternaturally audacious a mere hint of the chermadion suffices late in our own experience too late for glory we made the discovery that all dogs have a mysterious reverence for a trundling stone it calls off attention from the human object and strikes alarm into the caitiffs mind he thinks the stone alive upon this hint we thought it possible to improve stooping down we made believe to launch a stone when in fact we had none and the effect generally followed so well is this understood in greece that according to a popular opinion reported by mr mure the prevailing habit in grecian dogs as well as bitches of absenting themselves from church grows out of the frequent bowing and genuflexions practised in the course of the service the congregation one and all simultaneously stoop the dogs wickedness has made him well acquainted with the meaning of that act it is a symbol but too significant to his conscience and he takes to his heels with the belief that a whole salvo of one hundred and one chermadia are fastening on his devoted hurdies here therefore is a suggestion at once practically useful and which furnishes more than one important elucidation to passages in homer hitherto unintelligible for the sake of one other such passage we shall before dismissing the subject pause upon a novel fact communicated by mr mure which is equally seasonable as a new homeric light and as a serviceable hint in a situation of extremity in the passage already quoted under popes version from odyssey xiv what is the meaning of that singular couplet down sate the sage and cautious to withstand let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand footnote mr mures very singular explanation will remind the naturalist of something resembling it in the habits of buffaloes dampier mentions a case which he witnessed in some island with a malay population where a herd of buffaloes continued to describe concentric circles by continually narrowing around a party of sailors and at last submitted only to the control of children not too far beyond the state of infancy the white breed of wild cattle once so well known at lord tankervilles in northumberland and at one point in the southwest of scotland had a similar instinct for regulating the fury of their own attack but it was understood that when the final circle had been woven the spell was perfect and that the herd would do business most effectually as respects the homeric case i says mr mure am probably not the only reader who has been puzzled to understand the object of this manoeuvre the sitting down on the part of the hero i was first led to appreciate its full value in the following manner at argos one evening at the table of general gordon then commandinginchief throughout the morea and the best historian of the greek revolution but who subsequently resigned and died in the spring of at his seat in aberdeenshire the conversation happened to turn as it frequently does where tourists are in company on this very subject of the number and fierceness of the grecian dogs when one of the company remarked that he knew of a very simple expedient for appeasing their fury happening on a journey to miss his road and being overtaken by darkness he sought refuge for the night at a pastoral settlement by the wayside as he approached the dogs rushed out upon him and the consequences might have been serious had he not been rescued by an old shepherd the eumeus of the fold who after pelting off his assailants gave him a hospitable reception in his hut the guest made some remark on the zeal of his dogs and on the danger to which he had been exposed from their attack the old man replied that it was his own fault from not taking the customary precaution in such an emergency that he ought to have stopped and sate down until some person came to protect him here we have the very act of ulysses with the necessary circumstance that he laid aside his arms after which the two parties were under a provisional treaty and adam smiths doubtful assumption that dogs are incapable of exchange or reciprocal understanding seems still more doubtful as this expedient was new to the traveller he made some further inquiries and was assured that if any person in such a predicament will simply seat himself on the ground laying aside his weapon of defence the dogs will also squat in a circle round him that as long as he remains quiet they will follow his example but that as soon as he rises and moves forward they will renew their assault this story though told without the least reference to the odyssey at once brought home to my own mind the scene at the fold of eumeus with the most vivid reality the existence of the custom was confirmed by other persons present from their own observation or experience yet what if the night were such as is often found even in southern greece during winter a black frost and that all the belligerents were found in the morning symmetrically grouped as petrifactions however here again we have the homer qui nil molitur inepte who addressed a people of known habits yet quare as a matter of some moment for homeric disputes were these habits of ionian colonies or exclusively of greece proper but enough of the repulsive features in greek travelling we for our part have endeavored to meet them with remedies both good and novel now let us turn to a different question what are the positive attractions of greece what motives are there to a tour so costly what are the pros supposing the cons dismissed this is a more difficult question than is imagined so difficult that most people set out without waiting for the answer they travel first and leave to providential contingencies the chance that on a review of the tour in its course some adequate motive may suggest itself certainly it may be said that the word greece already in itself contains an adequate motive and we do not deny that a young man full of animal ardor and high classical recollections may without blame give way to the mere instincts of wandering it is a fine thing to bundle up your traps at an hours warning and fixing your eye upon some bright particular star to say i will travel after thee i will have no other mark i will chase thy rising or thy setting that is on mr wordsworths hint derived from a scottish lake to move on a general object of stepping westwards or stepping eastwards but there are few men qualified to travel who stand in this free unhoused condition of license to spend money to lose time or to court peril in balancing the pretensions of different regions to a distinction so costly as an effectual tour money it is simply the consideration of cost which furnishes the chief or sole ground of administration having but pounds sterling disposable in any one summer a man finds his field of choice circumscribed at once and rare is the household that can allow twice that sum annually he contents himself with the rhine or possibly if more adventurous he may explore the passes of the pyrenees he may unthread the mazes of romantic auvergne or make a stretch even to the western alps of savoy but for the mediterranean and especially for the levant these he resigns to richer men to those who can command from three to five hundred pounds and next having submitted to this preliminary limitation of radius he is guided in selecting from what remains by some indistinct prejudice of his early reading many are they in england who start with a blind faith inherited from mrs radeliffes romances and thousands beside that in southern france or in italy from the milanese down to the furthest nook of the sicilies it is physically impossible for the tourist to go wrong and thus it happens that a spectacle somewhat painful to good sense is annually renewed of confiding households leaving a real calabria in montgomeryshire or devonshire for dreary sunburned flats in bavaria in provence in languedoc or in the legations of the papal territory vintagers at a distance how romantic a sound hops on the other hand how mercenary nay how culinary by the feeling connected with their use or their taxation arcadian shepherds again or sicilian from the bank of delicate galesus can these be other than poetic the hunter of the alpine ibex can he be other than picturesque a sandalled monk mysteriously cowled and in the distance but be sure of that a band of robbers reposing at noon amidst some salvatorrosalooking solitudes of calabria how often have such elements semiconsciously grouped and flashing upon the indistinct mirrors lighted up by early reading seduced english good sense into undertakings terminating in angry disappointment we acknowledge that the english are the only nation under this romantic delusion but so saying we pronounce a very mixed censure upon our country in itself it is certainly a folly which other nations germany excepted are not above but below a folly which presupposes a most remarkable distinction for our literature significant in a high moral degree the plain truth is that southern europe has no romance in its household literature has not an organ for comprehending what it is that we mean by radcliffian romance the old ancestral romance of knightly adventure the sangreal the round table c exists for southern europe as an antiquarian subject or if treated aesthetically simply as a subject adapted to the ludicrous and the secondary romance of our later literature is to the south unintelligible no frenchman spaniard or italian at all comprehends the grand poetic feeling employed and nursed by narrative fictions through the last seventy years in england though connected by us with their own supposed scenery generally in speaking of southern europe it may be affirmed that the idea of heightening any of the grander passions by association with the shadowy and darker forms of natural scenery heaths mountainous recesses forests drear or the sad desolation of a silent seashore of the desert or of the ocean is an idea not developed amongst them nor capable of combining with their serious feelings by the evidence of their literature viz of their poetry their drama their novels it is an interest to which the whole race is deaf and blind a frenchman or an italian for the italian in many features of gallic insensibility will be found ultragallican can understand a state in which the moving principle is sympathy with the world of conscience not that his own country will furnish him with any grand exemplification of such an interest but merely as a human being he cannot escape from a certain degree of human sympathy with the dread tumults going on in that vast theatre a consciencehaunted mind so far he stands on common ground but how this mode of shedding terror can borrow any alliance from chapels from ruins from monastic piles from inquisition dungeons inscrutable to human justice or dread of confessionals all this is unfathomably mysterious to southern europe the southern imagination is passively and abjectly dependent on social interests and these must conform to modern types hence partly the reason that only the british travel the german is generally too poor the frenchman desires nothing but what he finds at home having paris at hand why should he seek an inferior paris in distant lands to an englishman this demur could seldom exist he may think and with introductions into the higher modes of aristocratic life he may know that london and st petersburg are far more magnificent capitals than paris but that will not repel his travelling instincts a superior london he does not credit or desire but what he seeks is not a superior it is a different life not new degrees of old things but new kinds of experience are what he asks his scale of conception is ampler whereas generally the frenchman is absorbed into one ideal why else is it that after you have allowed for a few frenchmen carried of necessity into foreign lands by the diplomatic concerns of so vast a country and for a few artists travelling in quest of gain or improvement we hear of no french travellers as a class and why is it that except as regards egypt where there happens to lurk a secret political object in reversion for france german literature builds its historic or antiquarian researches almost exclusively upon english travellers our travellers may happen or not to be professional but they are never found travelling for professional objects some have been merchants or bankers many have been ecclesiastics but neither commercial nor clerical or religious purposes have furnished any working motive unless where as express missionaries they have prepared their readers to expect such a bias to their researches colonel leake the most accurate of travellers is a soldier and in reviewing the field of marathon of plataa and others deriving their interest from later wars he makes a casual use of his soldiership captain beaufort again as a sailor uses his nautical skill where it is properly called for but in the larger proportions of their works even the professional are not professional whilst such is our academic discipline that all alike are scholars and in this quality of merit the author before us holds a distinguished rank he is no artist though manifesting the eye learned in art and in landscape he is not professionally a soldier he is so only by that secondary tie which in our island connects the landed aristocracy with the landed militia yet though not in a technical sense military he disputes with such as are difficult questions of greek martial history he is no regular agriculturist yet he conveys a good general impression of the greek condition with relation to landed wealth or landed skill as modified at this moment by the unfortunate restraints on a soil handed over in its best parts by a turkish aristocracy that had engrossed them to a bavarian that cannot use them in short mr mure is simply a territorial gentleman elevated enough to have stood a contest for the representation of a great scottish county of general information and in particular he is an excellent greek scholar which latter fact we gather not from anything we have heard but from these three indications meeting together that his verbal use of greek in trying the true meaning of names such as mycene the island of asteris c is original as well as accurate that his display of reading not volunteered or selected but determined by accidents of local suggestion is ample that the frugality of his greek citations is as remarkable as their pertinence he is never tempted into trite references nor ever allows his page to be encumbered by more of such learning than is severely needed with regard to the general motives for travelling his for greece had naturally some relation to his previous reading but perhaps an occasional cause making his true motives operative may have been his casual proximity to greece at starting for he was then residing in italy others however amongst those qualified to succeed him wanting this advantage will desire some positive objects of a high value in a tour both difficult as regards hardships costly and too tedious even with the aids of steam for those whose starting point is england these objects real or imaginary in a greek tour coextensive with the new limits of greek jurisdiction let us now review i the greek people it is with a view to the greeks personally the men women and children who in one sense at least viz as occupants of the greek soil represent the ancient classical greeks that the traveller will undertake this labor representatives in one sense why how now are they not such in all senses do they not trace their descent from the classical greeks we are sorry to say not or in so doubtful a way that the interest derived from that source is too languid to sustain itself against the opposing considerations some authors have peremptorily denied that one drop of genuine grecian blood transmitted from the countrymen of pericles now flows in the veins of any greek subject falmereyer the german is at the head we believe of those who take that view and many who think falmereyer in excess make these unpleasant concessions viz st that in athens and throughout attica where by special preference one would wish to see the grecian cast of face predominating there to a single family almost you may affirm all to be albanian well but what is albanian for the albanian race as having its headquarters in regions once undoubtedly occupied by a greek race epirus for instance acarnania c may still be grecian by descent but unfortunately it is not so the albanians are no more grecian and notoriously no more represent the old legitimate greeks who thumped the persians and whom the romans thumped than the modern english represent the britons or the modern lowland scotch represent the scoti of the centuries immediately following the christian era both english and lowland scotch for the first five centuries after the christian era were ranging the forests of north germany or of southern sweden the men who fought with caesar if now represented at all are so in wales in cornwall or other western recesses of the island and the albanians are held to be a sclavonic race such at least is the accredited theory so that modern greece is connected with russia not merely by the bond of a common church but also by blood since the russian people is the supreme branch of the sclavonic race this is the first concession made which limits any remnant of the true greek blood to parts of the ancient hellas not foremost in general interest nor most likely to be visited a second is that if any claim to a true grecian descent does exist extensively it must be looked for amongst mahometan clans descended from renegades of former days now confounded with our mussulmans ejected from greece and living in thrace or other regions under the sultans sceptre but even here the purity of the descent is in the last degree uncertain this case is remarkable from the stationary character of all things in the east there was a probability beforehand that several nations as in particular four that we will mention the greeks the egyptians the persians the affghans should have presented the same purity of descent untainted by alien blood which we find in the children of ishmael and the children of his halfbrother the patriarch isaac yet in that case where would have been the miraculous unity of race predicted for these two nations exclusively by the scriptures the fact is the four nations mentioned have been so profoundly changed by deluges of foreign conquest or foreign intrusion that at this day perhaps no solitary individual could be found whose ancestral line had not been confounded with other bloods the arabs only and the jews are under no suspicion of this hybrid mixture vast deserts which insulate one side of the arabian peninsula the sea which insulates the other sides have with other causes preserved the arab blood from all general attaint of its purity ceremonies institutions awful scruples of conscience and through many centuries misery and legal persecution have maintained a still more impassable gulf between the jews and other races spain is the only christian land where the native blood was at any time intermingled with the jewish and hence one cause for the early vigilance of the inquisition in that country more than elsewhere hence also the horror of a jewish taint in the spanish hidalgo judaism masquing itself in christianity was so keenly suspected or so haughtily disclaimed simply because so largely it existed it was however under a very peculiar state of society that even during an interval and in a corner jews could have intermarried with christians generally the intensity of reciprocated hatred long oppression upon the one side deep degradation upon the other perpetuated the alienation had the repulsion of creeds even relaxed and hence at this day the intense purity of the jewish blood though probably more than six millions of individuals but with respect to the grecians as no barrier has ever existed between them and any other footnote race than the turks and these only in the shape of religious scruples which on one side had the highest political temptation to give way there was no pledge stronger than individual character there could be no national or corporate pledge for the maintenance of this insulation as therefore in many recorded cases the strongest barrier viz that against mahometan alliances is known to have given way as in other cases innumerable but forgotten it must be presumed to have given way this inference follows viz that if anywhere the grecian blood remains in purity the fact will be entirely without evidence and for us the result will be the same as if the fact had no existence simply as a matter of curiosity if our own opinion were asked as to the probability that in any situation a trueblooded population yet survives at this day we should answer that if anywhere it will be found in the most sterile of the greek islands yet even there the bare probability of such a result will have been open to many disturbances and especially if the island happen to be much in the way of navigators or the harbors happen to be convenient or if it happen to furnish a good stage in a succession of stages according to the ancient usages of mediterranean seamanship or if it possessed towns containing accumulations of provisions or other stores or offered good wateringplaces under any of these endowments an island might be tempting to pirates or to roving adventurers or to remote overpeopled parts of italy africa asia minor c in short to any vicious city where but one man amongst the poorer classes knew the local invitations to murderous aggressions under so many contingencies operative through so many centuries and revolutions so vast upon nations so multiplied we believe that even a poor unproductive soil is no absolute pledge for nonmolestation to the most obscure of recesses for instance the poorest district of the large island crete might if any could be presumed to have a true greek population there is little to be found in that district beyond the means of bare subsistence and considering the prodigious advantages of the ground for defensive war little to be looked for by an invader but hard knocks more kicks than halfpence so long as there was any indigenous population to stand up and kick but often it must have happened in a course of centuries that plague smallpox cholera the sweatingsickness or other scourges of universal europe and asia would absolutely depopulate a region no larger than an island as in fact within our brief knowledge of the new hollanders has happened through smallpox alone to entire tribes of those savages and upon a scale still more awful to the american indians in such cases mere strangers would oftentimes enter upon the lands as a derelict the sfakians in that recess of crete which we have noticed are not supposed by scholars to be a true grecian race nor do we account them such and one reason of our own superadded to the common reasons against allowing a greek origin is this the sfakians are a largelimbed finelooking race more resembling the wallachians whom we have already noticed than the other races of crete or the other greek islanders and like the wallachians are often of colossal stature but the classical greeks we are pretty certain were a race of little men we have more arguments than one for this belief but one will be sufficient the athenian painter who recorded the battle of marathon in fresco upon the walls of a portico was fined for representing the persians as conspicuously taller than the greeks but why why should any artist have ascribed such an advantage to the enemy unless because it was a fact what plausible motive other than the notoriety of the fact can be imagined in the painter in reality this artist proceeded as a general rule amongst the greeks and a rule strictly if not almost superstitiously observed and of ancient establishment which was that all conquerors in any contest or at any games olympic or whatsoever they might be were memorialized by statues exactly representing the living man in the year of victory taken even with their personal defects the dimensions were preserved with such painful fidelity as though the object had been to collect and preserve for posterity a series from every generation of those men who might be presumed by their trophies to have been the models by natural prefiguration for that particular gymnastic accomplishment in which they had severally excelled see the acad des inscriptions about the year at the time of marathon fought against the lieutenant of darius the olympic games had existed for two hundred years minus thirteen and at the closing battle of plataea fought against the lieutenant of xerxes for two hundred minus only two during all this period it is known for certain perhaps even from far older times that this rule of exact portraiture a rigid demand for duplicates or facsimiles of the individual men had prevailed in greece the enormous amount of persian corpses buried by the greeks or perhaps by persian prisoners in the polyandrium on the field of battle would be measured and observed by the artists against the public application for their services and the armor of those select menatarms or greek text oplitai who had regular suits of armor would remain for many centuries suspended as consecrated anathaeyata in the grecian temples so that greek artists would never want sure records of the persian dimensions were it not for this rule applied sternly to all real conflicts it might have been open to imagine that the artist had exaggerated the persons of the enemy by way of exalting to posterity the terrors which their ancestors had faced a more logical vanity than that inverse artifice imputed to alexander of burying in the punjaub gigantic mangers and hyperbolical suits of armor under the conceit of impressing remote ages with a romantic idea of the bodily proportions in the men and horses composing the elite of the macedonian army this was the true secret for disenchanting the martial pretensions of his army were you indeed such colossal men in that case the less is your merit of which most part belongs manifestly to a physical advantage and in the ages of no gunpowder the advantage was less equivocal than it is at present in the other direction the logic of the greek artist who painted marathon is more cogent the persians were numerically superior though doubtless this superiority has been greatly exaggerated not wilfully so much as from natural mistakes incident to the oriental composition of armies and still more on the grecian side from extreme inaccuracy in the original reports which was so great that even herodotus who stood removed from plataea at the time of commencing his labors by pretty much the same interval as we in from waterloo is rightly observed by colonel leake travels in greece to have stated to him the greek numbers on the great day of plataea rather from the basis of fixed rateable contingents which each state was bound to furnish than of any positive return that he could allege however on the whole it seems undeniable that even at platsea much more at marathon the persians had the advantage in numbers if besides this numerical advantage they had another in qualities of bodily structure the inference was the greater to the grecian merit so far from slighting a persian advantage which really existed a greek painter might rather be suspected of inventing one which did not we apprehend however that he invented nothing for besides that subsequent intercourse with persians would have defeated the effect of his representation had it reposed on a fiction it is known that the greeks did not rightly appreciate tallness procerity to use dr johnsons stately word in speaking of the stately prussian regiment was underrated in greece perhaps for this reason that in some principal gymnastic contests running leaping horsemanship and charioteering it really was a disadvantage and hence possibly arose a fact which has been often noticed with surprise viz that the legendary hercules was never delineated by the greek artists as more than an athletic man of the ordinary standard with respect to height and bulk the greek imagination was extravagantly mastered by physical excellence this is proved by the almost inconceivable value attached to gymnastic merit nowhere except in greece could a lyrical enthusiasm have been made available in such a service but amongst physical qualities they did not adequately value that of lofty stature at all events the rule of portraiture the whole portrait and nothing but the portrait which we have mentioned as absolute for greece coerced the painter into the advantageous distinction for the persians which we have mentioned and this rule as servile to the fact is decisive for the greek proportions of body in comparison with the persian but were not some tribes amongst the greeks celebrated for their stature yes the daulians for instance both men and women and in some modern tourist we remember a distinction of the same kind claimed for the present occupants of daulis but the ancient claim bad reference only to the grecian scale tall were they yes but tall for grecians the romans were possibly a shade taller than the greeks but they also were a little race of men this is certain and if a man were incautious enough to plead in answer the standard of the modern italians who are often both tall and athletic he must be reminded that to tramontanes in fact such as goths heruli scyrra lombards and other tribes of the rhine lech or danube italy is indebted for the improved breed of her carcasses footnote man instead of degenerating according to the scandalous folly of books very slowly improves everywhere and the carcasses of the existing generation weighed off million for million against the carcasses of any prechristian generation we feel confident would be found to have the advantage by many thousands of stones the butchers stone is eight pounds upon each million and universally the best prima facie title to a pure greek descent will be an elegantly formed but somewhat undersized person with a lively animated and intelligent physiognomy of which last may be said that if never in the highest sense rising to the noble on the other hand it never sinks to the brutal at liverpool we used to see in one day many hundreds of greek sailors from all parts of the levant these were amongst the most probable descendants from the children of ion or of oeolus and the character of their person was what we describe short but symmetrical figures and faces upon the whole delicately chiselled these men generally came from the greek islands meantime what is mr mures opinion upon this muchvexed question into the general problem he declines to enter not we may be sure from want of ability to treat it with novelty and truth but we collect that he sees no reason for disputing the general impression that an albanian or hybrid population is mainly in possession of the soil and that perhaps he would say lis est de paupere regno for if there is no beauty concerned in the decision nor any of the quality of physical superiority the less seems the value of the dispute to appropriate a set of plain faces to identify the descent of ordinary bodies seems labor lost and in the race now nominally claiming to be grecian mr mure evidently finds only plain faces and ordinary bodies those whom at any time he commends for beauty or other advantages of person are tribes confessedly alien and on the other hand with respect to those claiming to be greek he pronounces a pointed condemnation by disparaging their women it is notoriously a duty of the female sex to be beautiful if they can with a view to the recreation of us males whom lilys grammar affirms to be of the worthier gender sitting at breakfast which consisted of red herrings and gruyere cheese upon the shore of megara mr mure beheld the megarensian lasses mustering in force for a general ablution of the megarensian linen the nymphs had not turned out upon the usual principles of feminine gatherings spectatum venit venit spectentur it ipsae and yet between them the two parties reciprocated the functions each to the other was a true spectacle a long scotchman qui sicca solus secum spatiatur arena and holding in his dexter mauley a red herring whilst a white tablecloth the centre of his motions would proclaim some mysterious rite must to the young ladies have seemed a merman suddenly come up from the sea without sound of conch whilst to him the large deputation from female megara furnished an extra theatre for the inspection of greek beauty there was no river mouth visible the operation being performed in the briny sea itself and so far from this being unusual mr mure notices it as a question of embarrassment to the men of plutarchs age why the phoeacian princess in the odyssey did not wash in the sea but mysteriously preferred the river sympos i qu but as to beauty says mr mure i looked in vain for a figure which either as to face or form could claim even a remote resemblance to nausicaa the modern greek woman indeed appeared to me upon the whole about the most illfavored i have met with in any country and it attests the sefconsistency of mr mure that in aracova the only place where he notices the women as having any pretensions to beauty he and others agree that their countenances are not true to the national type they are generally reputed to offer something much nearer to the bloom and the embonpoint of female rustics in germany and accordingly it is by the bavarian officers of king othos army that these fair aracovites have been chiefly raised into celebrity we cannot immediately find the passage in mr mures book relating to aracova but we remember that although admitting the men to be a tolerably handsome race he was disappointed in the females tall they are and stout but not he thinks beautiful yet in dismissing this subject of personal appearance as the most plausible test now surviving for the claim of a pure greek descent we must not forget to explain that it is far from our design to countenance the hypothesis of any abrupt supercession at any period or by any means to the old grecian blood the very phrase of national type which we used in the last paragraph and the diffusion of a language essentially greek argue at once a slow and gradational transition of the population into its present physical condition mr mure somewhere describes as amongst the characteristics of the present race swarthiness and leanness these we suspect to have been also characteristics of the old original ton dapameibomenoi greeks if so the fact would seem to argue that the changes after all had not been on a scale sufficient to obliterate the primitive type of hellenic nature whilst the existence of any diffused type marks a tendency to national unity and shows that some one element has so much predominated as to fuse the rest into a homogeneous whole indeed it is pretty certain that a powerful cross in any human breed whatever effects it may have in other respects leaves the intellect improved if not in the very highest qualities yet in mobility activity and pertinacity of attention the greek nation has also shown itself morally improved their revolutionary war evoked and tried as in a furnace the very finest qualities of courage both adventurous and enduring and we heartily agree in the sentiment delivered so ably by mr mure that the struggles of these poor shepherds and herdsmen driven into caves and thickets and having no great rallying principle but the banner of the cross against the crescent were as much more truly sublime in suffering and in daring than the classical struggles against the persians as they are and will be more obscure in the page of general history we do not at all question great stamina and noble elements in the modern greek character generations of independence will carry this character to excellence but still we affirm that he who looks for direct descendants from the race of miliades pericles or epaminondas is likely to be disappointed and most disappointed in that athens which for all of us alike as appealing to our imaginative feelings still continues to be what it was for cicero true and very greece in which therefore of all cities locally recalling the classical times we can least brook a disappointment if not the people of greece is it then the natural scenery of greece which can justify the tourist in this preference upon this subject it is difficult to dispute what a man is likely to relish in scenery what style or mode of the natural picturesque and secondly what weight or value he will allow to his own preferences are questions exceedingly variable and the latter of these questions is the more important for the objection is far less likely to arise against this mode of scenery or that since every characteristic mode is relished as a change than universally against all modes alike as adequate indemnifications for the toils of travelling female travellers are apt to talk of scenery as all in all but men require a social interest superadded mere scenery palls upon the mind where it is the sole and everpresent attraction relied on it should come unbidden and unthought of like the warbling of birds to sustain itself in power and at feedingtime we observe that men of all nations and languages tros tyriusve grow savage if by a fine scene you endeavor to make amends for a bad beefsteak the scenery of the himalaya will not draw houses till it finds itself on a line of good hotels this difference noted above between the knowledge and the power of a scenery hunter may be often seen illustrated in the fields of art how common is the old sapless connoisseur in pictures who retains his learned eye and his distinguished skill but whose sensibilities are as dry as summer dust to the interests of the art on the other hand daily you see young people whose hearts and souls are in the forests and the hills but for whom the eye is perfectly untutored if now to the differences in this respect you add the extensive differences which prevail as to the kinds of scenery it is easy to understand how rich in the materials for schism must be every party that starts up on the excitement of mere scenery some laud the caucasus some the northern and eastern valleys of spain some the alpine scenery some the pyrenean all these are different and from all alike differs again what mr mure classes as the classical character of scenery for this he thinks a regular education of the eye requisite such an education he himself had obtained from a residence in italy and subject to that condition he supposes the scenery on the eurotas to the eastern side of the peloponnesus the most delightful in europe we know not it may be so for ourselves the obscure sense of being or moving under a vast superincumbency of some great natural power as of a mighty forest or a trackless succession of mountainous labyrinths has a charm of secret force far better than any distinct scenes to which we are introduced such things ought not to be but still so it is that tours in search of the picturesque are peculiarly apt to break up in quarrels perhaps on the same principle which has caused a fact generally noticed viz that conchologists butterflyfanciers c are unusually prone to commit felonies because too little of a human interest circulates through their arid pursuits the morbid irritation accumulates until the amateur rushes out with a knife lets blood in some quarter and so restores his own connection with the vitalities of human nature in any case we advise the greek tourist to have at least two strings to his bow besides scenery iii is it then the monuments of the antique the memorials of pericles and phidias which a man should seek in greece if so no great use in going beyond athens because though more solemn images survive in other places associated with powers more mysterious and ages more remote as the gate of lions at mycense or the relics yet standing and perhaps to stand for ever of cyclopian cities forms of art that for thousands of years have been dying away through dimness of outlines and vegetable overgrowth into forms of nature yet in athens only is there a great open museum of such monuments the athenian buildings though none of them homeric in point of origin are old enough for us twoandahalf millennia satisfy our grovelling aspirations and mr mure himself whilst insisting on their too youthful character admits that they are superior in number variety and elegance to those which the united cities of greece can now show yet even these pure monuments have been combined with modern aftergrowths as in the case of the propylyoea of which multitudes doubt mr mure in particular whether they can now be detached from the connection with effect for more reasons than one it will perhaps be advisable to leave them in their present condition and that is as hybrid as the population but with respect to athenian buildings it strikes our feelings that finish and harmony are essential conditions to their effect ruins are becoming to gothic buildings decay is there seen in a graceful form but to an attic building decay is more expressive of disease it is scrofula it is phagedoenic ulcer and unless the bavarian government can do more than is now held out or hoped towards the restoration and disengagement of the public buildings surmounting the city we doubt whether there will not be as much of pain as of an artists pleasure in a visit to the athenian capital though now raised to the rank of metropolis for universal greece iv there are however mixed monuments not artificial in their origin but which gradually came to act upon the feelings as such from their use and habitual connection with human purposes such for instance is the acrocorinthus of which mr mure says that it is by far the most striking object that i have ever seen either abroad or at home neither the acropolis of athens nor the larissa of argos nor even gibraltar can enter into the remotest competition with this gigantic citadel indeed when a man is aware of the impression produced by a perpendicular rock over six hundred feet high he may judge of the stupendous effect from a citadel rising almost insulated in the centre of a plain sloping to the sea and ascending to the height of nineteen hundred feet objects of this class together with the mournful pelasgic remains the ruins or ruined plans which point back to egypt and to phoenicia these may serve as a further bribe to the tourist in greece if a collection of all the objects in every class according to the best order of succession for the traveller were arranged skilfully we believe that a maritime circuit of greece with a few landings and short excursions would bring the whole of what is firstrate within a brief period of weeks and an easy effort as to the people they will become more or less entitled to a separate interest according to the improvement and improved popularity of their government and upon that will depend much of the comfort much even of the safety to be looked for by tourists the prospects at present are not brilliant a government and a court drawn from a needy aristocracy like the bavarian are not suited to a needy people struggling with the difficulties of a new colony however we will hope for the best and for the tourist in greece as it is perhaps mr mures work is the best fitted for popularity he touches all things sufficiently but exhausts none and we add very sincerely this antithesis as due to him that of what may be called personal guides or those who maintain a current of personal interest in their adventures or in the selecting from their private experience he is the most learned whilst of learned guides he is in the sense explained the most amusingly personal notes note chief justice squinted probably at the versailles affair where parties were incinerated for which in yorkshire there is a local word crozelled applied to those who lie down upon a treacherous limepit whose crust gives way to their weight but if he meant security in the sense of public funds chiefjustice was still more in error as he will soon learn for the british railways now yield a regular income of three millions per annum one tenth of the interest of the national debt offer as steady an investment as the per cent consols and will soon be quoted in other securities note as respects the elegance of this translation there is good reason to warn the reader that much of the odyssey was let off bycontract like any poorhouse proposal for clods and stickings of beef to low undertakers such as broome and fenton considering the ample fortune which pope drew from the whole work we have often been struck by the inexplicable indulgence with which this scandalous partition is treated by popes biographers it is simply the lowest act of self degradation ever connected with literature note some will urge the intolerance of the greeks for christians of the latin church but that did not hinder alliances and ambitious attempts at such alliances with their venetian masters in the most distinguished of the greek houses witness the infernal atrocities by which the venetian government avenged at times what they viewed as unpardonable presumption see their own records note it may be remarked as a general prevailing tendency amongst the great italian masters of painting that there is the same conspicuous leaning to regard the gigantic as a vulgar straining after effect witness st paul before agrippa and st paul at athens alexander the great or the archangel michael nowhere throughout the whole world is the opposite defect carried to a more intolerable excess than amongst the low but we regret to add and in all but the very highest of london artists many things which the wretched von raumer said of english art were abominable and malicious falsehooods circulated not for london but for berlin and dresden where english engravers and landscapepainters are too justly prized by the wealthy purchasers nor to be hated by the needy sellers indeed to hear von raumers account of our watercolor exhibitions you would suppose that such men as turner dewint prout and many others had no merit whatever and no name except in london raumer is not an honest man but had he fixed his charges on the bookdecorators amongst us what an unlimited field for ridicule the most reasonable in most sentimental poems the musing young gentlemen and ladies usually run to seven and eight feet high and in a late popular novel connected with the tower of london by mr ainsworth which really pushes its falsifications of history to an unpardonable length as eg in the case of the gentle victim lady jane grey the spanish ambassador seems to us at least fourteen feet high and his legs meant for some ambassador who happened to be twentyseven feet high lord carlisle on pope lord carlisles recent lecture upon pope addressed to an audience of artisans drew the public attention first of all upon himself that was inevitable no man can depart conspicuously from the usages or the apparent sympathies of his own class under whatsoever motive but that of necessity he will awaken for the immediate and the first result of his act an emotion of curiosity but all curiosity is allied to the comic and is not an ennobling emotion either for him who feels it or for him who is its object a second however and more thoughtful consideration of such an act may redeem it from this vulgarizing taint of oddity reflection may satisfy us as in the present case it did satisfy those persons who were best acquainted with lord carlisles public character that this eccentric step had been adopted not in ostentation with any view to its eccentricity but in spite of its eccentricity and from impulses of large prospective benignity that would not suffer itself to be defeated by the chances of immediate misconstruction whether advantageous therefore to lord carlisle or disadvantageous and in that case i believe most unjust the first impressions derived from this remarkable lecture pointed themselves exclusively to the person of the lecturer to his general qualifications for such a task and to his possible motives for undertaking it nobody inquired what it was that the noble lord had been discussing so great was every mans astonishment that before such an audience any noble lord should have condescended to discuss anything at all but gradually all wonder subsides de jure in nine days and after this collapse of the primary interest there was leisure for a secondary interest to gather about the subject of the patrician lecture had it any cryptical meaning coming from a man so closely connected with the government could it be open to any hieroglyphic or ulterior interpretations intelligible to whigs and significant to ministerial partisans finally this secondary interest has usurped upon what originally had been a purely personal interest pope what novelty was there still open to even literary gleaners about him a man that had been in his grave for one hundred and six years what could there remain to say on such a theme and what was it in fact that lord carlisle had said to his yorkshire audience there was therefore a double aspect in the public interest one looking to the rank of the lecturer one to the singularity of his theme there was the curiosity that connected itself with the assumption of a troublesome duty in the service of the lowest ranks by a volunteer from the highest and secondly there was another curiosity connecting itself with the choice of a subject that had no special reference to this particular generation and seemed to have no special adaptation to the intellectual capacities of a working audience this double aspect of the public surprise suggests a double question the volunteer assumption by a nobleman of this particular office in this particular service may in the eyes of some people bear a philosophic value as though it indicated some changes going on beneath the surface of society in the relations of our english aristocracy to our english laboring body on the other hand it will be regarded by multitudes as the casual caprice of an individual a caprice of vanity by those who do not know lord carlisles personal qualities a caprice of patriotic benevolence by those who do according to the construction of the case as thus indicated oscillating between a question of profound revolution moving subterraneously amongst us and a purely personal question such a discussion would ascend to the philosophic level or sink to the level of gossip the other direction of the public surprise points to a question that will interest a far greater body of thinkers whatever judgment may be formed on the general fact that a nobleman of ancient descent has thought fit to come forward as a lecturer to the humblest of his countrymen upon subjects detached from politics there will yet remain a call for a second judgment upon the fitness of the particular subject selected for a lecture under such remarkable circumstances the two questions are entirely disconnected it is on the latter viz the character and pretensions of pope as selected by lord carlisle for such an inaugural experiment that i myself feel much interest universally it must have been felt as an objection that such a selection had no special adaptation to the age or to the audience i say this with no wish to undervalue the lecture which i understand to have been ably composed nor the services of the lecturer whose motives and public character in common with most of his countrymen i admire i speak of it at all only as a public opportunity suddenly laid open for drawing attention to the true pretensions of pope as the most brilliant writer of his own class in european literature or at least of drawing attention to some characteristics in the most popular section of popes works which hitherto have lurked unnoticed this is my object and none that can be supposed personal to lord carlisle pope as the subject of the lecture and not the earlier question as to the propriety of any lecture at all under the circumstances recited furnishes my thesis that thesis on which the reader will understand me to speak with decision not with the decision of arrogance but with that which rightfully belongs to a faithful study of the author the editors of pope are not all equally careless but all are careless and under the shelter of this carelessness the most deepseated vices of popes moral and satirical sketches have escaped detection or at least have escaped exposure these and the other errors traditionally connected with the rank and valuation of pope as a classic are what i profess to speak of deliberately and firmly meantime to the extent of a few sentences i will take the liberty of suggesting rather than delivering an opinion upon the other question viz the prudence in a man holding lord carlisles rank of lecturing at all to any public audience but on this part of the subject i beg to be understood as speaking doubtfully conjecturally and without a sufficient basis of facts the late dr arnold of rugby notoriously a man of great ingenuity possessing also prodigious fertility of thought and armed with the rare advantage of being almost demoniacally in earnest was however in some sort of balance to these splendid gifts tainted to excess with the scrofula of impracticable crotchets that was the opinion secretly held about him by most of his nearest friends and it is notorious that he scarcely ever published a pamphlet or contribution to a journal in which he did not contrive to offend all parties both friendly and hostile by some ebullition of this capricious character he hated for instance the high church with a hatred more than theological and that would have recommended him to the favorable consideration of many thousands of persons in this realm the same who have been secretly foremost in the recent outbreak of fanaticism against the roman catholics but unfortunately it happened that although not hating the low church the selfstyled evangelicals he despised them so profoundly as to make all alliance between them impossible he hated also many individuals but not to do him any injustice most or perhaps all of these were people that had been long dead and amongst them by the way was livy the historian whom i distinguish by name as furnishing perhaps the liveliest illustration of the whimsical and all but lunatic excess to which these personal hatreds were sometimes pushed for it is a fact that when the course of an italian tour had brought him unavoidably to the birthplace of livy dr arnold felicitated himself upon having borne the air of that city in fact upon having survived such a collision with the local remembrances of the poor historian very much in those terms which mr governor holwell might have used on finding himself pretty bobbish on the morning after the memorable night in the black hole of calcutta he could hardly believe that he still lived footnote and yet how had the eloquent historian trespassed on his patience and his weak powers of toleration livy was certainly not very learned in the archaeologies of his own country where all men had gone astray he went astray and in geography as regarded the italian movements of hannibal he erred with his eyes open but these were no objects of livys ambition what he aspired to do was to tell the story the tale divine of roman energy and perseverance and he so told it that no man as regards the mere artifices of narration would ever have presumed to tell it after him i cite this particular case as illustrating the furnaceheat of dr arnolds antipathies unless where some consideration of kindness and christian charity interposed to temper his fury this check naturally offered itself only with regard to individuals and therefore in dealing with institutions he acknowledged no check at all but gave full swing to the license of his wrath amongst our own institutions that one which he seems most profoundly to have hated was our nobility or speaking more generally our aristocracy some deadly aboriginal schism he seems to have imagined between this order and the democratic orders some predestined feud as between the head of the serpent and the heel of man accordingly as one of the means most clamorously invoked by our social position for averting some dreadful convulsion constantly brooding over england he insists upon a closer approximation between our highest classes and our lowest especially he seems to think that the peasantry needed to be conciliated by more familiar intercourse or more open expressions of interest in their concerns and by domiciliary visits not offered in too oppressive a spirit of condescension but the close observer of our social condition will differ with dr arnold at starting as to the facts the ancient territorial nobility are not those who offend by hauteur on the contrary a spirit of parental kindness marks the intercourse of the old authentic aristocracy with their dependants and especially with the two classes of peasants on their own estates and their domestic servants footnote those who really offend on this point are the nouveaux riches the parvenus and yet it would be great injustice to say that even these offend habitually no laws of classification are so false as those which originate in human scurrility aldermen until very lately were by an old traditional scurrility so proverbially classed as gluttons and cormorants hovering over dinnertables with no other characteristics whatever or openings to any redeeming qualities that men became as seriously perplexed in our days at meeting an eloquent enlightened and accomplished alderman as they would have been by an introduction to a benevolent cutthroat or a patriotic incendiary the same thing happened in ancient days quite as obstinate as any modern prejudice against a london alderman was the old attic prejudice against the natives of boeotia originally it had grown up under two causes first the animosities incident to neighborhood too close secondly the difference of bodily constitution consequent upon a radically different descent the blood was different and by a wider difference perhaps than that between celtic and teutonic the garrulous athenian despised the hesitating but for that reason more reflecting boeotian and this feeling was carried so far that at last it provoked satire itself to turn round with scorn upon the very prejudice which the spirit of satire had originally kindled disgusted with this arrogant assumption of disgust the roman satirist reminded the scorners that men not inferior to the greatest of their own had been bred or might be bred amongst those whom they scorned summos posse viros et magna exempla daturos vervecum in patria crassoque sub are nasci now if there is any similar alienation between our lowest classes and our highest such as doctor arnold imagined to exist in england at least it does not assume any such character of disgust nor clothe itself in similar expressions of scorn practical jealousy so far as it exists at all lies between classes much less widely separated the master manufacturer is sometimes jealous of those amongst his ministerial agents who tread too nearly upon his own traces he is jealous sometimes of their advances in domestic refinement he is jealous of their aspirations after a higher education and on their part the workmen are apt to regard their masters as having an ultimate interest violently conflicting with their own in these strata of society there really are symptoms of mutual distrust and hostility capital and the aristocracy of wealth is a standing object of suspicion of fear and therefore of angry irritation to the workingclasses but as to the aristocracy of rank and high birth either it is little known to those classes as happens in the most populous hives of our manufacturing industry and is regarded therefore with no positive feeling of any kind or else as in the more exclusively agricultural and pastoral districts is looked up to by the peasantry with blind feelings of reverence as amongst the immemorial monuments of the past involved in one common mist of antiquity with the rivers and the hills of the district with the cathedrals and their own ancestors a halfreligious sentiment of reverence for an old timeoutofmind family associated with some antique residence hall or abbey or castle is a wellknown affection of the rural mind in england and if in one half it points to an infirmity not far off from legendary superstition in the other half it wears the grace of chivalry and legendary romance any malignant scoff therefore against the peerage of england such as calling the house of lords a hospital of incurables has always been a townbred scurrility not only never adopted by the simple rural laborer but not even known to him or distinctly intelligible supposing it were if therefore there are great convulsions lying in wait for the framework of our english society if and more in sorrow than in hope some vast attempt may be anticipated for recasting the whole of our social organization and if it is probable that this attempt will commence in the blind wrath of maddened or despairing labor still there is no ground for thinking with dr arnold that this wrath however blind unless treacherously misled would apply itself primarily to the destruction of our old landed aristocracy it would often find itself grievously in error and selfbaffled even when following its first headlong impulses of revenge but these are the impulses that it would follow and none of these would primarily point in that direction suppose however that the probabilities were different and that a policy of conciliation were become peculiarly needful to the aristocracy which is what dr arnold does suppose in that case might not the course indicated by lord carlisle viz advancing upon a new line of intellectual communication with the laboring classes be the surest mode of retrieving their affections as most likely to flatter their selfesteem in its noblest aspirations one swallow it is true cannot make a summer and others of the aristocracy must repeat the experiment of lord carlisle before any ground can be won for the interest of the order even in lord carlisle it might be added the experiment if it were not followed up would not count for more than a caprice but on the other hand think as we may of the probable results in reference to the purposes of its author we ought to regard it as a sufficient justification that thus the ice has been broken that thus a beginning has been made and thus a sanction established under which no man if otherwise free to enter upon such a path needs ever again to find an obstacle in rank the highest or in blood the most ancient he is authorized by a howard and though doubts must still linger about the propriety of such a course when estimated as a means to a specific end yet for itself in reference to the prudery of social decorum we may now pronounce that to lecture without fee or reward before any audience whatever is henceforth privileged by authentic precedent and unless adulterating with political partisanship is consecrated by its own noble purposes still if it be urged that these noble purposes are not ratified and sealed by a solitary experiment i should answer that undoubtedly lord carlisle has placed himself under a silent obligation to renew his generous effort or in the event of his failing to do so will have made himself a debtor to public censure as one who has planned what he has not been strong enough to accomplish and has founded a staircase or a portico to a temple yet in the clouds had he the ulterior purposes assumed then by deserting or neglecting them he puts on record the instability of his own will had he no these ulterior purposes then and in that confession vanishes into vapor the whole dignity of his bold pretensions as the navigator who first doubled the cape of storms footnote into an untried sea but against a man dealing presumably with a noble purpose we should reckon nobly mean jealousies have no place in circumstances where as yet no meanness has been exhibited the exaction would be too severe upon lord carlisle if by one act of kindness he had pledged himself to a thousand and if because once his graciousness had been conspicuous he were held bound over in all time coming to the unintermitting energies of a missionary amongst pagans the laboring men of yorkshire have not the clamorous necessities of pagans and therefore lord carlisle has not assumed the duties of a working missionary when by personally coming forward to lecture he inaugurated a new era of intellectual prospects for the sons of toil implicitly he promised that he would himself from time to time come forward to cooperate with a movement that had owed its birth to his own summons and impulse but if he cannot honorably release himself from engagements voluntarily assumed on the other hand he cannot justly be loaded with the responsibility of a continued participation in the details of the work which he has set in motion by sympathy with the liberal purposes of an intellectual movement he gives to that movement its initial impulse henceforward it suffices if at intervals he continues to it such expressions of the same sympathy as may sustain its original activity or at least may sustain the credit of his own consistency it cannot be expected that any person in the circumstances of lord carlisle should continue even intermittingly to lecture it is enough if by any other modes of encouragement or by inciting others to follow the precedent which he has set he continues to express an unabated interest in the great cause of intellectual progress amongst poor men a doubt may be raised meantime whether literature is the proper channel into which the intellectual energies of the poor should be directed for the affirmative it may be urged that the interest in literature is universal whilst the interest in science is exceedingly limited on the other hand it may truly be retorted that the scientific interest may be artificially extended by culture and that these two great advantages would in that case arise that the apparatus of means and instruments is much smaller in the one case than the other that science opens into a progression of growing interest whereas literature having no determined order of advance and offering no regular succession of stages to the student does not with the same certainty secure a selfmaintaining growth of pleasureable excitement some remedy however will be applied to this last evil if a regular plan of study should ever be devised for literature and perhaps that may be found not impossible but now coming to the second question namely this question if any lecture at all why upon pope we may see reason to think that lord carlisle was in error to make a choice which is not altogether the best will not of necessity argue an error because much must be allowed to constitutional differences of judgment or of sensibility which may be all equally right as against any philosophic attempts to prove any one of them wrong and a lecturer who is possibly aware of not having made the choice which was absolutely best may defend himself upon the ground that accidental advantages of a personal kind such as previous familiarity with the subject or preconformity of taste to the characteristic qualities of the author selected may have qualified him to lecture on that theme with more effect and with more benefit than upon a theme confessedly higher but less tractable for himself with his own peculiar preparations here however the case is different what might be no error per se becomes one if the special circumstances of the situation show it to have rested upon a deep misconception given the audience which lord carlisle had before him the audience which he anticipated and which he proposed to himself as the modulating law for the quality and style of his lecture that same choice becomes a profound error which for a different audience more refined or more miscellaneous would have been no error at all i do not fear that i shall offend lord carlisle so upright as he has always shown himself so manly and so faithful to his own views of truth by repeating firmly that such a choice in such a situation argues a deep misconception of the true intellectual agencies by which pope acts as a power in literature and of the moral relations to general human sensibilities or universal nature which such agencies involve my belief is that if a prize had been offered for a bad and malappropriate subject none worse could have been suggested unless perhaps it had been the letters of madame de sevigne or the fables of la fontaine in both of which cases the delicacies and subtle felicities of treatment are even more microscopic more shy and more inapprehensible without a special training and culture than in pope and in this point they all agree with no great difference amongst the three that the sort of culture which forms the previous condition for enjoying them a conditio sine qua non is not of a kind to be won from study even of that a mechanic artisan whose daily bread depends upon his labor cannot have had much but the dedication of a life to books would here avail but litttle what is needed must be the sort of culture won from complex social intercourse and of this the laboring artisan can have had none at all even the higher ranks during those stages of society when social meetings are difficult are rare and consequently have their whole intellectual opportunities exhausted in forms and elaborate ceremonials are not able to develope what may be called the social sense that living trembling sensibility to the expressions and the electric changes of human thought and feeling so infinite as they are potentially and as they will show themselves to be when the intercourse is free is sudden is spontaneous and therefore has not leisure to be false amongst all varieties of combination as to sex age rank position and personal accomplishments up to the time of james the first society amongst ourselves wore a picturesque and even a scenical exterior but the inner life and its pulsations had not then been revealed great passions were required to stir the freezing waters so that certain kinds of comedy in which such passions are inappropriate could not then exist and partly to this case it was amongst the early romans united with the almost asiatic seclusion from social meetings of female influence or in any virtual sense even of female presence that we must ascribe the meagreness of the true social interest and of the dialogue exhibited by plautus two separate frosts during a century otherwise so full of movement as the sixteenth in england repressed and killed all germinations of free intellectual or social intercourse amongst ourselves one was the national reserve and this was strengthened by concurring with a national temperament not phlegmatic as is so falsely alleged but melancholic dignified and for that reason if there had been no other antimercurial but the main cause of this reserve lay in the infrequency of visits consequent upon the difficulties of local movement the other frost lay in the spanish stateliness and the inflexibility of our social ceremonies our social meetings of this period even for purposes of pleasure were true solemnities with usage of politeness that laid a weight of silence and delay upon every movement of a social company rapid motion of thought or fancy became in a literal sense physically impossible not until first our capital city had prodigiously expanded not until secondly our representative system had so unfolded its tendencies as to bring politics within the lawful privilege of ordinary conversation not until thirdly the expansions of commerce had forced us into the continual necessity of talking with strangers fourthly not until all these changes gradually breaking up the repulsion which separated our ungarrulous nation had been ratified by continual improvements applied to the construction of roads and the arts of locomotion could it be said that such a state of social intercourse existed as would naturalty prompt the mind to seek food for its own intellectual activity in contemplating the phenomena of that intercourse the primary aspects and the rapid changes of such an object could not arise until the object itself arose satire which follows social intercourse as a shadow follows a body was chained up till then in marston and in donne a man yet unappreciated satire first began to respire freely but applying itself too much as in the great dramatists contemporary with shakspeare to the exterior play of society under charles ii in the hands of dryden and under anne in those of pope the larger and more intellectual sweep of satire showed that social activities were now appreaching to their culmination now at length it became evident that a new mode of pleasure had been ripened and that a great instinct of the intellect had opened for itself an appropriate channel no longer were social parties the old heraldic solemnities footnote enjoined by red letters in the almanac in which the chief objects were to discharge some arrear of ceremonious debt or to ventilate old velvets or to apricate and refresh old gouty systems and old traditions of feudal ostentation which both alike suffered and grew smokedried under too rigorous a seclusion by a great transmigration festal assemblages had assumed their proper station and had unfolded their capacities as true auxiliaries to the same general functions of intellect otherwise expressing themselves and feeding themselves through literature through the fine arts and through scenic representations a new world of pleasures had opened itself offering new subjects of activity to the intellect but also presupposing a new discipline and experience for enjoying them precisely at this point starts off what i presume to think the great error of lord carlisle he postulates as if it were a mere gift of inevitable instinct what too certainly is the gift and the tardy gift of training which training again is not to be won from efforts of study but is in the nature of a slow deposition or sediment as it were from a constant perhaps at the moment an unconscious experience apparently the error is twofold first an oversight in which it is probable that without altogether overlooking the truth lord carlisle allowed to it a very insufficient emphasis but secondly a positive misconception of a broad character the oversight is probably his own and originating in a general habit of too large and liberal concession but the misconception i suspect that he owes to another first concerning the first it is evidently assumed in the adoption of pope for his subject that mechanic artists as a body are capable of appreciating pope i deny it and in this i offer them no affront if they cannot enjoy or if often they cannot so much as understand pope on the other hand they can both enjoy and understand a far greater poet it is no insult but on the contrary it is often a secret compliment to the simplicity and the breadth of a mans intellectual nature that he cannot enter into the artificial the tortuous the conventional many a rude mind has comprehended to the full both milton in his elementary grandeur and shakspeare in his impassioned depths that could not have even dimly guessed at the meaning of a situation in comedy where the comic rested upon arbitrary rules and conventional proprieties in all satiric sketches of society even where the direct object may happen to have a catholic intelligibility there is much amongst the allusions that surround and invest it which no man will ever understand that has not personally mixed in society or understand without very disproportional commentaries and even in that case he will not enjoy it this is true of such compositions as a class but pope in reference to this difficulty is disadvantageously distinguished even amongst his order dryden for instance is far larger and more capacious in his satire and in all the genial parts would approach the level of universal sympathies whereas pope besides that the basis of his ridicule is continually too narrow local and casual is rank to utter corruption with a disease far deeper than false refinement or conventionalism pardon me reader if i use a coarse word and a malignant word which i should abhor to use unless where as in this case i seek to rouse the vigilance of the inattentive by the apparent intemperance of the language pope in too many instances for the sake of some momentary and farcical effect deliberately assumes the license of a liar not only he adopts the language of moral indignation where we know that it could not possibly have existed seeing that the story to which this pretended indignation is attached was to popes knowledge a pure fabrication but he also cites as weighty evidences in the forum of morality anecdotes which he had gravely transplanted from a jestbook footnote upon this however the most painful feature amongst popes literary habits i will not dwell as i shall immediately have occasion to notice it again i notice it at all only for its too certain effect in limiting the sympathy with popes satiric and moral writings absolute truth and simplicity are demanded by all of us as preconditions to any sympathy with moral expressions of anger or intolerance in all conventionalism there is a philosophic falsehood and that would be more than sufficient to repel all general sympathy with pope from the mind of the laboring man apart from the effect of direct falsification applied to facts or of fantastic extravagance applied to opinions of this bar to the popularity of pope it cannot be supposed that lord carlisle was unaware doubtless he knew it but did not allow it the weight which in practice it would be found to deserve yet why suppose that the unpopular tendency in popes writings were of a nature to be surmounted upon a sufficient motive arising suppose it not absolutely impossible to bring pope within the toleration of workingmen upon whom however all that is bad would tell fearfully and most of popes peculiar brilliancy would absolutely go for nothing this notwithstanding suppose the point established that by huge efforts by pulling and hauling by coaxing and flattering and invita minerva the workingman might at length be converted to pope yet finally when all was over what object what commensurate end could be alleged in justification of so much preternatural effort you have got your man into harness that is true and in a sullen fashion he pulls at his burden but after all why not have yoked him according to his own original inclinations and suffered him to pull where he would pull cheerfully you have quelled a natural resistance but clearly with so much loss of power to all parties as was spent uponthe resistance and with what final gain to any party the answer to this lies in the second of the errors which i have imputed to lord carlisle the first error was perhaps no more than an undervaluation of the truth the second if i divine it rightly rests upon a total misconception viz the attribution to pope of some special authority as a moral teacher and this if it were really so would go far to justify lord carlisle in his attempt to fix the attention of literary students amongst the workingclasses upon the writings of pope rightly he would judge that some leading classic must furnish the central object for the general studies each man would have his own separate favorites but it would be well that the whole community of students should also have some common point of interest and discussion pope for such a purpose has some real advantages he is far enough from our own times to stand aloof from the corroding controversies of the age he is near enough to speak in a diction but slightly differing from our own he is sparkling with wit and brilliant good sense and his poems are all separately short but if lord carlisle count it for his main advantage that he is by distinction a moral poet and this i must suppose in order to find any solution whatever for the eagerness to press him upon the attention of our most numerous classes when is it that this idea has originated i suspect that it is derived originally from a distinguished man of genius in the last generation viz lord byron amongst the guardians of lord byron one was the late lord carlisle and lord byron was besides connected by blood with the house of howard so that there were natural reasons why a man of such extraordinary intellectual power should early obtain a profound influence over the present earl of carlisle and the prejudice which i suppose to have been first planted by lord byron would very easily strengthen itself by the general cast of popes topics and pretensions he writes with a showy air of disparaging riches of doing homage to private worth of honoring patriotism and so on through all the commonplaces of creditable morality but in the midst of this surface display and in defiance of his ostentatious pretensions pope is not in any deep or sincere sense a moral thinker and in his own heart there was a misgiving not to be silenced that he was not yet this is strange surely lord carlisle a man of ability and experience might have credit given him for power to form a right judgment on such a question as that power undoubtedly if he had ever been led to use his power that is to make up his opinion in resistance to the popular impression but to this very probably he never had any motive and the reason why i presume to set up my individual opinion in this case against that of the multitude is because i know experimentally that until a man has a sincere interest in such a question and sets himself diligently to examine and collate the facts he will pretty certainly have no title to give any verdict on the case what made lord byron undertake the patronage of pope it was as usually happened with him a motive of hostility to some contemporaries he wished to write up pope by way of writing down others but whatever were the motive we may judge of the style in which he carried out his intentions by the following wellknown mot having mentioned the poets he compares them with the moralists the moralists these are his words the moralists their betters how or in what sense that would satisfy even a lampooner are moralists as a class the betters in a collation with poets as a class it is pretty clear at starting that in order to be a moralist of the first rank that is to carry a great moral truth with heartshaking force into the mind a moralist must begin by becoming a poet for instance to justify the ways of god to man that is a grand moral doctrine but to utter the doctrine authentically a man must write a paradise lost the order of precedency therefore between poets and moralists as laid down by lord byron is very soon inverted by a slight effort of reflection but without exacting from a man so selfwilled as lord byron and at that moment in a great passion any philosophic vigor it may be worth while so far as the case concerns pope to ponder for one moment upon this invidious comparison and to expose the fallacy which it conceals by the term moralist we indicate two kinds of thinkers differing as much in quality as a chestnut horse from horse chestnut and in rank as a roman proconsul from the nautical consuls first clerk at a seaport a clerical moralist in a pulpit reading a sermon is a moralist in the sense of one who applies the rules of a known ethical system viz that system which is contained in the new testament to the ordinary cases of human action such a man pretends to no originality it would be criminal in him to do so or if he seeks for novelty in any shape or degree it is exclusively in the quality of his illustrations but there is another use of the word moralist which indicates an intellectual architect of the first class a grecian moralist was one who published a new theory of morals that is he assumed some new central principle from which he endeavored with more or less success to derive all the virtues and vices and thus introduced new relations amongst the keys or elementary gamut of our moral nature footnote for example the peripatetic system of morality that of aristotle had for its fundamental principle that all vices formed one or other of two polar extremes one pole being in excess the other in defect and that the corresponding virtue lay on an equatorial line between these two poles here because the new principle became a law of coercion for the entire system since it must be carried out harmoniously with regard to every element that could move a question the difficulties were great and hardly to be met by mere artifices of ingenuity the legislative principle needed to be profound and comprehensive and a moralist in this sense the founder of an ethical system really looked something like a great man but valued upon that scale pope is nobody or in newmarket language if ranked against chrysippus or plato or aristotle or epicurus he would be found nowhere he is reduced therefore at one blow to the level of a pulpit moralist or mere applier of moral laws to human actions and in a function so exceedingly humble philosophically considered how could he pretend to precedency in respect of anybody unless it were the amen clerk or the sexton in reality however the case is worse if a man did really bring all human actions under the light of any moral system whatever provided that he could do so sternly justly and without favor this way or that he would perform an exemplary service such as no man ever has performed and this is what we mean by casuistry which is the application of a moral principle to the cases arising in human life a case means a genuine class of human acts but differentiated in the way that law cases are for we see that every case in the law courts conforms in the major part to the genuine class but always or nearly always it presents some one differential feature peculiar to itself and the question about it always is whether the differential feature is sufficient to take it out of the universal rule or whether in fact it ought not to disturb the incidence of the legal rule this is what we mean by casuistry all law in its practical processes is a mode of casuistry and it is clear that any practical ethics ethics applied to the realities of life ought to take the professed shape of casuistry we do not evade the thing by evading the name but because casuistry under that name has been chiefly cultivated by the roman catholic church we protestants with our ridiculous prudery find a stumblingblock in the very name this however is the only service that can be rendered to morality among us and nothing approaching to this has been attempted by pope what is it then that he has attempted certainly he imagines himself to have done something or other in behalf of moral philosophy for in a wellknown couplet he informs us that not in fancys maze he lingered long but stooped to truth and moralized his song upon these lines a lady once made to me this very acute and significant remark the particular direction she said in which pope fancied that he came upon truth showed pretty clearly what sort of truth it was that he searched after had he represented fancy as often is done soaring aloft amongst the clouds then because truth must be held to lie in the opposite direction there might have been pleaded a necessity for descending upon truth like one who is looking for mushrooms but as fancy by good luck is simply described as roaming about amongst labyrinths which are always constructed upon dead levels he had left it free for himself to soar after truth into the clouds but that was a mode of truth which pope cared little for if she chose to go galavanting amongst the clouds pope for his part was the last person to follow her neither was he the man to go down into a well in search of her truth was not liable to wet feet but pope was and he had no such ardor for truth as would ever lead him to forget that wells were damp and bronchitis alarming to a man of his constitution whatever service pope may have meditated to the philosophy of morals he has certainly performed none the direct contributions which he offered to this philosophy in his essay on man are not of a nature to satisfy any party because at present the whole system may be read into different and sometimes into opposite meanings according to the quality of the integrations supplied for filling up the chasms in the chain of the development the sort of service however expected from pope in such a field falls in better with the style of his satires and moral epistles than of a work professedly metaphysical here however most eminently it is that the falseness and hypocrisy which besieged his satirical career have made themselves manifest and the dilemma for any workingman who should apply himself to these sections of popes writings is precisely this reading them with the slight and languid attention which belongs to ordinary reading they will make no particular discoveries of popes hollowness and treacherous infidelities to the truth whether as to things or persons but in such a case neither will they reap any benefit on the other hand if they so far carry out lord carlisles advice as to enter upon the study of pope in the spirit of earnest students and so as really to possess themselves of the key to his inner mind they will rise from their labors not so much in any spirit of gratitude for enlarged and humanizing views of man as in a spirit of cynical disgust at finding that such views can be so easily counterfeited and so often virtually betrayed the paper of last month footnote on lord carlisles lecture having been written under the oppression of a nervous illness accompanied by great suffering may probably enough have been found heavy another objection to that paper is that it too easily assumes the radical falseness of pope as a notorious fact needing no evidence or illustration to myself it did not need either but to any casual reader whose attention had never been attracted to the circumstantialities of popes satiric sketches this assumption would be startling and it would have done him a service to offer a few exemplifications of the vice attributed to pope both as substantiating the charge and as investing it with some little amusement this it had been my intention to do at the moment but being disabled by the illness abovementioned i now supply the omission whom shall we pronounce a fit writer to be laid before an auditory of workingmen as a model of what is just in composition fit either for conciliating their regard to literature at first or afterwards for sustaining it the qualifications for such a writer are apparently these two first that he should deal chiefly with the elder and elementary affections of man and under those relations which concern mans grandest capacities secondly that he should treat his subject with solemnity and not with sneer with earnestness as one under a prophets burden of impassioned truth and not with the levity of a girl hunting a chancestarted caprice i admire pope in the very highest degree but i admire him as a pyrotechnic for producing brilliant and evanescent effects out of elements that have hardly a moments life within them there is a flash and a startling explosion then there is a dazzling coruscation all purple and gold the eye aches under the suddenness of a display that springing like a burning arrow out of darkness rushes back into darkness with arrowy speed and in a moment all is over like festal shows or the hurrying music of such shows it was and it is not untruly therefore was it ever fancied of pope that he belonged by his classification to the family of the drydens dryden had within him a principle of continuity which was not satisfied without lingering upon his own thoughts brooding over them and oftentimes pursuing them through their unlinkings with the sequaciousness pardon a coleridgian word that belongs to some process of creative nature such as the unfolding of a flower but pope was all jets and tongues of flame all showers of scintillation and sparkle dryden followed genially an impulse of his healthy nature pope obeyed spasmodically an overmastering febrile paroxysm even in these constitutional differences between the two are written and are legible the corresponding necessities of utter falsehood in pope and of loyalty to truth in dryden strange it is to recall this one striking fact that if once in his life dryden might reasonably have been suspected of falsehood it was in the capital matter of religion he ratted from his protestant faith and according to the literal origin of that figure he ratted for he abjured it as rats abjure a ship in which their instinct of divination has deciphered a destiny of ruin and at the very moment when popery wore the promise of a triumph that might at any rate have lasted his time dryden was a papist by apostasy and perhaps not to speak uncharitably upon some bias from selfinterest pope on the other hand was a papist by birth and by a tie of honor and he resisted all temptations to desert his afflicted faith which temptations lay in bribes of great magnitude prospectively and in persecutions for the present that were painfully humiliating how base a timeserver does dryden appear on the one side on the other how much of a martyr should we be disposed to pronounce pope and yet for all that such is the overruling force of a nature originally sincere the apostate dryden wore upon his brow the grace of sincerity whilst the pseudomartyr pope in the midst of actual fidelity to his church was at his heart a traitor in the very oath of his allegiance to his spiritual mistress had a lie upon his lips scoffed at her whilst kneeling in homage to her pretensions and secretly forswore her doctrines whilst suffering insults in her service the differences as to truth and falsehood lay exactly where by all the external symptoms they ought not to have lain but the reason for this anomaly was that to dryden sincerity had been a perpetual necessity of his intellectual nature whilst pope distracted by his own activities of mind living in an irreligious generation and beset by infidel friends had early lost his anchorage of traditional belief and yet upon an honorable scruple of fidelity to the suffering church of his fathers he sought often to dissemble the fact of his own scepticism which yet often he thirsted ostentatiously to parade through a motive of truthfulness he became false and in this particular instance he would at any rate have become false whatever had been the native constitution of his mind it was a mere impossibility to reconcile any real allegiance to his church with his known irreverence to religion but upon far more subjects than this pope was habitually false in the quality of his thoughts always insincere never by any accident in earnest and consequently many times caught in ruinous selfcontradiction is that the sort of writer to furnish an advantageous study for the precious leisure precious as rubies of the toilworn artisan the root and the pledge of this falseness in pope lay in a disease of his mind which he like the roman poet horace mistook for a feature of preternatural strength and this disease was the incapacity of selfdetermination towards any paramount or abiding principles horace in a wellknown passage had congratulated himself upon this disease as upon a trophy of philosophic emancipation nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor liospes which words pope thus translates and applies to himself in his english adaptation of this epistle but ask not to what doctors i apply sworn to no master of no sect am i as drives the storm at any door i knock and house with montaigne now or now with locke that is neither one poet nor the other having as regarded philosophy any internal principle of gravitation or determining impulse to draw him in one direction rather than another was left to the random control of momentary taste accident or caprice and this indetermination of pure unballasted levity both pope and horace mistook for a special privilege of philosophic strength others it seems were chained and coerced by sertain fixed aspects of truth and their efforts were overruled accordingly in one uniform line of direction but they the two brilliant poets fluttered on butterflywings to the right and the left obeying no guidance but that of some instant and fugitive sensibility to some momentary phasis of beauty in this dream of drunken eclecticism and in the original possibility of such an eclecticism lay the ground of that enormous falsehood which pope practised from youth to age an eclectic philosopher already in the very title which he assumes proclaims his selfcomplacency in the large liberty of error purchased by the renunciation of all controlling principles having severed the towingline which connected him with any external force of guiding and compulsory truth he is free to go astray in any one of ten thousand false radiations from the true centre of rest by his own choice he is wandering in a forest all but pathless ubi passim pallantes error recto de tramite pellit and a forest not of sixty days journey like that old hercynian forest of caesars time but a forest which sixty generations have not availed to traverse or familiarize in any one direction for horace as i have endeavored to explain in the note the apology is so much the readier as his intrusions into this province of philosophy are slighter more careless and more indirect but popes are wilful premeditated with malice aforethought and his falsehoods wear a more malignant air because they frequently concern truth speculative and are therefore presumably more deliberate in their origin and more influential in the result it is precisely this part of popes errors that would prove most perplexing to the unlearned student beyond a doubt the essay on man would in virtue of its subject prove the most attractive to a laboring man of all popes writings as most of all promising a glimpse into a world of permanence and of mysterious grandeur and having an interest therefore transcendent to any that could be derived from the fleeting aspects of manners or social conventionalisms though illuminated and vivified by satire here would be the most advantageous and remunerative station to take for one who should undertake a formal exposure of popes hollowheartedness that is it would most commensurately reward the pains and difficulties of such an investigation but it would be too long a task for this situation and it would be too polemic it would move through a jungle of controversies for to quote a remark which i once made myself in print the essay on man in one point resembles some doubtful inscriptions in ancient forms of oriental languages which being made up elliptically of mere consonants can be read into very different senses according to the different sets of vowels which the particular reader may choose to interpolate according to the choice of the interpreter it may be read into a loyal or a treasonable meaning instead of this i prefer as more amusing as less elaborate and as briefer to expose a few of popes personal falsehoods and falsehoods as to the notorieties of fact truths speculative oftentimes drives its roots into depth so dark that the falsifications to which it is liable though detected cannot always be exposed to the light of day the result is known but not therefore seen truth personal on the other hand may be easily made to confront its falsifier not with refutation only but with the visible shame of refutation such sharoe would settle upon every page of popes satires and moral epistles oftentimes upon every couplet if any censor armed with an adequate knowledge of the facts were to prosecute the inquest apd the general impression from such an inquest would be that pope never delineated a character nor uttered a sentiment nor breathed an aspiration which he would not willingly have recast have retracted have abjured or trampled under foot with the curses assigned to heresy if by sueh an act he could have added a hue of brilliancy to his coloring or a new depth to his shadows there is nothing he would not have sacrificed not the most solemn of his opinions nor the most pathetic memorial from his personal experiences in return for a sufficient consideration which consideration meant always with him poetic effect it is not as too commonly is believed that he was reckless of other peoples feelings so far from that he had a morbid facility in his kindness and in cases where he had no reason to suspect any lurking hostility he showed even a paralytic benignity but simply and constitutionally he was incapable of a sincere thought or a sincere emotion nothing that ever he uttered were it even a prayer to god but he had a fancy for reading it backwards and he was evermore false not as loving or preferring falsehood but as one who could not in his heart perceive much real difference between what people affected to call falsehood and what they affected to call truth volumes might be filled with illustrations i content myself with three or four i pope felt intellectually that it was philosophic and also that it wore an air of nobility not to despise poverty morally however he felt inversely nature and the accidents of his life had made it his necessity to despise nothing so heartily if in any one sentiment he ever was absolutely sincere if there can be cited one insulated case upon which he found it difficult to play the hypocrite it was in the case of that intense scorn with which he regarded poverty and all the painful circumstances that form the equipage of poverty to look at a pale dejected fellowcreature creeping along the highway and to have reason for thinking that he has not tasted food since yesterday what a pang would such a sight accompanied by such a thought inflict upon many a million of benign human hearts but in pope left to his spontaneous nature such a sight and such a thought would have moved only fits of laughter not that he would have refused the poor creature a shilling but still he would have laughed for hunger and cold and poverty appeared to him only in the light of drolleries and too generally of scoundrelisms still he was aware that some caution was requisite in giving public expression to such feelings accordingly when he came forward in galadress as a philosopher he assumed the serene air of one upon whom all such idle distinctions as rich and poor were literally thrown away but watch him follow his steps for a few minutes and the deep realities of his nature will unmask themselves for example in the first book of the dunciad he has occasion to mention dennis and all the mighty mad in dennis raged upon this line the th of the text he hangs a note in the course of which he quotes a few sentences about dennis from theobald one of these begins thus did we really know how much this poor man suffers by being contradicted c upon which pope thinks proper to intercalate the following pathetic parenthesis in italics i wish that reflection on poverty had been spared how amiable how pretty could joseph surface have more dexterously improved the occasion the man that disparages poverty is a man that c it is manifest however at a glance that this virtuous indignation is altogether misplaced for poor in the quotation from theobald has no reference whatever to poverty as the antithesis to wealth what a pity that a whole phial of such excellent scenical morality should thus have been uncorked and poured out upon the wrong man and the wrong occasion really this unhappy blunder extorts from me as many tears of laughter as ever poverty extorted from pope meantime reader watch what follows wounded so deeply in his feelings by this constrained homage to poverty pope finds himself unable to resettle the equilibrium in his nervous system until he has taken out his revenge by an extra kicking administered to some old mendicant or vagrant lying in a ditch at line comes the flourish about denniss poverty just nine lines ahead keeping close as a policeman upon the heels of a thief you come up with pope in the very act of maltreating gibber upon no motive or pretence whatever small or great but that he the said gibber was guilty of poverty pope had detected him and this is popes own account of the assault in an overt act of poverty he deposes as if it were an ample justification of his own violence that gibber had been caught in the very act not of supping meanly coarsely vulgarly as upon tripe for instance or other offal but absolutely in the act of not supping at all swearing and supperless the hero sate here one is irresistibly reminded of the old story about the cat who was transformed into a princess she played the role with admirable decorum until one day a mouse ran across the floor of the royal saloon when immediately the old instinct and the hereditary hatred proved too much for the artificial nature and her highness vanished over a sixbarred gate in a furious mousechase pope treading in the steps of this model fancies himself reconciled to poverty poverty however suddenly presents herself not as a high poetic abstraction but in that one of her many shapes which to pope had always seemed the most comic as well as the most hateful instantly popes ancient malice is rekindled and in line we find him assaulting that very calamity under one name which under another at line he had treated with an ostentatious superfluity of indulgence ii i have already noticed that some of popes most pointed examples which he presents to you as drawn from his own experience of life are in fact due to jestbooks and some offered as facts are pure coinages of his own brain when he makes his miser at the last gasp so tenacious of the worldly rights then slipping from his grasp as that he refuses to resign a particular manor pope forgot that even a jestbook must govern its jokes by some regard to the realities of life and that amongst these realities is the very nature and operation of a will a miser is not therefore a fool and he knows that no possible testamentary abdication of an estate disturbs his own absolute command over it so long as he lives or bars his power of revoking the bequest the moral instruction is in this case so poor that no reader cares much upon what sort of foundation the story itself rests for such a story a lie may be a decent basis true but not so senseless a lie if the old miser was delirious there is an end of his responsibilities and nobody has a right to draw upon him for moral lessons or warnings if he was not delirirous the case could not have happened modelled in the same spirit are all popes pretended portraitures of women and the more they ought to have been true as professing to be studies from life the more atrociously they are false and false in the transcendent sense of being impossible heaps of contradiction or of revolting extravagance do not verify themselves to our loathing incredulity because the artist chooses to come forward with his arms akimbo saying angrily but i tell you sir these are not fancypieces these ladies whom i have here lampooned are familiarly known to me they are my particular friends i see them every day in the undiess of confiding friendship they betray all their foibles to me in the certainty that i shall take no advantage of their candor and will you coming a century later presume to dispute the fidelity or the value of my contemporary portraits yes and upon these two grounds first as to the fidelity that the pretended portraits are delineations of impossible people and secondly as to the value that if after all they could be sworn to as copies faithful to the originals not the less are they to be repelled as abnormal and so far beyond the intelligibilities of nature as practically to mean nothing neither teaching nor warning the two duchesses of marlborough for instance sarah and henrietta are atrocious caricatures and constructed on the desperate principle of catching at a momentary stare or grin by means of anarchy in the features imputed and truculent antithesis in the expression who does not feel that these are the fierce pasquinades and the coarse pasquinades of some malignant electioneering contest is there a line that breathes the simplicity and singleheartedness of truth equal disgust settles upon every word that pope ever wrote against lady mary w montagu having once come to hate her rancorously and finding his hatred envenomed by the consciousness that lady mary had long ceased to care two straws for all the malice of all the wits in christendom pope labored at his own spite filing it and burnishing it as a handpolisher works at the the blade of a scymitar for years he had forgotten to ask after the realities of nature as they existed in lady mary and considered only what had the best chance of stinging her profoundly he looked out for a raw into which he might lay the lash not seeking it in the real woman but generally in the nature and sensibilities of abstract woman whatever seemed to disfigure the idea of womanhood that by reiterated touches he worked into his portraits of lady mary and at length no doubt he had altogether obliterated from his own remembrance the true features of her whom he so much detested on this class of popes satiric sketches i do not however wish to linger having heretofore examined some of the more prominent cases with close attention my last paper on pope has been taxed with exaggeration this charge comes from a london weekly journal the leader distinguished by its ability by its hardihood of speculation by its comprehensive candor but in my eyes still more advantageously distinguished by its deep sincerity such qualities give a special value to the courtesies of that journal and i in particular as a literary man have to thank it for repeated instances of kindness the most indulgent on any occasion which has brought up the mention of my name such qualities of necessity give a corresponding value to its censures and accordingly as a point of duty i directed my attention immediately to this censure whatever was still unprinted i reviewed and whatever struck me as open to objection i removed and if the result after all has been that i do not altogether concur in the criticism of the leader the reason is because as upon reexamination it strikes me in the worst cases pope has not left room for exaggeration i do not see any actual exaggeration simply because i do not see that any exaggeration is possible but though i thus found myself unable sincerely to make the sacrifice of my own opinion another sacrifice of a different kind i have made viz that of half my paper i cancelled one half viz that half which was occupied with cases in pope of disingenuousness and perhaps of moral falsehood or collusion with other peoples falsehood but not of falsehood atrociously literal and conscious meaning thus to diminish by one half the penance of those who do not like to see pope assaulted although forced by uneasiness to watch the assault feeling with which i heartily sympathize and meaning on the other hand in justification of mylelf to throw the readers attention more effectively because more exclusively upon such cases of frantic and moonstruck falsehood as could allow no room for suspense or mitigation of judgment of these i have selected two one relating to the duke of buckingham and the other to the history and derivation of english literature generally i believe that to a just appreciation of popes falseness levity and selfcontradiction it is almost essential that a reader should have studied him with the purpose of becoming his editor this at one time was my own purpose and thus it was that i became acquainted with qualities prevailing in pope which in the midst of my great admiration for him would have made such a purpose difficult of execution for in the relation between author and editor any harshness of reproach on the part of the latter or any expression of alienation and imperfect sympathy seems unbecoming in one who has spontaneously assumed the office of a patronus to a client and are uniformly painful to the reader on this account it is that the late mr roscoe figures amongst all editors of pope as by far the most agreeable he has a just tenderness for the memory and merits of the great writer whom he undertakes to edit this feeling keeps his annotations clear from the petulance of joseph warton and the malice of bowles whilst not having happened to see popes errors in the same light as myself he suffers from no conflict between his natural indulgence to intellectual splendor and his conscientious reverence for truth but if the reader is shocked with popes false reading of phenomena where not the circumstances so much as the construction of the circumstances may be challenged what must he think of those cases in which downright facts and incidents the most notorious have been outrageously falsified only in obedience to a vulgar craving for effect in the dramatic situations or by way of pointing a moral for the stimulation of torpid sensibilities take for instance the death of the second villiers duke of buckingham a story which in popes version of it has travelled into a popularity that may be called national and yet the whole is one tissue of falsehoods and of falsehoods that must have been known for such by pope not less than to most of his contemporary readers suppose them not known and the whole must have wanted all natural interest for this interest lay in the dukes character in his superb accomplishments and natural advantages in his fine person in his vast wealth and in the admirable versatility of his intellectual powers which made him alternately the idol and the terror of all circles that he approached which caused lord clarendon to tremble with impotent malice in his chancellors robes and dry den to shiver with panic under his laureate crowns now wherever these features of the case were not known the story was no more than any ordinary death arising out of a foxchase but those to whom they were known must at the same time have known the audacious falsehood which disfigures the story in popes way of telling it without the personal interest the incidents were nothing and with that interest at starting popes romance must have defeated itself by its fabulous coloring let me recall to the reader the principal lines in this famous description in the worst inns worst room with mat half hung the floors of plaster and the walls of dung on once a flockbed but repaired with straw with tapetied curtains never meant to draw the george and garter dangling from that bed where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red great villiers lies alas how changed from him that life of pleasure and that soul of whim gallant and gay in clivedens proud alcove the bower of wanton shrewsbury and love there victor of his health of fortune friends and fame the lord of useless thousands ends without stopping to examine these famous lines as to thought and expression both of which are scandalously vicious what i wish the reader to remark is the one pervading falsehood which connects them wherefore this minute and purely fanciful description of the roadside cabaret with its bedroom and bed wherefore this impertinent and also fraudulent circumstantiality it is as pope would tell you for the sake of impressing with more vivacity the abject poverty to which the dukes follies had brought him the wretched bed for instance is meant to be the exponent of the empty purse which could purchase no better and for fear that you might miss this construction of the passage pope himself tells you in a prose note that the duke died in a remote inn in yorkshire reduced to the utmost misery being engaged in the business of dying it could hardly be expected that the duke should be particularly happy but what pope means you to understand by misery is poverty the prose note simply reiterates the words victor of fortune in the text now had the truth been really so what moral would such a story exemplify beyond the vulgar one of pecuniary improvidence and yet surely this was not the cause of the dukes being thrown from his horse meantime pope well knew that the whole was a ridiculous fable the duke had the misfortune to be fatally injured in a foxchase in such an extremity naturally his servants carry him into the house nearest at hand which happens to be an alehouse not the worst since there was no other nor was it possible that to a man of his distinction once the lordlieutenant of that very east riding any room would be offered worse than the very best that contained a bed in these dreadful circumstances it is not easy to measure the levity which can linger upon the description of such exquisite impertinences as the housewifely defects of the walls the curtains the flockbed c but pope was at his wits end for a striking falsehood he needed for a momentary effect some tale of a great lord once fabulously rich who had not left himself the price of a halter or of a paupers bed and thus for the sake of extorting a stare of wonderment from a mob of gaping readers he did not scruple to give birth and currency to the grossest of legendary lies the dukes death happened a few months before popes birth but the last of the villiers family that wore a ducal coronet was far too memorable a person to have died under the cloud of obscurity which popes representation presumes he was the most interesting person of the alcibiades class footnote that perhaps ever existed and popes mendacious story found acceptance only amongst an aftergeneration unacquainted with the realities of the case there was not so much as a popular rumor to countenance pope the story was a pure gratuitous invention of his own even at the time of his death the duke of buckingham was generally reputed to have sixty thousand per annum and chiefly from land an income at that period absolutely without precedent or parallel in europe in this there might be some exaggeration as usually there is in such cases but the fairfax papers have recently made it manifest that popes tale was the wildest of fictions the duke of buckingham had to some extent suffered from his loyalty to the crown though apparently sheltered from the main fury of the storm by the interest of his presbyterian fatherinlaw and in his own person he had at one time been carelessly profuse but all this was nothing the sting of popes story requires him to have been a pauper and yet o heaven and incredulous earth a pauper hunting upon bloodhorses in a star and garter and perhaps in a collar of ss the plain historical truth meanwhile survives that this pauper was simply the richest man in christendom and that except aladdin oh yes always except aladdin of the arabian nights there never had been a richer and thus collapses the whole fable like a soapbubble punctured by a surgeons probe ii yet even this specimen of popes propensity to falsehood is far from being the worst here were facts scandalously distorted falsehoods they were but if it had pleased god they might have been truths next however comes a fiction so maniacally gross so incoherent and so rife with internal contradictions as to involve its own exposure literally shrinking from its own intelligible enunciation burrowing in sentences kept aloof from the text and calling upon footnotes to cover it the case will speak for itself pope had undertaken to translate the wellknown epistle of horace to augustus caesar not literally but upon the principle of adapting it to a modern and english treatment of its topics caesar upon this system becomes george the second a very strange sort of caesar and pope is supposed to have been laughing at him which may be the color that pope gave to the travesty amongst his private circle otherwise there is nothing in the expressions to sustain such a construction rome with a little more propriety masquerades as england and france as greece or more strictly as athens now by such a transformation already from the very beginning pope was preparing for himself a dire necessity of falsehood and he must have known it once launched upon such a course he became pledged and committed to all the difficulties which it might impose desperate necessities would arise from which nothing but desperate lying and hard swearing could extricate him the impossibility of carrying through the parallel by means of genuine correspondences threw him for his sole resource upon such as were extravagantly spurious and apparently he had made up his mind to cut his way through the ice though all the truths that ever were embattled against baron munchausen should oppose his advance accordingly about the middle of the epistle a dilemma occurs from which no escape or deliverance is possible except by an almighty falsehood take the leap pope must or else he must turn back when halfway through horace had occasion to observe that after rome had made a conquest of greece by force of arms captive greece retaliated upon her conqueror by another kind of victory namely by that of arts footnote graecia capta ferum ietorera cepit et artes intulit agresti latio now in the corresponding case as pope had arranged it between england and france the parallel certainly held good as far as the military conquest england it was undeniable had conquered france in that sense as completely as ever rome had conquered greece or macedon two english kings had seated themselves in succession upon the throne of france one virtually one formally so far all was tight and held water nothing could disturb that part of the case but next came the retaliatory conquest by means of arts and letters how was this to be dealt with what shadow or dream of a correspondency could be made out there what impudence could face that already in popes ears sounded the trumpet of recall and pope mused a little but no he said in effect i will not turn back why should i it is but one astounding falsehood that is wanted to set me free i will venture to say that mendez pinto the portuguese liar that sir john mandeville the traveller that baron munchausen the most philosophic of bold adventurers into the back settlements of lying never soared into such an aerial bounce never cleared such a rasper of a fence as did pope on this occasion he boldly took it upon his honor and credit that our english armies in the times of agincourt and the regent bedford found in france a real fullgrown french literature packed it up in their baggagewagons and brought it home to england the passage from horace part of which has been cited above stands thus in the translation of pope we conquered france but felt our captives charms her arts victorious triumphed oer our arms britain to soft refinements less a foe wit grew polite and numbers learned to flow ten years then before joan of arcs execution footnote viz about if we are to believe pope or even fifteen years france had a great domestic literature and this unknown literature has actually furnished a basis to our own let us understand clearly what it is that pope means to assert for it is no easy matter to do that where a man dodges behind texts and notes and shuffles between verse and prose mystifying the reader and designing to do so under the torture of crossexamination let us force pope to explain what literature that is which having glorified france became the venerable mother of a fine english literature in an early stage of the fifteenth century the reader perhaps fancies that possibly pope may have expressed himself erroneously only from being a little hurried or a little confused not at all i know my man better perhaps than the reader does and i know that he is trying to hoax us he is not confused himself but is bent upon confusing us and i am bent upon preventing him and therefore again i ask sternly what literature is this which very early in the fifteenth century as early as agincourt we english found prospering in france and which for the benefit of the english intellect such men as ancient pistol nym bardolph fluellen capt macmorris jamy and other wellknown literati in the army of henry v transplanted or as the wise it call conveyed to england agincourt was fought in exactly four centuries before waterloo that was the beginning of our domination in france and soon after the middle of that same fifteenth century viz about our domination was at an end during that interval therefore it must have been then or not at all that this great intellectual revolution worked by france upon england was begun and completed naturally at this point the most submissive and sycophantish of popes friends would feel moved by the devil of curiosity if not absolutely by the devil of suspicion humbly to ask for a name or two just as a specimen from this great host of anglogallic wits pope felt and groaned as he felt that so reasonable a demand could not be evaded this comes of telling lies must have been his bitter reflection one lie makes a necessity for another however he reflected that this second lie need not be introduced into the text where it would have the fatal effect of blowing up the whole bubble it might be hidden away in a footnote not one person in twenty would read it and he that did might easily suppose the note to be some unauthorized impertinence of a foolish commentator secretly therefore silently stealthily so as to draw as little attention as possible pope introduced into a note his wicked little brazen solution of his own wicked and brazen conundrum france such was the proposition had worked a miracle upon english ground as if with some magicians rod she had called up spawn innumerable of authors lyric epic dramatic pastoral each after his kind but by whom had france moved in this creation as the chief demiurgus by whom mr pope name name mr pope ay we must suppose the unhappy man to reply thats the very question which i was going to answer if you wouldnt be so violent well answer it then take your own time but answer for we dont mean to be put off without some kind of answer listen then said pope and ill whisper it into your ear for its a sort of secret now think reader of a secret upon a matter like this which if true at all must be known to the antipodes however let us have the secret the secret replied pope is that some time in the reign of charles the second when i wont be positive but im sure it was after the restoration three gentlemen wrote an eighteenpenny pamphlet good and what were the gentlemens names one was edmund waller the poet one was mr godolphin and the other was lord dorset this trinity of wits then you say mr pope produced a mountain price eighteenpence and this mountain produced a mouse oh no it was just the other way they produced a mouse price eighteenpence and this mouse produced a mountain viz the total english literature o day and night but this is wondrous strange the total english literature not the tottle only but the tottle of the whole like an oak and the masts of some great amiral that once slept in an acorn absolutely lying hid in an eighteenpenny pamphlet and what now might this pamphlet be about was it about the curing of bacon or the sublimer art of sowing moonshine broadcast it was says pope if you must know everything a translation from the french and judiciously chosen for it was the worst and surely everybody must think it proper to keep back the best until the english had earned a right to such luxuries by showing a proper sense of their value the worst it was and by very much the worst of all corneilles dramas and its name was pompey pompey was it and so then from pompeys loins we the whole armies of english litterateurs grubs and eagles are lineally descended so says pope so he must say in obedience to his own line of argument and this being the case one would be glad to have a look at pompey it is hard upon us literati that are the children of pompey not to have a look at the author of our existence but our chance of such a look is small indeed for pompey you are to understand reader never advanced so far as to a second edition that was a poor return on the part of england for pompeys services and my too sceptical mind at one time inclined to doubt even pompeys first edition which was wrong and could have occurred only to a lover of paradoxes for warton not tom but joe had actually seen pompey and records his opinion of him which happened to be this that pompey was pitiful enough these are joes own words still i do not see that one witness establishes a fact of this magnitude a shade of doubt therefore continues to linger over pompeys very existence and the upshot is that pompey not the great but confessedly the doubtful eighteenpenny pompey but in any case pompey the pitiful is the great overriding and tutelary power under whose inspiration and inaugurating impulse our english literature has blossomed and ripened root stem and branch through the lifestruggles of five centuries into its present colossal proportions here pause reader and look back upon the separate reticulations so as if possible to connect them in this network of hideous extravagance where as elsewhere it happens that one villany hides another and that the mere depth of the umbrage spread by fraudulent mystifications is the very cause which conceals the extent of those mystifications contemplated in a languid mood or without original interest in the subject that enormity of falsehood fails to strike which under circumstances personally interesting would seem absolutely incredible the outrage upon the intellect actually obscures and withdraws the outrage upon the facts and inversely the affronts to historical accuracy obscure the affronts to good sense look steadily for a moment at the three points in the array of impeachments i in the redrose invasion of france pope assumes as a matter of notoriety that the english invading force went from a land of semibarbarism to a land of literature and refinement the simple fact being so conspicuously the other way that whilst france had no literature at all consequently could have nothing to give there being no book extensively diffused in the france of that period except the de imitatione christi footnote england on the other hand had so bright a jewel to offer that to this hour the whole of christendom has not matched it or approached it even at present in the case so often supposed that a man were marooned that is confined as regarded his residence to one desert island and marooned also as to books confined i mean as regarded his reading to one sole book his choice if he read english would probably oscillate between shakspeare and chaucers canterbury tales now the canterbury tales had been finished about thirtyfive years before agincourt so exquisitely false even in this point is popes account against the nothing of beggarly france was even then to be set a work which has not been rivalled and probably will not be rivalled on our planet ii in this comparison of the france and england then existing historically pope betrays an ignorance which is humiliating he speaks of france as if that name of course covered the same states and provinces that it now covers but take away from the france of this day the parts then possessed by burgundy take away alsace and lorraine and franche compte take away the alien territories adjacent to spain and navarre take away avignon c take away the extensive duchy of britanny c and what remains of that which constituted the france of popes day but even that which did remain had no cohesion or unity as regarded any expanded sentiment of nationality or the possibilities of a common literature the moral anachronisms of pope in this case are absolutely frightful and the physical anachronisms of pope also for the simple want of roads by intercepting all peaceful and pleasurable intercourse must have intercepted all growth of nationality unless when a rare community of selfish interest happened to arise as when the whole was threatened with conquest or with famine through foreign aggression upon a part iii that particular section of the french literature through which pope pretends to think for think he does not that france absolutely created our own was the drama eighteenpenny pompey belongs to this section now most unhappily these two broad facts are emblazoned beyond all power of impudence to darken them the first is that our english drama was closing or actually had closed just about the time when the french was opening shakspeare notoriously died in when corneille footnote was yet a child of ten and the last of shakspeares great contemporary dramatists died according to my remembrance in and in one year earlier was first performed the first successful tragedy the medea of corneille about seven or eight years after that the puritans officially suppressed the english drama by suppressing the theatres at the opening of the parliamentary war the elder that is the immortal english drama had finished its career but racine the chief pillar of the french did not begin until cromwell was dead and gone and charles ii was restored so here we have the asopian fable of the lamb troubling the waters for the wolf or in the greek proverb ano potamon the other fact is that as no section whatever of the french literature has ever availed to influence or in the slightest degree to modify our own it happens that the dramatic section in particular which pope insists on as the galvanizing force operating upon our seers has been in the most signal repulsion to our own all the other sections have been simply inert and neutral but the drama has ever been in murderous antagonism to every principle and agency by which our own lives and moves footnote and to make this outrage upon truth and sense even more outrageous pope had not the excuse of those effeminate critics sometimes found amongst ourselves who recognise no special divinity in our own drama that would have been one great crime the more but it would have been one inconsistency the less for pope had been amongst the earliest editors of shakspeare he had written a memorable preface to this edition the edition it is true was shocking and if the preface even was disfigured by concessions to a feeble system of dramatic criticism rhetorically it was brilliant with the expression of a genuine enthusiasm as to shakspeare and a true sympathy with his colossal power iv yet even this may not be the worst even below this deep perhaps there opens a lower deep i submit that when a man is asked for a specimen of the agincourt french literature he cannot safely produce a specimen from a literature two hundred and fifty years younger without some risk of facing a writ de lunatico inquirendo pompey the pitiful or if the reader is vexed at hearing him so called let us call him with lord biron in loves labors lost more than great great pompey pompey the huge was not published even in france until about two centuries and a quarter had elapsed from agincourt but as respects england eighteenpenny pompey was not revealed the fulness of time for his avatar amongst us did not arrive until something like two hundred and sixty years had winged their flight from agincourt and yet popes doctrine had been that in the conquest of france we english first met with the prometheus that introduced us to the knowledge of fire and intellectual arts is not this ghastly elsewhere indeed pope skulks away from his own doctrine and talks of correctness as the particular grace for which we were indebted to france but this will not do in his own art of criticism about verse he describes us brave britons as incorrigibly rebellious in that particular we have no correctness it seems nor ever had and therefore except upon sir richard blackmores principle of stealing a suit of clothes from a naked pict it is hard to see how we need to thank france for that which as to us has no existence then again pope acquiesced at other times in an opinion of his early friends that not pompey but himself was the predestined patriarch of correctness walsh who was a sublime old blockhead suggested to pope that correctness was the only tightrope upon which a fresh literary performer in england could henceforth dance with any advantage of novelty all other tightropes and slackropes of every description having been preoccupied by elder funambulists both walsh and pope forgot ever once to ask themselves what it was that they meant by correctness an idea that in its application to france akenside afterwards sternly ridiculed neither of the two literati stopped to consider whether it was correctness in thought or metrical correctness or correctness in syntax and idiom as to all of which by comparison with other poets pope is conspicuously deficient but no matter what they meant or if they meant nothing at all unmeaning or in any case inconsistent as this talk about correctness may be we cannot allow pope so to escape from his own hyperbolical absurdities it was not by a little pruning or weeding that france according to his original proposition had bettered our native literature it was by genial incubation by acts of vital creation she upon our crabtree cudgel of agincourt had engrafted her own peaches and apricots our sterile thorn france had inoculated with roses english literature was the eve that in the shape of a rib had been abstracted from the side of the slumbering pompey of unconscious pompey the huge and all at the small charge of eighteenpence o heavens to think of that by any possibility that the cost the total damage of our english literature should have been eighteenpence that a shilling should actually be coming to us out of halfacrown tantae molis erat romanam condere gentem notes note a similar instance of a craze beyond the bounds of perfect physical sanity may be found in dr arnolds nervous paroxysm of horror on hearing st paul placed on a level with st john the evangelist note and by the way as to servants a great man may offend in two ways either by treating his servants himself superciliously or secondly which is quite reconcilable with the most paternal behavior on his own part by suffering them to treat the public superciliously accordingly all novelists who happen to have no acquaintance with the realities of life as it now exists especially therefore rustic scotch novelists describe the servants of noblemen as insolent and pampered menials but on the contrary at no houses whatever are persons of doubtful appearance and anomalous costume sure of more respectful attention than at those of the great feudal aristocracy at a merchants or a bankers house it is odds but the porter or the footman will govern himself in his behavior by his own private construction of the case which as to foreigners is pretty sure to be wrong but in london at a noblemans door the servants show by the readiness of their civilities to all such questionable comers that they have taken their lessons from a higher source than their own inexperience or unlearned fancies note cape of storms which should primae facie be the cape of terrors but it bears a deep allegoric sense to the bold wrestler with such terrors that in english and at length to all the world this cape of terrors has transfigured itself into the cape of good hope note heraldic solemnities therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare since seldom coming in the long year set like precious stones they thinly placed are or captain jewels in the carcanet shakspeare d sonnet note i give and i bequeath old euclio said and the ridiculous story of the dying epicure insisting upon having his luxurious dish brought back to his deathbed for why not since at any rate eating or not eating he was doomed to die are amongst the lowest rubbish of jestbooks having done duty for the christian and the pagan worlds through a course of eighteen centuries not to linger upon the nursery silliness that could swallow the legend of epicureanism surviving up to the very brink of the grave and when even the hypocrisy of medical hope had ceased to flatter what a cruel memento of the infirmity charged upon himself was pope preparing whilst he intended nothing worse than a falsehood he meant only to tell a lie naturally perhaps saying to himself whats one lie more or less and behold if his friends are to be believed he was unconsciously writing a sort of hieroglyphic epitaph for his own tombstone dr johnsons taste for petty gossip was so keen that i distrust all his anecdotes that pope killed himself by potted lampreys which he had dressed with his own hands i greatly doubt but if anything inclines me to believe it chiefly it is the fury of his invectives against epicures and gluttons what most of all he attacked as a moralist was the particular vice which most of all besieged him note upon this principle i doubt not that we should interpret the sayings attributed to the seven wise men of greece if we regard them as insulated aphorisms they strike us all as mere impertinences for by what right is some one prudential admonition separarately illuminated and left as a solemn legacy to all posterity in slight of others equally cogent for instance meden agan nothing in excess is a maxim not to be neglected but still not entitled to the exclusive homage which is implied in its present acceptation the mistake meantime i believe to be not in the grecian pleiad of sages but in ourselves who have falsely apprehended them the man for instance bias was it or who who left me this old saw about excess did not mean to bias me in favor of that one moral caution this would have argued a craze in favor of one element amongst many what he meant was to indicate the radix out of which his particular system was expanded it was the keynote out of which under the laws of thoroughbass were generated the whole chord and its affinities whilst the whole evolution of the system was in lively remembrance there needed no more than this shorthand memento for recalling it but now when the lapse of time has left the little maxim stranded on a shore of wrecks naturally it happens that what was in old days the keystone of an arch has come to be compounded with its superfluous rubbish note it is no matter of wonder or complaint that a paper written by a correspondent a distance of four hundred miles or something more from the press requiring therefore a diaulos of above eight hundred miles for every letter and its answer a distance which becomes strictly infinite in the case when the correspondent sends no answer at all should exhibit some press errors these having now done their worst i will not vex the reader or the compositor by recalling only with respect to one viz the word genuine which is twice printed for the true word generic i make an exception as it defeats the meaning in a way that may have perplexed a painstaking reader such readers are rare and deserve encouragement the same diaulos which mr de quincey laments is also the cause of his present paper appearing incomplete it will be resumed in the next number ed note the two brilliant poets as regards horace it is scarcely worth while to direct the readers attention upon inconsistency of this imaginary defiance to philosophic authority with his profession elsewhere of allegiance to epicurus for had it even been possible to direct the poets own attention upon it the same spirit of frank simplicity which has converted his very cowardice his unmitigated cowardice relicta non bene parmula into one of those amiable and winning frailties which once having come to know it on no account could we consent to forego would have reconciled us all by some inimitable picturesqueness of candor to inconsistency the most shocking as to the fulfilment of some great moral obligation just as from the brute restiveness of a word equotuticum that positively would not come into the harness of hexameter verse he has extracted a gay laughing alias viz versu quod dicere non est a pleasantry which is nowhere so well paralleled as by southeys on the name of admiral tchichakoff a name which you all must know very well which nobody can speak and nobody can spell vain would it be to fasten any blame upon a poet armed with such heavenborn playfulness that upon a verbal defect he raises a triumph of art and upon a personal defect raises a perpetual memento of smiling and affectionate forgiveness we condone his cowardice to use language of doctors commons many times over before we know whether he would have cared for our condonation and protest our unanimous belief that if he did run away from battle he ran no faster than a gentleman ought to run in fact his character would have wanted its amiable unity had he not been a coward or had he not been a rake vain were it to level reproaches at him for whom all reproaches become only occasions of further and surplus honor but in fact for any serious purposes of horace philosophy was not wanted some slight pretence of that kind served to throw a shade of pensiveness over his convivial revels and thus to rescue them from the taint of plebeian grossness so far and no farther a slight coloring of philosophy was needed for his moral musings but popes case is different the moral breathings of horace are natural exhalations rising spontaneously from the heart under the ordinary gleams of chance and change in the human things that lay around him but pope is more ambitious he is not content with borrowing from philosophy the grace of a passing sanction or countersign but undertakes to lend her a systematic coherency of development and sometimes even a fundamental basis in his essay on man his morals connect themselves with metaphysics the metaphysics had been gathered together in his chance eclectic rambles amongst books of philosophy such as montaigne charron and latterly amongst the fossil rubbish and debris of bayles dictionary much also had been suggested to his piercing intellect in conversation especially with lord bolingbroke but not so exclusively by any means with him as the calumniators of pope would have us suppose adopt he did from all quarters but pope was not the man servilely to beg or to steal it was indispensable to his own comfort that he should at least understand the meaning of what he took from others though seldom indeed he understood its wider relations or pursued its ultimate consequences hence came anguish and horror upon pope in his latter days such as rarely can have visited any but the deathbed of some memorable criminal to have rejected the verba magistri might seem well it might look promising as all real freedom is promising for the interests of truth but he forgot that in rejecting the master he had also rejected the doctrine the guiding principle the unity of direction secured for the inquirer by the masters particular system with its deep internal cohesion coming upon his own distracted choice of principles from opposite angles and lines of direction he found that what once and under one aspect had seemed to him a guiding light and one of the buoys for narrowing the uncertainties of a difficult navigation absolutely under another aspect differently approached and differently associated did the treacherous office of a spanselled horse as in past days upon the cornish and the south irish coast it was employed expressly for showing false signals and leading right amongst breakers that hortus siccus of pet notions which had won popes fancy in their insulated and separate existence when brought together as parts and elements of the same system in the elaborate and haughty essay on man absolutely refused to cohere no doctoring no darning could disguise their essential interrepulsion dismal rents chasms hiatuses gaped and grinned in a theory whose very office and arrogant pretension had been to harmonize the dislocated face of nature and to do that in the way of justification for god which god had forgotten to do for himself how if an enemy should come and fill up these ugly chasms with some poisonous fungus of a nature to spread the dry rot through the main timbers of the vessel and in fact such an enemy did come this enemy spread dismay through popes heart pope found himself suddenly shown up as an antisocial monster as an incendiary as a disorganizer of mans most aspiring hopes o heavens what is to be done what can be done he cried out when i wrote that passage which now seems so wicked certainly i meant something very good or if i didnt at any rate i meant to mean it the case was singular if no friend of the authors could offer a decent account of its meaning to a certainty the author could not luckily however there are two ways of filling up chasms and warburton who had reasons best known to himself for cultivating popes favor besides considerable practice during his youth in a special pleaders office took the desperate case in hand he caulked the chasms with philosophic oakum he payed them with dialectic pitch he sheathed them with copper and brass by means of audacious dogmatism and insolent quibbles until the enemy seemed to have been silenced and the vessel righted so far as to float the result however as a permanent result was this that the demurs which had once been raised however feebly pressed against the poem considered in the light of a system compatible with religion settled upon it permanently as a sullen cloud of suspicion that a century has not availed to dissipate note the most interesting person of the alcibiades class but it is thoroughly characteristic of pope that the one solitary trait in the dukes career which interested him was the fact that a man so familiar with voluptuous splendor should have died on a flockbed patched with straw how advantageously does dryden come forward on this occasion he as mr bayes had some bitter wrongs to avenge and he was left at liberty to execute this revenge after his own heart for he survived the duke by a dozen years yet he took no revenge at all he with natural goodness and magnanimity declined to kick the dead lion and in the memorable lines all alive and trembling with impassioned insight into the demoniac versatility of the dukes character how generously does he forbear every expression of scorn and cover the mans frailties with a mantle of comprehensive apology and in fact the true apology by gathering them together one and all as the united results of some secret nympholepsy or some sacred pythian inspiration blest madman that could every hour employ in something new to wish or to enjoy now all for rhyming wenching fiddling drinking beside ten thousand freaks that died in thinking strangely enough the only duke of buckingham that interested pope was not the villiers that so profoundly interested dryden and his own generation but in every sense a mock duke of buckingham a pantomimic duke that is known only for having built a palace as fine as gilt gingerbread and for having built a pauper poem some time after the death of the villiers duke and the consequent extinction of the title sheffield lord mulgrave obtained a patent creating him not duke of buckingham but by a pawnbrokers dodge devised between himself and his attorney duke of buckinghamshire the ostensible reason for which as alleged by himself was that he apprehended some lurking claim to the old title that might come forward to his own confusion at a future time and in that case he was ready with this demur you mistake i am not ham but hamshire such was his account of the matter mine is different i tell the reason thus he had known the villiers of old he knew well how that lubricated gladiator had defied all the powers of chancery and the privy council for months after months once to get a grip of him or a hawk over him it was the old familiar case of trying to catch a pig but in this instance a wild boar of the forest whose tail has been soaped see lord clarendon not his history but his life what the birmingham duke therefore really feared was that the worst room the tawdry curtains the flockbed c were all a pyramid of lies that the villiers had not been thrown had probably not died at all but was only trying it on in readiness for a great demonstration against himself and that in case the title of buckingham were ever finally given away the villiers would be heard clattering on horseback up the grand staircase of the newbuilt buckingham house like the marble statue in don juan with a double commission against the false duke and the government as jointtraders in stolen goods but if pope were callous to the splendor of the true buckingham what was it that drew him to the false one pope must have been well aware that amongst all the poetic triflers of the day there was not one more ripe for the dunciad like the jaws of the hungry grave acherontis avari the dunciad yawned for him whilst yet only in dim conception as a remote possibility he was besides the most vainglorious of men and being anxious above all things to connect himself with the blood royal he had conceived the presumptuous thought of wooing queen anne then the unmarried princess anne being rejected of course rather than have no connection at all with royalty he transferred his courtship to a young lady born on the wrong side of the blanket namely the daughter of james ii by miss sedley her he married and they reigned together in great pomp over buckingham house but how should this have attracted pope the fact i fear is that pope admired him in spite of his verses as a man rich and prosperous one morning in some of his own verses he lodged a compliment to the duke as a poet and a critic immediately the duke was down upon him with an answering salute of twentyone guns and ever afterwards they were friends but i repeat that in popes own judgment nine out of ten who found their way into that great menagerie of the dunciad had not by half so well established their right of entrance as the duke note even this is open to demur the roman literature during the main punic war with hannibal though unavoidably reached by some slight influence from the literature of greece was rich in native power and raciness left to itself and less disturbed by direct imitation applied to foreign models the roman literature would probably have taken a wider compass and fulfilled a nobler destiny note joan of arcs execution viz not by any english but virtually by a french tribunal as now at last is satisfactorily established by the recent publication at paris of the judicial process itself in its full official records note the notes are now i e in all modern editions assigned to their separate authors though not always in a way to prevent doubts for instance roscoes notes except that they are always distinguished by kindness and good sense are indicated only by the absence of any distinguishing signature but in the early editions great carelessness prevailed as to this point and sometimes intentional dissimulation note which was probably not of french origin thomasakempis gerson and others have had the credit of it but the point is still doubtful when i say that it was extensively diffused naturally i mean so far as it was possible before the invention of printing one generation after agincourt this invention was beginning to move after which that is in two generations the multiplication of copies and even of separate editions and separate translations ran beyond all power of registration it is one amongst the wonders of the world and the reason i have formerly explained froissart belongs to the courts of england and of burgundy much more than to that of france note hardi it is scarcely necessary to mention as he never became a power even in france and out of france was quite unknown he coincided in point of time i believe most nearly with francis beaumont note italian spanish and finally german poetry have in succession exercised some slight influence more or less over our english poetry but i have formerly endeavored to show that it is something worse than a mere historical blunder that in fact it involves a gross misconception and a confusion in the understanding to suppose that there ever has been what has been called a french school in our literature unless it is supposed that the unimpassioned understanding or the understanding speaking in a minor key of passion is a french invention
