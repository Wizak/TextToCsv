ends as it began the book miranda of the balcony chapter i in which a shortsighted taxidermist from tangier makes a discovery upon rosevear the discovery made a great stir amongst the islands and particularly at st marys in the square space before the customs house on the little stone jetty among the paths through the gorse of the garrison it became the staple subject of gossip until another ship came ashore and other lives were lost for quite apart from its odd circumstances a certain mystery lent importance to ralph warriner it transpired that nearly two years before when on service at gibraltar captain warriner of the artillery had slipped out of harbour one dark night in his yacht and had straightway disappeared it was proved that subsequently he had been dismissed from the service and the coroner of st marys in a moment of indiscretion let slip the information that the home office had requested him to furnish it with a detailed history of the facts the facts occurred in this sequence at seven oclock of a morning in the last week of july the st agnes lugger which carries the relief men to and fro between the trinity house barracks upon st marys and the bishop lighthouse in the atlantic ran alongside of st marys pier there were waiting upon the steps the two lighthouse men and a third a small rotund belgian of a dark shiny countenance which seemed always on the point of perspiring he was swathed in a borrowed suit of oilskins much too large for him and would have cut a comical figure had he not on that raw morning looked supremely unhappy and pathetic m claude fournier was a taxidermist by profession and resided at tangier he was never backward in declaring that the evidences of his skill decorated many entrancehalls throughout europe and some three weeks before he had come holidaymaking alone to the islands of scilly he now stood upon the steps of the pier nervously polishing his glasses as the lugger swung upwards and downwards on the swell he watched the relief men choose their time and spring on board and just as zebedee isaacs the master of the boat was about to push off with his boathook he nerved himself to speak i go with you to the bishop is it not isaacs looked up in surprise he had been wondering what had brought the little man out in this dress and on this morning therell be a headwind all the way he said discouragingly and wi that and a heavy ground sea well be brave an wet before we reach the bishop brave an wet i do not mind replied m fournier for the sea i am dvot but his voice was tremulous and belied him isaacs shook his head its not only the sea look and he stretched out his arm a variable fog rolled and tumbled upon a tumbling wilderness of sea ild sooner have two gales lashed together than sail amongst these islands in a fog ild never go today at all but the boats moren three weeks overdue indeed as m fournier looked seawards there was no glimpse of land visible a fortnight of heavy weather had been followed by a week of fog which enveloped the islands like a drenched blanket only today had it shown any signs of breaking and the st agnes lugger was the first boat so far as was known to run the hazard of the sea it is true that two days before one man had run in to the bar of tregarthens hotel and told how he had stood upon the top of the garrison and had looked suddenly down a lane between two perpendicular walls of mist and had seen the water breaking white upon great smith rock and in the near distance an open boat under a mizzen and a jib beating out through the heavy swell towards the west but his story was in no wise believed to all of isaacss objections m fournier was impervious and he was at last allowed to embark now cried zebedee isaacs as the lugger rose m fournier gave a pathetic look backwards to the land shut his eyes and jumped isaacs caught and set him upon the floor of the boat where he stood clutching the runners he saw the landingsteps dizzily rush past him up to the sky like a jacobs ladder and then as dizzily shut downwards below him like a telescope the boat was pushed off it rounded the pierhead and beat out on its first tack across the road m fournier crouched down under the shelter of the weather bulwark as for the sea i am dvot he murmured with a watery smile in a little the boat was put about from sour milk ledge it was sailed on the port tack towards great minalto and felt the wind and felt the sea it climbed up waves till the red lugsail swung over m fourniers head like a canopy and on the downward slope the heavy bows took the water with a thud m fournier knelt up and clung to the stays at all costs he must see he stared into the shifting fog at the rollers which came hopping and leaping towards him and he was very silent and very still as though the fascination of terror enchained him on the third tack however he began to resume his courage he even smiled over his shoulder towards zebedee isaacs at the tiller as for the sea he began to say i am but the statement which he was not to verify on this day ended in a shriek for at that moment a great green wave hopped exultingly over the bows and thenceforward all the way to the bishop the lugger shipped much water m fourniers behaviour became deplorable as isaacs bluntly and angrily summarised it he lay upon the thwarts and screeched like a rook and in his appeals to his mother he was quite conventionally french he made no attempt to land upon the lighthouse the relief men were hoisted up in the sling the headkeeper and one of his assistants were lowered and the lugger started upon its homeward run before the wind the fog thickened and lightened about them as they threaded the intricate channels of the western islands now it was a thin grey mist parting here and there in long corridors driven this way and that twirling in spires of smoke shepherded by the winds now again it hung close about them an impenetrable umber while the crew in short quick tones and gestures of the arms mapped out the rocks and passages about them they could hear the roar of the breaking waves and the rush of water up slabs and over ledges and then the glumph glumph as the wave sucked away at times too the fog lifted from the surface and hung very low massed above their heads so that the black hillocks of the islets stood out in the sinister light like headstones of a cemetery of the sea and at the feet of them the water was white like a flash of hungry teeth it was at one such moment when the boat had just passed through crebawethan neck that m fournier who had been staring persistently over the starboard bulwark suddenly startled the crew theres a ship on shore tenez look he cried there there and as he spoke the mist drove between his eyes and what he declared that he saw zebedee isaacs looked in the direction on jackys rock he asked nodding towards a menacing column of black rock which was faintly visible no no beyond there and m fournier excitedly gesticulated he seemed at that moment to have lost all his terror of the sea on rosevear then said the keeper of the lighthouse and he strained towards rosevear i see nothing he said and theres nothing to see replied isaacs who did not alter his course but its true exclaimed the little belgian i see it no more myself but i have seen it i tell you i have seen the mast above the island you interrupted isaacs with a blunt contempt you are blind and m fournier before anyone could guess his intention flung himself upon isaacs and jammed the tiller hard over to port the boat came broadside to the wind heeled over and in a second the water was pouring in over the gunwale zebedee wrenched the main sheet off the pin and let the big sail fly another loosed the jib the promptitude of these two men saved the boat it ran its head up into the wind righted itself upon its keel and lay with flapping sails and shivered isaacs without a word caught hold of m fournier and shook him like a rat and every man of the crew in violent tones expounded to the belgian the enormity of his crime fournier was himself wellnigh frantic with excitement he was undaunted by any threats of violence neither the boat nor the sea nor the crew had any terrors for him there is a ship he screamed the fog was vanished just for a second it was vanished and i have seen it there may be men alive on that rock starving perishing men of the sea like you you will not leave them but you shall not and clinging to the mast he stamped his feet but you shall not and by the lord hes right said the lighthousekeeper gravely so gravely that complete silence at once fell upon the crew one man stood up in the bows a second knelt upon the thwarts a third craned his body out beyond the stern and all with one accord stared towards rosevear the screen of haze was drawn aside and quite clear to the view over a low rock rose the mast and tangled cordage of a wreck the sheets were made fast without a word without a word zebedee isaacs put the boat about and steered it into the neck between rosevear and rosevean as they passed along that narrow channel no noise was heard but the bustle of the tide for at the western end they saw the bows of a ship unsteadily poised upon a ledge there was a breach amidships the stern was under water only the foremast stood and nowhere was there any sign of life isaacs brought the boat to in a tiny creek some distance from the wreck we can land here he said and the lighthousekeeper and fournier stepped ashore on the instant that quiet silent islet whirred into life and noise so startling was the change that m fournier jumped backwards while his heart jerked within him whats that he cried and then laughed as he understood for a cloud of puffins gulls kittiwakes and shearwaters whirled upwards from that nursery of seabirds and circled above his head their cries sounding with infinite melancholy their wings flickering like silver in that grey and desolate light its so like your robinson crusoe said m fournier it is more like our islands of scilly said the lighthousekeeper as he looked towards the wreck they climbed over the low rocks and walked along the crown of the island towards the wreck there was no tree or shrub upon the barren soil only here a stretch of sandy grass there a patch of mallows mallows of a rusty green and whitened with salt of the sea in the midst of one such patch they came upon the body of a man he was dressed in a pilot coat sea boots and thick stockings drawn over his trousers to the hips and he lay face downwards with his head resting upon his arms in a natural posture of sleep fournier stood still the lighthousekeeper walked forward and tapped the sleeper upon the shoulder but the sleeper did not wake the lighthouse man knelt down and gently turned the man over upon his back as he did so or rather just before he did so fournier turned sharply away with a shudder when the sailor was lying upon his back the keeper of the lighthouse started with something of a shudder too for the sailor had no face the lighthouse man drew his handkerchief from his pocket and gently covered the head it seemed almost as if fournier had been waiting had been watching for this action for he turned about immediately and stood by the lighthousekeepers side above the lonely islet the seabirds circled and called on the sea the mist was now no more than a gauze and through it the glow of the sun was faintly diffused strange that isnt it said the lighthousekeeper in a hushed voice the sea dashed him upon the rocks and drew him down again and threw him up again until it got tired of the sport and so tossed him here to lie quietly face downwards amongst the mallows like a man asleep then he sat back upon his heels and measured the distance between the mallows and the sea with some perplexity upon his forehead and the perplexity grew its a long way for the sea to have thrown him he said and as fournier shifted restlessly at his side he looked up into his face good god man but you look white he said the sight is terrible replied fournier as he wiped his forehead the lighthousekeeper nodded assent yes its a terrible place the sea about these western islands he said did you ever hear tell that there are sunken cities all the way between here and lands end the sunken cities of lyonnesse terrible sights those cities must see i often think of the many ships which have plunged down among their chimneys and rooftops perhaps here a great spanish galleon with its keel along the middle of a paved square and its poop overhanging the gables and the fishes swimming in and out of the cabins through the broken windows perhaps there a big threedecker like sir cloudesley shovels showing the muzzles of her silent guns or a little steamtramp of our own times its iron sides brown with rust and god knows what tragedy hidden in its tiny engineroom a terrible place these islands of scilly dwelling amongst the seas as the old books say dwelling amongst the seas he bent forward and unfastened the dead sailors pilot jacket then he felt in his pocket and drew out an oilskin case this he opened and fournier knelt beside him there were a few letters in the case which the two men read through they were of no particular importance beyond that they were headed yacht the ten brothers and they were signed ralph warriner all of them except one this one was a loveletter of a date six years back it was addressed to ralph and was signed miranda six years old said the lighthousekeeper for six years he has carried that about with him and now it will be read out in court to make a sorry fun for people whom he never knew thats hard on him eh but harder on the woman at the words spoken in a low voice m fournier moved uneasily and seemed to wince the lighthousekeeper held the letter in his hands and thoughtfully turned over its pages i have a mind to tear it up but i suppose i must not he returned the papers to the oilskin case and going back to the boat called for two of the crew to carry the body down meanwhile said he to fournier we might have a look at the ten brothers they could not approach the bows of the ship but overlooked them from a pinnacle of rock there was however little to be remarked she is an old boat and she has seen some weather from the look of her said the lighthousekeeper that indeed was only to be expected for the ten brothers had been a trader before ralph warriner bought her and two years had elapsed between the night when he slipped from gibraltar harbour and the day when this boat came to its last moorings upon rosevear the mist cleared altogether towards sunset the sun shone out from the edge of the horizon a ball of red fire and the lugger ferried the dead body back to st marys over a sea which had the colour of claret and through foam ripples which sparkled like gold the miranda who wrote the loveletter was miranda warriner ralph warriners wife miranda bedlow she had been at the date which headed the letter she was living now at ronda in the andalusian hills a hundred miles from algeciras and gibraltar and had lived there since her husbands disappearance to ronda the oilskin case was sent she heard the news of her ralphs death with a natural sense of solemnity but she was too sincere a woman to assume a grief which she could not feel for her married life had been one of extraordinary unhappiness chapter ii presents the hero in the unheroic attitude of a spectator it was lady donnisthorpe who two years later introduced luke charnock to mrs warriner lady donnisthorpe was an outspoken woman with an untameable passion for matchmaking which she indulged with the ardour and indeed the results of an amateur chemist her life was spent in mingling incompatible elements and producing explosions to which her enthusiasm kept her deaf even when they made a quite astonishing noise for no experience of reverses could stale her satisfaction when she beheld an eligible bachelor or maid walk for the first time into her parlour she had made charnocks acquaintance originally in barbados he sat next her at a dinner given by the governor of the island and took her fancy with the pleasing inconsistency of a boyish appearance and a wealth of experiences he was a man of a sunburnt aquiline face which was lean but not haggard grey and very steady eyes and a lithe tall figure and though he conveyed an impression of activity he was still a restful companion lady donnisthorpe remarked in him a modern appreciation of the poetry of machinery and after dinner made inquiries of the governor he is on his way homewards from peru answered the latter he has been surveying for a railway line there during the last two years what do you think of him i want to know what you think i like him he is modest without diffidence successful without notoriety what are his people asked lady donnisthorpe i dont believe he has any but i believe his father was a clergyman in yorkshire it would sound improper for a girl without visible relations to say that she was the daughter of a clergyman in yorkshire wouldnt it said her ladyship reflectively but i suppose its no objection in a man and in her memories she made a mark against charnocks name she heard of him again once or twice in unexpected quarters from the lips of the men who from east to west are responsible for the work that is done and once or twice she met him for she was a determined traveller finally at cairo she sat next to sir john martin the head partner of a great leeds firm of railway contractors did you ever come across a mr charnock she asked the head partner laughed i did i knew his father its a strange thing about mr charnock said she but one never hears anything of what he was doing before the last few years why not ask him said the northcountryman bluntly it might sound inquisitive replied lady donnisthorpe and perhaps theres no need to if you know yes i know returned sir john with a great deal of provoking amusement and believe me lady donnisthorpe its not at all to his discredit lady donnisthorpe began thereafter to select and reject possible wives for charnock and while still undecided she chanced to pass one december through nice the first person whom she saw in the vestibule of the hotel was luke charnock what in the world are you doing here she asked taking a weeks holiday lady donnisthorpe i have been in spain for the last two years and shall be for the next nine months in spain i am making a new line between cadiz and algeciras god bless the man and i never thought of it exclaimed lady donnisthorpe i think you will do she added looking him over and nodding her head i hope so replied charnock cheerfully its a big lift for me in a way no doubt agreed her ladyship though mind you the land isnt what it was the railway will improve it said charnock they happened to be talking of different subjects lady donnisthorpe pursued her own then you wont be in england for a year she said regretfully the company building the line is an english one replied charnock i shall have to see the directors in june i shall be in london then then you must come and see me write before you leave spain promise said lady donnisthorpe who was now elated charnock promised and that day lady donnisthorpe wrote to her cousin miranda warriner at ronda who was now at the end of the first year of her widowhood and of the third year of her ridiculous seclusion at that little hilltown of spain miranda was entreated implored and commanded to come to london in may there was the season there was mirandas estate in suffolk which needed her attention miranda reluctantly consented and so lady donnisthorpe was the instrument by which charnock and mrs warriner became acquainted but the foundations of that acquaintanceship were laid without her ladyships agency and indeed without the knowledge of either charnock or miranda a trifling defect in the machinery of a p and o boat began it the p and o stayed for four days at aden to make repairs and so charnock had four days to wait at gibraltar before he could embark for england he did not however spend more than two of those four days at gibraltar but picking up a yellow handbill in the lounge of the hotel he obeyed its advice and crossing the sunlit straits early the next morning saw the jealous hills about tangier unfold and that cardboard city glitter down to the sea he was rowed ashore to the usual accompaniment of shouts and yells by a villainous boats crew of arabs a mob of barbary jews screamed at him on the landingstage and then a moorish boy with a brown roguish face who was dressed in a saffron jellabia pushed his way forwards and in a conversational voice said you english god damn you give me a penny charnock hired that boy and under his guidance sauntered through tangier where the east and the west rub shoulders where the camel snarls in the sk with an electric arclamp for a nightlight and all the races and all the centuries jostle together in many colours down the cobbles of its narrow streets charnock was shown the incidentals of the tangier variety entertainment the basha administering more or less justice for less or more money at his palace gate the wooden peephole of the prison where the prisoners hands come through and clutch for alms a dancingroom where a moorish woman closely veiled leaned her back against a tottenham court road chest of drawers under a portrait of mrs langtry and beat upon a drum while another stamped an ungainly dance by the light of a paraffin lamp and coming out again into the sunlight charnock cried out hamet take me somewhere where its clean and theres no din and there are no smells hamet led the way up the hills and every now and then as he passed a man better dressed than his fellows he would say in a voice of awe thats a rich he invariably added hes a juice look here hamet said charnock at length cant you show me a rich who isnt a jew these are the loryers observed hamet after the fashion of the march hare when posed with an inconvenient question he pointed to a number of venerable gentlemen in black robes who sat in wooden hutches open to the street i will show you he continued a moor who was the richest man in all tangier the pair walked up out of the town towards the mazan and came to a lane shadowed by cedars and bordered with prickly pears here the resounding din of the streets below was subdued to a murmurous confusion of voices from which occasionally a sharp cry would spirt up clear into the air like a jet of water only one voice was definite and incessant and that voice came down to them from the trees higher up the lane a voice very thin but on that hot still afternoon very distinct a voice which perpetually quavered and bleated one monotonous invocation hassan akbar said hamet the invocation became articulate as they ascended allah beh the voice cried and again allah beh and again until the windless air seemed to vibrate with its recurrence they came upon the moor who uttered this cry at the gate of the moorish cemetery a white stubbly beard grew upon his chin and lips but his strength was not diminished by his years and with every movement of his body the muscles beneath the tough skin of his bare legs worked like live things he sat crosslegged in the dust with a filthy sack for his only garment he was blind and his eyes stared from their red sockets covered with a bluish film as though the colours of the eyeballs had run allah beh he cried swaying his body backwards and forwards with the regularity of an automaton and an inimitable quickness he paid no heed whatever to charnock and the boy as they halted beside him allah beh he cried and his chest touched the cradle of his knees he marked the seconds with the pendulum of his body he struck them with his strident invocation he was the richest man in tangier said hamet and he told hassan akbars story as though it was an affair of every day hassan had not secured the protection of any of the european legations he had hoped to hide his wealth by living poorly and though he owned a house worth three thousand dollars in tangier he did not dwell in it but no concealments had availed him someone of his familiars had told and no doubt had made his profit from the telling the basha had waited his opportunity it came when blindness left hassan defenceless then the basha laid hands upon him forced him to give up the gains of a lifetimes trade and so cast him out penniless to beg for copper flouss at the gate of the cemetery and europes no more than seven miles away cried charnock even where he stood he could see the laughing water of the straits and beyond that the summit of gibraltar who was it that told he asked that is not known charnock dropped some money into the blind mans lap but hassan did not cease from his prayer to thank him he is very strong said hamet who saw nothing strange in the story he had told he swings like this all day from seven in the morning to five at night he never stops and at that moment upon the heels of hamets words as though intentionally to belie them hassan akbar suddenly arrested the motion of his body and suddenly ceased from his pitiable cry his silence and immobility came with so much abruptness that charnock was fairly startled then hamet held up a finger and they both listened maybe the blind man was listening too but charnock could not be certain his face was as blind as his eyes and there was no expression in the rigid attitude of his body charnock heard a faint sound higher up the lane the sound became louder and defined itself it was the slapslap of a pair of moorish slippers charnock drew hamet back by the trunk of a tree which sheltered them both from the view of anyone who came down the hill he left the lane free and into the open space there came a man who wore the dress of a moor of wealth serwal chamir farajia and haik spotless and complete in figure he was slight and perhaps a trifle under the middle height and the haik was drawn close over his forehead to shield him from the sun hassan was seated in the dust with the sun beating full upon his head in front of him the newcomer stopped peace be with you he said as charnock who had some knowledge of arabic understood but the beggar made no answer nor gave any sign that he heard he sat motionless impassive a secret figure of stone the newcomer laughed lightly to himself and the laughter within view of the rags and misery of the once rich man sounded unpleasant and callous hamet shifted a foot at charnocks side and charnock whose interest in this picturesque encounter was steadily growing pressed a hand upon the boys shoulder to restrain him the stranger however had noticed neither of the two spectators he was still laughing softly to himself as he watched the beggar and in a little he began to hum between his teeth a tune a queer elusive tune of a sweet but rather mournful melody and it seemed to charnock by some indefinable hint of movement that hassan akbar was straining his ears to catch and register that tune the stranger advanced to hassan and dropped a coin in his lap the coin was not copper for it sparkled in the air as it fell then with another easy laugh he turned to go down into tangier but as he turned he saw charnock watching him on the instant his hand went to his hood and drew it close about his cheeks but not before charnock had seen a scared face flashed at him for a moment and immediately withdrawn the moor went down the lane perhaps it was he who told said charnock hamet disagreed he would not know his beard was fair so he comes from fez charnock too had remarked that the man was fairhaired but nevertheless this encounter of the rich moor and the beggar remained in his thoughts and he allowed his imagination lazily to fix a picture of it in his mind thus occupied he walked through the cemetery taking in that way a short cut to the sk but he was not halfway across the cemetery when he turned sharply towards hamet do you remember the tune the moor hummed charnocks ear was slow to retain the memory of music hamet however promptly whistled the melody from beginning to end while charnock stood and took count of it i shall have forgotten it tomorrow said hamet i think now that i shall recollect it tomorrow said charnock and he walked on but in a moment or two he stopped again as though some new perplexity was present to his mind hamet he said before the moor appeared at all while his footsteps were still faint certainly before he spoke hassan akbar stopped his prayer which you say he never stops he knew then who was coming at all events he suspected how did he know how did he suspect there is the sk replied hamet they had passed round the bend of the hill up which the cemetery slopes and were come within view of the marketplace charnock was puzzled by his unanswered question and the question was forced to his notice again that afternoon and with yet greater force it was marketday charnock beheld stretched out beneath him a great field or rather a great plain for the grass was long since trampled into mud which curved down to the yellow sunbaked wall of the city and whereon an innumerable throng negroes from timbuctoo arabs jews and moors in all manner of raiment from rags to coloured robes jostled and seethed bawled and sweated under a hot sun and in a brilliant air here an old hag screamed aloud the virtues of her merchandise a few skinny onions and vegetables there two men forced a passage with blows of their sticks and behind them a stately train of camels brought in from the uplands their loads of dates a riffian sauntered by with an indifferent air his silvermounted gun upon his back a pair of pistols in his belt and a great coarse tail of hair swinging between his shoulders he needed no couriers to prepare his way at one spot a serpentcharmer thrust out his tongue from which a snake was hanging by the fangs at another a storyteller vivid in narration and of an extraordinary aptness in his gestures held an audience enchained from every side the din of human voices rose into the air and to the din was added the snarling of camels the braying of donkeys the bleating of sheep the lowing of oxen and all manner of squeals and grunts so that it seemed the whole brute creation had combined to make one discordant orchestra into this babel charnock descended those are the shoemakers said hamet he pointed to a cluster of tiny grimed gunnybag tents in a corner of the highest part of the sk in the doorways of the tents a few men sat cobbling one or two wood fires crackled in the intervals between the tents and in close proximity a dead mule took its last unsavoury sleep hassan akbar sleeps in the mud near to the tents continued hamet every evening he comes down to the sk buys milk and bread from the shoemakers and sleeps near to that mule interrupted charnock and he was the richest man in all tangier a moment later there was shown to him the second picture which he was to carry away from tangier down the sk through the crowd came the moor in his spotless robes and a few yards behind him striding swiftly and noiselessly the blind gaunt beggar of the cemetery gate followed upon his trail in and out amongst the shifting groups he threaded and wound and never erred in his pursuit the man in whose track he kept never spoke when all were shouting yet hassan never faltered the sound of his footsteps was lost in a multitude of the like sounds yet hassan was somehow sensible of it somehow to his ears it emerged distinct charnock was amazed in a way too he was chilled it seemed uncanny that this sightless creature of the impassive face should be able to follow follow follow relentlessly unswervingly one silent man amongst the noisy hundreds charnock walked for a few yards by hassan akbars side keeping pace with him even with his eyes fixed upon the moor in front even though he saw his feet tread the ground he could not distinguish his footfalls how then could hassan tracker and tracked passed from the sk under the archway of the gate and charnock dismissing hamet walked down towards his hotel near the waterside however he missed his road he turned through the horse market descended the steep street past the great mosque and walked along a narrow crooked alley between blank and yellow walls which ended in a tunnel beneath overarching houses almost within the mouth of this tunnel there was a shop or so it seemed for a stuffed jackal swung above the door as a sign before this shop charnock halted with a thrill of excitement the door of the shop was shut the unglazed window was shuttered it was not on that account that charnock stopped but underneath the shuttered window his head almost touching the sill hassan squatted on the cobbles fingering now and then a silver dollar inside the door a bolt grated the door opened and a stout undersized european appeared in the entrance polished a pair of glasses set them upon his nose glanced up and down the street closed the door behind him and taking no heed whatever of the blind man under his window walked briskly into the tunnel he walked with a short tripping and jaunty step charnock waited while the echo of it diminished and ceased and the moment it had ceased he saw hassan without any hurry without any sign of expectation or excitement rise slowly to his feet and move along the house wall towards the door his right elbow scraped the plaster then his elbow touched nothing he had come to the recess of the door and he stopped it flashed upon charnock that he had not heard the bolt again grate into its socket the door was then only latched and was hassans quarry behind its panels the affair had ceased to be a toy with which charnocks imagination could idly play he strode across the alley and planted himself face to face with hassan hassan quietly and immediately murmured a request for alms and stretched out his left hand a supple corded hand with long sinuous fingers a hand of great strength but as he spoke he drew within the recess of the door and charnock noticed his right hand steal up the panels feeling for the latch made by this seemingly passionless and apathetic man the secret movement shocked charnock it seemed to him at that moment so coldblooded as to be almost inhuman look out he shouted through the door and in broad english forgetting that the man for whom his warning was intended was a moor but the warning had its effect there was a heavy blow upon the door as though a mans shoulder lurched against it and then the bolt grated into the socket hassan akbar walked on repeating his prayer for alms as if his hand had never for an instant stolen up the panel and felt for the latch charnock to make his warning the more complete rapped on the door for admission once twice thrice but he got no answer he leaned his ear to the panel he could detect not so much as a foot stirring absolute silence reigned in that dark and shuttered room charnock walked back to his hotel on the way he passed the end of the pier where he saw the little frenchman bargaining with the owner of a felucca his excitement gradually died down it occurred to him that there might have been no grounds at all for any excitement hassan akbar might have been following through the sk by mere accident he might have tried the door in pursuit of nothing more than alms and in a little the whole incident ceased to trouble his speculations he crossed the straits to gibraltar the next morning and waited there for two days until the p and o came in it was on the p and o that he first fell in with major wilbraham chapter iii treats of a gentleman with an agreeable countenance and of a womans face in a mirror major ambrose wilbraham had embarked at marseilles and before the boat reached gibraltar he had made the acquaintance of everyone on board and had managed to exchange cards with a good many the steamer was still within sight of gibraltar when he introduced himself to charnock with a manner of effusive jocularity to which charnock did not respond the major was tall and about forty years of age a thin crop of black hair was plastered upon his head he wore a moustache which was turning grey his eyebrows were so faultlessly regular that they seemed to have been stencilled on his forehead and underneath them a pair of cold beady eyes counterfeited friendliness charnock could not call to mind that he had ever met a man on whom geniality sat with so ill a grace or one whose acquaintance he less desired to improve major wilbraham however was not easily rebuffed and he walked the deck by charnocks side talkative and unabashed off the coast of portugal the boat made bad weather and she laboured through the crossseas of the bay under a strong southwesterly wind off ushant she picked up a brigantine which charnock watched from the hurricane deck without premonition and indeed without more than a passing curiosity fine lines eh charnock old fellow said a voice at his elbow the brigantine dipped her head into a roller lifted it and shook the water off her decks in a cascade of snow i have seen none finer answered charnock except on a racingyacht or a destroyer shes almost familiar to me speculated the major she reminds me of some boats i saw once at the west indies returned charnock built for the fruittrade and so built for speed only they were schooners from salcombe i believe the salcombe clippers they were called indeed said the major with a sharp interest and he leaned forward over the rail now i wonder what her name is charnock held a pair of binoculars in his hand he gave them to the major wilbraham raised them to his eyes while the p and o closed upon the sailingboat the brigantine slid down the slope of a wave and hoisted her stern the tarifa said the major and he shut up the binoculars what is her tonnage do you think about three hundred i should say my notion precisely would it be of any advantage to alter her rig supposing that she was one of the salcombe schooners i should hardly think so replied charnock i rather understood that the schooners were noted boats ah thats interesting said wilbraham and he returned the binoculars the steamer was now abreast of the brigantine and in a little it drew ahead by the way charnock i shall hope to see more of you resumed major wilbraham i havent given you a card have i he produced a wellworn cardcase its very kind of you said charnock as he twirled the card between his forefinger and his thumb dont you he added find cards rather a heavy item in your expenses major wilbraham laughed noisily i take you dear friend he exclaimed i take you but a friend in this world sir is a golden thread in a very dusty cobweb but the friendship is rather a onesided arrangement rejoined charnock for instance the cards you give major wilbraham bear no address the cards you receive do and while showing the card to his companion he inadvertently dropped it into the sea major wilbraham blamed the negligence of a rascally printer and made his way to the smokingroom the p and o boat touched at plymouth the next morning and landed both major wilbraham and charnock the latter remained in plymouth for two days and on the morning of the third day hired a hansom cab and so met with the last of those incidents which were to link him in such close strange ties with the fortunes of men and women who even in name were then utterly unknown to him a yellow handbill had led charnock across the straits to tangier and now it was nothing more serious than a draft upon lloyds bank which took him in a hansom cab through the streets of plymouth spring was in the air charnock felt exceedingly lighthearted and cheerful on the way he unconsciously worked his little finger into the eye of the brass bracket which juts inwards on each side of the front window at the level of the shoulder and when the cab stopped in front of the bank he discovered that his finger was securely jammed across the road he noticed a chemists shop and descending the steps of the bank a fairhaired gentleman of an agreeable countenance who quite appropriately in that town of sailors had something of a nautical aspect sir began charnock politely as he leaned out of the window i shall be much obliged to charnocks surprise the goodnatured gentleman precipitately sprang down the steps and began to walk rapidly away charnock was sufficiently human and therefore sufficiently perverse to become at once convinced that although there were others passing this reluctant man was the only person in the world who could and must help him from his predicament so he leaned yet farther out of the cab hi you sir he shouted you who are running away the words had an electrical effect the man of the agreeable countenance stopped suddenly and so stood with his back towards charnock while gently and thoughtfully he nodded his head it seemed to charnock that he might perhaps be counting over the voices with which he was familiar well cried charnock who was becoming exasperated my dear sir am i to wait for you all day the street was populous with the morning traffic of a business quarter curious people stopped and attracted others in a very few moments a small crowd would have formed the stranger thereupon came slowly back to the hansom showing a face which was no longer agreeable he set a foot upon the step of the cab and fixed a blue and watchful eye upon charnock i am afraid said the latter with severity that my first impression of you was wrong an indescribable relief was expressed by the other but he spoke with surliness you mistook me for someone else i mistook your disposition for something else charnock affably corrected i expected to find you a person of great goodnature you hardly made such a point of summoning a perfect stranger and here the blue eyes became very wary for no other reason than to tell him that certainly not returned charnock i would not trespass upon your time which seems to be extremely valuable without a better reason but my finger is fixed as you can see in this brass ring and i cannot withdraw it so if you would kindly cross over to the chemist and buy me a pennyworth of vaseline i shall be more than obliged and with the hand which was free he felt in his pocket for a penny and held it out a look of utter incredulity showed upon the listeners face do you mean to tell me he blurted out that i ask you to be my good samaritan yes the strangers face became suddenly vindictive vaseline he cried a pennyworth said charnock again offering the penny the man of the agreeable countenance struck charnocks hand violently aside and the penny flew into a gutter he stood up on the step and thrust his face which was now inflamed with fury into the cab i tell you what he cried you are a fair redhotter you are buy you vaseline i hope your finger will petrify i hope youll just sit in that cab and rot away in your boots until you have to ante up in kingdom come he added expletives to his anathema really said charnock if i was a lady i dont think that i should like to listen to you any longer but before charnock had finished the sentence the good samaritan who was no samaritan at all had flung himself from the cab and was striding up the street after all thought charnock i might just as well have driven across to the chemist if i had only thought of it this he now did got his finger free cashed his draft and took the train to london during this journey the discourteous stranger occupied some part of his thoughts between charnocks eyes and the newspaper against the red cliffs of teignmouth on the green of the home counties his face obtruded and for a particular reason the marks of fear are unmistakable the man whom he had called had been scared by the call nor had his fear quite left him when he had come face to face with charnock set features which strove to conceal and a brightness of the eye which betrayed emotion these things charnock remembered very clearly in london he dined alone at his hotel and over against him the strangers face bore him company he went out afterwards into the street and amidst the myriad ringing feet was seized with an utter sense of loneliness more poignant more complete than he had ever experienced in the waste places of the world the lights of a theatre attracted him he paid his money took a seat in the stalls and was at once very worried and perplexed he turned to his neighbour who was boisterously laughing would you mind telling me what this play is he asked oh its a musical comedy i see but what is it about charnocks neighbour scratched his head thoughtfully i ought to remember he said for i saw the piece early in the run charnock went out crossed a street and came to another theatre where he saw a good half of the tragedy of macbeth thence he returned to his hotel and went to bed the hotel was one of many balconies situated upon the embankment from the single window or his bedroom charnock looked across the river to where the name of a brewery perpetually wrote itself in red brilliant letters which perpetually vanished it was his habit to sleep not merely with his window open but with the blinds drawn up and the curtains looped back and these arrangements he made as usual before he got into bed now the lookingglass stood upon a dressingtable in the window with its back towards the windowpanes and since the night was moonless and dark this mirror it should be remembered reflected nothing of the room or its furniture but presented only to the view of charnock as he lay in bed a surface of a black sheen charnock recurred to his adventure of the morning and thus the abusive stranger was in his thoughts when he fell asleep he figured also in his dreams for after he had fallen asleep a curtain was raised upon a fantastic revue of the past week hassan akbar strode quickly and noiselessly behind his quarry tracking him by some inappreciable faculty not through the muddy sk but across the polished floor of the ballroom in the musical comedy again charnock shouted look out and the moor with one bound leapt from the ballroom which was now become a landingstage into a felucca the crew of the felucca it now appeared was made up of charnock lady macbeth and hassan akbar and by casting lots with counters made of vaseline charnock was appointed to hold the tiller this duty compelled extraordinary care for the felucca would keep changing its rig and the bulk of its hull swelled and dwindled at last to charnocks intense relief the boat settled into a salcombe clipper with the rig of a p and o but with immeasurably greater speed so that within a very few seconds they sailed over a limitless ocean and anchored at tangier at once the crew entirely vanished charnock was not distressed because he saw a hansom cab waiting for him at the customs though how the hansom was to pass up those narrow cobbled streets he could not think that however was the drivers business i hope your horse is good said charnock springing into the cab she comes of the great redhotter stock replied the cabman and lifting the trap in the roof he showered packets of visiting cards which fell about charnock like flakes of snow charnock had not previously noticed that the cabman was major wilbraham the cab shot up the hill through the tunnel past the closed shop a figure sprang from the ground and thrust a face through the window of the cab the man was in moorish dress but the face was the face of the abusive stranger of plymouth and all at once charnock started up on his elbow and in the smallest fraction of a second was intensely and vividly awake there was no sound at all within the room but in the black sheen of the mirror he saw a womans face he saw it quite clearly for perhaps five seconds the face rising white from the white column of the throat the dark and weighty coronal of the hair the curved lips which alone had any colour the eyes deep and troubled which seemed to hint a prayer for help which they disdained to make for five seconds perhaps the illusion remained for five seconds the face looked out at him from the black mirror lit palely as it seemed by its own pallor and so vanished charnock remained propped upon his elbow a faint twilight from the stars crept timidly through the open window as though deprecating its intrusion charnock looked into the dark corners of the room but nowhere did the darkness move nor could he hear any sound not even a board of the floor cracked and outside the door there was no noise of a footstep on the stairs then from a great distance the jingle of a cab came through the open window to his ears with a light companionable lilt gradually the sound ceased and again the silence breathed about him charnock struck a match and looked at his watch it was a few minutes after three charnock lay back in his bed wondering for he had seen that face once he had once exchanged glances with those eyes once only six years ago and thereafter had entirely forgotten the incident until this moment he had stopped for a night at monte carlo and had seen the girl yes the girl though it was a womans face which had gleamed in the depths of his mirror standing under the green shaded lamps in the big gamblingroom his attention he now remembered had been seized by the contrast between her amused indifference and the feverish haste of the gamblers about the table between her fresh clear looks and their heated complexions even between her frock of lilac silk and their more elaborate toilettes the girl was entirely happy then the red lips smiled the violet eyes laughed why should her face appear to him now after these years and paled by this distress a queer fancy slipped into his mind a fancy at the extravagance of which he knew very well he should laugh in the sane light of the morning though he indulged it now that somehow somewhere this woman needed help and that it was thus vouchsafed to her a stranger to make her appeal to him in this way which spared her the humiliation of making any appeal at all charnock fell asleep convinced that somehow somewhere he was destined to meet and know her as he had foreseen he laughed at his fancies in the morning but nevertheless he did meet her it had in fact already been arranged that he should for the face which he saw in the mirror was the face of miranda warriner chapter iv treats of the first meeting between charnock and miranda lady donnisthorpe with a sigh of relief retired from her position at the head of the stairs and catching charnock in the interval between two dances you kept some dances free she said didnt you i want to introduce you to a cousin of mine miranda warriner because she lives at ronda at ronda indeed yes her ladyship added with a magnificent air of indifference she is a widow and she led charnock across the ballroom miranda saw them approaching noticed an indefinable air of expectation in lady donnisthorpes manner and smiled a few excessively casual remarks concerning one mr charnock which lady donnisthorpe had dropped during the last few days had not escaped the notice of miranda who was aware of her cousins particular weakness this was undoubtedly mr charnock she raised her eyes towards him and had her ladyship been less fluttered she might have remarked that mirandas eyes lit up with a momentary sparkle of recognition mrs warriner mr charnock lady donnisthorpe effected the momentous introduction and felt immediately damped she had not indeed expected that her two newest victims would at once and publicly embrace but at all events she had decked out her ballroom as the sacrificial altar and had taken care that a fitting company and cheerful music should do credit to the immolation this tame indifference was less than she deserved miranda to whom lady donnisthorpe was looking made the perfunctory dip of the head and smiled the perfunctory smile and charnock why in the world did he not move or speak lady donnisthorpe turned her eyes from miranda to this awkward cavalier and was restored to a radiant goodhumour dazzled she said to herself absolutely dazzled for charnock stood rooted to the ground and tonguetied with amazement it was fortunate for lady donnisthorpe that at this point she thought it wise to withdraw otherwise she would surely have remarked an unmistakable look of disappointment which grew within charnocks eyes and spread out over his face then the disappointment vanished and as he compared programmes with miranda he recovered his speech four dances must intervene before he could claim her and charnock was glad of the interval to get the better of his bewilderment here was the woman whom his mirror had shown to him after all his nocturnal fancy was fulfilled or rather part of it only part or it he had met her he was to dance with her some miracle had brought them together from the corner by the doorway he watched miranda he remarked an unaffected friendliness in her manner towards her partners candour was written upon her broad white forehead and looked out from her clear eyes he had no doubt it was fragrant too in her hair there were heavy masses of that hair as he knew very well from his mirror but now the masses were piled and woven about her head with a cunning art which to be sure they deserved there was a ripple in her hair too which caught the light a most taking ripple here was a woman divested of a girls wiles and vanities charnock without a scruple aspersed all girls up to the age of say twentyfour that he might give her greater praise he fell to wondering not how it was that her face had appeared to him nor by what miracle he was now enabled to have knowledge of her but rather by what miracle of forgetfulness he had allowed her face after he had seen it that one time six years ago ever to slip from his thoughts or her eyes after that one time he had exchanged a glance with them the whirl of the dance carried her by his corner she swung past him with the lightest imaginable step and he was suddenly struck through and through with a chilling apprehension that by some unconscionable maladroitness he would surely tread upon her toes at once he proceeded to count over the dances in which he had borne himself with credit he had danced with spanish women he assured himself and they had not objected he was thus consoling himself when the time came for him to lead her out and the touch of her hand in his he remembers turned him into a babbling idiot he recollects that they danced with great celerity that they passed lady donnisthorpe who smiled at him with great encouragement and that he was dolefully humorous concerning major wilbraham and his exchanges of cards though why major wilbraham should have thrust his bald head into the conversation he was ever at a loss to discover and then miranda said shall we stop oh i didnt did i exclaimed the horrorstricken charnock as he looked downwards at her toes no you didnt miranda assured him with a laugh do you usually no he declared vehemently believe me no never upon my word i have danced with spanish women not at all no no no no quite so said miranda and they laughed suddenly each to the other and in a moment they were friends conversation came easily to their tongues and underneath the surface of their light talk the deeps of character called steadily like to like i have seen you once before mrs warriner said charnock as they seated themselves in an alcove of the room yes she returned promptly at monte carlo six years ago and her face lost its look of enjoyment and darkened with some shadow from her memories the change was however unremarked by charnock it seems strange he said in an absent voice that we should meet first of all in a gamblingroom and the next time at a ball why the question could not be answered charnock had a real but inexplicable feeling that miranda and he should have met somewhere amidst the grandeur of open spaces in the centre of the sahara and for the moment he forgot to calculate the effect of the sand upon mirandas eyes this feeling however he could hardly express at the present point of their acquaintanceship and indeed he immediately ceased to be aware of it do you actually remember our meeting in that way six years ago he exclaimed how wonderful of you why again asked mrs warriner why is it wonderful since you remember it ah but i didnt remember it until he paused for a second or two until i saw your face in a lookingglass miranda glanced at him in considerable perplexity then she said with a demure smile i have at times seen it there myself no doubt he replied with a glance at the cunning arrangement of her hair my maid does that said she biting her lip no doubt but you sit in front of the glass at the time youre in the room he continued hastily but when i saw your face in my mirror you couldnt be i was in bed i mean let me tell you he stopped overwhelmed with embarrassment miranda with an air of complete unconsciousness carefully buttoned her glove only the glove was already buttoned and her mouth twitched slightly at the corners it was just a week ago today charnock began again i got home to my hotel late ah murmured mrs warriner as though the whole mystery was now explained to her i assure you he retorted with emphasis that i dined in the train and drank nothing more serious than railway claret i made no accusation whatever miranda blandly remarked and seemed very well pleased after i had fallen asleep i began to dream but not about you mrs warriner thats the strange feature of the business it wasnt that i had been thinking of you that evening or indeed that i had ever been at all in the habit of thinking again charnock was utterly confused i dont seem to be telling the story with the best taste in the world do i he said ruefully never mind she said in a soothing voice of course i could have turned it into a compliment he continued only i take it you have no taste for compliments and i lack the experience to put them tactfully for a novice said she you seem to be doing very well charnock resumed his story i dreamt solely of people i had seen and incidents i had witnessed during the last week at tangier and at plymouth i dreamed particularly of a man i quarrelled with at plymouth and i suddenly woke up and saw your face in the mirror as you fancied it was no fancy it was no dreamface that i saw dreamfaces are always elusive it was no dreamface it was yours or one like mine there cannot be two for a novice repeated miranda with a smile you are doing very well charnock had watched her carefully while he told his story on the chance that her looks if not her lips might give him some clue to the comprehension of his mysterious vision but she had expressed merely an unconcerned curiosity and some amusement shall i explain your vision said she you must have seen me in london during the day the recollection that you had seen me must have lain latent so that when you woke up you saw me in your mirror and did not remember that you had seen me during the day were you at any theatre this day week no said miranda after counting over the days you did not see macbeth that night no then it is impossible i should have seen you for i came up from plymouth only that afternoon i drove from paddington to my hotel from the hotel i went to the theatre from the theatre i walked back to the hotel it is impossible it is very strange said miranda whose interest was increasing and whose sense of amusement had vanished for she saw that her companion was moved by something more than curiosity it was evident to her from his urgent tones from the eagerness of his face that he had some hidden reason for his desire to fathom the mystery it seemed to her that he nourished some intention some purpose in the back of his mind which depended for fulfilment upon whether or no there was any feasible solution tell me your dream she said it was the oddest jumble it had neither sense nor continuity moors figured in it ships lady macbeth the major with his cardcase and the stranger who swore at me through the cabwindow at plymouth the phrases that man used came into it what phrases i couldnt repeat to you the most eloquent there were milder ones however he called me a fair redhotter amongst other things said charnock laughing at his recollections and expressed a wish that i might well sit in that cab until i anted up in kingdom come miranda leaned back in her seat and opened and shut her fan he was a stranger to you you say quite you are sure quite you had never seen him anywhere anywhere think charnock deliberated for a few seconds never anywhere he replied there was a moments silence mrs warriner gently fanned herself as she leaned back in the shadow of the alcove describe him to me she said quietly a man of a slight figure a little under the middle height fair hair bright blue eyes an open goodnatured face and i should say a year or so under forty i took him to be a sailor the fan stopped miranda let it fall upon her lap that was the only movement which she made and from the shadow of the recess she said there is no explanation charnock drew a breath and leaned forward his hands clasped his elbows on his knees it seemed he had been waiting for just that one sentence as he sat now his face was in the light and miranda remarked a certain timidity upon it as though now that he had heard the expected words he dared not after all reply to them he did not look towards her he stared at the dancers but with vacant eyes he saw nothing of their jewels or their coloured robes or the flash of their silver feet and the noise of their chatter sounded very dimly in his ears he was quite occupied indeed with the hardihood of what he had it on his tongues tip to say when he had gained sufficient courage miranda moved restlessly unbuttoned a glove drew it off her wrist unconsciously and then was still as charnock began to speak is there no explanation he asked i imagined one you know how fancies come to one in the dark that night i imagined one i laughed at it the next morning but now since i have talked with you i have been wondering whether by any miracle it might be true and if theres an infinitesimal chance that its true i think that i ought to tell you it even though it may seem merely ridiculous even though it may offend you but i have lived for the most part of my time since i was a man in the waste places of the earth and what may well be an impertinence for we are only these few minutes acquainted you will perhaps pardon on that account he received no encouragement to continue on the other hand he received no warning to stop for miranda neither spoke nor moved he did not look at her face lest he should read the warning there but from the tail of his eye he could see the fan the white glove lying idle upon the black satin of her dress the skirt hung from her knee to her foot without a stir in its folds nor did her foot stir where it showed beneath the hem she remained in a pose of most enigmatical quietude the face which my mirror showed to me he went on was your face as i said but in expression it was not your face as i see it tonight it was very troubled it was very pale the eyes haunted me because of the pain in them and because of something else beside it was a tortured face i saw and the eyes seemed to ask but to ask proudly for help is it plain the explanation which occurred to me his voice sank he went on slowly choosing every word with care and speaking it with hesitation i imagined that out of all the millions of women in the world here was one who needed help my help who was allowed to appeal to me for it without if you understand making any appeal at all and the explanation was not unpleasant to a man who lives much alone in fact it has been so pleasant and has become so familiar during this last week that when i saw you tonight without a care just as i saw you that night at monte carlo and indeed it seemed to charnock that the black dress she wore alone marked the passage of those six years i am ashamed to say that i was disappointed yes said miranda i noticed the disappointment but theres a simpler explanation of the troubled face than yours you had been to macbeth that evening lady macbeth played a part in your dreams what if lady macbeth lent her pallor and her distress to the face which you saw in your mirror charnock swung abruptly round towards her it was not the explanation which surprised him but the altered voice she used and if her voice surprised him he was shocked and startled by her looks she was still leaning back in the shadow of the alcove and her head rested against the dark woodpanels she did not move when he looked towards her my god he said in a hushed and trembling whisper and she gave no sign that she heard she might have fainted but that her eyes glittered out of the shadow straight and steadily into his she might be dead from the whiteness of her face against the panels but that her bosom rose and fell what can i do he exclaimed hush she replied and rose to her feet here is lady donnisthorpe she walked abruptly past him across the room to the open window charnock remained nailed to the ground following her with his eyes for in that alcove leaning against the dark panels he had seen not merely the features but the expression on the features he had seen exact in every detail the face which he had seen in the polished darkness of his mirror the sheen of the dark polished panels helped the illusion his fancy had come true was transmuted into fact somewhere somehow he was to meet that woman he had met her here and in this way and her eyes and her face uttered her distress as with a piercing cry her eyes the resemblance was perfect to the last detail for charnock ventured to surmise in them the same involuntary appeal which he had seen in the eyes that had looked out from his mirror what then if the rest were true what if his explanation was as true as the true facts which it explained what if it was given to him and to her to stand apart from their fellows in this mysterious relation he saw that miranda was already near the window that lady donnisthorpe was approaching him he followed instantly in mirandas steps and lady donnisthorpe perceiving his attention had the complaisance to turn aside for the window opened on to a balcony wherein discreet palms sheltered off a nook there was one of lady donnisthorpes guests who did not share her ladyships complacency a censorious dowager sitting near to the window had kept an alert eye upon the couple in the recess during the last three dances and each time that her daughter a pretty girl with hair of the palest possible gold and light blue eyes that were dancing with a childs delight at all the wonders of a first season returned to the shelter of her portly frame the dowager drew moral lessons for her benefit from the text of the oblivious couple she remarked with pain upon their increasing infatuation for each other she pointed out to her daughter a hapless youth who tiptoed backwards and forwards before mrs warriner with a dancecard in his hand too timorous to interrupt the intimate conversation and when mrs warriner dropped a glove as she stepped over the windowsill on to the balcony the dowager nudged her daughter with an elbow now mabel theres a coquette she said charnock was close behind and overheard the triumphant remark i beg your pardon he said politely it was the purest accident the dowager bridled her face grew red she raised her tortoiseshell glasses and annihilated charnock with a single stare charnock had the audacity to smile he stooped and picked up the glove mrs warriner had indeed dropped the glove by accident but since it fell in charnocks way and since he picked it up it was to prove like the handbill at gibraltar and the draft on lloyds bank a thing trivial in itself but the opportunity of strange events chapter v wherein charnock and miranda improve their acquaintanceship in a balcony lady donnisthorpes house stood in queen annes gate and the balcony overlooked st jamess park there charnock found miranda he leaned his elbows upon the iron balustrade and for a while neither of them spoke it was a clear night of early june odorous with messages of hedgerows along country lanes and uplands of young grass and of bells ringing over meadows in front of them the dark trees of the park rippled and whispered to the stray breaths of wind between the trees one line of colourless lamps marked the footpath across the bridge to the mall and the carriages on the outer roadway ringed that enclosure of thickets and lawns with flitting sparks of fire charnock was still holding the glove which he had picked up on the windowsill thats mine said miranda thank you and she stretched out her hand for it yes said charnock absently and he drew the glove through his fingers it was a delicate trifle of white kid he smoothed it and his hand had the light touch of a caress miranda he said softly but distinctly and lingered on the word as though the sound pleased him miranda started and then sank back again in her chair with a quiet smile very likely she blushed at this familiar utterance of her name and at the caressing movement of his hand which accompanied and perhaps interpreted the utterance or perhaps it was only at a certain throb of her own heart that she blushed at all events the darkness concealed the blush and charnock was not looking in her direction the freshness of the night air had restored her but she was very willing to sit there in silence so long as no questions were asked of her and charnock had rather the air of one who works out a private problem for himself than one who seeks the answer from another the clock upon westminster tower boomed the hour of twelve miranda noticed that charnock raised his head and listened to the twelve heavy strokes with a smile his manner was that of a man who comes unexpectedly upon some memento of an almost forgotten time that is a familiar sound to you said mrs warriner and she was suddenly sensible of a great interest in all of the past life of this man who was standing beside her yes said charnock turning round to her you lived in westminster then at one time i used to stay here a good deal where did you live charnock laughed you would probably be no wiser if i named the street it is not of those which you and your friends go up and down he replied simply yes i lived in westminster for three hard curious years its not only the years that are curious said miranda but the hint was lost for charnock had turned back to the balustrade she was still however inclined to persist the details which lady donnisthorpe had sown in her mind now bore their crop interested in the man now that she knew him she was also interested in his career in his hurried migratory life in the mystery which enveloped his youth and all the more because of the contrast between her youth and his he had lived for three years in some small back street of westminster very likely she had more than once rubbed shoulders with him in the streets on the occasions when she had come up from her home in suffolk that home became instantly very distinct in her memories an old manorhouse guarded by a moat of dark silent water a house or broad redbrick chimneys whereon she had known the roses to bloom on a christmasday and of leaded windows upon which the boughs of trees continually tapped i should like to show you my home she said with a sudden impulse and did not check herself before the words were spoken perhaps some day she continued hurriedly you will tell me of those three years you spent in westminster and she hoped that he had not heard the first sentence of the two i will make an exchange said charnock i will exchange some day if you will the history of my three years for the history of your trouble he turned eagerly towards her but she held up her hand please please she said in a low shaking voice for her distress had come back upon her she had begun if not to forget it at all events to dull the remembrance of it since she had come out upon the balcony she had in a word sought and found a compensation in the new friendship of this man and a relief in his very navet but he had brought her anxieties back to her as he clearly understood for he said that is the second time this evening i am sorry the second time said miranda quickly why do you say that am i wrong he asked am i wrong in fearing that i myself have brought on you the trouble which i fancied i was to avert i should be glad to know that i was wrong for since i have stood here on this balcony that fear has been growing your face so changed at the story i told you at what point of it i do not know i was not looking did i show you some misfortune you were unaware of and might still be unaware of if i had only held my tongue in offering to shield you did i only strike at you i do not know i am in the dark he spoke in a voice of intense remorse pleading for a proof that his fear was groundless and miranda did not answer him at all i do not ask you to speak freely now he continued but sometime perhaps you will you see we shall be neighbours neighbours exclaimed miranda and her lips parted in a smile you live at ronda lady donnisthorpe tells me my headquarters now are at algeciras and he told her briefly of his business there my cousin did not tell me that said miranda lady donnisthorpe in the wisdom of her heart had in fact carefully concealed charnocks place of abode thinking it best that miranda should learn it from charnocks lips and be pleasantly surprised thereby that miranda was pleasantly surprised might perhaps have been inferred by a more experienced man from the extreme chilliness of her reply ronda is at the top she said algeciras at the bottom and there are a hundred miles of hillside and corkforest between there are also retorted charnock a hundred miles of railway shall we go back into the room suggested miranda if you wish only there is something else i am trying to say to you said charnock and at that miranda laughed and laughed with a fresh bright trill of amusement it broke suddenly and spontaneously from her lips and surprised charnock who was at a loss to reconcile it with the signs of her distress he turned towards her what is it he asked nothing she said hastily nothing at all you wished to go in not now not for the world she was genuinely amused her eyes laughed at him in the starlight charnock was very content at the change in her though he did not at all understand it it made what he meant to say easier if he could only find the means to say it he held the means unwittingly in his hand for he held mirandas glove it was that glove which provoked her amusement charnock with a pertinacity which was only equalled by his absence of mind was trying to force his hand into mrs warriners glove he had already succeeded in slipping the long sleeve of it over his palm he was now engaged in the more strenuous task of fitting his fingers into its slender fingers as he leaned upon the balcony you are laughing no doubt at my pertinacity and it is true that our acquaintanceship is very slight said he in a moment you will irretrievably destroy it said she looking at the glove i hope you dont mean that he answered sadly as he smoothed the fingertip of the forefinger down upon his own and at once proceeded to the other fingers the little finger in particular needed a deal of strenuous coaxing and caused him to break up his words with intervals of physical effort because as i say we shall be neighbours there the exclamation there meant that he was satisfied with the third finger a hundred miles of hillside in a foreign country on a map a thumb will cover it will it cover a thumb though asked miranda who took a feminine interest in the durability of her glove she leaned forward in a delighted suspense as charnock proceeded to answer her question by experiment theres the railway too said he as he struggled with the thumb of the glove and as i say a foreign country very likely we shall be nearer neighbours though you are at ronda and i am at algeciras than if you lived in this house and i at the house next door because after all theres one advantage in trouble of any kind trouble is the short footpath to friendship dont you think like that line of lamps across the park miranda forgot the glove she was touched by the deep sincerity of his voice by the modesty of his manner she rose from her chair and stood by his side at the balustrade yes she answered looking at the circling lights on the outer rim of the park i think that is true it spares one the long carriageroad of ceremonial acquaintanceship but she said thoughtfully i do not know whether after all i shall soon return to ronda she heard a little sound of something tearing and there was charnock contemplating in amazement upon his left hand a white kid glove of which the kid was ripped across the palm he felt in his pocket with his right hand and drew out both of his own gloves which he had taken off while he was talking in the alcove then he looked at miranda and his amazement became remorse its yours he said of course i picked it up i had forgotten even that i was holding it i had no notion that i was putting it on i gave you fair warning said miranda with a frank laugh but you would not pay any attention charnock looked at her with absolute incredulity you mean to say that you dont mind you are wonderful it seems almost too late to mind said she looking at the tattered glove or to mend said he ruefully drawing it off with extreme care and as a new thought struck him oh he exclaimed suppose it had belonged to anyone else the dowager in the window for instance he dangled the glove in the air now thats a lesson perhaps its a parable said miranda as she took the glove from him charnock saw that she had grown quite serious if so said he i cannot expound it shall i the smile had faded from her lips her eyes shone upon his with no longer a sparkle of merriment but very still very grave yes well then she said slowly shall i say that no man can offer a woman his friendship or help without doing her a hurt in some other way his eyes as steadily answered back to hers do you believe that he said he spoke quite simply without raising his voice in any way but none the less mrs warriner was certain that she had but to say yes and there would be an end now and forever of his questions of his help of his friendship of everything between them beyond the merest acquaintanceship perhaps some day they might cross the harbour together in the same ferry from algeciras to gibraltar and bow and exchange a careless word but that would be all and only that until his work was finished there do you believe that she was half tempted to say yes but she had an instinct a premonition that whatever answer she made would stretch out to unknown and incalculable consequences she seemed to herself to be drawing the lots which one way or another would decide and limit all her years to come upon the tiny yes or no between which she had to make her choice her whole life was destined to pivot accordingly she made up her mind to say neither but to turn the matter into a jest heres the proof said she as lightly as she could and she flourished the glove but the man steadily held her to his question with his eyes with his voice with his very attitude do you believe that he repeated i dont know whether i believe it she murmured resentfully i dont see why i should be asked to mean what i say or whether i mean what i say but it might be so i think i dont know i dont know to her relief charnock moved if he had stood like that demanding an answer with every line of his body for another instant she knew she would have been compelled to answer one way or another and she felt certain too that whatever answer she gave it would have been the one she would have wished afterwards to take back now if you are satisfied she added with a touch of petulance we will go in he moved aside for her to pass but before she had time to step forward he moved back again and barred the way no please he said quickly and his voice thrilled as though he had hit upon an inspiration lady donnisthorpe told me you were rather unconventional she remarked with a sigh which was only half of it a jest and she drew back as though she did not wish to hear what he had to say as though she almost feared to hear it but charnock barely even remarked her reluctance that glove he said and pointed to it miranda imagined that he was reaching out a hand for it i have heaps of pairs she exclaimed whipping it behind her back there is no need to trouble about it at all i do not ask for it i had no thought of that on the contrary i would ask you to keep it if you will there is something else which i was trying to say if you remember dear dear said miranda ruefully i could wish after all that you had trodden on my toes i beg your pardon said charnock and instantly he drew aside he left the way clear for her she passed him and went towards the window from which the lights and the music streamed out into the night had he followed she would have stepped into the room amongst the dancers she would have been claimed by a partner and she would have seen no more of charnock and the only consequences of this interview upon the balcony would have been a memory in her thoughts a curiosity in her speculations but charnock did not follow her he remained where she left him and her feet loitered more with every step she took at the edge of the window she stopped for the second time that evening she became aware that one way or other she must do the irrevocable thing it was a mere step to make across the sill of the window from the stone of the balcony to the parquet of the ballroom floor a thing insignificant in itself and in its consequences most momentous she stood for a second undecided the sight of her partner looking about the room decided her she came back to where charnock stood in a soldierly rigidity you might have come halfway to meet me she said in a whimsical complaint and then very gently i will hear what you wish to say if you will still say it what i mean is this he replied it is what i was trying to say the hardest thing if one ever wants help is dont you think the asking for it i could not say that to you until i had hit upon a means by which the asking should it ever be necessary might be dispensed with and it seemed to me that there was something providential in my tearing that glove for that torn glove can be the means if ever you see fit to use it you live at ronda for the next year i am to be found at algeciras you will only have to send that torn glove to me in an envelope i shall know without a word from you and when i answer it by coming up to you at ronda it will be understood by both of us again without a word why i have come i shall not need to speak at all you will only need to say the precise particular thing which needs to be done miranda stood with her eyelids closed and her ungloved hand pressed over her heart the blood darkened her cheeks charnock saw her whole face soften and sweeten i understand she said in a low voice i might appeal and be spared the humiliation of appealing like the face in your mirror i believe said he that my mirror sent me a message on that night i have tried to deliver it miranda slowly raised her eyes and they glistened with something other than the starlight thank you she said for the delicacy of the thought i am most grateful what woman would not be but i do not think that i shall ever send you the glove not because i would not be glad to owe gratitude to you but just for the same reason which has kept me from telling you anything of my troubles such as they are i must fight them through by myself this time she passed over the sill into the ballroom but she was holding the glove tight against her breast and she had a feeling that charnock very surely knew that at some time she would send it to him chapter vi while charnock builds castles in spain miranda returns there the anxious dowager who was preparing to depart with her daughter had just risen from her seat by the window as miranda stepped over the sill into the ballroom she sat down again however for she had a word or two to say concerning mirandas appearance muriel she observed take a good look at that woman and remember that if ever you sit out with one man for halfanhour on a cool balcony you can make no greater mistake than to return with a flushed face thank you mother said muriel who was growing restive under this instructional use of an evening party i will take the first opportunity of practising your advice at this moment charnock stepped over the sill he stepped up to mrs warriners side and spoke to her mrs warriner stopped within a couple of yards of the dowager and gave her hand and with her hand her eyes to her companion muriel look said the censorious one how vulgar shall i listen too asked muriel innocently do my child do said the dowager who was impervious to sarcasm what was said however did not reach the dowagers ears it was indeed no more than an interchange of goodnights but the dowager bridled perhaps out of disappointment that she had not heard an intriguing woman i have no doubt said she as through her glasses she followed mirandas retreat surely she has too much dignity objected the daughter dignity indeed my child when you know more of the world you will understand that the one astonishing thing about such women is not their capacity for playing tricks but their incredible power of retaining their selfrespect while they are playing them now we will go the dowagers voice was a high one it carried her words clearly to charnock who had not as yet moved he laughed at them then with entire incredulity but he retained them unwittingly in his memory the next moment the dowager swept past him the daughter muriel followed and as she passed charnock she looked at him with an inquisitive friendliness but her eyes happened to meet his and with a spontaneous fellowfeeling the girl and the man smiled to each other and at the dowager before they realised that they were totally unacquainted lady donnisthorpe was lying in wait for charnock she asked him to take her to the buffet charnock secured for her a chair and an ice and stood by her side conversational but incommunicative she was consequently compelled herself to broach the subject which was at that moment nearest to her heart how did you get on with my cousin she asked charnock smiled foolishly at nothing oh say something cried lady donnisthorpe and tapped with her spoon upon the glass plate tell me about her said charnock drawing up another chair lady donnisthorpe lowered her voice and said with great pathos she is most unhappy charnock gravely nodded his head why lady donnisthorpe settled herself comfortably with the full intention of wringing charnocks heart if by any means she could miranda comes of an old catholic suffolk family she was eighteen when she married and thats six years ago no six years and a half ralph warriner was a lieutenant in the artillery and made her acquaintance when he was staying in the neighbourhood of the pollards thats mirandas house in suffolk ralph listened to allan bedlows antediluvian stories allan was mirandas father her mother died long ago ralph captured the father finally he captured the daughter ralph you see had many graces but no qualities he was a bad stone in a handsome setting and miranda was no expert how could she be she lived at glenham with only her father and a discontented relation called jane holt for her companions consequently she married ralph warriner who got his step the day after the marriage and the pair went immediately to gibraltar ralph had overestimated mirandas fortune and it came out that he was already handsomely dipped so that their married life began with more than the usual disadvantages it lasted for three years and for that time only because of mirandas patience and endurance she is very silent about those three years but we know enough and lady donnisthorpe was for a moment carried away it must have been intolerable she exclaimed ralph warriner never had cared a snap of his fingers for her his tastes were despicable his disposition utterly mean cards were in his blood i verily believe that his heart was an ace of spades add to that that he was naturally cantankerous and jealous to his brother officers he was civil for he owed them money but he made up for his civility by becoming a bully once he had closed his own front door yes yes interrupted charnock hurriedly as though he had no heart to hear more i understand you can understand then that when the crash came we were glad two years after the marriage old allan bedlow sickened miranda came home to nurse him and ralph he bought a schooneryacht allan bedlow died miranda inherited and the estate was settled upon her ralph could not touch a farthing of the capital and he was aggrieved miranda returned to gibraltar and matters went from worse to worse the crash came a year later the nature of it is neither here nor there but ralph had to go and had to go pretty sharp his schooneryacht was luckily lying in gibraltar bay he slipped on board before gunfire and put to sea as soon as it was dark and he was not an instant too soon from that moment he disappeared and the next news we had of him was the discovery of his body upon rosevear two years afterwards charnock hunted through the jungle of lady donnisthorpes words for a clue to the distress which miranda had betrayed that evening but he did not discover one another question forced itself into his mind why does mrs warriner live at ronda he asked i have never been there but there are no english residents i should think that was one of her reasons replied lady donnisthorpe at least i think so but upon that too she is silent and when she will not speak no one can make her you see what ralph did was hushed up it was one of those cases which are hushed up particularly since he had disappeared and was out of reach but everyone knew that disgrace attached to it his name was removed from the army list miranda perhaps shrank from the disgrace she shrank too i think from the cheap pity of which she would have had so much at all events she did not return home she sent for jane holt her former companion and settled at ronda lady donnisthorpe looked doubtfully at charnock perhaps there were other reasons too sacred reasons but she had not made up her mind whether it would be wise to explain those other reasons before her guests began to take their leave of her and so the opportunity was lost charnock walked back to his hotel that night in a frame of mind entirely strange to him he was inclined to rhapsodise he invented and rejected various definitions of woman he laughed at the worldly ignorance of the dowager a woman madam he imagined himself to be lecturing her is the great gift to man to keep him clean and bright like a favourite sword he composed other and no less irreproachable phrases and in the midst of this exhilarating exercise was struck suddenly aghast at the temerity of his own conduct that night at the remembrance of his persistency however he was not in a mood to be disheartened the dawn took the sky by surprise while he was still upon his way the birds bustled among the leaves in the gardens and a thrush tried his throat and finding it clear gave full voice to his song the blackbirds called one to the other and a rosy light struck down the streets it was morning and he stopped to wonder whether miranda was yet asleep he hoped so intensely for the sake of her invaluable health but miranda was seated by her open window listening to the birds calling in the park and drawing some quiet from the quiet of the lawns and trees and every now and then she glanced across her shoulder to where a torn white glove lay upon the table as though she was afraid it would vanish by some enchantment but the next day miranda packed her boxes and when charnock called upon lady donnisthorpe he was informed that she had returned in haste to ronda charnock was surprised for he remembered that mrs warriner had expressed a doubt whether she would ever return to ronda and wondered what had occurred to change her mind but the surprise and bewilderment were soon swallowed up in a satisfaction which sprang from the assurance that miranda and he were after all to be neighbours chapter vii in which major wilbraham describes the steps by which he attained his majority and gives miranda some particular information a month later at ronda and a little after midday in the cool darkness of the cathedral under the great stone dome behind the choir miranda was kneeling before a lighted altar that altar she had erected as an inscription showed to the memory of ralph warriner and since her return from england she had passed more than an ordinary proportion of her time in front of it this morning however an unaccountable uneasiness crept over her she tried to shake the sensation off by an increased devoutness but though her knees were bent there was no prayer in her mind or upon her lips her uneasiness increased and after a while it defined itself someone was watching her from behind she ceased even from the pretence of prayer her heart fluttered up into her throat she did not look round she did not move but she knelt there with a sinking expectation in the light of the altar candles and felt intensely helpless because their yellow warmth streamed full upon her face and person and must disclose her to the watching eyes behind she knelt waiting for a familiar voice and a familiar step she heard only the grating of a chair upon the stone flags beyond the choir and a priest droning a litany very far away here all was quiet quiet as the eyes watching her out of the gloom at last resenting her cowardice she rose to her feet and turned at once a man stepped forward and her heart gave a great throb of relief as she saw the man was a stranger he bowed and with an excuse for his intrusion he handed her a card she did not look at it for immediately the stranger continued to speak in a cool polite voice and it seemed to her that all her blood stood still i knew captain warriner at gibraltar he said in fact i may say that i know him for he is alive miranda was dimly aware that he waited for an answer and then excused her silence with an accent of sarcasm such good news must overwhelm you no doubt i have used all despatch to inform you of it for i was only certain of the truth yesterday and to her amazement miranda heard herself reply then i discovered it a month before you did the next thing of which she was conscious was a thick golden mist before her eyes the golden mist was the clear sunlight in the square before the cathedral miranda was leaning against the stone parapet though how she was there she could not have told she had expected the news she had even thought that the man standing behind her was her husband come to tell her it in person but nevertheless the mere telling of it the putting of it in words to quote the strangers phrase had overwhelmed her memories of afternoons during which she had walked out with her misery to europa point of evenings when she had sat with her misery upon the flat housetop watching the riding lights in algeciras bay and listening to the jingle of tambourines from the houses on the hillside below all the sordid unnecessary wretchedness of those three years spent at gibraltar came crushing her she savoured again the disgrace which attended upon ralphs flight her first instinct when she learned ralph was alive had urged her to hide and at this moment she regretted that she had not obeyed it she regretted that she had returned to ronda where ralph or any emissary of his at once could find her but that was only for a moment she had returned to ronda with a full appreciation of the consequences of her return and for reasons which she was afterwards to explain and of which even while she stood in that square she resumed courage to approve the stranger came from the door of the cathedral and crossed to her your matteroffact acceptance of my news was clever mrs warriner he said with a noticeable sharpness believe me i do homage to cleverness i frankly own that i expected a scene of sorts i was quite taken aback a compliment i assure you upon my puff and he bowed with his hand on his breast you were out of the cathedral door before i realised that all this time you had been the captains would you mind if i said accomplice that her matteroffact acceptance of the news was entirely due to the fact that the news dazed her miranda did not trouble to explain the altar continued the stranger in a voice of genuine admiration was a masterstroke to erect an altar to the memory of a husband who is still alive to pray devoutly before it is highly ingenious and may i say brave religion is a trumpcard mrs warriner in most of the games where you sit with law and order for your opponents but not many women have the bravery to play it for its value miranda coloured at his words there had been some insincerity in her daily prayers before the altar though the selfsatisfied man who spoke to her had not his finger upon the particular flaw enough insincerity to cause miranda some shame now that she probed it and yet in the insincerity there had been also something sincere the truth is miranda could bring herself to wish neither that her husband was dead if he was alive nor that he should come to life again if he was dead she made a compromise she daily prayed with great fervour for his souls salvation before the altar she had erected to his memory but this again was not a point upon which she troubled to enlighten her companion she was more concerned to discover who the man was and on what business he had come you knew my husband at gibraltar she said and yet it is true replied the man in answer to her suspicion you need not be afraid mrs warriner i have not come from scotland yard i have had i admit relations with the police but they have always been of an involuntary kind you assume said she with some pride that i have reason to fear scotland yard whereas nothing was further from my thoughts only you say that you knew my husband at gibraltar you pretend to come from him by no means we are at crosspurposes i fancy i do not come from him though most certainly i did know him at gibraltar but i admit that he never invited me to his house in that case said miranda with a cold bow i can do no more than thank you for the news you give me and wish you a good day she walked by him he turned and imperturbably fell into step by her side clever said he clever miranda stopped who are you what is your business she asked as to who i am you hold my card in your hand mrs warriner had carried it from the cathedral unaware that she held it she now raised it to her eyes and read major ambrose wilbraham wilbraham noted though he did not understand the rapid perplexed glance which she shot at him charnock had spoken to her of a major wilbraham had described him and undoubtedly this was the man as to my business he continued i give you the news that your husband is alive but i have also something to sell what obviously my silence it might be awkward if it was known in certain quarters that captain warriner who sold the mechanism of the new daventry quickfiring gun to a foreign power who slipped out of gibraltar just a night before his arrest was determined on and who was wrecked a year ago in the scillies is not only alive but in the habit of paying periodical visits to england mrs warriner again read the name upon the card major ambrose wilbraham she said with an incredulous emphasis on the major captains he retorted airily have at times deviated from the narrow path so that a major may well be forgiven a peccadillo but i will not deceive you mrs warriner the rank was thrust upon me by a barman in shaftesbury avenue and i suffered it because the title after all gives me the entrance to the chambers of many young men who have or most often have not just taken their degrees so major i am but my mess is any bar within a mile of piccadilly circus shall we say that i hold brevet rank and am seconded for service in the noble regiment of the soldiers of fortune and the enemies you fight with said miranda with a contemptuous droop of the lips are women like myself pardon me retorted wilbraham with unabashed good humour women like yourself mrs warriner are the vivandires whom we regretfully impress to supply our needs upon the march our enemies are the rozzers again i beg your pardon the gentlemen in blue who lurk at the street corners by whom from time to time we are worsted and interned they walked across the square along a narrow street down towards the tajo that deep chasm which bisects the town the heat was intense the road scorched under foot and they walked slowly they made a strange pair in the old quaint streets the woman walking with a royal carriage delicate in her beauty and her dress the man defiant battered and worn with an eye which from sheer habit scouted in front and aside for the chance which might toss his days rations in his way their talk was stranger still for by an unexpressed consent the subject of the bargain to be struck was deferred and as they walked wilbraham illustrated to miranda the career of a man who lives by his wits and dwelt even with humour upon its alternations of prosperity and starvation i have been a manager of theatrical companies in the smalls he said a billiardmarker at trieste a racing tipster a vender of photographs and i once carried a sandwichboard down bond street and saw the women i had danced with not so long before draw their delicate skirts from the defilement of my rags however i rose to a better position it is funny you know to go right under and then find there are social degrees in the depths i have had good times too mind you every now and then i have struck an a copperbottomed gold mine and then there were dress suits and meals running into one another and ormolu rooms on the first floor dark sayings unintelligible shibboleths came and went among his words and obscured their meaning accents and phrases from many countries betrayed the vicissitudes of his life but he spoke with the accent of a gentleman and with something of a gentlemans good humour so that miranda moved partly by his recital and perhaps partly because her own misfortunes had touched her to an universal sympathy began to be interested in the man who had experienced so much that was strange to her and they both slipped into a tolerance of each other and a momentary forgetfulness of their relationship as blackmailer and blackmailed i could give you a modern edition of don guzman he said i was a moneylenders tout at gibraltar at one time its to that i owed my acquaintance with warriner its to that i owe my present acquaintance with you he came to a dead stop in the full swing of narration he halted in his steps and banged the point of his stick down into the road but i have done with it he cried and drawing a great breath he showed to miranda a face suddenly illuminated the garrets and the first floors the stale billiard rooms the desperate scouting for food like a damned seagull i beg your pardon mrs warriner upon my word i do but imagine a poor beggar of a bankrupt painter who after fifteen years suddenly finds himself with a meal upon the table and his bills paid i am that man fifteen years of what i have described to you it might have been less no doubt but i hadnt learnt my lesson fifteen years and from first to last not one thing done of the few things worth doing fifteen years of a murderous hunt for breakfast and dinner and ive done with it thanks to you mrs warriner and his face hardened at once and gleamed at her very cruel and menacing yes thanks to you well not forget that and as he resumed his walk the astounding creature began gaily to quote poetry i resume life after death for tis no less than life after such long unlovely labouring days a great poet mrs warriner what do you think no doubt said miranda absently that one cruel glance had chilled the sympathy in her major wilbraham would not spare either ralph or herself with the memory of those fifteen years to harden him they came to the ciudad the old intricate moorish town of tortuous lanes in the centre of ronda before a pair of heavy walnut doors curiously encrusted with bright copper nails wilbraham came to a stop your house i think mrs warriner and he took off his hat and wiped his forehead i should prefer said she to hear what you have to say in the alameda as you will i am bound to say that i could have done with a soda and im so frisky but i recognise that i have no right to trespass upon your hospitality they went on crossed a small plaza and so came down to the tajo a bridge spans the ravine in a single arch in the centre of the bridge miranda stopped leaned over the parapet and looked downwards wilbraham followed her example for three hundred feet the walls of the gorge fell sheer at the bottom the turbulence of a torrent foamed and roared at the top was the span of the bridge in the brickwork of the arch a tiny window looked out on air do you see that window said miranda drily the prison is underfoot in the arch of the bridge indeed how picturesque returned wilbraham easily who was quite untouched by any menace which mirandas words might suggest miranda looked across the road towards a guardia wilbraham lazily followed the direction of her glance for all the emotion which he showed blackmail might have been held in spain an honourable means of livelihood miranda turned back that window she said is the window of the prison the view remarked wilbraham would compensate in some measure for the restriction chains might add to the restriction chains are unpleasant wilbraham heartily agreed miranda realised that she had tempted defeat in this little encounter she accepted it and walked on you were wise to come off that barrow mrs warriner wilbraham remarked in approval they crossed the bridge and entered the mercadillo the new spanish quarter of the town ascended the hill and came to the bull ring before that wilbraham stopped why do we go to the alameda we can talk there on neutral ground it seems a long way on the other hand replied miranda the alameda is close to the railway station by the bye how did you know where i lived there was no difficulty in discovering that i learnt at gibraltar that you lived at ronda and the stationmaster here told me where when i saw your house i did not wonder at your choice you were wise to take a moorish house i fancy the patio with the tamarisks in the middle and the fountain and the red and green tiles very pleasant i should think a door or two stood open the rooms seemed charming low in roof with dark panels of a grateful coolness and so far as i could judge with fine views you went into the house then exclaimed miranda yes i asked for you and was told that miss holt was at home i thought it wise to go in one never knows so i introduced myself but not my business to miss holt your cousin is she not a profound sentimentalist i should fancy i noticed she was reading henrietta temple she complained of being much alone she nurses grievances no doubt sentimentalists have that habit what do you say miranda could have laughed at the shrewdness of the mans perceptions had she not been aware that the shrewdness was a weapon directed against her own breast they reached the alameda miranda led the way to a bench which faced the railings wilbraham looked quickly and suspiciously at her and then walked to the railings and looked over the alameda is laid out upon the very edge of the ronda plateau and wilbraham looked straight down a sheer rock precipice of a thousand feet he remained in that posture for some seconds from the foot of that precipice the plain of the vega stretched out level as a southsea lagoon the gardens of a few cottages were marked out upon the green like the squares of a chessboard upon the hedges there was here and there the flutter of white linen orchards of apples cherries peaches and pears enriched the plain with their subdued colours and the guadiaro freed from the confinement of its chasm wound through it with the glitter and the curve of a steel spring a few white moorish mills upon the banks of the stream were at work and the sound of them came droning through the still heat up to wilbrahams ears wilbraham however was not occupied with the scenery for when he turned back to miranda his face was dark and angry why did you bring me to the alameda he asked sternly because i will not listen to you in my own house she answered with spirit wilbraham did not resent the reason but he watched her warily as though he doubted it now said miranda as she stood before him you tell me that my husband is living i have your bare word for it and out of your lips you have proved to me that your bare word has very little worth the buttons are off the foils said he very well in the cathedral you corroborated my word you know that he lives i know it how do you know it by adding two and two and making five as any man with any savvy always can replied wilbraham indeed by adding two and two one can even at times make a decent per annum mrs warriner sat down upon the bench and wilbraham standing at her side presented the following testimonial to his savvy first of all he drew from one pocket four pounds of english gold and from the other a handful of dollars and pesetas this is what is left of two hundred and thirty pounds which i won at monte carlo in the beginning of may theres a chance for philosophy mrs warriner if i hadnt won that money i shouldnt be standing here now with my livelihood assured for i shouldnt have been able to embark on the p and o mail steamer india at marseilles and so i shouldnt have fallen in with my dear young friend charnock miranda fairly started at the mention of charnocks name in connection with wilbrahams discovery instantly wilbraham paused miranda made an effort to look entirely unconcerned but wilbrahams eye was upon her and she felt the blood colouring her cheeks oho said wilbraham cocking his head then he whistled softly to himself while he looked her over from head to foot miranda kept silence and he resumed his story though every time he mentioned charnocks name he looked to surprise her in some movement off ushant we came up with a brigantine and i couldnt help fancying that her lines were familiar to me charnock lent me his binoculars a dear good fellow charnock and i made out her name the tarifa i should not have given the boat another thought but for charnock charnock said she had the lines of a salcombe clipper did you happen to know that the ten brothers was a salcombe clipper i did and the moment charnock had spoken i understood why the look of her hull was familiar i had seen her or her own legitimate sister swinging at warriners moorings in algeciras bay i did not set any great store upon that small point however until charnock kindly informed me that her owner could have gained no possible advantage by altering her rig from a schooners into a brigantines then my interest began to rise for he had altered the rig why if the change was to his disadvantage i cant say that i had any answer ready i cant say that i expected to find an answer but since i landed at plymouth from which salcombe is a bare twenty miles i thought that i might as well run over one never knows such small accidents mean everything for us and as a matter of fact i spent a very pleasant halfhour in the back parlour of the commercial inn watching the yachts at anchor and the little sailing boats spinning about the river and listening to an old skipper who deplored the times when the town rang with the din of hammers in shipbuilding yards and twelve observe mrs warriner twelve schooners brought to it the prosperity of their trade the schooners had been sold off but the skipper had their destinies at his fingers ends as a man follows the fortunes of his children two had been cast away three were in the newfoundland trade one was now a steamyacht and the others still carried fruit from the west indies he accounted for eleven of them and the twelfth of course was the ten brothers wrecked upon rosevear i eliminated the ten brothers the two which had been cast away and the steamyacht eight were left yes said mrs warriner i went back to plymouth and verified the skippers information he had given me the owners names and the names of the vessels i looked them up in the sailinglists and i proved beyond a shadow of doubt from their dates of sailing and arrival at various ports that not one of those eight schooners could have been the brigantine we passed off ushant there remained then the four which i had eliminated or rather the three for the steamyacht was out of the question do you follow miranda made a sign of assent those three boats had been cast away two of them belonged to respectable firms the third to ralph warriner it would of course be very convenient for ralph warriner under the circumstances to be reputed dead and yet to be alive with a boat in hand so to speak on the other side would it profit either of the two respectable firms to spread a false report that one of their boats had been cast away hardly besides it would of course be to warriners advantage from the point of view of concealment to change the rig and the name of his boat it was all inference and guesswork no doubt charnock for instance might have been entirely wrong the tarifa might never have been anything but the tarifa and a brigantine but the inference and the guesswork all pointed the one way and i own that my interest was rapidly changing to excitement my suspicions were strengthened by the behaviour of the tarifa herself no news of her approach was recorded in the papers she didnt make any unnecessary noise about the port she was bound for nor had she the manners to pass the time of day with any of lloyds signalstations the tarifas business began to provoke my curiosity here was shall we say a needless lack of ceremony to begin with it didnt seem as if the tarifa had many anxious friends awaiting her arrival besides that supposing that my suspicions were right that the tarifa was the ten brothers masquerading under another name and that perhaps ralph warriner was on board it stood to reason ralph warriner would not risk his skin in an english port without a better reason than a cargo of trade comprenny mrs warriner i was guessing conjecturing inferring i had no knowledge so i thought the cargo of the tarifa was the right end of the stick to hang on to if i could know the truth about that i should be in a better position to guess whether it had anything to do with ralph warriner is that clear it was clear enough to miranda who already felt herself enmeshed in the net of this mans ingenious deductions yes she said very well from the brigantines course she was evidently making for one of the western harbours i lay low in plymouth for a couple of days and read the shipping news that wasnt all i did during those two days though i went to the free library besides overhauled the file of the western morning news and assimilated information about the inquest at st marys the faceless mariner chucked up on rosevear struck one as interesting i noticed too that there had been a good many wrecks in the channel during the heavy weather and the fog just about that time but before i had come to any conclusion i opened my newspaper on the third morning and read that the tarifa had dropped her anchor at falmouth i took the first train out of plymouth and sure enough i picked the tarifa up in falmouth docks then i made friends with the portofficers but i got never a glimpse of ralph warriner mirandas hopes revived she knew very well that ralph warriner was not at that time in falmouth for the moment however she let wilbraham run on i frankly admit that my hopes sank a little he continued of course warriner might have been put ashore but it seemed to me impossible to obtain sufficient certainty of my suspicions unless i actually clapped eyes on him miranda agreed and her prospects of escaping from this mans clutches showed brighter for she was not in a mood of sufficient calmness to enable her to realise that wilbraham would hardly have been so frank if he had not by now at all events acquired absolute certainty my hopes were to sink yet more wilbraham continued the brigantine passed for a tramp out from tarifa with a cargo of fruit i saw that cargo unloaded there was no pretence about it it was a full cargo of fruit the boat was sailing back to tarifa with a cargo of alkali and i saw that cargo stowed away in her hold mrs warriner my spirits began to revive that cargo of alkali was most uncommon small the profit on it wouldnt have paid the deckys wages again i inferred i inferred that the alkali was a blind and that the tarifa meant to pick up a cargo of another sort somewhere along the coast though what the cargo would be i could not for the life of me imagine but it is all guesswork said miranda with an indifference which she was far from feeling i learned one piece of solid cheering information from my friends the portofficers retorted wilbraham the tarifas papers were all quite recent and yet she was an old boat she was supposed to be owned by her master and no doubt was added miranda with an assumption of weariness it appeared that her saloon had caught fire the saloon had been gutted and the tarifas papers destroyed a year before wilbraham resumed untroubled by mrs warriners objections a pretty careless captain that eh a most uncommon careless captain mrs warriner for a boat to lose her papers well its pretty much the same as when a girl loses her marriage lines in the melodramas a most uncommon careless captain or a most astute one you say what well ill not deny but what you may be right for that brigantine caught fire and burned her papers just about the date when the ten brothers went ashore on rosevear hows that for the long arm but you did not see my husband said miranda stubbornly and why asked wilbraham and answered his question because your husband wasnt onboard then the whole story falls to the ground exclaimed miranda as she rose from her seat wait a bit mrs warriner said wilbraham and he sat down on the seat and nursed his leg the tarifa was supposed to belong to her master who went by the name of john wilson now heres a funny thing i never saw john wilson though i prowled about the docks enough the portofficers described him to me a grizzled seafaring man of fifty but he was always snug in his cabin and a mate did the show business with the cargo i grew curious about john wilson i wanted to see john wilson accordingly i located the chartroom from the wharf then i put on a black thumb tie and a dirty collar so as to look like a clerk and i walked boldly down the gangway and stepped across the deck i chose my time you understand i knocked at the chartroom door come in said a voice and in i walked mrs warriner you could have knocked me down with that dainty parasol of yours if you had been present when i first saw john wilson what do you want says he short and sharp will you take a load of cotton to valencia says i and i quoted an insignificant price i am not such a fool as you look said he and out i went and shook hands with myself on the quay for john wilson was not my husband exclaimed miranda with almost a despairing violence he was not he was not you are right mrs warriner he was not but he was a man whom you and i knew as thomas discipline first mate of the schooneryacht the ten brothers of which captain ralph warriner was the certificated master and observe please the whole crew of the ten brothers was reported lost upon rosevear thomas discipline might have left the ten brothers before argued miranda his presence on the tarifa does not connect my husband with that boat thats precisely the objection which occurred to me said wilbraham coolly but here was at last a fact which fitted in with my guesswork and i own to being uplifted that evening i got the ticket that the tarifa was to put to sea the next day and sure enough in the morning she swung out into the fairway and waited for the evening ebb i passed that day in an altogether unenviable state of anxiety mrs warriner for if by any chance i was wrong if she did not mean to take up another cargo of a more profitable kind by dark if she were to sail clean away for ushant on the evening ebb why the boat might be the ten brothers or it might not and the master might be the late captain warriner or he might not any way the bottom fell clean out of my little business but she did not she got her anchors in about eight oclock and reached out towards the lizard in the dusk with a light wind from the land on her beam the story so far miranda interrupted seems nautical but hardly to the point think so said wilbraham indifferently did i mention that at the mouth of the harbour the tarifa passed a steam launch pottering around the st anthony light between you and me mrs warriner i was holding the tiller of that steam launch you she exclaimed just poor little me said he smiling politely with a few paltry thickuns in my pocket to speculate in the hire of a steam launch i gave the tarifa a start and followed keeping well away on her lee with her red light just in view that first halfhour or so was a wearing time for me mrs warriner i assure you and he took off his hat and wiped his forehead as though the anxiety came back upon him now he laboured his breath and broke up his sentences with short nervous laughter he seemed entirely to forget his companion and the sun and the andalusian sierras across the plain he was desperately hunting the tarifa along the spit to the lizard point i was certain of one thing that no captain warriner had come aboard at falmouth so if the tarifa kept out to sea why there was no captain warriner to come aboard and here was i spending my last pounds in running down a willothewisp and the world to face again tomorrow in the grim old way without a penny to my purse on the other hand if there was a captain warriner he would come aboard with the cargo somewhere that night and i fancied i could lay my finger on that somewhere i had another cause for anxiety grant my guesswork correct and the last thing the tarifa was likely to hanker after would be a wasp of a steam launch buzzing in her wake the evening was hazy by a stroke of luck but the wind was light and the sea smooth and my propeller throbbed out over the water until i thought it must reverberate across the world and the esquimaux on franz josef land and the kanaka in the pacific would hear it plain as the pulsing of a battleship however i slowed the launch down to less than halfspeed and the crew of the tarifa made no account of me the brigantine was doing only a leisurely five knots she was waiting for the dark i conjectured conjectured i came near to praying it and as if in answer to my prayer it sounds pretty much like blasphemy now doesnt it but at that moment i believed it all at once her red light vanished and my heart went jumping in the inside of me as though it had slipped its moorings for the tarifa had changed her course she was pointing closer to the wind and the wind came offshore she was showing me her stern instead of her port beam on the course she was lying now she couldnt clear the manacles not by any manner of means she was heading for the anchorage i hoped she would she was standing in towards helford river in a little she went about and seeing her green light i slowed down again i could afford to take it easy he drew a breath of relief and lolled back upon his seat miranda no longer put questions there was a look of discouragement upon her face she began bitterly to feel herself helpless in this mans hands as clay under the potters thumb do you know the creek he asked and did not wait for an answer i hadnt anchored there for twenty years but i had a chart of it in my memories his voice softened with perhaps some recollection of a yachting trip in the days before his life had grown sour steep hills on each side and on each side woods the trees run down and thrust their knees into the water like animals at their watering places of an evening a mile or so up a little rose and honeysuckle village nestles as pretty as a poem theres a noise of birds all day and all night and day the trees talk given a westerly wind and the summer i dont know many places which come up to helford river and his voice ceased and he sat in a muse a movement at his side recalled him but thats not business you say he resumed briskly i left the tarifa at the mouth of the creek the little village a mile or more up is on the southward side opposite to it on the falmouth side is the coastguard station nearer to the mouth and still on the falmouth side a tiny dingle shelters a schoolhouse and halfadozen cottages and still nearer the road from falmouth comes over the brow of the hill and dips down along the hillside at one point the steep hillside is broken theres an easy incline of sand and bushes and soil between the water and the road the incline is out of sight of the coastguard besides it is only just round the point and close to the sea and for that reason i was in no particular hurry to follow the tarifa i edged the launch close in under the point waded ashore and scrambled along in the dark until i reached the break in the hillside then i lay down among the bushes and waited all lights were out on the tarifa but i could see her hull dimly a blot of solid black against the nights unsubstantial blackness i waited for centuries and ons there was neither moon nor any star at last i heard a creaking sound that came from the other end of the world it was repeated it grew louder it became many sounds the sounds or cart wheels on the dry road i looked at my watch the glimmer of its white face made it possible for me to tell the hour it was five minutes to eleven for five minutes the sounds drew infinitesimally nearer higher up the creek six bells were struck upon a yacht and then over the waters from the direction of the tarifa came cautiously the wooden rattle of oars in the rowlocks of a boat a boat i say but it was followed by another and another the three boats grounded on the sand as the carts reached the break in the hillside there were few words spoken and no light shown i lay in the bushes straining my ears to catch a familiar voice my eyes on the chance that a match might be struck and light up a familiar face well said miranda breaking in upon his speech she was strung to a high pitch or excitement and her face and voice betrayed it i was disappointed replied wilbraham but i saw something of the cargo which the waggons brought over the hill and the boats carried on board backwards and forwards between the tarifa and the shore they were rowed with unremitting diligence and caution carrying first longish packingcases of some weight as i could gather from the conduct of the men who stumbled with them down the incline and after the packingcases square boxes yet more unwieldy than the long cases if one takes the proportion of size the morning was breaking before the last boat was hoisted on board and the last waggon had creaked out of hearing over the hill and what was the cargo asked miranda that was the question which troubled me replied wilbraham i lay on the hillside in the chill of the morning as disheartened a man as you can imagine through a break in the bushes i watched the tarifa below me her decks busy with the movement of her crew and from her galley the comfortable smoke coiling up into the air breakfast a gargantuan appetite suddenly pinched my stomach had warriner gone on board with the cargo and what was the cargo and into what harbour would the tarifa carry it i had found out nothing then on board the brigantine men gathered at the windlass a chain clinked musically as the anchor was hove short the gaff of her mainsail creaked up the mast and the festoons of her canvas were unfolded the tarifa was outward bound and i had discovered nothing i was like a man tied hand and foot and a treasure within his reach i had had my fingers on the treasure again the chain rattled on the windlass she broke out her foresail and her jib i saw the water sparkle under her foot and stream out a creaming pennant in her wake i had lost in the space of a second i lived through every minute of my last fifteen years and their dreary vicissitudes i lived in anticipation through another fifteen similar in every detail and fairly shuddered to think there might be another fifteen still to follow those i stretched myself out and ground my face in the sand and cursed god with all my heart for the difference between man and man and meanwhile the tarifa with a hint of the sun upon her topsails slipped out over the tide to sea wilbrahams face was quite convulsed by the violence of his recollections and with so vivid a sincerity with a voice so mutable had he described the growth and extinction of his hopes that miranda almost forgot their object almost found herself sympathising with his endeavours almost regretted their failure until she remembered that after all he had not failed or he would not have been sitting beside her in the alameda well she said in a hard voice you failed what then i crawled down to my launch the cheapest man in the united kingdom my engineer was muffled up in a pilot jacket and uncommon surly and cheap too i hadnt the pluck left in me to resent his impudence and we crept back to falmouth all the way i was pestered with that question what was the cargo i had seen shipped that night in helford river i couldnt get it out of my head the propeller lashed it out with a sort of vindictiveness the little waves breaking ashore whispered about it as though they knew very well but wouldnt peach when i had landed in falmouth i found that i was walking towards the free library the doors however were still closed i breakfasted in a fever of impatience and was back again at the doors before they were opened you may take it from me mrs warriner i was the first student inside the building that morning i read over again every scrap of news and comment about the inquest in scilly which i could pester the librarian to unearth and points which in my hurry i had overlooked before began to take an air of importance the old man fournier for instance it seemed sort of queer that a taxidermist of tangier should come all the way to scilly for a months holiday eh what what was old man fournier doing at scilly scillys a likely place for wrecks was old man fournier a hangeron upon chance a nautical mr micawber waiting for a wreck to turn up which would suit his purpose or had he stagemanaged by some means or other the coup de theater on rosevear it seemed funny that the shortsighted man should spot the wreck on rosevear before the st agnes men eh suppose m fournier and ralph warriner were partners in that pretty cargo i walked straight out of that library feeling quite certain that i held the right end of the skein i had made a mistake in following up warriner i ought to have followed up the taxidermist i walked about falmouth all that day puzzling the business out and i came to the conclusion that the sooner i crossed to the scillies the better i was by this time fairly excited and i think i should have spent my last farthing in the hunt even if i had known that when i had run the mystery to earth it would not profit me at all i took a train that very evening and pottered about from station to station all night in the morning i got to penzance and kicked my heels on the wharf of the little dock there until nine oclock when the lyonnesse started for st marys three hours later i saw the islands hump themselves up from the sea and i stared and stared at them till a genial being standing beside me said i suppose you havent been home for a good many years by the way mrs warriner he suddenly broke off i have heard that natural sherry is a drink in some favour hereabouts i cant say that its a beverage i have ever hankered after before but what with the sun and the talk the thought of it is at the present moment most seductive what if we rang down the curtain for ten minutes and had an entracte eh would you mind and wilbraham rose from his seat no said miranda please finish what you have to say now wilbraham sighed resumed his seat and at the same time his story chapter viii explains the mystery of the tarifas cargo at st marys he continued i called at once upon the doctor ah said he liver i suppose permanently enlarged by excessive indulgence in alcohol said i i had once a very dear friend in the same case called ralph warriner here miranda interrupted with considerable indignation there is not a word of truth in that there is not wilbraham agreed pleasantly but i had to introduce the subject some way and my way was successful ralph warriner exclaimed the doctor and what was he dismissed the service for i winked very slowly with intense cunning i understand said the doctor with a leer though heaven only knows what he did understand i fancy he thought his reputation as a man of the world was at stake after that the conversation went on swimmingly i was more than ever convinced that the discovery on rosevear was a putup job if so old man fournier must have been aware of that wreck before he discovered it he must have landed on the island and shoved those papers into the dead mans pocket and someone must have sailed him out to the island i determined to lay myself out to discover who that someone was but i went no farther than the determination there was not indeed any need that i should for i sailed myself the next day to rosevear i hired the st agnes lugger and zebedee isaacs as he sat at the tiller gave me news of old man fournier old man fournier was a desperate coward on the sea yet he had put out to the bishop on a most unpleasing day it was old man fournier who insisted that they should run through the neck and examine rosevear and when zebedee isaacs declined the risk old man fournier flung himself in a passion on the tiller and nearly swamped the boat all very queer eh m fournier must have had some fairly strong motive to nerve him to that pitch of audacity and what that motive was i should discover when i discovered the nature of the tarifas cargo i thought perpetually about that cargo all the way to rosevear and after i had landed on that melancholy island the truth came upon me in a moment of inspiration the ground i remember gave way under my foot i had trodden on a seabirds nest and stumbled forward on my knees and with the shock of the stumble came the inspiration i remained on my knees with the gulls screaming overhead and the grey wastes of ocean moaning about the unkindly rocks and i knew the taxidermist from tangier the longish packingcases the square boxes ralph warriner and old man fournier were running guns and ammunition into morocco miranda could not repress an exclamation she had no doubt that wilbraham was right the theory fitted in with ralphs adventurous character m fournier no doubt made the arrangements and provided the capital ralph worked the cargo across from england to morocco and to make it safe for himself to venture upon english soil he had altered the rig of the tarifa in some unfrequented port and somehow arranged the deception concerning his death you think as i thought in rosevear said wilbraham looking shrewdly into her face i only wish you could participate in the delight i felt i had my fingers on the secret now and it was such a perfect profitable secret for quite apart from the other affair gunrunning in morocco is itself an offence against the law i fairly hugged myself ambrose said i never in all your puff have you struck anything like this fouch you shall trample under foot and sherlock holmes shall be your washpot you are the best in the world the faceless mariner was a fraud a freak from barnums here at last is eldorado and theres no fly anywhere upon the gilding thus mrs warriner i soliloquised and took the next boat back to penzance from penzance i travelled by train to plymouth from plymouth i sailed in an orient boat to gib and from gib i crossed to tangier where i had a few minutes conversation with one or two officers of the customhouse morocco as a social institution has many points of convenience which it is useful for men like warriner and myself to know heres a small case in point if you wish to smuggle forbidden goods into the country you hire the customhouse officials to unload your cargo for you at night somewhere on the beach thus you avoid much trouble all chance of detection and you secure skilled workmen i had no doubt that warriner had followed this course so i hired the customhouse officials to tell me the truth and out it came the tarifa had landed its cargo in the bay a mile and a half from tangier a couple of days before i arrived and m fournier had supervised the unloading and the captain of the tarifa was no longer the grizzled seadog mr thomas discipline but a gentleman of a slight figure blue eyes and fair hair that middleaged cherub in a word with whom you and i are both familiar and who now calls himself mr jeremy bentham when i had derived this information i walked into m fourniers shop and bought a stuffed jackal there was a tourist making purchases so i asked my question quietly as i leaned my elbows on the counter how did you work the situation on rosevear said i and hows my sweet friend ralph warriner the little frenchman turned white and sick he babbled expostulations and denials he demanded my name you gave him your card i hope interrupted miranda biting her lip wilbraham gazed at her with admiration well you have got some spirit i will say that for you mrs warriner i am not in need of testimonials said miranda what of m fournier he talked to me mysteries after that you were in tangier a month ago said he you shouted look out through the door you startled a friend of mine you are a coward would you believe it the little worm turned he flew into a violent passion i suppose it was in just such a passion that he flung himself on zebedee isaacs at scilly a plucky little man for all his cowardice he called me a number of ill names however i had got what i wanted i crossed back to gibraltar and here i am wilbraham crossed his legs and with a polite you will permit me lighted a cigarette i see said miranda with a contemptuous droop of her lips having failed to blackmail m fournier and my husband you fall back upon blackmailing a woman wilbrahams answer to the sneer was entirely unexpected even by miranda who was prepared for the unexpected in this man he showed no shame he did not try to laugh away the slur but removing his cigarette from his mouth he turned deliberately his full face to her and in a deliberate voice said i do not take the conventional view upon these matters and all other things being equal had i to choose between a man and a woman i should spare the man and strike the woman he spoke without any bitterness but in a hard calm voice as though he had sounded the question to the bottom miranda gasped the words for a second took her breath away and then the blood came warmly into her cheeks and her eyes softened and brightened and she smiled a sudden glory seemed to illuminate her face wilbraham wondered why he could not know that the brutal shock of his speech had sent her thoughts winging back to a balcony overlooking st jamess park where a man had held a torn glove in his hand and in a no less decided voice than wilbrahams had spoken quite other words i never intended to address either fournier or your husband upon the subject of shall we call it compensation at the best i should have got a lump sum now and again from them and as i say i have learnt my lesson if i had a lump sum it would be spent and i should again be penniless i apply to you because i propose a regular sum per annum paid quarterly in advance miranda was still uplifted by the contrast between her recollections and wilbrahams words she had the glove at home locked up an evidence that succour was very near a hundred miles only down the winding valley which faced her and she had not even to say a word in order to command it when she spoke again to wilbraham she spoke emboldened by this knowledge and what if i were to refuse you even a shilling for your dinner i should be compelled to lay my information before the proper authorities that ralph warriner is alive and may at times be captured in england would you be surprised to hear that mr warriner committed no crime for which he could be captured i should be surprised beyond words mr warriner sold the mechanism of the daventry gun to a foreign government are you so sure of that i was his agent you then you are also his accomplice true and i look forward to turning queens evidence miranda withdrew from the contest the discussion was hardly more than academic for she knew both that her husband was alive and that this particular crime he had committed what is your price she asked and she sat down upon the bench wilbraham did not immediately reply he took a pocketbook from his coat and a letter from the pocketbook i should wish you fully to understand the strength of my position he said this letter you will see is in your husbands handwriting this passage and he folded the letter to show miranda a line or two enjoins me to be very careful about the plans the gun is not mentioned by name but the date of the letter and the context leave no possible doubt he fluttered the letter under mirandas eyes and within reach of her fingers it is my one piece of evidence but a convincing piece he made a pretence of dropping it at her feet and snatched it up quickly then he replaced it in his pocketbook and shut up his pocketbook with a snap why didnt you snatch at it he exclaimed with irritation why did you wish me to snatch at it she replied because because he said angrily you have made me feel real mean as mean as a man in the commission of his first dishonourable act towards a woman and i wanted you to look mean at all events it would have made my business easier to handle well lets have done with it i know ralph warriner is alive i can give information which may lead to his capture and theres always the disgrace to publish he blurted out the words ashamed and indignant with her for the shame he felt miranda in spite of herself was touched by wilbrahams manner and she answered quite gently very well i will buy your silence coals of fire he replied with a sneer miranda understood that he was defying her to make him feel ashamed is that the ticket mrs warriner it wont lessen the amount of the per annum i can assure you what i propose is to live for the future in some more or less quiet hole where none of my acquaintances are likely to crop up tarifa occurred to me for one thing i can reach you from tarifa for another i can do the royal act at tarifa on a moderate income for a third it is a quiet place where i can have a shot at well at what i want to do and his voice suddenly became shy she looked at him and he coloured under her glance and he shifted in his seat and laughed awkwardly miranda was familiar with those signs and what they signified wilbraham wanted her to ask him to confide in her many men at gibraltar had brought their troubles to her in just this way with just these marks of diffidence this fear that the troubles would bore her she had been called upon to play the guardianangel at times and had not shrunk from the responsibility though she had accepted it with a saving modesty of humour at the notion of herself playing the guardianangel to any man what is it you want to do she asked and wilbraham confided in her the position was strange no doubt here was a woman whom he had bullied whom he meant to rob and on whom he meant to live until he died and he was confiding in her but the words tumbled from his lips and he did not think of the relationship in which he stood to her he was only aware that for fifteen years he had not shared a single one of his intimate thoughts with either man or woman and he was surcharged with them here was a woman frank reliable who asked for his confidence and he gave it with a schoolboys mixture of eagerness and timidity do you know said he the odes of horace have never been well translated into english verse by anyone some people have done an ode or two very well perhaps as well as it could be done hood for instance tried his hand at it but no one has done them all with any approach to success and yet they ought to be capable of translation perhaps they arent i dont know perhaps they are too wonderfully perfect probably i should make an awful hash of the job but i think i should like to have a shot i began years and years ago when i was an attach at paris and and i have always kept the book with me but one has had no time as he spoke he drew from his side pocket a little copy of horace in an old lightbrown cover of leather very much frayed and scratched look said he and half stretched it out to her as though doubtful whether he should put it into her hands or refuse to let her take it at all she held out her hand and he made up his mind and gave it into her keeping the copy was dated the rough black type in which all the ss looked like fs was margined by paper brown with age and sullied with the rims of tumblers and the stains of tobacco and this stained margin was everywhere written over with ink in a small fine hand you see i have made a sort of groundwork said wilbraham with a deprecating laugh as though he feared miranda would ridicule his efforts the writing consisted of tags of verse halflines here and there complete lines and sometimes though rarely a complete stanza you must not judge by what you see there he made haste to add all i have written on the margin is purely tentative probably its no good at all miranda turned over a page and came upon one ode completely translated i did that explained wilbraham one season when i shipped as a hand on a yarmouth smack we got bad weather on the dogger bank out in the north sea at christmas we spent a good deal of time hove to with the wheel lashed and on nightwatches i used to make up the verses indeed those nightwatches seem the only time i have had free during the last fifteen years the rest of the time well i have told you about it i got through one complete ode out in the north sea and did parts of others mrs warriner began to read the ode may i she asked of course said he with a flush of pleasure and he watched her most earnestly for the involuntary signs of approval or censure but her face betrayed neither the one nor the other and he was quick to apologise for the odes shortcomings you mustnt think that i had a great deal of time on those nightwatches for one thing we did not get overmuch sleep on the voyage and so ones brains no doubt were a trifle dull besides there were always seas combing up above the bows and roaring along the deck you had to keep your eyes open for them and scuttle down the companion before they came on board otherwise if the weight of the water took you it was a case of this way to the pit the whole hull of the smack disappears and you just see the foresail sticking up from the hungry lashing tumble of green water so you see it stands to reason that ode is subject to revision but miranda was not thinking of the ode she had a vision of the smack labouring on a black night in the trough of a black sea flecked with white at christmas time and a man on the watch who had been an attach at paris and was even with the rude sailorfolk for his companions engaged in translating horace and the vision had an exquisite pathos for her what was the beginning of it all she asked in a low voice and since wilbraham was in the train of confidences he told her that too he told her perhaps more than he meant to tell it was an old story the story of the faithless woman and the man who trusts her and what comes of it all the story of helen and menelaus but disfigured into a caricature of its original by the paltriness of the characters and the vulgarity of the incidents the throb of primitive passion was gone from the story and therefore all dignity too subtle and intricate trivialities of sentiment took the place of passion and made the episode infinitely mean menelaus was an attach at paris helen lived at knightsbridge and the pair of them were engaged to be married helen was faithless merely through a cheap vanity and a cheaper pose of wilfulness and even so she was faithless merely in a low and despicable way it was an infidelity of innumerable flirtations she passed from arm to arm without intermission and almost allowed those who fondled her to overlap yet all the day she talked of her pride and was conscious of no inconsistency between the vulgarity of her conduct and the high words upon her lips she practised all the small necessary deceits to conceal her various meetings and appointments and was unaware of the degradation they involved for still she talked loudly of her pride and when menelaus lifted his hat and wished her goodmorning she only felt that she was deeply aggrieved menelaus however was in no better case he had not the strength to thrust her from his mind but let his thoughts play sensuously with his recollections until he declined upon a greater and a greater weakness i went back to paris continued wilbraham i had good prospects but they came to nothing even now men going in for mods have to get up a book which i once wrote and as for the service if i were to tell you my real name it is just possible that you might have heard it for i was supposed to have done something quite decent at zanzibar well i went back to paris its a hard thing you know to discover that the woman you have been working for and in a way succeeding for isnt worth the nicotine at the bottom of your pipebowl at that time i reckon i would rather have been the wreck i am now and believed it was all my fault for you see i might then have imagined that if i had done all right i should have won the desirable woman anyway after i got back to paris a little while after there was trouble wilbraham examined his cane and drew diagrams upon the ground the woman blabbed in a moment of confidence to her husband there was a sort of a scandal i had to go i didnt blame the woman who blabbed no mrs warriner i blamed the first woman the woman in knightsbridge was i right i came back to england i was a second son and my father slammed the door in my face then mrs warriner i blamed all women you you you amongst the others even though i didnt know you he spoke in a gust of extraordinary violence and so brought his confidences to an end now your income is he resumed and fetched out his pocketbook again i made a note about your estate when i was doing business with warriner he said the note comes in usefully now he found the details of which he was in search and made a neat little sum at the corner of the leaf to which miranda paid no attention whatsoever the queer inclination towards pity which had moved her to ask for his confidence had been entirely and finally destroyed by the confidence she had asked for the story was so utterly sordid the characters in it so utterly puny before he told it he had acquired in her eyes even a sort of dignity the dignity of a man battered and defeated in a battle wherein his wits were unequally matched against the solid forces of order but in the telling he had destroyed that impression miranda had no feeling now but one of aversion for the wreck of a man at her side she looked at the horace which still lay open on her lap and the contrast between the fine scholars handwriting and the stains of the pothouse had no longer any power to touch her she set the book down on the bench and stood up wilbraham stopped his calculations and with the stump of his pencil in his mouth looked at her alertly and furtively she took a step or two towards the parapet of the alameda wilbraham instantly laid his pocketbook on the seat with the pencil to mark the place and without any noise stood up miranda reached the railings at the edge of the gardens and leaned her arms upon it the next moment she felt a firm grip upon her elbow she turned round and saw wilbrahams face ablaze with passion i suspected that he said fiercely when first i saw where you had brought me and he shook her elbow suspected what exclaimed miranda and she drew away to free herself from his grasp wilbrahams next movement answered her question for he slipped between her and the railings with a glance at the precipice below but you shall not do it he continued i was robbed that way once before ill take care the robbery is not repeated he leaned his back against the railings and shook his finger at her besides theres no sense in it and he jerked his head backwards to signify the abysm you are crying out before you are hurt you dont even know how much i want i shant ruin you i made a mistake that way once i had the best secret conceivable and ran my man down across two continents then i was fool enough to put my hand too deep in his sky and i suppose he thought well he blew his brains out that night and then was i robbed mrs warriner stared at him with a growing horror in her eyes you murdered him she said slowly we wont quarrel over words said wilbraham callously miranda walked back to the bench she was not troubled to explain wilbrahams misconception of her movement she was only anxious to be rid of him what income do you want she asked you have three thousand a year he returned of that i take it warriner takes a largish slice miranda flushed my husband has never asked for a farthing since the ten brothers slipped out of gibraltar he has never received a farthing she said angrily an imprudent remark said wilbraham i might feel inclined to raise my price at all events you shall not slander him wilbraham looked at her with his head cocked on one side you are very loyal said he with genuine admiration i will not raise my price miranda did not by any gesture or word acknowledge his compliment she stood over against him with a face just as hard and white as he had shown to her i say seven hundred a year he said briefly i will call for it myself every quarter i will send it to you she interrupted i prefer to call for it said he for so he concealed his own address and kept her within his reach you will not leave ronda even for a week without giving me due notice of your destination i will take a quarters payment today you draw on a bank in ronda i suppose so a cheque will serve if you will wait here i will bring you the cheque twenty minutes afterwards she returned with it to the alameda where she found wilbraham seated on the bench with his horace in his hand he put down the book awkwardly and rose he had the grace to feel some discomfort as he took the cheque and that discomfort his manner expressed miranda had no word no look for him he stood perhaps for the space of a minute fingering the cheque then he said suddenly i cant imagine what a woman like you sees in ralph warriner to trouble about in your place i should have let him go his own way without paying to keep him out of prison miranda kept her reasons to herself as she had done with the reason of her return to ronda she waited for him to go and he walked sullenly away for ten yards then he returned for he had left his copy of horace lying upon the bench he picked it up with a curious and almost timorous glance of appeal towards miranda she did not move but waited implacably for his departure wilbraham worked his shoulders in discomfort my clothes dont fit and god hates me he cried irritably then this jackinthebox of fortune slunk out of her sight chapter ix shows the use which a blind man may make of a dark night a week a week after wilbrahams departure from ronda the night fell very dark at tangier in the sk outside the city gate the solitary electric lamp from its tall mast threw a pale light over a circle of the trampled grass but outside the circle all was black there was no glimmer in the tents of the shoemakers at the upper corner of the sk nor was there any stir or noise for it was past midnight and the world was asleep except at one spot on the hillside above the sk and a little distance to the right there a small villa standing by itself shone gaudily in the heart of the blackness from its open windows a yellow flood of light streamed out and besides the light the music of a single violin and the rhythmical beat of feet there were other noises too such as the popping of corks and much laughter outside the villa and beyond the range of its light a man and a boy sat patient and silent the man for his sole clothing wore a sack but a dark cloak lay on the ground beside him with his hands he continually tested a cord twisted from palmetto fibres as though doubtful of its strength at length the door of the villa opened who comes out asked the man a man and a woman answered the boy describe the man to me big fat that is enough the man and the woman passed through the little garden of the villa and walked down across the sk towards the city gate the door opened again and again there was a continual sound of leavetaking in different languages mostly german and french and between the man and the boy the same dialogue was repeated and repeated some wore evening dress others did not some walked across the sk others rode they are all gone said the boy wait commanded the man they are putting out the lights are all the lights out no one light is burning wait the door opened again and two men in evening dress came out on to the steps there are two men said the boy but only one wears a hat describe him to me he is not tall he is thin but i cannot see his face for his hat look look well he goes back into the house he takes off his hat wait he is smoking he strikes a match and holds it to his mouth i can see him now well of what colour is his hair very fair yellow his face is round his eyes are light the man in the sack ceased from his questions but he gave no sign of either approval or disappointment he sat still in the darkness until a voice from the little garden cried out with a french accent i cannot think what has come to the beast he has got loose and he was hobbled jeremy you did hobble him hein the boy began to laugh the little fat christian is looking for the mule in the garden said he hush whispered the man laying his hand upon the boys mouth listen what does the other answer listen for his voice he does not answer returned the boy he leans against the door and smokes and waits while the little fat room searches for the mule help to find the mule the boy laughed again rose from the ground and disappeared into the darkness in a few minutes he returned driving the mule in front of him he drove it through the wicket of the garden a few words passed between the little frenchman and the boy then the boy came back to the man seated patiently outside the rim of the villas lights what did he say to thee said the man he asked me if i had stolen the hobbles and thou didst answer that i knew nothing of the hobbles i said that i had found the mule loose in the sk and seeing the lights brought it to the house it is well now go my son go home and sleep and forget the hours we have waited in the darkness outside the villa of the room forget so that in the morning they shall never have been go god will reward thee the boy turned upon his heel and ran down towards the town the man was left alone he remained squatting on the ground he heard the french voice exclaim goodnight jeremy but no answering voice returned the wish jeremy indeed contented himself with a careless nod of the head mounted his mule and passed out of the wicket gate jeremy passed within ten yards of the man seated upon the ground who heard the padding of the mules feet upon the grass and smelt the cigar he did not move however a road ran between this stretch of grass and the sk beyond and he waited until the mules hooves rang upon it then he picked up the dark cloak by his side and ran swiftly and noiselessly down the grass across the road over the trampled sk ahead of him he heard the leisurely amble of the mule stop he cried out in the moghrebbin dialect i have the hobbles of the most noble one he heard the mule stop and ran lightly forward who is it asked jeremy in the same tongue as he bent round in his saddle hassan akbar cried the other leaping at the point from which the voice came bentham it is hassan akbar the man addressed as bentham turned quickly in his saddle with a cry and gathered up the reins but he was too late even the cry was stifled upon his lips for hassan threw the cloak over his head gathered it in tight round his neck and still holding him by the neck dragged him out of the saddle and flung him on to the ground bentham halfthrottled halfstunned lay for a moment or two upon his back limp and unresisting when he came to himself it was no longer within his power to resist for hassan knelt straddled across his body pinning him to the ground with the weight of his stature one bony knee pressed upon his chest insufferably benthams ribs cracked under it he felt that his ribs were being driven into his lungs the other knee held down his thighs and while he lay there incapable of defence hassan bound his arms tightly together with the cord of palmetto fibres bentham tried to shout but the cloak was over his mouth the knee was grinding and boring into his chest and his shout was an exiguous wail which when it had penetrated the cloak was no more than a sigh he waited for the moment when the knee would be removed and waited motionless without a twitch of his muscles so that hassan might be deceived into the belief that he had swooned and remove his knee and the cloak hassan removed his knees bent down to bentham twined one arm about his legs thrust the other underneath his neck and lifted him from the ground as though he was a child bentham was now less able to shout than before for the hand of the arm which was about his neck pressed the cloak close upon his mouth bentham struggled for his breath hassans arms only tightened their grip and held him like a coil of wire an utter terror seized upon bentham he remembered the darkness of the night the lateness of the hour the silence of the sk and from the manner of hassans walk he knew that he was being carried up the hill and away from tangier he was helpless in the hands of a moor whom he had irreparably wronged death he knew he must expect the question which troubled him was what kind of death hassans foot struck against a rope drawn tight across his path and in bentham hope for a moment revived the rope was the stay of a tent no doubt what if hassan had lost his way and stumbled among the tents of the shoemakers but hassan loosened the grip of the arm which held his legs and bentham heard him fumbling with his hand for the doorflap of the tent plainly hassan had not missed his way hassan dropt him on the ground thrust him through the small opening and crawled in after him then he knelt beside bentham turned back the cloak from his face but tied it securely about his mouth bentham could now see and the flap of the tent was open the tent was indeed one of the low tiny gunnybag tents of the shoemakers but it was set far apart from that small cluster as bentham recognized in despair for through the aperture he could see a long way below him and a long way to his right the electric light in the middle of the sk outside the tent there was a sound of something moving bentham sat up and tore at his gag with his bound hands why cry for help to a mule said hassan calmly will a mule help thee he leaned forward and tightened the knot which fastened the cloak at the back of his head then he crawled out of the tent and bentham heard him tethering the mule to one of the tentpegs bentham was thus left alone he had a few seconds and he had at once to determine what use he would make of those seconds there was not enough time wherein to free his hands it would have been sheer waste of time to free his mouth from the cloak for none was within earshot of that tent who would be concerned to discover the reason of a cry and the cry would not be repeated since hassan outside the tent was still within arms reach instead he hitched and worked his white waistcoat upwards from the bottom leaning forward the while until his watch fell from the pocket and dangled on the end of the chain after his watch a metal pencilcase rolled out and dropped between his knees one of the two things he meant to do was done hassan had bound his hands not palm to palm but wrist across wrist and raising his hands he was able with the tips of his righthand fingers to feel in the lefthand breastpocket of his dresscoat his fingers touched a small pocketbook opened it and plucked out a leaf of paper this leaf and the pencilcase he secreted in the palm of his hand hassan crawled back into the tent and closed the flap bentham with his knees drawn up to his chin crouched back against the wall of the tent now that the flap was closed it was pitchdark that however made no difference to hassan akbar who lived in darkness and out of the darkness his voice spoke the ways of god are very wonderful you gave me this tent with the dollar you dropped on my knees at the gate of the cemetery i bought this tent and set it up here apart to keep you safe for the little time before you start upon your journey bentham took no comfort from the passionless voice though his heart leaped at the words he was not then to be killed he did not answer hassan but remained crouched in his corner now the dog of a christian will speak said hassan quietly bentham made no movement hassan crawled towards him felt his feet his updrawn knees and reaching his face untied the cloak from his mouth now the dog of a christian will speak he repeated softly in a low gentle voice so that i may know it is indeed bentham who took shelter with me at tangier and ate of my kousskouss and thereafter betrayed me bentham did not reply if hassan had a doubt then it was his part to make the most of it to prolong the solution of the doubt to defer it if it might be till the morning came this was summer july the morning comes early in july not so early as in june but still early would that this had happened one month back hassan kneeled upon his hams by benthams side will not the dog of a christian speak he asked in a wheedling voice which daunted and chilled the man he spoke to let us see and again his sinuous hands lingered and stole over benthams face the thumbs lingered about benthams eyes bentham shivered but still though the desire to shout to curse to relieve by some violence if only of speech the tension he was suffering was strong he mastered himself he held his tongue for if once he did speak he betrayed himself his only chance lay in hassans doubt which lived upon his silence again hassans fingers returned to his face bentham closed his eyes the thumbs touched and retouched them now pressing gently upon the eyeballs now working about the corners of the sockets finally hassan snatched his hands away if i did that he murmured they would not take him for he would fetch no price and bentham understood the fate which was in store for him if he spoke hassan left his side and was busy in a corner of the tent at what bentham could not for the moment discover he heard a cracking of twigs what was to follow one instant he dreaded the next he burned to know and all the while he shivered with terror hassan struck a match and lit the twigs and breathed upon the little blue flames until they warmed to yellow and spirted up into a fire bentham watched hassans gaunt disfigured inexpressive face as he crouched over the twigs and his terror increased he saw that he held something in each hand something that flashed bright like a disk of iron hassan laid the disks upon the twigs they were the hobbles which bentham had placed upon his mule early that evening bentham began to count the seconds at any moment the morning might begin to break surely surely as he watched the hobbles growing hot and the sparks dance upon the iron he continued to count the seconds not knowing what he did and at an incredible speed hassan picked up the hobbles each with a cleft stick and brought them over to bentham now the dog of a christian will speak said he bentham summoned all his courage all his strength and was silent hassan reached out his hands and drew his legs from under him and fitted the hobbles over his slippers and fixed them round his ankles like a pair of fetters bentham uttered a cry it was almost a scream as the iron burnt into his flesh he kicked he struggled to free his legs to free his hands but hassan akbar dragged him forward thrust him down upon his back and pinned his shoulders to the ground bentham could do no more than vainly writhe in convulsive movements of his limbs the hot iron rings clung to his ankles the smoke from the wood fire choked him the smell of burning flesh was acrid in his nostrils agony redoubled his strength but even so he was too crippled and hassans grasp upon his shoulders did not relax in the end hassan had his hearts desire and bentham spoke he spoke too in the low voice which hassan enjoined though he used it without thought to obey low voluble earnest prayers for mercy and then again voluble curses and again voluble appeals for pity and at the end of it a broken whimpering as though his strength was gone and the convulsive jerks which a fish makes in a basket all the while hassan held him down listening to the appeals the prayers the curses with an untouched gravity of face it is indeed you i have made no mistake and he freed him from the burning fetters and opened the flap of the tent bentham rolled over on his side with his face to the opening and lay there shaking moaning now i will tell you what i have planned for you continued hassan i thought at first to kill you but it is so small a thing then i remembered words you once told me that you had trouble with your own people and could not ask them for protection so friends of mine from beni hassan who go upon their way tonight will take you with them and sell you when they are far away and for the rest of your days you will carry loads upon your back up and down the inlands of morocco and your masters will beat you and if you faint and are tired they will do strange things to make you suffer even as i did with the hobbles lo here my friends come the sound of steps came to their ears a few moments later a hand fumbled at the flap of the tent opened it and a head was thrust in is it you hassan akbar yes replied hassan and here is the room whom you promised to take out of my path he will fetch a price and besides i give to you his mule which you will find tethered to the tent and the saddle too hassan is it not so it is meanwhile hassan cut benthams clothes from him as he lay upon the ground and taking off his own sack cast it for a garment over benthams shoulders and wrapped himself in the dark cloak in the place of that cloak he tied over benthams mouth a thick rag then he thrust him out of the tent and jerked him on to his feet bentham made no longer any resistance he let them do with him as they were pleased and he stood tottering and swaying five arabs waited outside the tent he cannot walk he shall ride the mule this night said the chief of them tomorrow he shall learn to walk they hoisted bentham on to the back of the mule and tied him there with leathern thongs then they started on their long journey the cool night air after the stifling tent revived the man who perforce rode the mule it did not give him strength to resist or as yet even the impulse to cry out but it restored to him the power to hear and to understand what he heard was a distant clock below him in tangier striking an hour what he understood was that the hour it struck was only one oclock chapter x m fournier expounds the advantages which each sex has over the other the long interview with wilbraham in the alameda of ronda had consequences for miranda which she felt but did not trace to their source it was not merely that she sickened at the vulgar futile story of his ruin that she saw in imagination the wretched victim he had run to earth across two continents closing the door and slipping the pistolbarrel between his teeth that she loathed the knowledge that this man was henceforward her gaoler but she took him and the bitter years of her marriage together in her thoughts and using them as premisses began doubtfully to draw universal conclusions these conclusions miranda hazarded at times in the form of questions to her companion jane holt and sought answers from her as from one who had great experience of the tortuous conduct of men were men trustworthy at all if so were there any means by which a woman could test their trustworthiness these two questions were the most constant upon mirandas tongue and jane holt answered them with assurance and in her own way wilbraham had not erred when he described her as a sentimentalist with grievances sentimentalism was the shallows of her nature and she had no depths her conversation ran continually upon the big things as she termed them such as devotion endurance selfsacrifice and the rest in which qualities men were singularly deficient she meant however only devotion to her endurance of her selfsacrifice for her of which it was not unnatural that men should tire seeing who it was that demanded them yet she had enjoyed her share and more than her share for though incapable of passion herself she had in her youth possessed the trick of inspiring it but without the power perhaps through her own incapacity of keeping it alive and no doubt too because upon a moderate acquaintance she conveyed an impression of inherent falsity for being a sentimentalist she lived in a false world on the borders of a lie never quite telling it perhaps and certainly never quite not telling it she was by nature exigent for she was in her own eyes the pivot of her little world and for the wider world beyond she had no eyes whatever and her exigence took amusing or irritating shapes according to the point of view of those who suffered it for instance you must never praise her costumes of which she had many and those worthy of praise but the high qualities of her mind which were few and often of no taste whatever it should be added that she had always favoured an inferior before an equal for it pleased her above all things to condescend since she secured thus a double flattery in the knowledge of her own condescension and in the grateful humility of those to whom she condescended it can be foreseen then what answers this woman who was tall and still retained the elegance of her figure and would have still retained the good looks of her face but that it was written upon by many grievances would give to mirandas questions you can trust no men you must bribe them with cajoleries you must play the coquette you must enlist their vanity they are all trivial and the big things do not appeal to them miranda listened she was accustomed to jane holt and had no longer a reasoned conception of her character habit had dulled her impressions she remembered only that jane holt had had much experience of men wherein she herself was wofully deficient jane holt embroidered her theme a pretty display of petulance the seemingly accidental disclosure of an ankle a voluntary involuntary pressure of the arm these things had power to persuade the male mind such as it is and to enmesh that worthless thing the male heart one might have a man for a friend perhaps suggested miranda hopefully my poor miranda exclaimed miss holt no wonder your marriage was a failure men pretend friendship for a woman at times but they mean something else the moral was always that they were not to be trusted and miranda vividly recollecting ralph warriner and wilbraham listened and wondered listened and wondered until she would rise of a sudden and take refuge in her own parlour of which the window looked out across the valley to the hills where she would sit with a throbbing forehead pressed upon her palms certain certain that the homily was not true and yet half distracted lest it should be true on the morrow of one such conversation and one such flight miss holt came into the little parlour a cool darkpanelled lowroofed room of which the door gave on to the patio and found miranda searching the room do you know what month this is miss holt asked severely october quite so and great emphasis was laid upon the words i know replied miranda penitently as she crossed over to a table and lifted the books we have been here all the summer it has been very hot i am sorry but i was compelled to stay i did not know what might occur and she anxiously turned over the letters and papers on her writingtable in the window it was some comfort i admit to feel that one was near she stopped suddenly and resumed in confusion i mean i did not know what might happen jane holt looked at her with great displeasure but said nothing until miranda began hurriedly to open and shut the drawers of her writingtable then she said irritably what in the world are you looking for miranda stood up and looked round the room there was a glove she said absently yes i threw it away threw it away miranda stared at jane holt with a look of complete dismay you dont mean that oh you cant mean it indeed i do it was torn across the palm i left it lying there on my writingdesk yesterday after you and i had been talking she left the sentence unfinished yes and i found it there it was torn so i had it thrown away miranda rang a handbell and ordered search to be made for the glove it could not be found it had been burnt with the answered letters very well said miranda and the servant retired miranda sat down and showed to jane holt a face of which the expression was almost scared what does it matter exclaimed jane the glove was torn you could never have used it no answered miranda quickly almost guiltily it seemed i should never have used it i never meant to use it the glove was only a symbol it was no more than that it represented a belief i can retain the belief no doubt no doubt though i have lost the glove what in the world are you talking about interrupted jane holt nothing nothing answered miranda with a start the loss of the glove had so dismayed her that she had forgotten who it was she had been speaking to or indeed that she was speaking to anyone she had merely uttered her thoughts for she had come to look upon that glove which under no circumstances would she use as none the less a safeguard and of late in particular she had fallen into a habit of taking it from the drawer in which it rested and setting it before her eyes of stating it as it were as a refutation of jane holts ready opinions jane holt shook her head you have changed very much towards me miranda you are growing secret i dont want to know i would not press anyone for their confidence but i may think it strange i suppose she folded her arms across her breast and tapped with her fingers upon her elbows i suppose i may think it strange and if anyone took the trouble to give me a thought perhaps anyone might believe that i had a right to feel hurt but i dont please dont run away with that idea no i cannot allow you miranda to fancy for a moment that i should feel hurt but i do notice that you jump whenever there is a knock at the door there what did i say the door of the parlour stood open to the patio in the corner of the opposite side of the patio there was the mouth of a passage which led to the outer door and upon that outer door just at this moment someone rapped heavily as though he came in haste miranda started nervously and to cover the movement rose from her chair and closed the door and as for the glove resumed jane holt who found it difficult to leave any subject alone when it was evident that it was unwelcome you could never have used it no answered miranda thoughtfully of course of course i could never have used it and a servant entered the room and handed to her a card on which was engraved m fourniers name and address miranda held the card beneath her eyes for some little while then she walked out into the patio where m fournier awaited her he came towards her at once in an extreme agitation but she signed to him to be silent and opening a second door on the same side of the patio as the door of her parlour but farther to the right she led the way into a tiny garden rich with deep colours jonquils camellias roses wild geraniums and pinks tended with a care which bespoke a mistress from another country made a gay blaze in the sun and sweetened the air with their delicate perfumes the garden was an irregular nook with something or the shape of a triangle enclosed between the back wall of the house and a wing flung out at a right angle the base of the triangle was an old brick wall breasthigh which began at the end of the house wall and curved outwards until it reached the wing over this wall the eye looked through air to the oliveplanted slope of a mountain for the house was built on the brink of the precipice it was in a line with the alameda though divided from it by the great chasm and if one leaned over the crumbling wall built long ago by the moors one had an impression that one ought to see the waves churning at the foot of the rock and to hear a faint moaning of the sea so that the sight of the level carpet of the plain continually surprised the eyes into this garden miranda brought m fournier no windows overlooked it for those which gave light to mirandas parlour were in the end and the other side of the wing and so commanded the valley without commanding this enclosure a little flagged causeway opened a path between the flowers to the nook between the wing of the house and the old wall where two lounge chairs invited use miranda seated herself in one of these chairs and with a gesture offered the other to m fournier m fournier however took no heed of the invitation he had eyes only for mirandas face he held his hat in one hand and with a coloured handkerchief continually mopped his forehead a dusty perspiring image of anxiety you come from my husband said miranda m fourniers face lightened ah then you know that he is alive yes you come from him from him no on his behalf yes miranda smiled at the subtle distinction you need money of course she said drily how much do you want you have no doubt some authority from my husband the little belgians anxiety gave place to offended pride we do not need money neither he nor i but as for authority perhaps this will serve he drew from his pocket a soiled scrap of paper and handed it to miranda the paper as she could see from the blue lines the shape and the jagged border had been torn from a small pocketbook it was so crumpled and soiled that a few words scribbled with a pencil on the outside in arabic were barely visible miranda unfolded the paper slowly for the mere look of it was sinister the words within were written also in pencil and her face altered as she read them what does j b mean she asked j b are the initials of the name he took you are sure this comes from my husband i do not recognise his hand quite sure here is bad news said she and she conned the words over again and could nowhere pick out the familiar characteristics of ralph warriners handwriting the words themselves were startling reward the bearer well and for gods sake do quickly what you can but more startling more significant than the words was the agitation of the writers hand haste and terror had kept the hand wavering here the pencil had paused yet even when pausing its point had trembled on the paper as the blurred dots showed miranda imagined that so it had paused and trembled while someone walked by the writers back and had but to glance over his shoulder to discover the business he was engaged upon then again the pencil had raced on running the words one into the other fevered to get the message done a whole tragedy was indicated in the formation of the letters or a malady miranda turned eagerly to the letter the writing wavered up and down the small letters were clear the capitals and the long letters the fs the qs the ys weak as though the fingers could not control the pencil illness might account for the message and miranda chose that supposition he is lying very ill somewhere she said m fournier shook his head no i tried to believe that myself at first but i never did believe it and i thought and thought and thought tenez look he drew a piece of blank paper from one pocket a pencil from another the paper he spread upon his knee the pencil he took between his teeth then he held out his wrists now fasten them together miranda uttered a cry her face grew very white what with she asked your belt she unclasped her belt from her waist and strapped fourniers wrists together tighter said he tighter now see with great difficulty and labour he copied out warriners message on the blank paper and while he wrote miranda saw the sentence wavering up and down the small letters coming out clear and small the long strokes and tails straggling she seized the copy almost before he had finished and held it side by side with the original there was a difference of course the difference which stamped one mans hand as warriners and the other as fourniers the difference of fear but that was the only difference the method in each case was identical the same difficulties had produced the same results there can be no doubt hein asked fournier as miranda unfastened the belt how did this come to you she returned i tell you said he from the beginning bentham that is what m warriner calls himself now bentham jeremy bentham he calls himself because he says hes such an economist well he and i are partners in a little business and we have prospered so when bentham came back from bemin sooar to tangier a week ago i give a dinner in my house to a few friends and we dance afterwards perhaps ten or eleven of us and bentham bentham he came and danced and he was the last to go away he did not stay in my house it was better for our little business that we should not be thought more than mere friends he had a lodging in the town while my house was outside up the hill he rode away alone on a mule for he was in evening dress and one cannot walk across the sk in dancing shoes and he never reached his lodging he disappeared i heard no word of him until yesterday yesterday about midday an arab brought that scrap of paper to my shop but the arab told you how and where he got it said miranda yes he belonged to a douar a tent village you understand the village is three days from tangier on the road to mequinez the arab was leading down his goats to the water a week ago in the morning when six men passed him at a distance they were going up into the country they had a mule with them he watched them pass and noticed that one of them would now and then loiter and fall a little behind whereupon the rest beat him with sticks and drove him again in front and he did not resist madame i am afraid we know why he did not resist miranda pressed her hands to her forehead well she said with an effort and her voice had sunk to a whisper finish finish it seemed to the arab continued fournier whose anxiety seemed in some measure to diminish and whose face grew hopeful as he watched mirandas increasing distress that this victim made a sign to him and when the party had gone by he noticed something white gleaming on the brown soil in the line of their march he went forward and picked it up it was this piece of paper he read the writing on it these marks m fournier turned over the sheet and pointed to the indecipherable arabic they mean take this to fournier at tangier and you will get money he opened it he could not read the inside but seeing that it was written in one of the languages of the nazarenes he thought there might be some truth in the promise so he brought the paper to tangier yesterday and i have brought it to you m fournier settled his glasses upon his nose and leaned forward for his answer miranda sat with knitted brows gazing out to the dark mountains fournier would not interrupt her he fancied she was searching her wits for a device to bring help to warriner but indeed she was not thinking at all miranda had a trick of seeing pictures she was not given to arguments and inferences but a word a sentence would strike upon her hearing and at once a curtain was rolled up somewhere in her mind and she saw men moving to and fro and things happening as upon a lighted stage such pictures made up her arguments her conclusions even her motives and it was because of their instant vividness that she was so rapidly moved to sympathy and dislike so now there was set before her eyes the picture of a man riding down the hill of tangier at night in the civilisation of evening dress and as she looked it melted into another in which the same man clad in vile rags with his hands bound was flogged forwards under a burning sun into the barbaric inlands of morocco she saw that brutal party the five gaolers the one captive straggle past the tent village she guessed at ralphs despairing glance as though it was directed towards herself she saw the scrap of paper flutter white upon the dark soil and as she contemplated this vision she heard m fournier speaking again to her but the sound of his voice had changed he was no longer telling his story he was pleading with a tenderness which had something grotesquely pathetic when she considered who it was for whom he pleaded his foreign accent became more pronounced and the voluble words tumbled one over the other so m warriner does not ask you for money that sees itself is it not nor even does he ask you for help be sure of that madame read the note again he would not come to you for help he is not so mean he has too much pride and as mrs warriner smiled with perhaps a little bitterness m fournier noticing her smile became yet more astonishing and intricate in his apologies he take your money oh yes i know very well while he is with you but then you get his company in exchange that make you both quits eh but once he has gone away he would not come back to you for money or help at all he has so much pride oh no he just take it from the first person he meet me or anyone else he has so much pride besides it would be simpler no it is i who come to you he often speak to me of you oh but in the highest terms and i say to myself that dear ralph he is difficult to live with he is not a comfortable friend we know that mrs warriner and i but we both love him very much no the emphatic interruption fairly startled m fournier miranda had risen from her seat and stood over him he would not have believed that so gentle a face could have taken on so vigorous an expression he stammered a protest miranda repeated her denial no no no she cried let us be frank she turned aside from him and leaning her elbows upon the crumbling parapet of the wall looked across the valley and down the cliffs side where one road was cut in steep zigzags and winding down to the plain as to the waters edge helped to complete the illusion that the sea should fitly be breaking at the base m fourniers hopes dwindled in the face of this uncompromising denial he had come to enlist her help he had counted upon her affections and had boldly counted because warriner had so surely attracted his own m fournier would have been at a loss to explain his friendship for warriner to account for the causes or the qualities which evoked it but he felt its strength and he now knew that mrs warriner had no lot or share in it he was therefore the more surprised when she turned back to him with eyes which were shining and moist and said very gently but of course i will help her conduct was not at all inconsistent however much it might appear so to m fournier she was acting upon the same motive which had induced her the moment she was aware of ralph warriners existence to return to ronda the one spot where warriner would be sure to look for her if he needed her and which had subsequently persuaded her to submit to the blackmail of major wilbraham of course i will help what can i do m fourniers eyes narrowed his manner became wary and cunning i hoped that you might perhaps hit upon some plan he suggested i miranda thought for a moment then she said we must appeal to the english minister at tangier m fournier sprang out of his chair no that is the very last thing we must do for what should we say that mr ralph warriner who was thought to be dead has just been kidnapped in morocco no but that mr bentham has she returned quickly m fournier shrugged his shoulders why am i here he exclaimed stamping his foot i ask you why am i here saperlipopette would i have come to you if any so simple remedy had been possible suppose we go politely to the english minister and ask him to find mr jeremy bentham the minister goes to the sultan of morocco and after many months perhaps mr bentham is found perhaps he is not suppose that he is found and brought down to tangier what next i beg you there will be talk about mr bentham there will be gentlemen everywhere behind bushes under tables everywhere so that the great british public may know the colours of the ties he wears and at last be happy his name will be in the papers and more mrs warriner his portrait too his portrait have you thought of that but he might escape the photographers suppose he do by a miracle do you think there will be no inquiry as to what is mr benthams business in morocco do you think the english minister will not ask the inconvenient question do you think that you can hide his business once an inquiry is set on foot in that country he might pass as a tourist you think perhaps hein and any one man has only got to give a few dollars to some officer in the customhouse and he will know that mr bentham is smuggling guns into morocco and selling them to the berbers of bemin sooar what then he would be taken for trial to gibraltar where only two years ago he was captain warriner miranda had already heard enough from wilbraham to confirm m fourniers statement about the customhouse no continued fournier the risk is too great and i call it risk he hunched his shoulders and spread out his hand it is a redhot cert as he would say his identity would be established and he had better after all be a captive in morocco than a convict in england there is some chance of an escape in morocco there is also in morocco some chance of a mirandas lips refused to speak the word m fournier supplied it murder i do not fear that had they intended murder they would have killed that night then and there in the sk of tangier there would have been no letter dropped three days inland miranda eagerly welcomed the argument yes yes she exclaimed and the colour came back to her lips he is held for ransom then surely m fournier shook his head hardly had they captured him for ransom they would have got from him the names of his friends they would have used measures said he with some emphasis upon the word at which miranda shivered sure measures to get the names and warriner would have given mine they would have come to me for the ransom and i should have given it if it was everything i had and warriner would be safe by now fournier was aware that miranda looked curiously and even with a sort of compunction towards him though he did not understand the reason of her look to him it was the most natural simple thing in the world that he should care for warriner no it is not ransom and he threw a cautious glance this way and that and then even in that secret spot continued in a whisper warriner has enemies enemies of his own race i do not wonder at it he explained impartially he treats me yes even me who am his one friend as though well his own phrase is the best he wipes the floor with me he has promised to do it many times and many times he has done it too no doubt he has enemies and they have arranged his capture why suppose they sell him for a slave a long way off and a long way inland it would not be pleasant at all and most of all unpleasant to him for he is particular of course you know that mrs warriner he likes his linen very clean and fine he would not enjoy being a slave yet he could not appeal to his government even if he got the chance oh dont please cried miranda that intimate detail about ralphs habits brought home to her most convincingly his present plight but what enemies she asked in a moment or two is it a guess of yours or do you know of any m fournier hitched his chair nearer his voice became yet more confidential three months ago an englishman came to my shop three months ago interrupted miranda he leaned over your counter and he said how did you work that little affair on rosevear and hows my dear friend ralph warriner ah you know him cried fournier springing up in excitement yes and he has nothing to do with ralphs capture replied miranda he only went that one time to tangier m fournier resumed his seat and she briefly explained to the belgian the reason and the consequence of wilbrahams visit fourniers face fell as he listened he had hoped that the necessary clue had been discovered and when miranda finished he sat silent in a glum despair after a little his face lightened only once you say he came to tangier this man you speak of only once he asked eagerly stretching out his hand only the once he was not there earlier in the year he was not there in may think carefully be very sure mrs warriner reflected for a second i am sure he was not she replied he travelled by train from monte carlo to marseilles in may from marseilles he came directly by boat to england good said m fournier he sat forward in his chair and rubbed the palms of his hands together now listen there was another englishman who came in may he came to my shop though the shutter was on the window and the shop closed who was he asked mrs warriner i cannot guess tell me what he was like ah theres the trouble neither of us saw him warriner heard his voice that is all and a voice there is no clue more deceptive the one thing warriner is sure of is that he had never heard the voice before but what was it that he heard i tell you warriner came down to tangier that very morning from the country he travelled as always in the dress of a moor for he speaks their tongues no moor better and our little business you understand needs secrecy i closed my shop shuttered the window locked the door warriner told me he had arranged with the sheikhs of the berber tribes to deliver so many winchesters so much ammunition within a certain period the period was short warriners boat the ten brothers was waiting at tarifa i leave him to change his dress and shave his beard while i go down to the harbour and hire a felucca to put him over to tarifa but warriner forgot to lock the door behind me in a minute or two he hear a hand scrape softly oh so softly up the door towards the latch for a second he stood with the razor in his hand like this and the belgian in the absorption of his narrative began to act the scene looking at the latch waiting for it to rise and listening then he remembered that he had not locked the door he crept on tiptoe towards it just as he reached it he heard a loud english voice shout to him violently look out that phrase is a menace eh he stopped to ask it might be it would more naturally be a warning said mrs warriner in either case it means an enemy as he shouted warriners hand was already on the key warriner turn the lock and immediately the englishman batter and knock at the door but he could not get in and after a little he went away ah how often we have wondered who that man was and why he shouted out his threat and tried to force the door to know that you have one enemy at your heels but you cannot pick him out because you have not seen his face that frightens me madame warriner i am a coward and it is no wonder that it frightens me the perspiration broke out on fourniers forehead as he made his frank confession but it frightens warriner too who is no coward often and often have i seen him lift up a finger so he suited the action to the word when a new voice speak within his hearing and listen listen listen to make sure whether that was the voice which shouted through the door or no but a voice you cannot be certain you recognise it unless you can recognise also the face of the man to whom it belongs a singers voice yes perhaps you might know that again though you heard it for the first time blindfold but a voice that merely speaks or shouts no m fournier picked up his hat and rose from his chair miranda rose too and they stood face to face with one another under the awning so i ask you this will you help to recover your husband he asked with a simplicity of appeal which went home to miranda all the more because it did not presume to claim her help either a search must be made privately through morocco until he is found and bought and such a search seems hopeless or the unknown man who shouted through the door must be discovered that is the simplest way for this i do believe and he expressed his belief with a great solemnity and conviction which sank very memorably into mirandas mind i believe that if we lay our hands upon that man we shall lay our hands also upon the means to rescue warriner from his servitude but how can i help i do not know the man who shouted through the door the words were flung at fournier in a passion of impotence you say you need no money i cannot scour morocco how can a woman help m fournier hesitated he took off his glasses he found it easier to speak the matter of his thoughts when he saw her face dimly and could not take note of its expressions a woman very often has friends he hinted he saw her face grow rosy and then pale yes but i have lost the glove she cried impulsively and as she turned towards the perplexed m fournier the blood rushed back into her cheeks i mean she stammered and broke off suddenly into a question which was at once an accusation and a challenge and men have they no friends fournier did not affect to misunderstand her here and there perhaps a man has one friend who will deliberately risk much even life for him but in those cases he has only one such friend warriner has one but alas that one friend is myself already it is true i have risked my life for him at the scillies and i would gladly lose it for him now if i could only lose it without foreknowledge but what can i do a little fat belgian bourgeois of middle age who speaks no language correctly but his own and has only a few poor words of arabic a man of no strength and madame a coward what could i do inland in morocco he made no parade of humility as he described himself he used the simple straightforward tone of one who advances cogent arguments miranda was moved by an impulse to hold out her hand to him i beg your pardon she said m fournier was encouraged to continue his plea but to possess sufficient friends so that one may choose the adequate instrument ah that is the privilege of women he added timidly of women who have youth and beauty but in a voice so low that the words hardly reached mirandas ears and their significance was not understood by her at all i have not many friends she returned frankly but i have one who would be adequate i cannot tell whether i can bring myself to i mean i cannot tell whether he could go he has duties it is asking much to ask any man to set out into morocco on such an errand however i must think of it i could at all events send for him and tell him of my husband m fournier interposed quickly he knows nothing of ralph warriner he believes my husband dead then why should he not continue to believe your husband dead asked fournier with a sly cunning it is mr jeremy bentham he goes out to find a friend of yours a relation perhaps is it not so we can keep ralph warriner dead for a while longer the little mans intention was becoming obvious why asked miranda sharply it would be more prudent i dont understand her voice was cold and dangerous a man has one friend a woman many explained m fournier but there are compensations for the man in that his friend will serve him for friendships sake but a man will not serve a woman for friendships sake not if he serve her well m fournier was prepared for an outburst of indignation he was not prepared for the expression which came over mirandas face and he could not understand it she looked at him fixedly and as it seemed in consternation that is not true she said it is not true surely surely it cannot be true m fournier made no answer she turned away from him and walked along the flagged pathway turned at the end and came slowly back a man will only serve a woman if he cares for her m fournier bowed and men can be made to care m fournier smiled but it needs time m fournier shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands and it needs tricks m fournier made a pun nature madame has put the tricks in your hand miranda nodded her head once or twice and made a remark which m fournier was at a loss to apply the old question said she and the old answer and at once an irrational anger flamed up within her anger with m fournier for posing the question again anger with herself for her perplexity anger even against charnock because he did not magically appear in the garden and answer the question and dissolve her perplexity but m fournier alone was in the garden with her and the full force of her anger broke upon him i am to throw out my net she cried and catch my friend i am to trick him to lie to him and to earn with the lie the use of his life and his brains and his time and his manhood how dare you come to me with such a thought a cowards thought indeed the thought of a man who loves his friend said m fournier stubbornly and he continued without any sarcasm your sentiments madame warriner are most correct they do you honour but i love my friend to his surprise miranda suddenly smiled at him and then laughed i was never treated with such absolute disregard in all my life she said no dont apologise i like you for it then you will do as i propose he exclaimed miranda grew serious i cannot if i ask my friend to go upon this errand he must know before he goes who it is i ask him to bring back i must think what can be done you will go back to tangier perhaps you may find ralph there when you return i will write to you at tangier m fournier had plainly no opinion of her plan but he saw that he could not dissuade her he took the hand which she held out to him and returned sorrowfully through the patio to the street chapter xi in which miranda adopts a new line of conduct and the major expresses some discontent miranda was left with two convictions of which she was very certain somehow somewhither help must be sent to ralph and if charnock carried the help he must know why and for whom before he went she stood in the patio until the outer door closed behind m fournier a local newspaper lying upon a wicker chair caught her eye and harassed and unresolved as she was she turned eagerly for rest to its commonplaces she read an anecdote about an unknown politician and a summary of don carloss prospects with extreme care and concentration for she knew that her perplexities lay in wait for her behind the screen of the news sheet and she was very tired she turned over the sheet and in spite of herself began to feel at a third idea she applied herself consequently to the first paragraph which met her eye and read it over with great speed perhaps ten times but the words she read were not the printed words they were these send me the glove and when i come up to ronda it will be understood without a word why i have come there will be no need for me to speak at all and you will only have to tell me the particular thing that wants doing and the idea became distinct she could choose her own time for telling charnock the particular thing which wanted doing he would ask no questions he had indeed hit upon that device of the glove to spare her she could send the glove and she could tell him after he had come in answer but at her own discretion why she had sent it therefore she had time she had time she turned to her paragraph again read it with comprehension and from the paragraph her trouble sprang at her and caught her by the heart for what she read was the account of the opening of the branch line to algeciras charnocks work was done then he would be leaving algeciras even at that moment her first feeling was one of approaching loneliness so closely had the man crept into her thoughts she took a step towards her parlour stopped stood for a moment irresolute ran up the winding iron staircase to the landing halfway up the patio and fetched a new long white kid glove from her dressingroom she moulded it upon her hand soiled it by a ten minutes wearing ripped it across the palm and sealed it up in an envelope jane holt came into the patio while miranda was still writing the address whats that she asked a sham jane a sham said miranda in a queer unsteady voice a trick the first of them jane holt shook her head you are very strange miranda but miranda picked up the envelope and putting on her hat hurried to the postoffice as she crossed the bridge over the tajo a man barred her way she tried to pass him he moved again in front of her and she saw that the man was wilbraham i wish to speak to you in ten minutes said she in the alameda i have a letter to post the letter can wait said he if it did it would never be posted said she and she hurried past him the major followed her with inquisitive eyes he felt a certain admiration for her buoyant walk her tall slight figure which a white muslin dress with a touch of colour at the waist so well set off and for the pose of her head under the wide straw hat but business instincts prevailed over his admiration he lit a cigarette what is the large sealed letter which must be posted at once or it will never be posted at all he asked himself why must it be posted at once he strolled to the alameda unable to find an answer in the alameda at the bench before the railings miranda was waiting for him she rose at once to meet him why have you come she asked it is not quarterday we made our bargain i have kept my part of it yes said he but it was not a good bargain for me i underrated my necessities i overrated my taste for a quiet life and the horace she asked scornfully one of the few things worth doing was it not wilbraham flushed angrily so it is he said but i find it difficult to settle down i need in fact do we not all need them intervals of relaxation he spoke uneasily he looked even more worn and tired than when he first came to ronda miranda understood that here indeed was the real tragedy of the mans life all these years fifteen years she said you have dreamed of doing sooner or later this one thing you have played with the dream you have kept your selfrespect by means of it it has set you apart from your companions and now when the opportunity comes you find that you were only after all on the level of your companions lower perhaps a trifle lower by this trifle of delusion for you cannot do the work wilbraham did not resent the speech which was uttered without reproach or accusation but in the tone of one who notes a fact which should have been foreseen a topping fellow horace of course wilbraham began and i trusted you to do it she said suddenly and looked at him for a moment full in the face not angrily but with a queer sort of interest in the mistake she had made then she turned from him and walked away the major followed quickly but before he could come up with her she turned round on him follow me for one other step she said and i call that guardia twenty yards away she meant to do it too this was unmistakable she resumed her walk and the major thought it prudent to remain where he was he remained in fact for some time on that spot whistling softly to himself wilbrahams menaces had sunk to a complete insignificance in mirandas mind since she had been confronted with the actual positive disaster which had befallen ralph warriner wilbraham however was not in a position to trace mirandas sudden audacity to its true source he fell therefore and not unnaturally into the error of imagining that she drew her courage to refuse his demands from some new and external support his thoughts went back to the letter which must be posted at once had that letter anything to do with that support had it anything to do with her refusal wilbraham asked himself these questions with considerable uneasiness for after all the seven hundred per annum was not so absolutely assured he came to the conclusion that it would be wise to transfer his quarters from tarifa to ronda chapter xii the hero like all heroes finds himself in a fog at eight oclock the next morning charnock was crushing the remainder of his clothes into a portmanteau a couple of corded trunks stood ready for the porters while the manager of the line sat in the window overlooking algeciras bay and gave him gratuitous advice as to totally different and very superior methods of packing the manager suddenly rose to his feet heres the p and o coming into the bay he said man but you have very little time im thinking youll miss it charnock raised a flushed face from his portmanteau and so wasted a few seconds he made no effort to catch them up im thinking too you would not be very sorry to miss it continued the manager sagely though what charms you can discover in algeciras its beyond my powers to comprehend charnock did not controvert or explain the managers supposition he continued to pack but perhaps a trifle more slowly than before you have got my address macdonald he said you wont lose it will you he shut up the portmanteau and knelt upon it you will forward everything that comes everything without fail he insisted in all human probability returned macdonald i will forward nothing at all for i am thinking you will lose the boat there was a knock on the door charnocks servant brought in a letter the letter lay upon its face and the sealed back of the envelope had an official look open it will you macdonald said charnock as he fastened the straps well whats it about i cannot tell its written in a dialect i do not understand said the manager gravely and charnock turning about saw that he dangled and deliberated upon a long white kid glove charnock jumped up and snatched it away its a females said the manager sagely its a womans returned charnock with indignation you are very young observed macdonald and ill point out to you that you have torn your letter charnock was turning the glove over and showed the palm at that moment he smiled but made no answer he folded the glove wrapped it in its envelope took it out again and smoothed its creases then he folded it once more held it for a little balanced on his hand and finally replaced it in the envelope and hid the envelope in his pocket man but you are very young remarked macdonald and im thinking that youll lose theres a train to ronda pretty soon interrupted charnock there is replied macdonald drily and ill be particular to mind your address and forward everything that comes eh but you have paid your passage on the p and o charnock in spite of that argument took his seat in the train for ronda and travelled up through the forest of cork trees whose foliage split the sunshine making here a shade there an alley of light the foresters were at work stripping the trunks of their bark and charnock was in a mood to make parables of the world so long as they fitted in with and exemplified his own particular purposes and plans he himself was a forester and the rough bark he was stripping was mirandas distress so it is to be supposed that the bare treetrunk was miranda herself and to be sure what simile could be more elegant charnocks dominant feeling indeed was one of elation the message of his mirror was being fulfilled he had the glove in his pocket to assure him of that and the feel of the glove of its delicate kid between his strong fingers pleased him beyond measure for it seemed appropriate and expressive of her and he hoped that the strength of his fingers was expressive of himself but beyond that it was a call a challenge to his chivalry which up till now through all his years had never once been called upon and challenged and therein lay the true cause of his elation the train swept out of the cork forest and the great grass slopes stretched upwards at the side of the track dotted with white villages seamed with rocks charnock fell to marvelling at the apt moment of the summons just when his work was done when his mind and his body were free the glove had come to him if it had come by a later post on that same day he would have been on his way to england but it had not it had come confederate with the hour of its coming the train passed into the gorge of tunnels climbing towards ronda he was not forgetful that he was summoned to help miranda out of a danger perhaps certainly out of a great misfortune but he had never had a doubt that the misfortune from some quarter and at some time would fall she had allowed him on the balcony in st jamess park to understand that she herself expected it he knew too that it must be some quite unusual misfortune for had she not herself said with a complete comprehension of what she said if i have troubles i must fight them through myself he had been prepared then for the troubles and he was rejoiced that after all they were of a kind wherein his service could be of use at the head of the gorge he caught his first view of ronda balanced aloft upon its dark pinnacle of rock it was midday and the sun tinged with gold the white spanish houses and the old brown mansions of the moors and over all was a blue arch of sky brilliant and cloudless at that distance and in that clear light ronda seemed one piece of ivory exquisitely carved and tinted and then exquisitely mounted on a black pedestal charnock was not troubled with any of lady donnisthorpes perplexities as to why miranda persisted in making that town her home to him it seemed the only place where she could live since it alone could fitly enshrine her the train wound up the incline at the back of the town and steamed into the station charnock drove thence to the hotel in the square near the bullring lunched and asked his way to mrs warriners house he stood for a while looking at the blank yellow wall which gave on to the street and the heavy door of walnut wood for the first time he began to ponder what was the nature of the peril in which miranda stood his speculations were of no particular value but the fact that he speculated at this spot opposite the house opposite the door was for quite unconsciously his eyes took an impression of the geometrical arrangement of the copper nails with which it was encrusted or rather sought to take such an impression for the geometrical figures were so intricate in their involutions that the eyes were continually baffled and continually provoked charnock was thus absently searching for the key to their intertwistings when he walked across the road and knocked he was conducted through the patio he was shown into the small darkpanelled parlour which overlooked the valley the door was closed upon him the room was empty a book lay open upon the table before the window charnock stood in front of this table looking out of the window across to the sierras so that the book was just beneath his nose he had but to drop his eyes and he would have read the title and known the subjectmatter of the book and perhaps taken note or some pencil lines scored in the margin against a passage here and there for the book had been much in mirandas hands these last few days but he did not for he heard a light step cross the patio outside and pause on the threshold of the door charnock turned expectantly away from the table the door however did not open nor on the other hand were the footsteps heard to retreat a woman then was standing quite silent and quite motionless on the other side of that shut door and that woman no doubt was miranda charnock was puzzled he too stood silent and motionless looking towards the door and wondering why she paused there and in what attitude she stood for the seconds passed and there must have been a lapse of quite two minutes between the moment when the footsteps ceased and the moment when the door was flung open for the door was flung open noisily violently and with a great bustle of petticoats an unknown woman danced into the room humming a tune she stopped with all the signs of amazement when she saw charnock oh she exclaimed why didnt they tell me she cast backwards over her shoulder that glance of the startled fawn which befits a solitary maid in the presence of a devouring man then she advanced timidly lowered her eyes and said so you have come to ronda then this unknown woman had paused outside the door yet she had swung into the room as though in a great hurry and had been much surprised to see her visitor charnock was perplexed moreover the unknown woman wore the semblance of miranda she was dressed in a white frock very elaborate with lace he noticed there was a shimmer of satin at her throat and waist and to him who had not seen her for these months past and who had thought of her as of one draped in black since thus only he had seen her she gleamed against the dark panels of the room silvered and wonderful so you have come to ronda said she of course she held out her hand with a gingerly manner of timidity and pressed his fingers when they touched hers as though she could not help herself and then hastily drew her hand away as if she was ashamed and alarmed at her forwardness charnock could not but remember a frank honest handclasp with which she had bidden him goodbye in london is this your first visit to ronda she asked yes sure she looked at him with her eyebrows raised and an arch glance of provocation sure you have not come up once or twice just to see in what corner of the world i lived no i have been busy miranda shrugged her shoulders i had no right to expect you would she pushed out a foot in a polished shoe beyond the hem of her dress contemplated it with great interest and suddenly withdrew it with much circumstance of modesty then with an involuntary gesture of repugnance which charnock did not understand she went over to the window and stood looking out from it from that position too she spoke you promised that night if you have not forgotten at lady donnisthorpes on the balcony to tell me about yourself about those years you spent in westminster and charnock broke in upon her speech in a voice of relief i understand said he what you he replied simply oh i hope not she returned for when a woman becomes intelligible to a man he loses all liking for her and she spoke the word liking with extreme shyness as though there were a bolder word with which he might replace it if he chose is not that the creed a false creed said he and her eyes fell upon the open book she uttered a startled exclamation threw a quick glance at charnock closed the book and covered it with a newspaper let us go into the garden said she and you shall talk to me of those years in which i am most interested that i can understand said he and she glanced at him sharply suspiciously but there was no sarcasm in his accent he had hit upon an explanation of the change in her she stood in peril she needed help and very likely help of a kind which implied resource which involved danger she knew nothing of him nothing of his capacity it was no more than natural that he should require to know and that she should sound his years for the knowledge before she laid him under the obligation of doing her a service he sat down on the chair in which m fournier had sat only yesterday it will sound very unfamiliar to you he said with a laugh my father was vicar of a moorland parish on the hills above brighouse in yorkshire there i lived until i was twelve until my father died he had nothing but the living which was poor the village schoolmaster what with capitation grants was a good deal better off so that when he died he died penniless i was adopted by a maiden aunt who took me to her home a little villa in the south suburbs of london of which the shutters had never been taken down from the front windows since she had come to live there three years before why asked miranda in surprise she was eccentric explained charnock with a smile and he resumed nor had the front door ever been opened my aunt was afraid that visitors might call and as she truly said the house was not yet in order the furniture partly unpacked with wisps of straw about the legs of the chairs was piled up in the uncarpeted rooms for there was only a carpet down in one room the room in which we lived and since the room was in the front and the shutters were up we lived in a perpetual twilight but did the servants do nothing exclaimed miranda there were no servants returned charnock my aunt said that they hampered her independence consequently of course we made our meals of tinned meat and bottled stout which we ate standing up by the kitchen table in the garden if it was fine but wet or fine the kitchen table always stood in the garden here miranda began to laugh and charnock joined with her it was a quaint sort of life said he but rather ghostly to a boy of twelve but you went to school no my schooldays were over i just lived in the twilight of that house and through the chinks of the shutters watched people passing in the street and lay awake at night listening to the creak of the bare boards the house was in a terrace and since we went to bed as soon as it grew dark to save the gas i could hear through the wall the sounds of people laughing and talking sometimes too the voices of boys of my own age playing while i lay in bed i used to like the noise at times it was companionable and told me fairy stories of blazing firesides at times however i hated it beyond words and hated the boys who laughed and shouted while i lay in the dark amongst the ghostly piles of furniture miranda was now quite serious and charnock as he watched her recognised in the woman who was listening the woman he had talked with on the balcony over st jamess park and not the woman he had talked with five minutes since only to think of it she exclaimed i was living then amongst the suffolk meadows and the great whispering elms of the park and i never knew she spoke almost in a tone of selfreproach as she clasped her hands together on her knees i never knew oh but we had our dissipations returned charnock we dug potatoes in the garden and sometimes we paid a visit to marshall and snelgrove marshall and snelgrove yes those were gala days my aunt would buy the best readymade bodice in the shop which she carried away with her from marshall and snelgroves we used to go to verreys restaurant where we dined amongst mirrors and much gilding and about nine oclock we would travel back to our suburb creep into the dark house by the back door and go to bed without a light imagine that if you can mrs warriner the clatter the noise the flowers the lights of the restaurant men and women in evening dress and just about the time when they were driving up to their theatres these people in whose company we had dined we were creeping into the dark closeshuttered villa of the bare boards and groping our way through the passage without a light i used to imagine that every room had a man hiding behind the door and all night long i heard men in my room breathing stealthily it was after one such night that i ran away you ran away yes and hid myself in london i picked up a living one way and another it doesnt cost much to live when you are put to it i sold newspapers i ran errands you didnt carry a sandwichboard exclaimed miranda eagerly say you didnt do that i didnt replied charnock with some surprise at her eagerness they wouldnt have given a nipper like me a sandwichboard and miranda drew an unaccountable breath of relief finally i became an office boy and i was allowed by my employer to sleep in an empty house in one of the small streets at the back of westminster abbey there werent any carpets either in that house but i was independent you see and i saved my lodging i wasnt unhappy during those three years i understood that very well when i heard the big clock strike twelve again on lady donnisthorpes balcony it was the first time i had heard it since i lived in the empty house and heard it every night and the sound of it was very pleasant and friendly then you left london said miranda after three years i was a clerk then i was seventeen and i had ambitions which clerking didnt satisfy i always had a hankering after machinery and i used to teach myself drawing the lessons however did not turn out very successful when i put them to the test what did you do asked miranda i went up north to leeds theres a firm of railway contractors and manufacturers of locomotives sir john martin is the head partner and i had seen him once or twice at my fathers house for he took and takes a great interest in the yorkshire clergy i see you went to him and told him who you were said miranda who inclined towards charnock more and more from the interest which she took in a youth so entirely strange and apart from her own upbringing just as he on his part had been from the first attracted to her by the secure traditional life of which she was the flower of which he traced associations in her simplicity and up to this day at all events her lack of affectations no replied charnock it would have been wiser if i had done that but i didnt i changed my name and applied for a vacancy as draughtsman i obtained it and held the post for three weeks why they suffered me for three weeks is still a mystery for of course i couldnt draw at all at the end of three weeks i was discharged i asked to be taken on as anything at thirteen shillings a week i saw sir john martin himself he said i couldnt live on thirteen shillings i said i could and he asked me how charnock began to laugh at his own story i told him how he said i lived practically for nothing how said miranda quick tell me charnock laughed again i had been three weeks at the works you see where hands were continually changing i lived in a sort of mechanics boardinghouse and i lived practically for nothing on condition that i kept the house full which i was able to do for i got on very well with the men at the works sir john laughed when i told him and took me into the office so there i was a clerk again which i didnt want to be however i was not a clerk for long one sunday sir john martin came down to the boardinghouse and asked for me it was dinner time and he was shown straight into the diningroom where i was sitting if you please at the head of the table in my shirtsleeves carving for all i was worth he leaned against the door and shook with laughter you are certain to get on he said but i would like a few minutes with you alone i put on my coat and went out with him into the street is your name charnock he asked and i answered that it was i thought i knew your face said he and thats why i took you into my office though i couldnt put a name to you so if you are proud enough to think that i took you on your own merits you are wrong you might as well have told me your real name and saved yourself some time look at that and he gave me a newspaper and pointed out an advertisement a firm of solicitors in london was advertising for me and the firm i happened to know looked after my aunts affairs i went to london that night my aunt had died sixteen months before and had left me six hundred a year the rest was easy i took sir johns advice railways he said railways they are the white mans tentacles and sir john gave me my first employment as an engineer miranda was silent for a long while after charnock had ended his story charnock himself had nothing further to say it was for her to speak not for him to question she had sent the glove she knew why he had come miranda however took a turn along the flagged pathway and leaned over the breasthigh wall and pointed out a vulture above the valley and talked in inattentive undecided tones upon any impersonal topic it was natural charnock thought that she should wish to con over what he had told her so he rose from his chair shall i come back tomorrow he asked and she rallied herself to answer him will you she exclaimed i should be so glad and checking the ardour of her words she explained i mean of course if you have nothing better to do and she examined a flower with intense absorption and then looked at him pathetically over her shoulder as he moved away so again he lost sight of the miranda of the balcony and carried away his first impression that he had met that afternoon with a stranger his fervour of the morning changed to a chilling perplexity he wondered at the change in her something else too seized upon his thoughts and exercised his fancies why had she stood so long outside the door before she hurried in with her simulated surprise how had she looked as she paused there silent and motionless that question in particular haunted him for he thought that if only he could have seen her through the closed door he would have found a clue which would lead him to comprehend and to justify her absorbed by these thoughts he sat through dinner unobservant of his few neighbours at the long table he was therefore surprised when as he stood in the stone hall lighting his cigar a friendly hand was clapped down upon his shoulder and an affable voice remarked aha dear friend finished the little job at algeciras i saw what are you doing at ronda what are you asked charnock as he faced the irrepressible major wilbraham trying to make seven hundred per annum into a thousand you see i have no secrets now confidence for confidence eh dear friend and his eyes drew cunningly together behind the glowing end of his cigar i am afraid that i must leave you to guess guessings not very sociable work perhaps thats why i am given to it said charnock and he walked between the stone columns and up the broad staircase the major looked after him without the slightest resentment slipped up that time ambrose my lad he said to himself and sauntered cheerfully out of the hotel five minutes later charnock passed through the square at a quick walk wilbraham was meditating a translation of the carmen sculare but business habits prevailed with him he thrust the worn little horace into his breastpocket and followed charnock at a safe distance by means of a skill acquired by much practice he walked very swiftly and yet retained the indifferent air of a loiterer there was another picture of the tracker and the tracked to be seen that evening but in ronda instead of tangier and charnock was unable to compare it with its companion picture since in this case he was the tracked the two men passed down the hill to the bridge charnock stopped for a little and stood looking over the parapet to the water two hundred and fifty feet below which was just visible through the gathering darkness like a ridge of snow on black soil wilbraham halted at the end of the bridge it seemed that charnock was merely taking a stroll he had himself however nothing better to do at the moment he waited and repeated a stanza of his translation to the rhythm of the torrent and was not displeased charnock moved on across the bridge across the plaza on the farther side of the bridge up a street until he came to an old moorish house that showed a blank yellow wall to the street and a heavy walnut door encrusted with copper nails then he stopped again and looked steadily at the house and for a long while wilbraham began pensively to whistle a slow tune under his breath charnock walked on stopped again looked back to the house as though he searched for a glimpse of the lights but there was no chink or cranny in that blank wall the house faced the street blind dark and repellent charnock suddenly retraced his steps wilbraham had just time to mount the doorsteps of a house as though he was about to knock before charnock passed him charnock had not noticed him wilbraham descended the steps and followed charnock back into the plaza charnock was looking for a road which he had seen that afternoon from mirandas garden a road which wound in zigzags down the cliff the road descended from the plaza charnock discovered it walked down it behind him at a little distance walked wilbraham it was now falling dark but the night was still so that wilbraham was compelled to drop yet farther and farther behind lest the sound of his footsteps upon the hard dry ground should betray his pursuit he fell so far behind in fact that he ceased to hear charnocks footsteps at all he accordingly hurried he did more than hurry he ran he turned an angle of the road and immediately a man seated upon the bank by the roadside said buenas noches the man was charnock wilbraham had the presence of mind not to stop felices suenos he returned in a gruff voice and continued to run he ran on until another angle of the road hid him then he climbed on to the top of the bank which was high and with great caution doubled back along the ridge until charnock was just beneath him charnock was gazing upwards wilbraham followed his example and saw that right above his head on the rim of the precipice an open window glowed upon the night a square of warm yellow light empanelled in the purple gloom the ceiling of the room was visible and just below the ceiling a gleam as of polished panels at that height above them the window seemed very small its brightness exaggerated the darkness which surrounded it and both men looked into it as into a tiny theatre of marionettes and expected the performance of a miniature play all that they saw however was a shadowpantomime thrown upon the ceiling and that merely of a tantalising kind the shadow of a womans head and hair growing and diminishing as the unseen woman moved away or to the candles a second shadow and this too the shadow of a woman joined the first but no woman showed herself at the window and charnock tiring of the entertainment returned to his hotel wilbraham remained to count the houses between that lighted window and the chasm of the tajo he counted six then he returned but not immediately to the hotel on reaching the plaza he walked indeed precisely in the opposite direction away from the tajo and he counted the houses which he passed and stopped before the seventh the seventh was noticeable for its great doors of walnutwood and the geometrical figures which were traced upon it with copper nails the major cocked his hat on one side and stepped out for the hotel most jauntily these little accidents said he a brigantine sighted off ushant a man going out for a walk if only one has patience patience theres the secret a little more and how much a great poet and he entered the hotel charnock rose from a bench in the hall pleasant night for a stroll said he business with me dear old boy replied the major i fancy that after all i have made that seven hundred per annum into a thou i am not sure but i think so goodnight sleep well be good with a flourish of his hand over the balustrade of the stairs the major disappeared charnock sat down again on the bench and reflected wilbrahams at ronda i find him at ronda when i am sent for to ronda wilbraham said goodnight to me on the road wilbraham was following me wilbrahams clothes were dusty it was wilbraham who kicked his toes into the grass on the top of the bank while i sat at the bottom have i to meet wilbraham what has his seven hundred per annum to do with mrs warriner well i shall learn tomorrow he concluded and so went to bed chapter xiii wherein the heros perplexities increase charnock however learned nothing the next morning except perhaps a lesson in patience for the greater part of his visit was occupied in extracting a thorn from one of mrs warriners fingers they chanced to be alone in the garden when the accident occurred and miranda naturally came to him for assistance she said no word about the glove nor did he it was part of the compact that he should be silent he came the next day and it seemed that there was something amiss with mirandas hairpins for the coils of her hair were continually threatening to tumble about her shoulders at least so she said complaining of the weight of her hair but again there was no mention of the glove that afternoon charnock was introduced to miss holt whom miranda kept continually at her side until charnock took his leave when she accompanied him across the patio we never seem to get an opportunity of talking to each other said she with the utmost innocence will you ride with me tomorrow say at two we might ride as far as ronda la viega charnock who within the last halfhour had begun to consider whether it would not be wise for him to return to algeciras eagerly accepted the invitation tomorrow everything would be explained they would ride out together alone and she would tell him of the dragon he was required to slay and no doubt explain why for these last two days she had been marketing her charms that certainly needed explanation for even at this moment in the patio she was engaged in kissing a kitten with too elaborate a preparation of her lips to avoid a suspicion that the pantomime was intended for a spectator charnock was punctual to the minute of his appointment and in mirandas company rode through the town as they passed the hotel major wilbraham came out of the doorway he took off his hat charnock nodded in reply and turned towards miranda remembering his suspicions as to whether wilbraham was concerned in the mysterious peril which he was to combat to his surprise miranda instantly smiled at the major with extreme friendliness and markedly returned his bow clever clever muttered the major as he bit his moustache and commended her manoeuvre a little overdone perhaps the bow a trifle too marked still its clever ambrose you will have that thousand charnock was perplexed how long have you known wilbraham he asked miranda stammered bent her head and smiled as it were in spite of herself a long while she answered and then she sighed a long while she repeated softly charnock was exasperated to a pitch beyond his control if you want to make me believe that you are in love with him he returned sharply almost roughly you will fail mrs warriner i should find it hard to believe that he is even one of your friends the words were hardly out of his lips before he regretted them they insulted her she was hardly the woman to sit still under an insult but her manner again surprised him he was almost prepared to be sent curtly to the right about whereas she made no answer whatever she coloured hotly and rode forward ahead of him until they were well out of the town and descending the hill into the bottom of the valley then she fell back again by his side and said why is your face always so illegible is it he asked its a lid a shut lid she said one never knows what you think how you are disposed she spoke with some irritation perhaps but sincerely and without any effort at provocation i was not aware returned charnock you must set it down to habit mrs warriner i was brought up in a hard school and learned no doubt intuitively the wisdom of reticence is it always wisdom she asked doubtfully and it seemed a strange question to come from her whose business it was to speak just as it was his to listen but very likely her doubt was in this instance preferable to his wisdom some word of surprise at the change in her perhaps one simple gesture of impatience would have broken down the barrier between them but he had taken the buffets of her provocations and her advances with as she truly said an illegible face is it always wisdom she asked and she added you were not so reticent when i first met you and just that inconsistency between his bearing at lady donnisthorpes ball and his inexpressive composure of these few last days might have revealed to her at this moment what he thought and how he was disposed had she brought a cooler mind to consider it for the man was not chary of expression when the world went well with him it was only in the presence of disappointments rebuffs and aversions that his face became a lid they left their horses at a farmhouse and climbed up the rough steep slope to the windy ridge on which the old roman town was built they sat for a while upon the stones of the old wall looking across the great level plain of olive trees and poplars and white villages gleaming in the sunlight here was a fitting moment for the story to be told charnock thought and expected its telling but he only saw that miranda scrutinised his looks and he only heard her gabbling of this triviality and that with a feverish vivacity and no doubt his face betrayed less than ever what he thought and felt shall i see you tomorrow she asked as they parted that afternoon outside her door i will come round in the morning after lunch he replied and she uttered a quick little sigh of pleasure which made charnock turn his horse with a sharp angry tug at the rein and ride quickly away across the bridge that first impulse to leave ronda had gone from him he was engaged through his own wish and action to serve mrs warriner and he was resolved to keep the engagement to the letter but he was beginning to realise that he should be serving a woman whom in the bottom of his heart he despised the message of his mirror became a fable he recalled what miranda herself had suggested that the look of distress which he had seen upon the face was due to his chance visit to macbeth and certain words which a woman had spoken at lady donnisthorpes dance as she sat by the window recurred to him theres a coquette was one phrase which on this particular evening recurred and recurred to his thoughts however he returned to the house upon the rim of the precipice the next morning and being led by a servant through the patio into the garden came upon miranda unawares she was busy amongst her flowers cutting the choicest and arranging them in a basket and she did not notice charnocks appearance charnock was well content with her inattention for in the quiet grace of her movements as she walked amongst her flowers he caught a glimpse of the miranda whom he knew the miranda of the balcony the october sunlight was golden about them a light wind tempered its heat and on the wind were borne upwards to his ears the distant cries of peasants in the plain below he had a view now and then of her face as she rose and stooped and he remarked a gentleness and a simplicity in its expression which had been foreign to it since he had come to ronda but the expression changed when she saw charnock standing in the garden who do you think i am cutting these flowers for she asked with an intolerable playfulness you will never guess charnock stepped over to her side mrs warriner said he will you give me one she looked at him with a whimsical hesitation they are intended for gibraltar she said as she caressed the bunch which she held but she spoke with a great repugnance and the playfulness had gone from her voice before she had ended the sentence for gibraltar he exclaimed remembering the gentle look upon her face as she had culled them for whom in gibraltar for whom he confronted her squarely his voice commanded her to answer she drew back from him the colour went from her cheeks her fingers were interclasped convulsively it seemed as though the words she tried to speak were choking her but her emotion lasted for no more than a moment though for that moment charnock could not doubt that it was real he took a step forwards and she was again mistress of herself yes i will give you one she said hurriedly i will even fix it in your buttonhole will you be grateful if i do will you be very grateful charnock neither answered nor moved he stood in front of her with a face singularly stolid but mirandas hands touched his breast and at the shock of her fingers he drew in his breath and his whole body vibrated and how it came about neither of them knew but in an instant the flowers were on the ground between them and her hands gripped his shoulders as they stood face to face and tightened upon them in a passionate appeal he read the same passionate appeal in her eyes which now frankly looked up to his you dont know she cried incoherently you dont know but i wish to know he exclaimed tell me and his arms went about her waist she uttered a cry and violently tore and plucked his arms from her no she cried no not now and she heard the latch of the door click charnock heard it too when said he as he stood away and the door opened and major wilbraham with his hat upon his heart bowed with great elegance upon the threshold miranda started she looked from charnock to wilbraham from wilbraham to charnock so he is one of your friends said charnock have you the right to choose my friends she asked and she greeted wilbraham warmly the major seemed very much at his ease it was the first occasion on which he had had the effrontery to push his way into the house but from his manner one would have judged him a family friend he waved a hand to charnock so you are there dear old darling boy he cried his endearments increased with every meeting i saw you come in and thought i might as well call at the same time eh mrs warriner so pleasant i meet charnock everywhere destiny will have us friends that dear destiny and as charnock with an illconcealed air of distaste turned from them towards the valley wilbraham whispered to miranda you need have no fear i shall not say a word unless you force me to miranda drew back she stood for a moment with her hands clenched and her eyelids closed her face utterly weary and ashamed then with a gesture of revolt she turned towards charnock instantly the major stepped in front of her may i beg one said he pointing to the basket of flowers it was all very well for him to threaten miranda that he would tell charnock of her husband but it would not suit his purpose at all for her actually to tell him on an impulse of revolt against the deception and the hold he himself had upon her so he fixed his eyes steadily upon her face may i beg one and he bent towards the stool on which the basket was set not of those she cried not of those and she snatched up the basket and held it close but you shall have one she continued with a forced laugh as over wilbrahams shoulder she saw charnock watching them and she snapped off some flowers from their stems with her fingers until she held a bunch there make your choice major a flower sets off a man just as a wife sets off a husband eh mrs warriner returned the major with a sly gallantry as he fixed the flower in his buttonhole eh charnock did you hear he joined charnock as he spoke and miss holt coming from the house the talk became general but charnock noticed that at one moment miranda moved carelessly away from the group and leaning carelessly over the wall carelessly dropped down the face of the cliff the whole bunch of flowers from which wilbraham had chosen one as she lifted her eyes however she saw charnock watching her and at once and for the rest of the time during which her guests remained she made her court to wilbraham with a feverish assiduity she laughed immoderately at his jokes she was extremely confused by his compliments she displayed the completest deference to his opinions so that even the unobservant miss holt was surprised charnock was the first to break up the gathering i must be going he said curtly to miranda it would almost seem that you were displeased with us she answered defiantly i beg your pardon said he coldly i do not claim the privilege to be displeased jolly afternoon murmured the major in a cheery desire to make the peace good company dear old friends and he saw that miranda was unmistakably bowing goodbye to himself he took the hint at once the major was in a very good humour that afternoon and as the party walked back to the house he fell behind to miranda who had already fallen behind clever clever he remarked encouragingly to play me off against the real man a little overdone perhaps but clever i trust i did my part well make it a thousand per annum miranda quickened her pace and took her leave of her visitors at the door of the garden wilbraham was in no particular hurry to settle his business he was quite satisfied for that afternoon and he entered genially into conversation with miss holt upon the subject of her grievances thus miss holt and wilbraham crossed the patio and entered the passage to the outer door charnock followed a few steps behind them and just after miss holt with her companion had entered the passage while he yet stood in the patio he heard a door slam behind him he turned and walked round the tiny group of tamarisks in the centre of the patio it was not the door into the garden which had slammed because that now stood wide open whereas he remembered he had closed it behind him and the only other door in that side of the house was the door of mirandas parlour he had left miranda in the garden it was plainly she who had slammed the door and had slammed it upon herself charnock was alone in the empty patio it was very quiet the sunshine was a steady golden glow upon the tiled floor upon the tiled walls above in the square of blue there was no scarf of cloud he stood in the quiet empty patio and the touch of her fingers tingled again upon his breast again he saw her drop the flowers she had culled for wilbraham down the cliff amongst his doubts and perplexities those two recollections shone they were accurate indisputable her feverish vivacity her coquetries her friendliness to wilbraham her silence towards himself the basket of flowers for gibraltar these things were puzzles but twice that afternoon she had been true to herself and each time she had betrayed the reality of her trouble and the reality of her need it was very still in the patio a bee droned amongst the tamarisks it seemed to charnock that after much sojourning in outlandish corners of the earth he who had foreseen his life as a struggle with the brutality of inanimate things was after all here in the still noonday within these four walls to undergo the crisis of his destiny he gently turned the handle of the door and entered the room chapter xiv miranda professes regret for a practical joke he closed the door behind him miranda had neither seen nor heard him enter she sat opposite to the door on the other side of the round oak table her arms stretched out upon the table her face buried in her arms she was not weeping and charnock might have believed from the abandonment of her attitude that she lay in a swoon but for one movement that she made her outstretched hands were clasped together and her fingers perpetually worked twisting and intertwisting there was no sound whatever in the room beyond the ticking of a clock and charnock leaned against the door and found the silence horrible he would have preferred it to have been broken if only by the sound of her tears all his doubts all his accusations were swept clean out of his brain by the sight of her distress and tortured himself he stood witness of her torture he advanced to the table and leaning over it took the womans clasped hands into his miranda he whispered and again miranda and there was just the same tenderness in his voice as when he had first pronounced the name in the balcony over st jamess park miranda did not lift her head but her hands answered the clasp of his she did not in truth know at that moment who was speaking to her she was only sensible of the sympathy of his touch and the great comfort of his voice charnock bent lower towards her i love you he said you miranda then she raised her face and stared at him with uncomprehending eyes i love you he repeated she looked down towards her hands which he still held and suddenly she shivered i love you he said a third time and she understood she wrenched her hands away she stretched out her arms she thrust him away from her in her violence she struck him no its not true she cried its not true and so fell to pleading volubly say that its not true now at once say theres no truth in your words say that pity prompted them and only pity and her voice rose again in a great horror horror glittered too in her eyes say that you spoke more than you meant to speak i can say that he answered when i came into this room i had no thought of speaking as i did but i saw you i watched your hands and he caught his breath and they plucked the truth out from me for what i said is true no she cried very true he repeated quietly her protesting arms fell limply to her sides she nodded her head submitted to his words acknowledged their justice yes she said yes i knew this afternoon you told me in the garden and though i would not know still i could not but know then she rose from her chair and walked to the window charnock did not speak he hung upon her answer and yet dreaded to hear it so that when her lips moved he would have had them still and when they ceased to move he was conscious of a great relief after a long while she spoke very slowly and without turning to face him words which he did not understand love she said in a wondering murmur is it so easily got and by such poor means surely then its a slight thing itself of no account surely not durable and at once her calmness forsook her she was caught up in a whirl of passion she raised a quivering face and cried aloud in despair its the friend i wanted i want no lover but you have both returned charnock with a hand upon the table he leaned over it towards her you have both ah exclaimed miranda with extraordinary swiftness she swung round and copied his movement she leaned her hand upon the table and bent forward to him but to win the one i have had to create the other to possess the friend i have had to make the lover and she suddenly threw herself back and stood erect well then and she spoke with a thrill in her voice as though she had this instant become aware of a new and a true conviction i must use neither i will use neither i want neither she faced charnock resolute and in her own fancy inflexible to any appeal only he made no appeal he drew his hand across his forehead and looked at her with an expression of simple worry and bewilderment my ways have lain amongst men and men and men he said regretfully i wish i understood more about women the simplicity of his manner and words touched her as no protestations would have done and broke down her selfcontrol my dear my dear she cried with a laugh which had more of tears in it than amusement i am not so sure that we understand so very much about ourselves and she dropped again into the chair and covered her face with her hands but she heard charnock move round the table towards her and she dared not risk the touch of his hand or so much as the brushing of his coat against her dress she drew her hands from her face held out her arms straight in front of her like bars and shrank back in the chair behind the protection of those bars i do not want you she said deliberately with a quiet harshness that at all events i understand and know go go away i do not want you and the words spoken this time without violence or haste struck charnock like a blow he stood dazed he shook his head as though it sang from the blow miranda drew in a breath go she repeated you do not want me he asked and somehow whether it was owing to his tone or his look miranda understood from the few words of his question how much he had built upon the belief that she needed him and consequently the reply she made now cost her more than all the rest to make i do not she managed to say firmly and dared not hazard another syllable charnock felt in his breastpocket took out an envelope and from the envelope a glove yet this was sent to me he laid the glove upon the table it was sent by you miranda took it up it contradicts your words miranda turned the glove over and stretched it out upon her knees does it she asked with a slow smile does it contradict my words you sent it to me no doubt you summoned me by sending it surely for some purpose then ah but for what purpose said she leaning forwards in her chair the cold smile was still upon her face and seemed to charnock unfriendly as even her violence had not been it had some cruelty too and perhaps too some cunning for what purpose you should know it is for you to say he answered in a dull tired voice he had built more upon this unneeded service than he himself had been aware i will tell you continued miranda you have talked to my companion miss holt yes she has no very strong faith in men perhaps you noticed as much no i did not agree with her i had the glove it would be amusing to know whether she was right or whether i was i sent it to you just to prove whether i should keep my word or not yes said miranda just for your amusement in a word amusement was the word i chose i see i see his voice was lifeless his face dull and stony miranda moved uneasily as she watched him but he did not notice her movement or regard her with any suspicion his thoughts and feelings were muffled he seemed to be standing somewhere a long way outside himself and contemplating the two people here in the room with a deal of curiosity and with perhaps a little pity of which pity the woman had her share with the man i see he continued it was all a sham miranda glanced at him and from him to the glove even the glove was a sham she said quickly look at it he bent down and lifted it from her knees then he drew up a chair to the table sat down and examined the glove miranda hitched her chair closer to the table too and propping her elbows there supported her chin upon her hands you see that the glove is fresh she said it has been worn answered charnock the fingers have been shaped by wearing it was worn by me for ten minutes in this room the day i posted it to you but the tear he asked with a momentary quickening of speech i tore it i see he laid the glove upon the table and the other glove the one you wore that night the one i tore upon the balcony over st jamess park it was you i met that night in london or wasnt it the question was put without any sarcasm but with the same dull curiosity which had marked his other questions and on her side she answered it simply as she had answered the others yes it was i whom you met and the glove you speak of was thrown away it seemed that he had come to the end of his questions for he sat for a little drumming with his fingers on the table once he looked up and towards the window as though his very eyes needed the relief of the wide expanse of valley now will you go please said miranda gently and the next moment regretted that she had spoken oh yes i will go he answered i will go back to algeciras and from algeciras to england he was not looking at her and so noticed nothing of the spasm of pain which for a second convulsed her face at his literal acceptation of her prayer but before i go tell me and the questions began again you say you need no one no one then why did you cry out a minute ago its the friend i want not the lover you were not amusing yourself then why too did you this afternoon in the garden perhaps you remember when the flowers fell on to the ground between us neither were you amusing yourself then miranda drew the glove away from where it lay in front of him absently she began to slip it over her hand and then becoming aware of what she did and of certain associations with that action at this moment she hurriedly stripped it off perhaps i have no right to press you he said but i should like to know miranda spread the glove out on the table and carefully divided and spread out the fingers i will tell you she said at length with something of a spirt in the quickness of her speech i am still capable of remorse though very likely you can hardly believe that do you remember she began to speak with greater ease when we rode out to ronda la viega i asked you why you never expressed what you felt i was then beginning to be afraid that you would take my my trick too much to heart that you would really think i needed you my fear became certain this afternoon when i i was putting the flower in your coat i was sorry then as you saw when you came into the room i was yet more sorry when you spoke to me as you did for i thought that if you hadnt cared if you had never intended to be more than my friend the trick would not have mattered so much and that was just what i meant when i said it was the friend i wanted not the lover charnock listened to the explanation accepted it and put it away in his mind i see he remarked and her bosom rose and fell quickly all this time you have been just playing with me as you played with wilbraham this afternoon just in the same way she returned without flinching ah but you dropped his flower down the cliff he exclaimed suddenly you forget that yours had already fallen on to the ground yes thats true and the suspicion died out of his face and that basket of flowers he asked this time and for the first time since the questions had begun miranda did flinch she had a great difficulty in answering it has already been sent off to gibraltar mirandas difficulty increased to whom at gibraltar a friend a man mirandas face grew very white she tried to speak and failed her throat her lips refused the answer at all events she managed to whisper hoarsely not to a woman and thereupon she laughed most mirthlessly till the strange harsh strangled noise of it penetrated as something unfamiliar to charnocks dazed mind i beg your pardon he said i was forgetful i had no right to ask you and he rose from his chair she rose too i am glad he continued with a formal politeness that you do not after all stand in need of anyones help oh no she replied carelessly no ones and almost before she was aware he was holding her wrists one in each of his hands and with his eyes he was searching her face silently interrogating her for the truth once before upon the balcony he had bidden her in just this way answer him and now as then she found herself under a growing compulsion to obey you hurt me she had the wit to say and instantly charnock released her wrists i beg your pardon said he and he walked to the door at the door he turned tell me he said abruptly you dropped your glove not that one on the table but the other just as you stepped out on to the balcony yes she answered and wondered what was coming was that an accident miranda stepped back and lowered her head you remember everything she murmured was it an accident you are unsparing was it an accident no it was a trick a sham like all the rest just like all the rest said miranda wearily i see said charnock goodbye he went out of the room and closed the door behind him it was very quiet and still in the patio in the square of blue sky there was no cloud the sunshine poured into the court only in one corner there was a shadow climbing the wall where there had been no shadow when he entered the room he vaguely wondered what the time was and then someone laughed someone above him he looked up jane holt was leaning over the railing of the balcony he made some sort of remark and he gathered from her reply that he had been asking why she laughed why did i laugh she said do you believe in affinities no he rejoined why she descended the stairs as she answered him i saw you standing in the doorway there with your hand on your throat breathing hard and quick and altogether a very tragical picture charnock was not aware whether the details were true or not well he asked well she replied do you remember the afternoon you came here i was in that lounge chair you were shown into the parlour you did not notice me neither did miranda when she followed you but she stopped on the threshold yes i remarked it she stopped for some while well well she stood just as you were standing a minute ago in that precise attitude with her hand to her throat breathing hard and quick and with a face not less tragical charnocks face now at all events ceased to look tragical jane holt saw it brighten extraordinarily miranda had she been there would not at this moment have complained of its lack of expression thats true he asked eagerly what you tell me is true she stood here and in that attitude yes thats the one point unexplained i forgot to ask she did not refer to it she stood here breathing hard and quick you say before she entered the room with all that appearance of surprise she stood here mere remorse does not account for that does not account for her manner on her own showing it cannot account since the remorse was only felt this afternoon there is something more he was talking enigmas to miss holt who went into the parlour and left him in the patio to talk to himself if he would she was not greatly interested in his relationship towards miranda however charnock was not the only person to talk enigmas to her that afternoon she found miranda standing just as charnock had left her miranda remained standing with any absent answer to jane holts remarks until the big outerdoors clanged to and made the house tremble then she started violently the sound of those doors shook her as no word or look of charnocks had done her ears magnified it it seemed to her that the doors swung to from the east and from the west clean across the world shutting charnock upon the one side and herself upon the other it seemed to her too that as they clanged together her heart was caught and broken between them you were wrong jane she said there are men who would be friends if we would only let them possibly we always find it out too late i only found it out this afternoon the clock struck the hour as she was speaking four oclock the train for algeciras leaves at sixfifteen she said chapter xv in which the major loses his temper and recovers it all that evening mirandas imagination followed the train from ronda to algeciras she looked at the clock at halfpast ten the ferry would be crossing from algeciras to gibraltar and no doubt charnock was crossing upon it she felt a loneliness of which she had never had experience and when she woke up in the morning from a troubled sleep it was only to picture some stately mail steamer marching out from algeciras bay she was conscious to the full of the irony of the situation if she had only met this man years ago seven years ago that regret was a continual cry at her heart and not the least part of her loneliness was made up from her clear remembrance of the picture of herself which she had given him to carry away she ordered her horse to be brought round early that morning and rode out past the hotel a few minutes before nine major wilbraham saw her pass he was down betimes as a rule when he stayed in a hotel since it was his habit as often as possible to look over the letters which came for the different visitors the mere postmark he had known upon occasion to give him quite valuable hints there was only however a telegram for charnock which he genially offered to deliver himself and did deliver running into charnocks bedroom for that purpose charnock thanked him and read the telegram it seemed to raise his spirits good news old friend asked the major well interesting news replied charnock as he lathered his face well you shall give me it another time said the major as he saw charnock put the telegram in his pocket so long the major went downstairs and kept an eye upon the road at ten oclock he noticed miranda returning slowly he put on his hat and followed her when he reached the house the horse was still at the door but miranda had gone in he observed that charnock was hesitating upon the other side of the road charnock was in fact debating his plan of action the majors was already prepared the door stood open wilbraham put ceremony upon one side the more readily since ceremony would very likely have barred the door in his face he walked straight into the patio where miranda stood before a little wicker table drawing off her gloves had a pleasant ride said the major nice horse i am partial to roans myself what do you want asked miranda to so uncompromising a question i must needs give an uncompromising reply i want one thousand jimmies per annum and the major bowed gracefully no said miranda but excuse me yes very much yes you see there is my excellent young friend the locomotiveman cant you keep his name out of the conversation she suggested but with a dangerous quietude of voice indeed no replied the major who was entirely at his ease he looked sympathetically at her face you look pale you have not slept well you are tired and so you do not follow me charnock is my god of the machine a blind unconscious god shall we say a cupid but a cupid in the machine let me explain may i be seated no so sorry on the first night of charnocks stay at ronda i had the honour to follow him while he took a stroll you followed him unseen of course said miranda contemptuously as she tossed her gloves on to the wicker table you take me you take me perfectly returned the major i followed him unseen a habit of mine and at times a very profitable habit charnock walked whither can you guess cant you tell he hummed with unabashed impertinence he walked down a certain road which winds down the precipice under your windows ah he uttered the exclamation in a playful raillery for mirandas hand had gone to her heart he walked down that road until he came to an angle from which he could see your lighted window show me said miranda suddenly she walked round the patio threw open the door of her parlour and crossed to the window the window was open and the major looked out the window was in the outer wall of the wing and was built on the very rim of the precipice wilbraham looked straight down on to the road that was the angle mrs warriner said he pointing with his finger by that heap of stones he sat him down mrs warriner leaned out of the window with something of a smile parting her lips at the bottom of the bank he sat and aspired little ambrose reclined on the top miranda turned from the window abruptly let us go back she returned to the patio and took her former position by the wicker table wilbraham upon the other side of it faced her we could only see the ceiling of the room he continued and the shadow of your head but so little contents an amorous engineer he sighed and what a sigh and yet how typical so hoarse it seemed the whistle of an engine so deep it surely came from a cutting he went home singing beneath the stars he did not tread the ground how should he love was his permanent way miranda had listened so far without interruption though the major had he been less pleased with his flowery description might have noticed something ominous in the still depths of her dark eyes mr wilbraham she said there is a little wicker table between us i see it and on the table a pair of gloves not only a pair of gloves ah true a ridingwhip i was sure that you had not noticed it before the major picked it up and examined the mounting of the handle it is very pretty he remarked with emphasis and laid it down again as i was about to say he proceeded with his argument i thus obtained on the night of charnocks arrival a very clear knowledge of his sentiments towards you while you on the other hand have been obliging enough to favour me with some hint of your own towards him not merely this morning when you asked me to point out the precise point of the road from which he worshipped your window but yesterday when in order to give an impetus to his bashfulness you ingeniously courted myself if i were then at all disposed to make unpleasantness you see that all i have to do is to walk out of your house and inform the trustful charnock that mrs warriner is carefully concealing the existence of her husband from the man with whom she is in love miranda took up the ridingwhip the major did not give ground if anything he leaned a little towards her his eyebrows drew together until they joined his birdlike eyes narrowed drop it drop that whip he commanded sharply i warn you mrs warriner i have dealt with you gently though you are a woman be prudent what if i took the gloves off eh you would place me in a better position replied miranda who still held the whip to point out to you that your hands are not clean wilbraham stepped back stared at her and burst into a laugh i will never deny that you are possessed or an admirable spirit said he i would rather have your threats than your compliments said she for your threats i can answer with threats i cannot do the same with your compliments threat for threat then said the major but theres a difference in the threats you cannot put yours into practice since i have my eyes upon the whip whereas i can mine can you said miranda with a suspicion of triumph i can returned the major i can walk straight out of your house and tell luke charnock and he banged his hand upon the table and leaned over it now what do you say i say that you cannot for mr charnock is at gibraltar if he is not already on the sea mr charnock is at ronda and contemplating the ornaments of your door at this very moment said the major triumphantly but never did a man get less visible proofs of his triumph miranda it is true was evidently startled her bosom rose and fell quickly but she was pleasurably startled as her face showed for it cleared of its weariness with a magical swiftness the blood pulsed warmly in her cheeks her eyes sparkled and laughed her contemptuous lips parted in the happiest of smiles wilbraham construed her reception of his news in his own fashion you may smile my lady said he brutally its gratifying no doubt to have your lover hanging about your doors a wistful lazarus for the crumbs of your favour its pleasant no doubt to transform a man into a tame whipped puppydog theres not one of you from eve to a modern factorygirl but envies circe her enchantments and imitates them to the best of her ability circes circes in laced petticoats and openworked stockings to help you in the dainty work of making a man a beast the majors vindictiveness had fairly got hold of him but in the original story if you remember the men resumed their shape now what if i play ulysses in our version of the story there was a knock upon the outer door the major paused and continued hurriedly do you understand that knock may have been charnocks do you understand he may be entering the house at this moment he is said miranda quietly the major listened he distinctly heard charnocks voice speaking to the servant he dropped his own to a whisper then what if i told him your lover now and here the truth about ralph warriner you shall said miranda major wilbraham was completely taken aback she had spoken in no gust of passion but slowly and calmly her face equally calm equally resolute showed him that she intended and understood what she had said the major was in a predicament the drawback to blackmailing as a profession is that the blackmailers secret is only of value so long as he never tells it his threats only of use so long as they are never enforced and here he was in imminent danger of being compelled to tell his secret and execute his threat if charnock knew the truth he would certainly lose his extra three hundred per annum moreover since charnock was a man and not a woman he would very likely lose his original seven hundred into the bargain these reflections flashed simultaneously into the majors mind but already he heard charnocks step sounding in the passage i dont wish to push you too far he whispered tomorrow tomorrow no today said miranda quietly you shall tell my lover the truth about ralph warriner and to help you to tell it him convincingly you shall tell it with this mark across your face charnock did not see the blow struck but he heard wilbrahams cry and as he entered the patio he saw the wheal redden and ridge upon his face he stood still for a second in amazement wilbraham had reeled back from the table against the wall with his coatsleeve pressed upon his smarting cheeks miranda alone seemed composed there was indeed even an air of relief about her for she was at last to be lightened of the deception major wilbraham she said as she dropped the whip upon the table and walked away to a lounge chair major wilbraham she seated herself in the chair as though she was to be henceforward a spectator major wilbraham has a confidence to make to you she said and by god i have snarled the major as he started forward it would be told for a certain thing either by mrs warriner or himself and since the slash of the whip burned intolerably upon his face he meant to do the telling himself that womans husband is alive charnocks face was a mask he did not start he did not even look at miranda only he was silent for some seconds then he said well and said it in a quite commonplace ordinary voice as though he wondered what there was to make any pother about miranda was startled the major utterly dumbfoundered his blow had seemingly failed to hurt and his anger was thereby redoubled a small thing eh he sneered a husband more or less dont matter in these days of the sacred laws of passion well very likely but this husband is a peculiar sort of a husband he slipped out of gibraltar one fine night why because he had sold the plans of the new daventry gun to a foreign government being stony well said charnock again well i know where he is well asked charnock for the third time and with an unchanged imperturbability wilbraham suddenly ceased from his accusations he looked at miranda who was herself looking on the ground and gently beating it with her foot from miranda he looked to charnock then he uttered a long whistle as if some new idea had occurred to him so you are both in the pretty secret are you he said and stopped to consider how that supposition affected himself his hopes immediately revived why then you are both equally interested in keeping it dark i cant say but what i am glad for i can point out to you precisely what i have pointed out to mrs warriner i have merely to present myself at scotland yard observe that ralph warriner is alive and mention a port in england where he may from time to time be found and do you follow me there is ralph warriner laid by the heels in a place which not even a tripleexpansion locomotive with the engineer from algeciras for the driver will get him out of and how does that concern me asked charnock the consequences concern you it will be known for instance that mrs warriner has a real live husband i see said charnock he looked at wilbraham with a curious interest then he spoke to miranda but without looking towards her at all it is blackmail i suppose yes said she it is a claim for common gratitude wilbraham corrected whats the price of the claim asked charnock pleasantly one thousand jimmies per annum is the minimum figure replied the major whose jauntiness was quite restored since his affairs progressed so swimmingly towards prosperity he was prepared to forgive and as soon as his lookingglass allowed to forget that hasty slash of the ridingwhip and up till now how much have you received continued charnock in the same pleasant businesslike voice a beggarly two hundred and fifty then if for forms sake you will give mrs warriner an i o u for that amount she can wish you goodday wilbraham smiled gaily and with some condescension is it bluff said he wheres the use my dear charnock i have a full hand and my dear major replied charnock i hold a royal straight flush he produced a telegram from his pocket the major eyed it with suspicion is that the telegram i brought into your room this morning it is to keep up your metaphor you dealt me my hand do you call it the major cocked his head charnocks ease was so very natural his good temper so complete still he might be merely playing the game besides one never knew what there might be in a telegram i do he said very well said charnock he sat down upon a chair and spread out the telegram on his knee you talk very airily major of dropping in upon scotland yard would it surprise you to hear that scotland yard would welcome you with open arms for other reasons than a mere gratitude for your information the major was more than disappointed he confessed to being grieved i expected something more subtle i did indeed really my dear charnock you are a novice sir a novice but a novice with a royal straight flush major why have you been living for four months at an outoftheway and unentertaining place like tarifa i will answer you with frankness i wished to keep my fingers upon mrs warriner an occasional tweak of the fingers dear friend is very useful if only to show that you are awake was that the only reason no interposed miranda he wanted quiet he is translating horace the major actually blushed for the first and last time that morning accusations even proofs of infamy he could accept without a stir of the muscles but to be charged perhaps to be ridiculed with his one honourable project the major was hurt a little mean he said gently to miranda you will agree with me when you think it over a little mean but there was a third reason beyond those two resumed charnock when i saw you dining at the hotel on the night of my arrival when i remembered that you had been living for four months at tarifa where from time to time i had the pleasure to come across you i began for reasons which theres no need to explain to wonder whether you were causing any trouble to mrs warriner that night too if you remember when i went for a stroll here charnock faltered for a second and miranda looked quickly up you followed me major when i sat down at the foot of the bank you crouched upon the top you made a mistake there major for i at once thought it wise to learn what i could of your history and character i accordingly wrote a letter that night to a friend of mine who also happens to be an official at scotland yard his answer you see comes by telegraph and you will see that a reply is prepaid he handed the telegram to the major the major read it through and glanced anxiously towards the door taking up his hat from the table at the same time i think so too said charnock what does the telegram say asked miranda nothing definite but every word of it is suggestive answered charnock i asked my friend if he knew anything of major ambrose wilbraham he wires me yes is he at ronda and prepays the reply if theres a warrant already issued major i dont think i should waste time but you of course are the best judge did you answer it asked the major i have not answered it yet do you think scotland yard will wait for an answer it does not interest me very much the one point which does interest me is this you are hardly in a position to enter into communication with scotland yard in order to revenge yourself on mrs warriner for not paying you blackmail major wilbraham tugged at his moustache his jauntiness had vanished and his face had grown very sombre and tired during the last few minutes i get nothing then not one depreciated spanish dollar there was a knock at the door the major started he looked from charnock to miranda his mouth opened his eyes widened he became at once a creature scared and hunted the door was opened the three people in the patio held their breath but it was merely the postman with a letter for miranda i must get out of here said wilbraham i must get out of ronda my god i have to begin it again have i the hunt for breakfast and dinner he showed a dangerous face at that moment his lips were drawn back from his teeth his eyes furtive and murderous miranda felt very glad of charnocks presence however the major mastered himself he might have taken some sort of revenge by insulting miranda on account of her disposition towards charnock but he did not and it was not fear of charnock which restrained him i go back to the regiment mrs warriner he said the regiment of the soldiers of fortune i have had my furlough four months furlough i cannot complain he endeavoured to speak gaily and to bow with grace goodbye said charnock miranda was implacably silent and they call women the softer sex said the major one moment exclaimed miranda taking no notice of his remark mr wilbraham has a letter from my husband about the daventry gun it is mine answered the major it was written to me i will buy it said charnock for a thousand no for permission to answer this prepaid telegram to scotland yard in your name in my name youre not a bad fellow charnock said the major as he drew out his pocketbook he handed the letter to charnock looked at him curiously and then laughed softly without malice o lover of my life o soldiersaint he quoted a great poet what do you know ralph warriner will you play caponsacchi to his guido you might very likely you will the major took the reply form and turned away it is not always a profitable habit it seems said miranda that habit of following a little mean said the major gently perhaps too a little overdone and as he went out of the patio miranda flushed and felt ashamed then the flush faded from her cheeks and left her white for she was alone with charnock and had to make her account with him chapter xvi explains why charnock saw mirandas face in his mirror miranda rose nervously from her chair she made an effort to speak which failed and then yielding to a peremptory impulse she ran away it was only however into her parlour that she ran and thither charnock followed her she stood up rather quickly in the farthest corner of the room as soon as he entered drew a pattern with her foot upon the floor and tried to appear entirely at her ease she did not look at charnock however on the contrary she kept her eyes upon the ground and felt very much like a schoolgirl who is going to be punished your husband is alive charnocks voice was cold and stern miranda resented it all the more because she knew she deserved nothing less than sternness did you he continued learn that from wilbraham for the first time this morning no she answered and since she had found her voice she added rebelliously no teacher and was at once aware that levity was not in the best of taste charnock perhaps was not at that moment in a mood for jocularities how long have you known that your husband was alive he asked five months she answered who told you you there was a moments pause mirandas foot described more figures on the floor and with great assiduity i beg your pardon said charnock it is very humorous no doubt but it is true interrupted miranda if i had wished to evade you to deceive you i should have answered that mr wilbraham brought me the news this morning i should have disbelieved it you could not at all events have disproved it you would have had not a single word to say she raised her eyes now and confronted him defiantly yes said charnock i admit that and a great change came over miranda she stepped out of her corner she raised her arms above her head like one waking from sleep but i have had my fill of deceptions i am surfeited ask what you will ill answer you and answer you the truth and for one thing this is true you told me ralph warriner was alive that night at lady donnisthorpes i told you on the balcony no before in the ballroom you described him to me you quoted his phrases you had seen him that very morning he was the stranger you quarrelled with in the streets of plymouth and you knew him from my description cried charnock all the anger had gone from his face all the coldness from his voice i remember your face grew so white in the shadow of the alcove i should have believed you had swooned but for the living trouble in your eyes your face became through its pallor and distress the face which i had seen in my mirror oh that mirror and its message he broke into a harsh bitter laugh and seating himself at the table beat upon his forehead with his clenched fists a message of appeal a call for help was there ever such a fool in all the world heres one woman out of all the millions who needs my help i was vain enough to think and the first thing the only thing that i did was to tell her that her outcast bully of a husband was still alive to bully her a fine way to help but i guessed correctly even that night yes even on that night i was afraid that i had revealed to you some misfortune of which you were unaware oh why wasnt i struck dumb before i spoke but you could not have been sure from my description he cried eagerly grasping in his remorse at so poor a straw as that subterfuge for men are not all unlike and they use the same phrases you could not have been certain you must have had some other proof before you were convinced yes that is true and that other proof you got from someone else he said and his voice implored her to assent miranda only shook her head i promised to speak nothing but the truth i got that other proof from you no no he exclaimed let me think no i told you nothing else but just my meeting with the man my quarrel with him yes said miranda you told me how you woke up from dreaming of ralph and saw my face in your mirror dont you see there is the convincing proof that the man you described to me the man you quarrelled with the man you dreamed of was ralph for when you woke with that dream vivid in your mind you saw my face vivid in your mirror you yourself were at a loss to account for it you had never so much as thought of me during the seven years since since our eyes met at monte carlo you could not imagine why on that particular night after you had dreamed of someone else unassociated with me my face should have come back to you but it was no mystery to me the man you dreamed of was not unassociated with me it was my husband and the husband recalled to you the wife by an unconscious trick of memory but i did not know he was your husband cried charnock i had never seen him with you i had never seen him at all before that day i quarrelled with him in the streets of plymouth you had answered miranda gently he was with me that night at monte carlo seven years ago we were on our honeymoon she added with a queer melancholy smile charnock remembered the look of happiness upon her young face and compared it with the tired womans face which he saw now he was with you he exclaimed yes you forgot us both you met him again you did not remember that you had ever seen him but none the less the memory was latent in you and recalled me to you too you could not trace the association but it was very clear to me wait wait said charnock he sat with his elbows on the table and the palms of his hands tightly pressed upon his eyes i can see you as clearly as i saw you then at monte carlo as though you were standing there now in the room and i in the room was watching you you were a little apart from the table you were standing a few feet behind the croupier at one end of the table but ralph warriner was he amongst the players wait let me think charnock remained silent miranda did not interrupt him and in a little he began again piecing together his memories revivifying that scene in the gamblingroom seven years ago i can see the lamps with their green shades i can see the glow of light upon the green table beneath the lamps i can see the red diamond the yellow lines upon the cloth the three columns of numbers in the middle the crowd about the table some seated others leaning over their chairs but their faces their faces and then he suddenly cried out ah he was seated in front of you next to the croupier you were behind him and in his excitement he reached out his arm towards her and with shaking fingers bade her speak yes said she i was behind him you moved to him i understand now his back was towards me at the first when i first saw you when our eyes met it was that vision of you the first which i carried away it was that only which i remembered you standing alone there it was that which came back to me when i saw your face in my mirror just the picture of you as you stood alone distinct from the flowers in your hat to the tip of your shoe before you moved to the table before you laid your hand on ralph warriners shoulder before he turned to answer you and so showed me his face i remember indeed i saw his hand first of all it was reached out holding his stake i can even remember that he laid his stake on impare and then he turned to you yes yes its true and charnock rose from the table in his agitation and walked once or twice across the room it was ralph warriner i met at plymouth and because of that trivial ridiculous quarrel i told you that he lived he stopped suddenly in front of the writingtable and stood staring out through the window while his fingers idly played with a newspaper which lay upon the desk but major wilbraham said miranda thinking to lessen his remorse major wilbraham told me too and only a month later he came to me in the cathedral at ronda here and told me he would have told me in any case wilbraham said charnock yes thats true how did he find out who told wilbraham and he turned eagerly towards miranda miranda stammered and faltered she had not foreseen the question and she tried to evade it he found out he used his wits he saw there was profit in the discovery if he could if he could make the discovery i understand that but how did he make the discovery why what does it matter cried miranda he followed up a clue charnock noticed her hesitation her effort to evade his question but who gave him the clue miranda moved restlessly about the room he set his wits to work he found out she repeated she sat down in the same chair in which charnock had sat what does it matter she said and even as charnock had done she pressed her hands upon her face you promised me to answer truly whatever question i put to you said he who the more she hesitated was the more resolved to know i ask you this question who gave him the clue since you will have it then miranda drew her hands from her face my poor friend you did she answered gently charnock was more than startled his face changed there was something even of horror in his eyes as he leaned across the table towards her i he gasped i did i would have spared you the knowledge of that she said with a smile if only you would have allowed me to but you would not you pointed out to him a brigantine which you passed off ushant yes the tarifa the tarifa was once the ten brothers ralphs yacht which was supposed to have been wrecked on rosevear but the ten brothers was a schooner urged charnock i was told only a few weeks ago at gibraltar one of the salcombe oh yes thats true too i suggested to wilbraham to wilbraham who said he was familiar with the look of the boat i suggested to him that the tarifa was one of the salcombe clippers yes wilbraham had known ralph at gibraltar had seen the ten brothers very likely had been aboard of her that was why the look of the tarifa was familiar to him when you told him the tarifa was a salcombe boat he understood why it was familiar it was the merest clue but he followed it up and found out and blackmailed you continued charnock he turned back to the writingtable and the window again his fingers played idly with the newspaper for a while he was silent then he said slowly do you remember what you said to me on the balcony that no man could offer a woman help without doing her a hurt in some other way i spoke idly interrupted miranda you spoke very truly for heres the proof i spoke to elude you said miranda stubbornly it was a mere idle fancy which came into my head and the next moment was forgotten but i remembered it cried charnock it was more true than you thought it was no more true than she hesitated however charnock was not looking at her she found it possible to proceed than another belief which led me astray as this one is leading you what other belief miranda nerved herself to answer him that no man would serve a woman well except for for the one reason the nature of that reason was apparent to charnock from the very tone in which she spoke the word and you believed that he asked in a movement of surprise he had knocked the newspaper off the writingtable underneath the newspaper was a book i did believe it she replied her face rosy with confusion for a few mad miserable days and she checked herself suddenly for she saw that charnock had absently opened and was absently turning over the leaves of the book was the message of your mirror after all so false she whispered he turned towards her with a face quite illumined he did not however leave the table and he kept the pages of the book open with his fingers then after all you do need help he cried need it she returned with a loud cry and she stretched out hands across the table towards him indeed indeed i need it i desperately need it i sent the glove because i needed it then the glove was no sham it was not the glove that you tore that was thrown away but not by me i searched for it it was not to be found so i tore the other and sent it as a substitute and when i came waited to discover he added whether the one reason held me to your service i understand you see she agreed really in my heart all the time i trusted you for i knew you would keep your word i knew you would say nothing but would just wait and wait until i told you what it was i needed done charnock turned abruptly towards her and as he turned the book slipped off the table and fell to the ground but yesterday he exclaimed in perplexity yesterday here in this room i gave you the assurance which you looked for you believed a man would only help you for the one reason well i told you that the one reason held with me yet at that moment you rejected all help and service you cried out its the friend i want not the lover because just at that moment i understood that my belief was wrong i understood the shame the horror of the tricks i had played on you tricks said charnock oh and as he stooped down to pick up the book he added in a voice of comprehension at last you puzzled me yesterday when you said to possess the friend you had had to make the lover yes she said eagerly you understand i want you to i want you to understand to the last letter so that you may decide whether you will help me or not knowing what the woman is who asks your help i sat down to trick you into caring for me if by any means i could i did it deliberately how deliberately you will see if you only open the book you hold and it wasnt until i had won that i realised that i had cheated to win and could not profit by the gains i won yesterday and yesterday i sent you away perhaps god kept you here charnock made no answer he sat down at the table opposite to miranda and turned over the leaves of the book whilst miranda watched him holding her breath he was not angry yet but she dreaded the moment when he should understand the subjectmatter of the book the book was a collection of letters written by a great french lady at the court of louis xv to a young girlrelative in provence and the letters were intended to serve as a guide to the girls provincial inexperience there was much sage instruction as to the best methods of handling men ces animaux effroyables dont nous ne pouvons ni ne voudrons nous dbarrasser as the great lady politely termed them in the margin of the book mirandas pencil had scored lines against passages here and there charnock read out one et prends bien garde de tellement diriger la conversation quil parle beaucoup de luimme that accounts for the history of my life which i gave you in your garden said charnock he was not angry yet he was even smiling yes said miranda seriously but theres worse go on soyez sage ma mie he read turning over a page on ne possede jamais un de ces animaux sans quon peut bien disposer dun autre celui que tu aimes taimera aussi si tu fais la cour a un deuxime ils ont bien tort qui disent quil ne faut que deux pour faire lamour il faut au moins trois that accounts for wilbraham and the basket of flowers for gibraltar for wilbraham yes said miranda charnock did not notice that she excluded the basket of flowers from her assent he read out other items still without any appearance of anger a foot carelessly exhibited and carefully withdrawn the young lady in the country was informed might kick a hole in any male heart so long as the foot was slim and the shoe all that it should be charnock closed the book and sat opposite to miranda with a laughing face enjoying her intense earnestness so you won by cheating he said and this book taught you how to cheat yes but i dont think you have grasped it she replied seriously and i want you to i want you to understand the horrible hateful way in which i made you care for me i now know that i ought to have relied upon your friendship when you first came to ronda but i chose the worse part and if you say that you will not help me why i must abide by it and ralph must abide by it too but there shall be nothing but truth now between you and me i was not content with friendship i had the time i knew to try to make you care for me in the other way and i did try hatefully and hatefully i succeeded and to mirandas surprise charnock leaned back in his chair and laughed loudly and heartily for a long while the more perplexed miranda looked the more he laughed believe me mrs warriner he said and stopped to laugh again if i had met you for the first time at ronda i should have taken the first train back to algeciras your tricks i noticed them all and they drove me wild with indignation do you mean that exclaimed miranda and her downcast face brightened i do indeed answered charnock oh your tricks i almost hated you for them he began to laugh again as he recollected them i am so glad replied miranda in the prettiest confusion and as charnock laughed in a little her eyes began to dance and she laughed too shall i tell you what kept me at ronda he said because in spite of yourself every now and then yourself broke through the tricks because however much you tried you could not but reveal to me now and then some fleeting glimpse of the woman who once stood beside me in a balcony and looked out over the flashing carriagelights to the quiet of st jamess park it was in memory of that woman that i stayed he was speaking with all seriousness now and miranda uttered a long trembling sigh of gratitude thank you she said thank you now what can i do for you he asked and miranda made haste to reply chapter xvii shows how a tombstone may convince when arguments fail she showed him the scribbled note which m fournier had brought she told him m fourniers story how that ralph had run guns and ammunition from england into morocco on board the tarifa how that he had been kidnapped between m fourniers villa and the towngate how that he was not held to ransom since no demand for ransom had come to the little belgian and finally how that it was impossible to apply for help to the legation since ralph was already guilty of a crime and would only be rescued that way in order to suffer penal servitude in england what a coil to unravel said charnock i know some arabic i could go to morocco i went there once but only to tangier but morocco how shall one search morocco without a clue he rested his chin upon his hand and stared gloomily at the wall miranda was careful not to interrupt his reflections if there was a way out she confidently relied upon this man to find it once she shivered and charnock looked inquiringly towards her she was gazing at the soiled note which lay beneath her eyes upon the table and saw again the picture of ralph being beaten inland under the sun she began to recall his acts and words that she might make the best of them she fell to considering whether she had not herself been in a measure to blame for the shipwreck of their marriage and so thinking of such matters she absently hummed over a tune a soft plaintive little melody from an oprabouffe she ended it and hummed it over again until it came upon her that charnock had been silent for a long time and she looked up from the note into his face he was not thinking out any plan he was watching her with a singular intentness his head thrust forward from his shoulders his face very strained it seemed that every fibre of his body listened and was still so that it might hear the better who taught you that tune he asked in a voice of suspense ralph said she in some surprise at the question at least i picked it up from him and charnock fell back in his chair he huddled himself in it he let his chin drop upon his breast he sat staring at her with eyes which seemed suddenly deepsunk in a face suddenly grown white and slowly gradually it broke in upon miranda that he held the clue after all that that tune was the clue that in a word charnock knew how ralph had disappeared you know she cried in her elation you know oh and i sent you away yesterday what if you had gone only to think of it you know that tune has given you the clue it was ralphs favourite you heard it when where tell me to her eager joyous questions charnock was silent he did not move he still sat huddled in his chair with his chin fallen on his breast and his eyes fixedly staring at her mirandas enthusiasm was chilled by his silence it was succeeded by fear she became frightened she picked up the note and held it out to him and bade it speak for her charnock did not take the note or change his position but he said even on your honeymoon you see he left you to stand alone while he gambled at the tables but you mustnt think of that she cried its so small a thing but so typical added charnock quietly miranda gave a moan and held her head between her hands that charnock might refuse to help her because with tears in her eyes she had played the sedulous coquette she had been prepared to acknowledge but that he would refuse to help out of a mistaken belief that by refusing to help he was helping best that supposition had not so much as occurred to her read the note again she implored him do quickly what you can and see it is a week and more since m fournier was here it is a fortnight and more since ralph was kidnapped in the sk quickly and nothing is done and nothing will be done unless you do it oh think of him driven his hands tied beaten with sticks sold for a slave to trudge with loads upon his back barefooted through morocco you will go and her voice broke and was very tender as she appealed to him please you will have pity on me and on him and she watched charnocks face for a sign of assent her heart throbbing her foot beating the ground and every now and then a queer tremulous moan breaking from her dry lips charnock however did not soften at the imagined picture of ralphs misfortunes and he hardened his heart against the visible picture of her distress when i was at algeciras i asked many questions about ralph warriner i listened to many answers he said curtly exaggerated answers she returned and as charnock opened his mouth to reply she hastened to continue listen listen heres the strange thing not that i should need help not that you should help me not that i should come to you for help those three things they are most natural but that coming to you i should come to the one man who can help who already knows the way to help dont you understand it is very clear to me you were meant to help to help me in this one trouble so you were shown the means whereby to help and seeing charnock still impenetrable she burst out oh he will not help he will not understand and she took to considering how it was that he knew how it was that he recognised the tune you were in tangier once she argued yes you told me that not only today but at lady donnisthorpes you crossed from gibraltar yes just before i came to england and met you just before still you wont understand you find out somehow somehow in tangier you come across a tune an incident something immediately after you meet a woman at the first sight of whom you offer her your succour and the time comes when she needs it and that one incident you witnessed just before you met her gives you and you alone in all the world the opportunity to help her dont you remember when you first were introduced at lady donnisthorpes what was your first feeling one of disappointment because i did not seem to stand in any need well i do stand in need now and now you turn away and for my sake too was there ever such a tangle such a needless irony and tangle and all because a man cannot put a woman from his thoughts and then she laughed bitterly and harshly and so fell back again upon her guesses you were in tangier how long for a day when never mind i know i met you in june you were in tangier for a day in may in may she repeated and stopped then she uttered a cry may that was the month m fournier said may you were the man and leaning forward she laid a clutching hand upon charnocks arm which lay quiet on the table you were the unknown man who cried look out through the closed door of m fourniers shop charnock started he was prepared to deny the challenge if assent threatened to disclose his clue but it did not m fournier knew nothing of the blind beggar at the cemetery gate where charnock had first heard the comic opera tune and registered it in his memory that was evident since in all m fourniers story there was no mention anywhere of hassan akbar yes he admitted it was i and you shouted it not as a menace so m fournier thought and was wrong but as a warning to ralph my husband whom you will not speak a word to save you spoke a word then very likely you saved him then well do just as much now i ask no more of you only speak the word tell me the clue i myself will follow it up oh he will not speak and in her agitation she rose up and paced the room charnock rose too miranda flew to the door and leaned her back against it just for a moment listen to what m fournier said he said that if once we could lay our hands upon the man who shouted through the door we should lay our hands upon the means to rescue ralph think how truly he spoke in a truer sense than he intended you know why he disappeared you know who captured him and if you dont speak i shall have no peace until i die and she sat herself again at the table do you still care for him asked charnock with some gentleness miranda who was wrought almost to frenzy drummed upon the table with her clenched fists must we debate that question while ralph then she mastered herself i know you she said if i were to tell you that i loved him heart and soul you would go upon this errand straight as an arrow for my sake but i promised there should be nothing but truth between you and me i do not love him now will you go to morocco or if you will not go will you speak no let him stay there where he cannot harm you what if i was meant to keep you from rescuing him you do not know she replied you can do me no greater service than by rescuing ralph by bringing him back to me will you believe that no said he calmly and she rose from her chair but if i proved it to you you cannot i will she looked at the clock it is four oclock she said two hours and a quarter before the train leaves for algeciras will you meet me on the platform i had thought to spare myself this but you shall have the proof i will not tell you of it but i will show it to you tomorrow at gibraltar she spoke now with great calmness she had hit upon the means to persuade she was convinced that she had and he was afraid that she had very well said he the for algeciras they travelled to gibraltar that night miranda stayed at the bristol charnock at the albion they met the next morning and walked through the long main street here and there an officer looked at her with a start of surprise and respectfully raised his hat and perhaps took a step or two towards her but she did not stop to speak with anyone it was two years since she had set foot within the gates of gibraltar and no doubt the stones upon which she walked had many memories wherewith to bruise her charnock respected her silence and kept pace with her unobtrusively they passed into the square with government house upon the one side and the messrooms upon the other charnock sketched a picture of her in his fancies the picture of a young girl newlycome from the brown solitudes of suffolk into this crowded and picturesque fortress with the wonder of a new world in her eyes and contrasted it with the woman who walked beside him and inferred the increasing misery of her years he was touched to greater depths of sympathy than he had ever felt before even when she had lain with her head upon her arms in an abandonment of distress so that now the uncomplaining uprightness of her figure made his heart ache and the sound of her footsteps was a pain but of the most intolerable of all her memories he had still to learn she led him into the little cemetery guided him between the graves and stopped before a headstone on which charnock read rupert warriner aged years and the date of his birth and death the headstone was of marble and had been sculptured with a poetic fancy a boy in whose face charnock could trace a likeness to miranda looked out and laughed between the open lattices of a window they both watched the grave silently for a while then miranda said gently now do you understand when rupert was born it seemed to me that here was a blossom on the thorn bush of the world but you see the blossom never flowered he died of diphtheria it was hard when he died and charnock suddenly started at her side those flowers he said hoarsely upon the grave were scattered jonquils geraniums roses pinks camellias all the rich reds and yellows of mirandas garden you were cutting them packing them that afternoon when wilbraham came mrs warriner shrank from looking at charnock yes she confessed in a whisper my god he exclaimed miranda glanced at him in fear so it was coming he was remembering the use to which she had put those flowers would he loathe her sufficiently to withdraw his help do you know what i thought he continued no you cant guess you could not imagine it i actually believed that you were cutting those flowers so that you might send them to and he broke off the sentence but its too odious to tell you but i meant you should believe just that she cried i meant you to believe it oh how utterly hateful how could i have done it i wanted to hide that from you but it was right you should know i must have been mad and she convulsively clasped and unclasped her hands i understand why you dropped that bunch from the cliff said charnock after wilbraham had picked a flower from it i wanted to bring you here said miranda so that you might know why i ask this service of you as i told you i have no love left for ralph but he was that boys father and the boy is dead i cannot leave ralph in morocco a slave he was ruperts father perhaps you remember that after i met you at lady donnisthorpes i came back at once to ronda i had half determined not to return at all and when you first told me ralph was alive my first absorbing thought was where should i hide myself but it occurred to me that he might be in need and he was ruperts father so i came back and when wilbraham blackmailed me i submitted to the blackmail again because he was ruperts father and because he was ruperts father when i learned in what sore need he stood i sent that glove to you i understand said charnock and they turned and walked from the cemetery now will you speak she asked no he returned but i will go myself to morocco it is your life i am asking you to risk said miranda who now that she had gained her end began at once to realise the consequences it would entail upon her friend i know that and take the risk replied charnock they walked out towards europa point and turned into the alameda there is something else said miranda your search will cost money every farthing of that i must pay you will promise me that yes i wrote to m fournier yesterday he will supply you there is one thing more this search will interrupt your career it will no doubt he assented readily and sitting down upon a seat he spoke to her words which she never forgot the quaint thing is that i have always been afraid lest a woman should break my career i lived as a boy high up on the yorkshire hills two miles above a busy town all day that town whirred in the hollow below i could see it from my bedroom window and all night the lights blazed in the factories and when i went down into its streets there were always grimed men speeding upon their business there was a certain grandeur about it which impressed me the perpetual shuffle of the looms the loud clear song of the wheels that seemed to me the life to live and i made up my mind that no woman should interfere a brake on the wheel going up hill a whip in the drivers hand going down that was what i thought of woman until i met you and proved it true cried miranda and learned that there are better things than getting on said charnock miranda turned to him with shining eyes and in a voice which left him in no doubt as to the significance of her words she cried my dear we are loves derelicts you and i and so stopped and said no more they went back to the hotel and lunched together and came out again to the geraniums and bellas sombras of the alameda but they talked no more in this strain they were just a man and a woman and the flaming sword kept their lips apart but they knew it and were not aggrieved for being a man and a woman they knew not grievances the evening came down upon gibraltar the riding lanterns glimmered upon the masts in the bay away to the left the lighthouse on europa point shot out its yellow column of light above the spanish sky grew purple and rich with innumerable stars the boat leaves early said charnock i will say goodbye now miranda caught the hand which he held out to her and held it against her breast but i shall see you again once please once she said when you bring ralph back to me and so they separated in the alameda charnock walked away and left her standing there nor looked back stray lines and verses of ballads which he had heard sung by women in drawingrooms here and there about the world came back to him ballads of knights and cavaliers who had ridden away at their ladies behests he had laughed at them then but they came back to him now and he felt himself linked through them in a community of feeling with the generations which had gone before men had gone out upon such errands as he was now privileged to do and would do so again when he was dust with just the same pride which he felt as he walked homewards on this night through the streets of gibraltar he realised as he had never realised before through the fellowship of service that in bone and muscle and blood he was of the family of men son of the men who had gone before father of the men who were to follow the next morning he crossed the straits to tangier chapter xviii in which the taxidermist and a basha prevail over a blind man he went at once to the taxidermists shop m fournier expected him but not the story which he had to tell you wish to discover the man who shouted through your door six months ago said charnock it was i m fournier got together his accountbooks and laid them on the counter of the shop i have much money where is my friend mr jeremy bentham it is hassan akbar whom we must ask said charnock and he told fournier of what he had seen on the day of his previous visit to tangier the two men walked up to the cemetery gate where hassan still sat in the dust and swung his body to and fro and reiterated his cry allah ben as on that day when clothed as a moor ralph warriner had come down the hill it was the tune which that moor had hummed and which miranda had repeated that had led charnock to identify the victim and the enemy charnock hummed over that tune again as he stood beside the moor and the moor stopped at once from his prayer hassan akbar what hast them done with the christian who hummed that tune and dropped a silver dollar in thy lap at this gate hassan made no answer and as though his sole anxiety had been lest warriner should have escaped and returned he recommenced his cry hassan continued charnock was it that christian who betrayed thy wealth give him back to us and thou shalt be rich again allah beh cried hassan allah beh it is of no use for us to question him said m fournier but the basha will ask him and in time he will answer tomorrow i will go to the basha charnock hardly gathered the purport of fourniers proposal he went back into the town and that evening m fournier related to him much about ralph warriner which he did not know the idea of running guns in morocco had appealed to warriner some time before he put it into practice and whilst he was still at gibraltar i did not know him then said fournier he had relations with others very likely with hassan akbar but nothing came of those relations when he ran from gibraltar in the ten brothers he landed at tangier and lay hid somewhere in the town while he sent the ten brothers over to south america and ordered the mate to sell her for as much as she would fetch but in a little while ralph warriner met me and asked me to be his partner in his scheme he had a little money then and indeed it was just about the time when hassans fortune was discovered it is very likely that our friend told the basha of hassans wealth if he knew he would certainly have told said m fournier with a lenient smile for there was money in it anyway he had some money then i had some i could get more and i like him very much i say yes he tells me of his ship we want a ship to carry over the guns i telegraph to the argentine and stop the sale warriner sent orders to change her rig as he call it and her name and she comes back to us as the tarifa the only trouble left was this the most profitable guns to introduce are the winchester rifles but for that purpose one of us must go between england and tangier must sail the tarifa between england and tangier i could not sail a toyboat in a pond without falling into the water how then could i sail the tarifa so warriner must do it but warriner my poor dear friend he has made little errors he must not go to england not even as bentham to make it safe for jeremy bentham to go to england ralph warriner must be dead you see yes i see but why in the world did he call himself jeremy bentham asked charnock because he was such an economist oh but he was very witty and clever my poor friend when he was not swearing at you at all events he decided that ralph warriner must die and that there must be proofs that he was dead so he packed up a few letters one from his wife before he was married to her that was clever hein a loveletter from his fiance which he has carried about next to his heart for six years so sweet so convincing to the great british public eh he found that letter by chance among his charts he gives it to me and some others in an oilskin case and sends me with one of his sailors to the scilly islands and then providence helped us all that we hoped to do was to hear of a wreck in which many lives were lost to go out amongst the rocks where the ship was wrecked and to pick up that little oilskin case you understand oh but we were helped there was a heavy storm for many days at scilly and after the storm for many days a fog on one day the sailor and i we go out in the fog to the western islands to see if any ship had come ashore but it was dangerous i can tell you it was very dangerous and very wet however we come to rosevear and there was the remnant of a ship and no sailor anywhere we landed on rosevear and just as i was about to place the oilskin case among the rocks where it would be naturally found we came upon one dead sailor lying near to the sea just as if asleep i slipped the oilskin case into his pocket and then with stones we broke in his face ah but that was horrible it made me sick then and there but we did it until there was no face left then for fear the waves might come up and wash him away we dragged him up the rocks and laid him amongst the grass again as though he was asleep we made a little mistake there we dragged him too far from the sea but the mistake did not matter i see said charnock and that day i shouted through the door warriner sailed for england yes replied fournier i hired that morning a felucca to sail himself across to tarifa i remember the boat lay at tarifa he set sail that night yes said charnock i spent the night here i waited two days for the p and o at gibraltar we passed the tarifa off ushant and three days later i met warriner in plymouth yes the times fit it is very likely ralph who told about hassan mused m fournier with a lenient smile if he knew he would have been sure to have told for there was money in it tomorrow i will see the basha m fournier went down to the kasbah and found the basha delivering justice at the gates the suitors were dismissed and m fournier opened his business we do not wish to trouble the legation said he the legation would make much noise and his shereefian majesty whom god preserve would never hear the end of it besides we do not wish it and upon that money changed hands but if the englishman told your nobility that hassan akbar was hoarding his money in utter selfishness then your nobility will talk privately with hassan and find out from him where the englishman is the basha stroked his white beard the nazarene speaks wisely we will not disturb the dignity of his majesty whom allah preserve for such small things i will talk to hassan akbar and send for you again that impenetrable man was fetched from the cemetery gates and the basha addressed him hassan thou didst hide and conceal thy treasure and truly the room told me of it and since thy treasure was of no profit to thee i took it when i was blind and helpless said hassan so thou wast chastened the more thoroughly for thy profit in the next world and thy master and my master the sultan was served in this said the basha with great dignity and he reverently bowed his head to the dust now what hast thou done with the room but hassan answered never a word thou stubborn man may allah burn thy greatgreatgrandfather said the basha and chained his hands and his feet and had him conveyed to an inner room where he talked to him with rods of various length and thickness at the end of the third day the basha sent a message to m fournier that hassans heart was softened by the goodness of god and that now he would speak the basha received charnock and m fournier in a great cool domed room of latticework and tiles he sat upon cushions on a dais at the end of the room stools were brought forward for his visitors and m fournier and the basha exchanged lofty compliments and drank much weak sweet tea then the basha raised his hand a door was thrown open and a blind wavering broken man crawled dragging his fetters across the floor good god whispered charnock what have they done to him they have made him speak that is all returned m fournier imperturbably he kept all his pity for ralph warriner m fournier translated afterwards to charnock the story which hassan told as he grovelled on the ground and it ran as follows when the son of the english first came into morocco i showed him great kindness and hospitality and how he returned it you know so after i was blind i waited more than once i heard his voice in the sk and in the streets of tangier and i knew that he had quarrelled with his own people the nazarenes and dared not turn to them for help i sit by the gate of the cemetery and many arabs and moors and negroes and jews come down the road from the country to the marketplace and at last one morning i heard the steps of one whose feet shuffled in his babouches he could not walk in the loose slippers as we who are born to the use of them and it was not an old man whose feet are clogged by age for his stride was long that my ears told me which are my eyes it was an infidel in the dress of the faithful it may be that if i had seen with my eyes i should never have known but my ears are sharpened and i heard when he passed me he gave me greeting and then i knew it was the room he dropped a dollar into my hands and whistled a tune which he had often whistled after he had eaten of my kousskouss and so went on his way i rose up and followed him thinking that my time had come across the sk i followed him hearing always the shuffle of the slippers amidst the din of voices and the hurrying of many feet he did not see me for he never turned or stopped but went straight on under the gate of the town and then turned through the horsemarket and came to a house which he entered i heard the door barred behind him and a shutter fixed across the window and i sat down beneath the shutter and waited i heard voices talking quickly and earnestly within the room and then someone rose and came out of the door and walked down the street towards the port but it was not the man for whom i waited this one walked with little jaunty tripping steps and i was glad that he went away for the bolt of the door was not shut behind him and the dog of a nazarene was alone i rose and walked to the door a son of the english stood in the way i asked him for alms with the one hand and felt for the latch with the other but the son of the english saw what i was doing and shouted through the door it was i said charnock hassan turned his sightless face towards charnock and reflected then he answered it was indeed you and after you had spoken the bolt was shot thereupon i went back to the sk and asking here and there at last fell in with some arabs from beni hassan with whom in other days i had traded and for a long while i talked to them showing that there was no danger for the room was without friends amongst his own people and moreover that he would fetch a price every okesa of which was theirs and at the last they agreed with me that i should deliver him to them at night outside the walls of tangier and they would take him away and treat him ill and sell him for a slave in their own country but the room had gone from tangier and the arabs moved to tetuan and omara and skettrun but after a while they returned to tangier and the room also returned and the time i had waited for had come what have you done with him said the basha speak i besought a lad who had been my servant to watch the room bentham and his goings and comings with the dollar which he had given me i bought a little old tent of palmetto and set it up in the corner of the sk apart from the tents of the cobblers well interrupted m fournier speak quickly one evening the lad came to me and said the room had gone up to a house on the hill above the sk where there were many lights and much noise of feasting so i went down the sk to where the arabs slept by their camels and said to them it will be tonight and as god willed it the night was dark the lad led me to the house and i sat outside it till the noise grew less and many went away at last the nazarene bentham came to the door and his mule was brought for him and he mounted i asked the boy who guided me is it he and the boy answered yes so i dismissed him and followed the mule down the hill to the sk which was very quiet then i ran after him and called and he stopped his mule till i came up with him what is it he asked and i threw a cloth over his head and dragged him from the mule we both fell to the ground but i had one arm about his neck pressing the cloth to his mouth so that he could not cry out i pressed him into the mud of the sk and put my knee upon his chest and bound his arms together then i carried him to my tent and took the cloth from his head for i wished to hear him speak and be sure that it was bentham but he understood my wish and would not speak so i took his mulehobbles which i had stolen while he feasted and made them hot in a fire and tied them about his ankles and in a little while i made him cry out and i was sure then i stripped him of his clothes and put upon him my own rags the arabs came to the tent an hour later i gagged bentham and gave him up to them bound and in the dark they took him away with the mule his clothes i buried in the ground under my tent and in the morning stamped the ground down and took the tent away and the chief of these arabs give me his name said the basha mallam juzeed replied hassan the basha waved his hand to the soldiers and hassan was dragged away i will send a soldier with you give you a letter to the sheikh of beni hassan and he will discover the room if he is to be found in those parts said the basha to m fournier charnock spent the greater part of a month in formalities he took the letter from the basha and many other letters to jews of importance in the towns with which m fournier was able to provide him he hired the boy hamet who had acted as his guide on his first visit and getting together an equipment as for a long journey in morocco rode out over the hill of the two seas into the inlands of that mysterious and enchanted country chapter xix tells of charnocks wanderings in morocco and of a walnutwood door in the course of time charnock came to a village of huts enclosed within an impenetrable rampart of cactus upon the flank of the hills southward of mequinez and there met the sheikh the sheikh laid his hands upon mallam juzeed and bade him speak which he did with a wise promptitude it was true they had taken the christian from tangier but they had sold him on the way they had chanced to arrive at the great houseless and treeless plain of seguedla a days march from alkasar on a wednesday and since every wednesday an open market is held upon two or three low hills which jut out from the plain they had sold ralph warriner there to a travelling merchant of the mtoga mallam supplied the merchants name and the direction of his journey charnock packed his tents upon his mules and disappeared into the south for two years he disappeared or almost disappeared almost since through the freemasonry of the jews that great telephone across barbary by which the jew at tangier shall hear the words which the jew speaks at tafilet m fournier was able to obtain now and again rare news of charnock and as it were a rare glimpse of him at saforo at marakesch at tarudant and to supply him with money then came a long interval until a jew of the waddoon stopped fournier in the sk of tangier handed him a letter and told him that many months ago as he rode at nightfall down a desolate pass of the upper atlas mountains he came to an inhospitable wilderness of stones where one in moorish dress and speaking the moorish tongue was watching the antics of a snakecharmer by the light of a scanty fire of brushwood the moor had two servants with him but no escort and no tent and for safetys sake the jew stayed with him that night in the morning the moor had given him the letter to m fournier and had bidden him say that he was well in that letter charnock told in detail the history of his search how he had held to his clue how he had missed it and retraced his steps how he had followed the merchant to figuig on the borders of algeria and back how he had gone south into the country of sus and was now returning northwards to mequinez he had discarded the escort because if a protection to himself it was a warning to the arabs with whom he fell in they grew wary and shut their lips distrusting him distrusting his business and since he could speak arabic before he had picked up sufficient of the moghrebbin dialect what with his dark face and hamet to come to his aid to pass muster as a native m fournier sent the letter on to mrs warriner at ronda who read it and reread it and blamed her selfishness in sending any man upon such an errand and wondered why she of all women in the world should have found a man ready to do her this service many a time as she looked from her window over the valley she speculated what his thoughts were as he camped in the nightair on the plains and among the passes did his thoughts turn to ronda did he see her there obtruding a figure of a monstrous impertinence and vanity for she had asked of him what no woman had a right to ask his frank confession of how he had defined women came back to her with a pitiless conviction a brake on the wheel going up hill a whip in the drivers hand going down it was true it was true she was the instance which proved it true there were unhappy months for miranda of the balcony at times jane holt would be wakened from her sleep by a great cry and getting from her bed she would walk round the landing halfway up the patio to mirandas bedroom only to find it empty she would descend the staircase and coming into the little parlour would discover miranda leaning out of the open window and looking down to a certain angle of the winding road she had dreamed she had seen in her dream charnock with his two servants encamped upon a hillside or on a plain and hooded figures in long robes crawling creeping towards them crouching behind boulders or writhing their bodies across fields of flowers she saw him too in the narrow dim alleys of ruined towns lured through a doorway behind impenetrable walls and then robbed for his money and tortured for his creed at such times the sight of that road whence he had looked upwards to her window was a consolation almost a confutation of her dreams there at that visible corner of the road underneath these same stars and the same purple sky charnock had sat and gazed at this window from which she leaned he could not be dead and carried away by a feverish revulsion she would at times come to fancy that he had returned that he was even now seated on the bank by the roadside that but for the gloom she would surely distinguish him that in spite of the gloom she could faintly distinguish him and so her cousin would speak to her and with some commonplace excuse that the night was hot miranda would get her back to her room these were terrible months for miranda of the balcony and the months lengthened and again no news came miranda began to wonder whether she had only sent charnock out to meet ralphs disaster to become a slave beaten and whipped and shackled and driven this way and that through the barbarous inlands the months were piled one upon the other the weight of their burden could be measured by the changes in mirandas bearing her cheeks grew thin her manner feverish the mere slamming of a door would fling the blood into her face like scarlet an unexpected entrance set her heart racing till it stifled her meanwhile charnock had long ceased to be troubled by the interruption of his career he moved now across wide prairies of iris and asphodel under a blazing african sun with perhaps a single palm tree standing naked somewhere within view or a cluster of dwarf olives he halted now for the night under a sinister sky on a dark plain which stretched to the horizon level as the sea he would skirt a hill and come unawares upon some white town of vast gaunt crumbling walls that ran out for no reason into the surrounding country and for no reason stopped he passed beneath their ruined crenellations under the great gateways into the tortuous and dark streets where men noiseless and sombre went their shrouded way there were nights too when he sat with a mouser pistol in his hand searching the darkness until the dawn the continent he had left behind seemed very far away the echo of its clamours diminished the hurry of its conflicts became unreasonable and strange he was in a country where the moss upon the palace roofs was itself of an immemorial antiquity where neither the face of the country nor the ways of those who lived on it had changed he had waited as he turned his back upon a town in the violet sunset to see the white flags break out upon the tops of the minarets and the mueddins appear he had waited for their cry allah akbar and for the great plaintive moan of prayer which rose to answer it from the terraces the bazaars from every corner of the town and which trembled away with infinite melancholy over infinite plains allah akbar allah akbar from those very minarets during long successive centuries a mueddin at just that hour had uttered just that cry so that the mueddin became nothing but the cry echoed down the years and just that same answer had risen and trembled out in just the same plaintive mournfulness so that those who prayed became of no account and the prayer repeated by the generations the one thing which lived charnock used to halt upon his road turn his face backwards to the town and picture to himself that from east to west the whole continent of africa was murmurous with that one prayer that the atlantic carried away the sound of it upon its receding waves and that the nile floated it down from village to village through the soudan he ceased to wonder at the indifference the passivity the fatalism of these mysterious men amongst whom he lived for he felt something of that fatalism invading himself he continued his search northwards from the atlas escaping here a band of robbers there struggling in the whirl of a swollen stream listening at night to the cries of the jackals and yielding to the witchery of a monotonous arab flute into which one servant blew a few yards away while hamet in a high strident voice chanted a no less monotonous song he continued his search almost because it was written until on a dull afternoon he came to mequinez with its palaces of dead kings which rise up one behind the other draped in golden lichens vast roofs stretching away into the distance green and grey with the whipping of rains tower overtopping tower crumbling crenellations of wall silent oppressive each palace shut and barred after its master was dead and left so to frown into decay and make a habitation for the storks to this city charnock tracked the merchant and taking up his abode in the mellah with a jew to whom m fournier had recommended him he walked out through the streets beneath the walls of the palaces neither inquiring for the merchant nor scanning the faces of the passersby but wrapped in his burnous careless of any cry impenetrable unobservant until he came out of the darkness of a bazaar and saw right before his eyes a door the door was set in a wall perhaps sixty feet high charnock could not see the top for the narrowness of the street blank and menacing in the sinister light the wall towered up before his eyes and reached out to the right and to the left and at the foot of the wall was the door a door of walnut wood studded with copper nails and the nails were intricately ordered in a geometrical figure impossible for the eye to unravel that charnock already knew he had made trial before now to unravel those geometrical figures once very long ago and very far away in the white sunlit street of a spanish town charnock stood and stared at the door and the spanish town loomed larger before his vision drew nearer moved towards him first slowly then quickly then in a rush ronda ronda the town as it were swept over him he seemed to wake he seemed to stand again in the street to his right was the chasm of the tajo and the bridge and the boiling torrent behind that door lived and these two years slipped from him like a cloak with an unconscious movement of his hands he pushed the hood back from his forehead and stood bareheaded and alert he was again one of the hurrying strenuous curious folk who live beyond the straits he gazed at the door behind that doors fellow miranda lived and waited even as the thought burned through his mind the door opened for a moment charnock imagined that miranda herself would step out but only a moor came forth from an interview with the basha and a ragged decrepit greybeard of a servant attended on the moor and made his path charnock was in an instant aware of a grey light filtering between the squalid rooftops of the filth of the streets of the tottering walls of mulai ismail he was in mequinez and at mequinez the long two years should end and in ending bear their fruit that door on which his eyes were set augured as much nay promised it not a sparrow shall fall just for this reason centuries ago a moorish conqueror had taken these slabs of walnut wood in spain and brought them back upon the shoulders of his slaves and made his door from them and set it in his wall at mequinez just that charnock coming to this spot centuries afterwards might be quickened in his service towards a woman and gird himself about with the memory of things which were growing dim and be assured the service should not fail charnock was uplifted to believe it he drew the hood again about his head and the voice of the mueddin called the world to prayer through the open doors of the mosques from the white walls glimmering in the dimness within those doors from the streets from the houses the highpitched tremulous prayer rose and declined in an arc of sound charnock felt his whole being throb exultantly at mequinez yes and tonight his search would end surely tonight for the hour after the evening prayer was the hour for the selling of slaves charnock walked to the market and sat himself down in the first dim corner he did not choose a place prominent and visible inviting whosoever had wares to sell he took the first seat which offered certain that wherever he sat ralph warriner would be brought to him he sat down and looked about him some half a dozen men were grouped about the market talking a young negress from the soudan a white moorish girl a young negro from timbuctoo were brought to them in turn they examined their teeth their arms their feet the moorish girl was bought the others passed on each with the owner they were followed by the moor whom charnock had seen step from the bashas door he wished to sell his decrepit greybeard and was met with laughter wheresoever he turned these were all the slaves in the market charnock did not lose heart at any moment within the next few minutes the narrow entrance to the market might darken and ralph warriners owner thrust ralph warriner in at some moment that would happen did warriner still shuffle in the moorish slippers as he walked charnock found himself asking the question with a curious lightheartedness the negress was offered to him and then the negro he refused them with a gesture he lent an ear to the rustling whispering traffic of the streets outside he listened patiently confidently for the sound of a shuffling footstep to emerge and grow distinct and more distinct the moor brought his greybeard to charnocks corner charnock held his head aside and listened for the loose slapslap of the slipper upon the mud the moor spoke was importunate charnock waved him aside impatiently but as he waved his arm he turned his head and then he suddenly reached out a hand while his heart leaped in his throat ten dollars he said the moor began to expatiate on the merits of his slave he was still strong he could carry heavy loads and for far distances charnock was impatient to interrupt to pay the price when he had turned his head suddenly for an instant he had looked straight into the greybeards eyes and they were the blue eyes which had stared into his once how many centuries ago through the window of a hansom cab in a noisy street of plymouth charnock had no doubt other moors had blue eyes and in no other feature of this wizened haggard creature but his eyes could he trace a resemblance to ralph warriner but he had no doubt all the intuitions of the last halfhour came to his aid he remembered the door the call to prayer this was ralph warriner and he had almost let him pass had he not turned by mere accident just at the one moment when the greybeards eyes were raised he would have lost his chance now and forever warriner would have perished in his servitude would have dropped somewhere on the plain under a load too heavy and lain there until nightfall brought the jackals the thought took charnock at the throat left him struggling for his breath so near had he been to failing when he must not fail he began to fear at once that another purchaser might step in while the moor was still exaggerating his goods yet he must not interrupt he must give no sign of anxiety lest he should awaken suspicion he must bargain with extreme indifference while a fever burnt in all his blood thirty dollars the moor proposed charnock shrugged his shoulders and shook his head the moor turned away the slave followed the master charnock clenched his hands together under the folds of his sleeves to prevent them reaching out and clasping the man the merchant walked slowly for a few yards at the entrance of the market there was a sudden obscurity a tall man blocked the way entered and stopped before the merchant and his slave charnocks heart died within him but the man only laughed and passed on charnock felt all his muscles relax as his suspense ended for now surely the slave would be brought back the merchant turned slowly warriner turned obediently behind him and the obedience went to charnocks heart it spoke of a discipline too hideous slowly the owner returned to charnock it seemed that he would never speak twentyfive dollars he said with an effort charnock mastered his face and controlled his body twenty he returned and spoke of the slaves age and how little need he had of him he heard the newcomer across the market haggling over the negro from timbuctoo and at last at last the word was spoken the man he had come to search for was his and his inalienably so long as he remained in any corner of morocco charnock paid the money he did not so much as glance again at his slave he rose from his seat follow me he said to warriner in moghrebbin and one behind the other mirandas lover and mirandas husband master and slave passed out of the market and down the street towards the gate of mequinez chapter xx charnock like the taxidermist finds warriner anything but a comfortable companion on the way charnock stopped at the fondak where hamet slept and bade the lad saddle the mules and bring them out of the town hamet looked surprised for nightfall was an ill time to start upon a journey near the country of the lemur tribes but he was accustomed to obey charnocks new slave did not even show surprise leaving hamet to follow him charnock passed through the gate he dreaded to remain in the town lest by some misfortune he might lose his slave and besides a nausea for its smells and its dirt began to gain upon him he walked down the slope of the hill to the olive trees and the mossy turf lepers of an unimaginable aspect dragged by the side of the beaten track and begged robbers who for their crimes had had their eyes burnt out kept pace with him their eyelids closed upon red and empty sockets dead horses mules and camels were scattered by the way their carcases half devoured everywhere were ruins and things decaying and things decayed and over all was a sky of unbroken cloud and a chill lugubrious light charnock observed his surroundings with newlyopened eyes and hurried on till he reached the olives then he stopped and turned to watch for hamets coming he turned a trifle suddenly and his slave instinctively shrank away and stood submissive and mute stilled by a long companionship with despair and this was a captain of her majestys artillery who had sailed his yacht in and out of gibraltar bay my god how you must have suffered cried charnock and he spoke in the english tongue warriner raised a dazed halfwitted face say that again he said slowly and he spoke in arabic my god how you must have suffered warriner listened with one forefinger uplifted he moved his finger backwards and forwards sawing the air yes he answered and this time in english but his mouth was awkward and the english came rustily from his tongue yes it has been a hell of a time he spoke in a quite expressionless voice but whether it was that the forgotten sound of the tongue he used awoke in his dim mind faint associations and a glimmer of memories of a sudden he dropped upon the turf amidst the olive trees and burying his face in the moss sobbed violently like a child charnock let him lie there until he saw hamet leading the mules down the beaten way from the towngates then he bent down and touched warriner on the shoulder here is my servant do you understand my servant the white mans pride answered the summons warriner got quickly to his feet and drew a ragged sleeve across his face then he looked round between the withered olives at that grey cruel ruin of a city looming through the falling desolate light and shivered his eyes lighted upon hamet and suddenly opened wide those mules he said almost fiercely they are yours yes let us ride o dear god let us ride and until hamet reached them his head darted this way and that while his eyes searched the trees mind you bought me he said i belong to you to no one else how far from here to the sea nine days nine days and he counted them over on his fingers hamet brought up the mules charnock unrolled a burnous and a turban warriner plucked off his rags and put on the dress then the three men rode out between the olive trees past the outer rampart of breached walls into the open plain shall we camp said charnock warriner cast a look across his shoulder mequinez was still visible a greyer blot upon the grey hillside no said he they rode forward over carpets of flowers between the hills the light fell the marigolds paled beneath their mules feet the gentians became any flower of a light hue at last a toothed savage screen of rock moved across mequinez here said warriner he tumbled rather than dismounted from his mule stretched his limbs out upon the grass and in a moment was asleep hamet gathered a bundle of leaves from a dwarf palm tree and a few sticks lit a fire and cooked their supper charnock woke warriner who ate his meal and slept again and all that night with a mouser pistol in his hand charnock sat by his side and guarded him the next morning they started betimes they passed a caravan farther on a tentvillage and towards evening from the shoulder of a hill they looked down upon the vast plain of the sebou level as a sea it stretched away until the distinct colours of its flowerpatches merged into one soft blue eight days said warriner and that night as last night he asked no questions of charnock but ate his supper and so slept and that night again charnock sat by his side and guarded him but the next morning warriner for the first time began to evince some curiosity as to his rescue and the man who had rescued him the two men had just bathed in a little stream which ran tinkling through the grass beside their camp warriner was kneeling upon the bank of the stream and contemplating himself in the clear mirror of its water when he said to charnock how in the world did you know me by your eyes we are not strangers eh i hailed you from a hansom cab once outside lloyds bank in plymouth you expressed an amiable wish that i should sit in that cab and rot away in my boots lucky for you i didnt you were the man who jammed his finger i remember i thought you had got a warrant in your pocket by the way and he lifted his head quickly you never i suppose came across a man called wilbraham ambrose yes yes when did you come across him he was blackmailing your wife oh my wife said warriner suddenly as though it had only just occurred to him that he had a wife he turned his head and looked curiously to charnock who was scrubbing himself dry some yards behind him so you know my wife yes ah warriner again examined his face in the stream i think i might walk straight up from the ragged staff said he wagging his grey beard and shake hands with the governor of gibraltar and no one be a penny the wiser then he paused so you know wilbraham he said slowly and paused again so you know my wife too and the pair went to their breakfast warriner walked in front of charnock and the latter could not but notice how within these two days his companion had changed his back was losing its timid differential curve there was less of a slink in his walk he no longer shrank when a loud word was addressed to him moreover his curiosity increased and while they were at breakfast he asked how did you find me and that morning as they rode forwards over the marigolds and irises charnock told him of his first visit to tangier and of hassan akbar so when i came again he said with perhaps a little awkwardness and after a pause i had a clue a slight one but still a clue and i followed it it was you who shouted through fourniers shopdoor was it said warriner thats the second time a cry of yours has fairly scared me so you know wilbraham he added in a moment so you know my wife too they halted at noon under a hedge of cactus and charnock tired with his long vigils covered his head and slept through the long afternoon over pink and violet flowers under a burning sun they journeyed drowsily with no conversation and no sound at all but the humming of the insects in the air and the whistle of birds and the brushing of their mules feet through the grass that evening they crossed the sebou and camped a few yards from the rivers bank in a most lucid air it was after supper charnock was lying upon his back his head resting upon his arms and his eyes upturned to the throbbing stars and the rich violet sky warriner squatted crosslegged beside a dying fire and now and then as a flame spirted up he cast a curious glance towards charnock how long have you been searching he asked two years replied charnock why the question was shot at him in a sharp challenging voice charnock did not move from his position he lay resting on that vast plain under the fresh night sky and the kindly stars but he was some little while silent before he answered your wife asked me to come warriner nodded his head thoughtfully but said no more that night charnock did not keep watch for they were across the sebou and out of the perilous country the next morning they rode on towards alkasar with few words between them only charnock noticed that warriner was continually glancing at him with a certain furtiveness and it seemed with a certain illwill charnock grew restless under this surveillance he resented it it made him vaguely uneasy they rode with no shadows to console them until the afternoon brought the clouds over the top of the atlas towards evening they saw far ahead of them the town of alkasar amongst its gardens of orange trees and olives we shall not reach it tonight said charnock looking up at the sky no thank god answered warriner fervently no towns for me what if it does rain so again they camped in the open under a solitary wild fig tree and the rain held off they talked indifferently upon this subject and that speculated upon news of europe and charnock heard something of warriners comings and goings his sufferings and adventures but the talk was forced and though now and again wilbrahams name and now and again mirandas recurred it died altogether away warriner broke it suddenly you are in love with my wife he said charnock started up on his elbow what the devil has that got to do with you he asked fiercely the two men eyed one another across the leaping flames of the fire well you have a right to put it that way no doubt said warriner charnock sank down again he felt resentment throbbing hot within him he was very glad that there were only five more days during which he and warriner must travel together alone and during which he must keep ward over the man he had rescued but the next day was one of peace the mere proximity of a moorish town had terrors for warriner his eyes turned ever towards it scared and frightened his very body shrank and took on a servile air besides it rained we might sleep in alkasar there is a jew i stayed with coming up you will be safe there said charnock i would sooner shiver to death here replied warriner and they skirted the town but a little distance from the gates charnock called a halt and taking hamet and a mule he went up into the town he sought out his jew and bought a tent which he packed upon the mule and so returned to where warriner crouched and hid amongst the orange trees beyond alkasar they passed through a long stretch of stubble whence acres of wheat had been garnered and at night the two men sat in the opening of their tent while the lad hamet drew weird melancholy from his pipe warriner was silent he was evidently turning over some thought in his mind and his mind rusted by his servitude worked very slowly a man of great vindictiveness and jealousy he was not grateful for his rescue but he was brooding over the motives which had induced charnock to come in search of him and which had persuaded miranda to send him in search warriner had never cared for his wife but his wife had never till now given him any cause for jealousy and out of his present jealousy there sprang and grew in his halfcrazy and disordered mind a quite fictitious passion he revealed something of it the next morning to charnock for after he had waked up and yawned after he had watched for a moment the busy shadow of hamet upon the tentwall and heard the light crackle of the breakfast fire he roused charnock with a shake of the shoulder and resumed the conversation at the point where it had been broken off when they sat by the campfire but ill tell you a question which has to do with me charnock he said is my wife in love with you you damned blackguard cried charnock thanks said warriner with a chuckle thats answer enough its no answer at all exclaimed charnock hotly and he sat up amongst his blankets and took refuge in subterfuges if what you say were true is it likely that your wife would have asked me to find you out and bring you back thats the very point i have been considering returned warriner and i think it uncommon likely women have all sorts of underground scruples which its difficult for a man to get upside with and i can imagine a woman would send off her fancy man on this particular business as a kind of setoff and compensation see charnock dared not trust himself to answer he got up and walked to the door of the tent unfastened the flap and let the sunlight in funny thing continued warriner i never took much account of my wife she was a bit too stately for me it was just as though someone played symphonies to you all day when you hankered after music of the musichall type but somehow i suppose its seeing you doing the heroic and all for her dont you know somehow i am getting very fond of her charnock seemed to have heard not a single word he stood at the door of the tent looking indifferently this way and that his silence spurred warriner to continue i tell you what charnock he said you had better run straight with me youll find out your mistake if you dont ill tell you something more you had better let me find when i get back to ronda that you have run straight with me he saw charnock suddenly look round the angle of the tent and then shade his eyes with his hand it seemed impossible to provoke him in any way mind i dont say that i shall take it much to heart if the affair has stopped where you say it has charnock had said not a word about the matter as warriner was well aware no he continued on the contrary for no harms actually done you say and my wife steps down from her pedestal on to my level understand sonny what are you up to here i say charnock had stridden back into the tent he stooped over warriner and roughly plucked him up from the ground stand up will you he cried here i say protested warriner rather feebly you might be speaking to a dog i wish i was at that warriner turned the two mens faces were convulsed with passion hatred looked out from warriners eyes and saw its image in charnocks get out of the tent said charnock and taking warriner by the shoulder he threw rather than pushed him out now whats that and he pointed an arm towards the east thats a caravan quite so a caravan perhaps you have forgotten what you said to me outside the walls of mequinez you belong to me you remember youre mine i bought you and i can sell you if i choose by god you wouldnt do that cried warriner his years of slavery rushed back on him he saw himself again tramping under the sun with a load upon his back through the sand towards algiers over the hills to the sus country he heard again the whistle of a stick through the air heard its thud as it fell upon his body and felt the blow my god you couldnt do that and seeing charnock towering above him his face hard his eyes gloomy he clung to his arm charnock old man you wouldnt would you youll fetch half a dozen copper flouss said charnock look here charnock i apologise see old man see i am sorry you hear that dont you yes im sorry its my cursed tongue charnock shook him off we left your rags behind i believe so you can keep those clothes the caravan will pass us in an hour then warriner fell to prayers and flamed up in anger and curses and died down again to whimpering all the while charnock stood over him silent and contemptuous there was no doubt possible he meant to carry out his threat warriner burst out in a flood of imprecations and moorish imprecations for they came most readily to his tongue he called on god to burn charnocks greatgrandmother and then in an instant he became very cunning and calm and what sort of a face will you show to miranda he said smoothly when you get back to ronda you have forgotten that charnock had forgotten it in his sudden access of passion he had clean forgotten it warriner wiped the sweat from his face he did not need to look at charnock to be assured that at this moment he was the master he stuck his legs apart and rested his hands upon his hips you werent quite playing the game eh charnock he said easily do you think you were quite playing the game from that moment warriner was master and he was not inclined to leave charnock ignorant upon that point jealousy burnt within him his mind was unstable a quite fictitious passion for his wife for whom he had never cared and of whom he certainly would very quickly tire was kindled by his jealousy and he left no word unspoken which could possibly wound his deliverer charnock bitterly realised the false position into which he had allowed passion to lead him and for the future he held his peace only one more day he said with relief as they saw the hills behind tangier and what then charnock said warriner what then what then indeed charnock debated that question during the long night the last night he was to spend under canvas in company with ralph warriner sometime tomorrow they would see the minarets of tangier tomorrow evening they would ride down across the sk and sleep within the town what then passion was raw in these two men it was a clear night an african moon sailed the sky and the interior of the tent was bright warriner lay motionless a foot or two away wrapped in his dark coverings and charnock was conscious of a fierce thrill of joy when he remembered mirandas confession that she had no love left for her husband he did not attempt to repress it he hugged the recollection to his heart all at once warriner began softly to whistle a tune it was the tune which he had whistled that morning at the gates of tangier cemetery it was the tune which miranda had hummed over absently in the little parlour at ronda and which had given charnock the clue and because of the clue warriner was again whistling the tune in the same tent with himself a days march from tangier charnock began hotly to regret that he had ever heard it that he had charged hamet to repeat it and that so he had fixed it in his mind he kicked over on his rugs and he heard warriner speak you are awake are you i say charnock he asked smoothly did miranda show you the graveyard in gib that was my youngster understand mine and mirandas charnock clenched his teeth clenched his hand and straightened his muscles out through all his body that he might give no sign of what he felt bone of my bone continued warriner in a silky drawling voice flesh of my flesh and mirandas perhaps some deep breath drawn with a hiss through the teeth assured warriner that his speech was not spoken in vain for he laughed softly and hatefully to himself charnock lay quite still but every vein in his body was throbbing he had one thought only to relieve him warriner had said the last uttermost word of provocation he had fashioned it out of the dust of his child when but for that child he would still be a slave and out of the wifehood of miranda when but for miranda charnock would never have come in search of him rupert warriner aged two the gravestone the boy looking out between the lattices was very visible to charnock at that moment he was in the mind to give warriner an account of how and why he was brought to see it but he held his peace sure that whatever gibes or stings warriner might dispense in the future they would be trifling and inconsiderable compared with this monumental provocation he was wrong warriners malice had yet another resource seeing that charnock neither answered him nor moved he got up from his couch charnock saw him rummaging amongst the baggage hopping about the tent in the pale moonlight the shadow of his beard wagged upon the tentwall and all the while he chuckled and whispered to himself charnock watched his fantastic movements and took them together with the mans fantastic words and it occurred to him then for the first time to ask whether warriners mind had suffered with his body he had come to this point of his reflections when warriner stooping over a bundle found whatever it was for which he searched charnock heard a light snick like the cocking of a pistol only not so loud then warriner hopped back to charnocks side knelt down and thrust something into the palm of charnocks hand charnocks fingers closed on it instinctively and gripped it hard for this something was the handle of a knife and the blade was open there said warriner you have to protect me this is the last night so i give you the knife to protect me with he hopped back to his rugs twittering with pleasure and turning his face once more towards charnock while charnock lay with the open knife in his hand he resumed my boy charnock mine and mirandas mine and mirandas the next evening they rode over the cobblestones of tangier and halted at m fourniers shop chapter xxi completes the journeyings of this incongruous couple m fournier received the wanderers with an exuberant welcome he fell upon warriners neck patted him and wept over him for joy at his return and for grief at his aged and altered looks then he grasped charnock with both hands the deliverer he cried the friend so noble yes said warriner pleasantly ce bon charnock he loves my wife within halfanhour the two travellers were shaved and clothed in european dress would anyone know me asked warriner my poor friend i am afraid not answered fournier and warriner seemed very well pleased with the answer then we will go and dine really and properly dine at a hotel on champagne wine said he they dined at a window which looked out across the straits and all through that dinner warriners face darkened and darkened and his gaze was sombrely fixed towards gibraltar what are your plans asked fournier the first thing i propose to do is to walk up to the cemetery and astonish my friend hassan akbar you will not find him the basha thought it wise to keep him safe in prison until you were found he has been there two years then said warriner he had no friends then he is dead for the moorish authorities do not feed the prisoners in the kasbah m fournier blushed no he is not dead he would have starved but you will forgive it my friend after all he had no great reason to like you i sent him food myself every day not very much but enough stammered m fournier anxiously warriner waved his hand it is a small thing yes i forgive you and he may go free why not he will not catch me again m fourniers face brightened with admiration ah but you are great truly great he exclaimed my friend you are magnanime now tell me what you will do m fourniers magnanimous friend replied the boat crosses to algeciras tomorrow i shall go up to ronda and you he asked turning to charnock i shall go with you said charnock ce bon charnock said warriner with a smile he loves my wife but afterwards fournier hurried to interpose will you stay at ronda no warriners eyes strained out across the water to where the topmost ridge of gibraltar rose against the evening sky since his rescue two thoughts had divided and made a conflict in his mind one was his jealousy of charnock his unreal hothouse affection for miranda the other had been represented by his vague questions and statements about wilbraham he was now to speak more clearly for as he looked over to the rock wilbraham was uppermost in his mind you did not know wilbraham he resumed charnock did ce bon charnock i have a little account to settle with wilbraham a little account of some standing and now theres a new item to the bill the scullion imagine it fournier he blackmailed my wife blackmailed miranda do you understand he cried feverishly miranda you know her charnock fournier how often have i spoken of her to you miranda and words failed him so inconceivable was the thought that any man should bring himself to do any wrong to his miranda m fournier stared as he had once told mrs warriner ralph had spoken to him of miranda but it had not been with the startling enthusiasm which at present he evinced i shall settle my accounts with wilbraham first continued warriner after i have seen miranda did you know it was wilbraham who sold the plans of the daventry gun was it exclaimed charnock it was and the three men drew their chairs closer together wilbraham was a moneylenders tout at gib i had borrowed money and renewed i borrowed again and again renewed you see he argued in excuse i would not touch a penny of my wifes estate that of course was sacred it was mirandas and settled upon miranda charnock could not refrain from interposing dont you call my wife by her christian name else you and i will quarrel exclaimed warriner banging his fist violently upon the table and m fournier anxiously signed to charnock to be silent it was a slip said fournier and soothingly he patted warriner on the shoulder here have one or two fine champagne eh now go on we are all of us good friends you borrowed twice from wilbraham and did not pay you would not of course well i tried to borrow a third time continued warriner but wilbraham refused unless i could offer him good security he himself suggested the plans of the daventry gun he swore most solemnly that he would not use them he would keep them as a security for three weeks and i wanted his money i had debts to pay debts to my brother officers and i agreed he lent me the money i gave him the plans and he went off to paris and sold them i received a hint one afternoon that the mechanism of the gun was known and i ran out of gibraltar that evening so you see i have an account with him and it grows and grows and grows upon me each time that i see that he pointed a shaking finger to where the sharp ridge of gibraltar cut the evening sky now that i can go where i will and no one will know me i will get the account paid and cut a receipt in full with a knife right across wilbrahams face his voice rose and quavered with a feverish excitement his eyes shone and glittered it seemed to charnock there was madness in them m fourniers eyes met his and they exchanged glances so m fournier who was engaged in assiduously soothing warriner shared the conjecture indeed as m fournier took his leave he said privately to charnock my poor friend what will be the end of it for him his wife does not like him and he will follow this wilbraham and he is not himself charnock was lighting his candle at the halltable yes said he slowly there is his wife there is wilbraham there is himself what is to be the end of it all he went up the stairs to his room his room communicated with warriners and taking the key from the door he left the door unlocked more than once as he tossed upon his bed vainly reiterating the question what was to be the end he heard the latch of the door click he saw the door open slowly he saw a head come cautiously through the opening and then as he lay still warriner came hopping across the room to his bed warriner came to assure himself that charnock had not stolen a march upon him during the night he was possessed by a crazy fear lest charnock should see miranda before himself on the following afternoon they crossed together to algeciras through a rough sea in a strong wind its the levanter said warriner therell be three days of it he looked earnestly at gibraltar as the boat turned into the bay wilbraham wilbraham he muttered in a voice of anticipation then he turned to charnock mind we go up to ronda together we shall have to stay the night at algeciras mind you are not to charter a special and go up ahead while i am asleep charnock was sorely tempted to secure an engine as he could have done but miranda had asked to see him once when he brought ralph back and so the next morning they travelled together at noon charnock saw again the walnut door encrusted with the copper nails and warriner was already hammering upon it with his stick the moment it was opened he rushed through without a word thrusting the servant aside charnock followed him but though he followed he had the advantage for while warriner gazed about the patio into which for the first time he entered charnock ran across to the little room in which miranda was wont to sit he opened the door empty said warriner from behind his shoulder and he pushed past charnock into the room from the balcony above them jane holt spoke she spoke to charnock as she ran down the stair its you at last miranda is at gibraltar she expected to hear of you and thought she would hear more quickly there she has been ill besides she needed doctors ill exclaimed charnock who is that asked miss holt glancing across charnocks shoulder ralph ralph cried out miss holt but hes hush they followed warriner into the room and charnock closed the door didnt you know he asked i went to find him no she replied utterly bewildered it seems strange but miranda is very secret a little unkind perhaps and then her voice went up almost in a scream as warriner turned towards her ralph is that ralph yes yes its ralph said warriner and all the time he spoke he trotted and hopped and danced about the room ralph warriner to be sure a little bit aged eh jane holt little bit musty been lyin too long in the churchyard at scilly bound to alter your looks that what he skipped over to the writing table and began with a seeming aimlessness to pull out the drawers wheres miranda does she know her lovin husbands here why dont she come tell me that jane holt he made a quick and to charnock an unintelligible movement at the writing table shut up a drawer with a bang and the next moment he had a hand tight upon jane holts wrist wheres miranda quick and he shook her arm fiercely but with a sly look towards charnock his other hand he thrust into his pocket charnock just got a glimpse of a sheet of paper clenched in the fist warriner withdrew his hand from his pocket empty he had stolen something from the writing drawer but what it was charnock could not guess nor did he think it wise in view of warriners excitement to ask mirandas at gibraltar said miss holt quite alarmed by the mans extravagance i told you she is ill warriner waited to hear no more he dropped her arm at gibraltar he said and ran out of the room across the patio charnock followed him immediately he must not go alone he cried over his shoulder to miss holt but the excuse was only half of his motive passion resentment jealousy these too ordered him and he obeyed charnock came up with warriner at the railway station the train did not leave ronda until three as charnock might have known and so behaved with dignity before miss holt but he was beyond the power of argument or reflection he hurried after warriner and caught him up and during the two hours of waiting the two men kept watch and ward upon each other together they walked to the hotel they lunched at the same table they returned side by side to the station and seated themselves side by side in the same carriage of the train the train which takes four hours to climb to ronda runs down that long slope of a hundred miles in two hours charnock and warriner took their seats in a coup at the end of the last carriage they rushed suddenly into the dark straight tunnels and saw the mouths by which they had entered as round os of light which contracted and contracted until a mere pinspoint of sunshine was visible far away and then suddenly they were out again in the daylight there were certain landmarks with which charnock was familiar a precipitous gorge upon the right an underground river which flooded out from a hillside upon the left a white town far away upon a green slope like a flock of sheep herded together and finally the glades of the cork forest with the gleam of its stripped treetrunks the train drew up at algeciras a few minutes after five charnock and warriner were met with the statement that the levanter of yesterday had increased in force and by the order of the harbourmaster the port of algeciras was closed it was impossible to make the passage to gibraltar and miranda was ill she had needed doctors jane holt had said charnocks fears exaggerated the malady she might be dying she might die while he and warriner waited at algeciras for the sea to subside we must reach gibraltar tonight he cried and before gunfire added warriner but how charnock went straight to the office of the manager of the line the manager greeted him with warmth but man where have you been these two years he exclaimed theres a station at san roque halfway round the bay said charnock i must get into gibraltar tonight if i can have a special to san roque i might drive the last nine miles gibraltar is before everything a fortress and the gates of that fortress are closed for the night at gunfire and opened again for the day at gunfire in the morning you will never do it said the manager the gun goes off at seven whats the month cried warriner july answered the manager in surprise and the day of july the fifth good cried warriner you are wrong on the fifth of july the gun goes off at eight from the fifth of july to the thirtyfirst of august the manager uncoupled one carriage and the engine coupled them together and switched them on to the upline meanwhile charnock telegraphed to the stationmaster at san roque to have a carriage in readiness but time was occupied and it was six oclock before the engine steamed into san roque san roque is a wayside station the village lies a mile away hidden behind a hill charnock and warriner alighted amongst fields and thickets of trees but nowhere was there a house visible and worst of all there was no carriage in the lane outside the station the stationmaster had ordered one and no doubt one would arrive he counselled patience for halfanhour the incongruous companions united by a common passion and a mutual hate kicked their heels upon the lonely platform of san roque then at last a crazy battered creaking diligence drawn by six brokenkneed sorebacked mules cantered up to the station with a driver and a boy upon the box whooping exhortations to the mules with the full power of their lungs charnock and warriner sprang up into the hooded seat behind the box the driver turned his mules and the diligence went off at a canter along an unmade track across the fields it was now close upon a quarter to seven and nine miles lay between san roque and the gates of gibraltar moreover there was no road for the first part of the journey merely this unmade track across the fields the two men urged on the driver with openhanded promises the driver screamed and shouted at his mules hi mules heres a bull after you he counterfeited the barking of dogs but the mules were accustomed to his threats and exhortations they knew there were no dogs at their heels and they kept to their regular canter charnock longed for the fields to end and for the road to begin and when the road did begin he longed again for the fields the road consisted of long lines of ruts ruts which were almost trenches ruts which had been baked hard by the summer suns the mules stumbled amongst them the diligence tossed and pitched and rolled like a boat in a heavy sea charnock and warriner clung to their seats while the driver continually looked round to see whether a wheel had slipped off from its axle at times the boy would jump down from the box and running forward with the whip in his hand would beat the mules with the buttend the lash had long ceased to influence their movements the roads infernal cried warriner it will be when we get to the sea replied the driver and charnock groaned in his distress there was worse to come and miranda was ill the diligence lurched between two clumps of juniper trees swung round a wall and instantly the wheels sank into soft sand the huge sheer landward face of gibraltar rock towered up before them as they looked across the mile of neutral ground that flat neck of land between the mediterranean and the bay they saw the spanish frontier town of linea but to linea the sand stretched in a broad golden curve soft and dry and through that curve of sand the wheels of the diligence had to plough the mules were beaten onwards but the levanter blew dead in their teeth the driver turned the diligence towards the sea and drove with the water splashing over the wheels there the sand bound and the pace was faster it was still however too slow gibraltar seemed still as far away the travellers paid the driver leaped from their seats and ran over the soft clogging sand to linea they reached linea they passed the sentinel and the iron gates they stood upon the neutral ground they had but one more mile to traverse a cab stood without the iron gates they jumped into it and drove at a gallop across the level but the gun was fired from the rock while they were still halfamile from the gate and the cabman brought his horses to a standstill what now said warriner we might get in said charnock the keys are taken to the governor there would be trouble there always is i know there would be questions asked it would not be safe i might slip in when the gates are open but now it would not be safe and mind charnock when you go in i go in too there was no doubt that warriner meant what he said every word of it for mirandas sake charnock could not risk warriners detection they must remain outside gibraltar for that night even though during the night miranda should die can we sleep at linea said charnock no linea is a collection of workmens houses and workmens pothouses the two men made their supper at one of these latter and for the rest of the night paced the neutral ground before gibraltar a scud of clouds darkened the sky and one pile of cloud darker than the rest lowered stationary upon the summit of the rock all night the levanter blew pitilessly cold across that unprotected neck of land between sea and sea with their numbed hands in their pockets and their coats buttoned to the throat charnock and warriner accustomed to the blaze of a morocco sun waited from nightfall until midnight and from midnight through the biting dreary hours till dawn the gates were opened at three oclock in the morning together the two men went through they had still hours to wait before they could return to the hotel they breakfasted together and they let the time go by for now that they were within reach of almost within sight of miranda warriner they both began to hesitate what was to be the end they looked at one another across the table with that question speaking from their eyes they walked down to the hotel and faced each other at the door and the question was still repeated and still unanswered they turned away together and strolled a few yards and turned and came back again this time charnock entered the hotel is mrs warriner in he asked the waiter replied yes charnock drew a long breath surely if much had been amiss with her the waiter would have told them but he said nothing he merely led the way upstairs chapter xxii in which charnock astonishes ralph warriner the waiter threw open the door the two men entered and warriner shut the door miranda rose from a chair and stood looking from charnock to warriner and back again from warriner to charnock and as yet no word was spoken by anyone of them charnock had time to note and grieve for the pallor of her face and the purple hollows about her eyes then she moved forward for a step or two quite steadily she murmured a name and the name was not ralph and then suddenly without any warning she fell to the ground between charnock and her husband and lay still and lifeless my god shes dead whispered warriner we should have sent word of our coming we have killed her and then he stopped for charnock was standing by the side of miranda and talking down to her as she lay in a low soft chiding voice come he was saying its what you wished you will be glad when you have time to think over it and understand there is no reason why you should this intimate talking with the lifeless woman came upon warriner as something horrible man cant you see he whispered hoarsely shes dead miranda is we have killed her you and i charnock slowly turned his head towards warriner and looked at him steadily with his eyebrows drawn down over his eyes somehow warriner was frightened by that glance he felt a chill creep down his spine he was more frightened than even on that morning when charnock threatened to sell him outside alkasar shes dead i tell you he babbled and so was silent charnock looked back to miranda sank upon one knee by her side and bending his head down began to whisper to her exhortations gentle reproaches at her lack of courage and between his words he smiled at her as at a wayward child there is no reason to fear the uncanny talk went on and it hurts us you dont know how much you might as well speak not be like this pretending he reached over her and took her hand cherished it in his own and entwined his fingers with her fingers and then laughed as though her fingers had responded to his own you are rather cruel you know warriner moved uneasily charnock i tell you mirandas charnock flung his other arm across her body and crouched over it glaring at warriner like a beast about to spring and i tell you shes not shes not shes not he hissed out dead and suddenly he lifted up mirandas head held it in the hollow of his arm and kissed the face upon the forehead and the lips dead and he broke out into a laugh is she ill show you come come he forced his disengaged arm underneath her waist and putting all his strength into the swing lifted himself on to his feet and lifted miranda with him now dont you see warriner was standing his mouth open his eyes contracted there was more than horror expressed in them there was terror besides dont you see cried charnock in a wild triumph perhaps you are blind are you blind ralph warriner he held miranda supported against his shoulder and swung her up and tried to set her dangling feet firmplanted on the ground but her limbs gave her head rolled upon his shoulder he hitched her up again her head fell back exposing the white column of her throat the heavy masses of her hair broke from their fastenings unrolled about her shoulders and tumbled about his he tried again to set her on her feet and her head fell forward upon his breast and her hair swept across his lips there man he cried she can stand can a dead woman stand tell me that he held her so that she had the posture the semblance of one who stands though all her weight was upon his arm his laughter rose without any gradation to the pitch of a scream sank without gradation to a hoarse cry why she can walk can a dead woman walk see see and suddenly he dropped his arm from her waist and stood aside from her holding her hand in his instantly her figure curved and broke she swung round towards him upon the pivot of his hand and as she swung she stumbled and fell charnock caught her before she reached the ground lifted her up strained her to his breast and held her so one deep sob broke from him shook him and left him trembling he carried miranda to a couch and there gently laid her down gently he divided her hair back from her temples and her face he crossed her hands upon her breast watched her for a second as she lay her dress soiled with the dust of his journeyings and then he dropped on his knees by the couch and with a set white face with his eyelids shut tight upon his eyes in a low even voice he steadily blasphemed some time later a hand was laid upon his shoulder and a strange voice bade him rise he stood up and looked at the stranger with a dazed expression like one who comes out of the dark into a lighted room warriner also was in the room charnock caught a word here and there the stranger was speaking to him charnock gathered that the stranger was a doctor and that warriner had fetched him but shes dead said charnock resentfully why trouble her shes dead and looking down to miranda he saw that there was a faint flush of pink upon her cheeks where all had been white before but you said she was dead he said stupidly to warriner and as the doctor bent over her it broke in upon him that she was in truth alive that she had but swooned and the shame of what he had done came home to him i was mad he said i was mad go said the doctor both of you i can stay said warriner this is mrs warriner i am her husband ralph warriner the doctor looked up sharply warriner simply nodded his head yes yes he said and this is charnock ce bon charnock you see he loves my wife warriner spoke slowly and in an inexpressive voice as though he too was hardly aware of what he said the conviction that miranda was dead had come with equal force to both of these two men and the knowledge that she was not brought an equal stupefaction warriner remained in the room charnock went outside and down the stairs he came to his senses in the streets of gibraltar and looking backwards seemed to himself to have lost them weeks ago somewhere between mequinez and alkasar in a profitless rivalry for a woman who could not belong to him in the present revulsion of his feelings he was conscious that he had lost all his enmity towards warriner he walked down to the landingstage at the mole the levanter had spent its force during the night the sea had gone down a steamer was dropping its anchor in the bay charnock was in two minds whether or no to cross the harbour to algeciras where warriner and himself had left their traps the day before gather together his belongings and sail for england in that steamer he had done all that he had been enjoined to do he had brought warriner back he had even as he had promised paid the one last visit to miranda but but he might be wanted he pleaded to himself and so undecided he wandered about the streets and in the afternoon came back to the hotel the waiter was watching for his return mrs warriner wished to speak with him there was no sign of warriner charnock mounted the stairs there was no sign of warriner within the sittingroom miranda was alone and from the frank unembarrassed way with which she held out her hand charnock understood that she knew nothing of what had passed in the morning chapter xxiii relates a second meeting between charnock and miranda i was afraid you had gone without my thanks she said and thanks are the only coin i have to pay you with surely there needs no payment i should have thanked you this morning but your return overcame me i had hoped and prayed so much for it the scream of the p and os steamwhistle sounded through the room they both turned instinctively to the window they saw the last late boatload reach the ships side and in a moment or so they heard the rattle of the anchorchain and ralph asked charnock miranda pointed to the steamer already the white fan of water streamed away from its stern he has sailed yes he could not stay here his she paused for a second and then spoke the word boldly his crime was hushed up but it is of course known here to a few and all know that there is something he told his name to the doctor it was not safe for him to stay over this morning he has gone to england yes but he will leave england immediately he promised to write to me so that i may know where he is more of warriners interview with his wife neither charnock nor anyone ever knew whether he asked her to come with him and she refused or whether once he saw her and had speech with her his fictitious passion died as quickly as it had grown these are matters which miranda kept locked within her secret memories at this time indeed such questions did not at all occur to charnock as he watched the great steamer heading out of the bay and understood that he must be taking the same path he was filled with a great pity for the lonely woman at his side the thought of her home up there in the spanish hills and of her solitary discontented companion came to him with a new and poignant sadness ronda was no longer a fitting shrine for her as his first fancies had styled it but simply a strange place in a strange country why dont you go home to your own place to your own people he suggested rather than asked miranda was silent for a while i have thought of it she said at length i think too that i shall at first there was the disgrace there was the pity i could not have endured it besides there was rupert but but i think i shall i should said charnock decidedly i should be glad too to know that you had made up your mind to that i should be very glad to think that you were back at your own home why she asked a little surprised at his earnestness of course i wasnt born to it he replied disconnectedly but now and then i have stayed at manorhouses in the country and such visits have always left an impression on me i would have liked myself to have been born of the soil on which i lived to have lived where my fathers and grandfathers lived and walked and laughed and suffered in the same rooms under the same trees enjoying the associations which they made do you know i dont think that that is a privilege lightly to be foregone and for a while again they both were silent then miranda turned suddenly and frankly towards him i should like so much to show you my home she had said much the same on that first evening of their meeting in lady donnisthorpes balcony as they both surely remembered i should like much to see it returned charnock gently but i am a busy man miranda coloured at the conventional excuse as charnock saw but it was kind of you to say that i was glad to hear it he added it was not to the addition she replied but to his first excuse as it is you have lost two years i have made you lose them please he exclaimed you wont let that trouble you promise me i am a young man it would be a strange thing if i could not give two years to you believe me mrs warriner when my time comes and i turn my face to the wall whatever may happen between now and then i shall count those two years as the years for which i have most reason to be thankful miranda turned abruptly away from him and looked out of the window with intense curiosity at nothing whatever then she said in a low voice i hope thats true i hope you mean it i believe you do i have been much troubled by an old theory of yours that a woman was a brake on the wheel going up hill and a whip in the drivers hand going down i will give you a new theory to replace the old he answered there are always things to do you know suppose that a man has cared for a woman has set her always within his vision has always worked for her for a long while and has at last come surely against his will to know that she was despicable why then perhaps he might have reason to be disheartened but otherwise well he has things to do and memories to quicken him in the doing of them thank you she said simply i think what you say is true i once met a man who found a woman to be despicable and the world went very ill with him it was of major wilbraham she was thinking who had more than once written to miranda during these two years and whose last letter she imagined to be lying then in a drawer of her writingtable at ronda chapter xxiv a mist in the channel ends as it began the book but that letter was in ralph warriners pocket as he walked the deck of the p and o it was dated from a hotel at dartmouth whence said the major he was starting on a little cruise westwards in the company of a young gentleman from oxford who owned a competence and a yacht the major would be back at dartmouth in some six weeks time and hoped for mrs warriners sake that he would find a registered letter awaiting him the major was still upon his cruise as ralph warriner was assured from the recent date of the letter warriner disembarked at plymouth and took train to dartmouth where he learned the name of the yacht by merely asking at the hotel he tried to hire a steam launch for sooner or later in one of the harbours he would be sure to come up with wilbraham if he only kept a sharp eye but steam launches are difficult to hire at this season of the year and in the end he had to content himself with chartering a tenton cutter he engaged one hand by whose testimony the history of ralphs pursuit came to be known and sailed out of dartmouth to the west he sailed out in the morning and coming to salcombe ran over the bar on the tail of the flood but did not find his quarry there and so beat out again on the first of the ebb and reached past bolt head and bolt tail across bigbury bay with its low red rocks to plymouth wilbraham had anchored in the cattwater only two days before the yacht was a yawl named the monitor and was making for the scillies warriner laughed when he picked up word about the destination of the yacht and thought it would be very appropriate if he could overhaul the monitor somewhere off rosevear as to what course he intended to pursue when he caught wilbraham he had no settled plan but on the other hand he had a new revolver in his berth he put out from plymouth under a light breeze which failed him altogether when he was abreast of rame head through the rest of the day he drifted with the tide betwixt rame head and plymouth the night came upon him jewelled with stars and a light mist upon the surface of the water all that night he swung up and down some four miles out to sea within view of plymouth lights but towards morning a fitful wind sprang up drove the cutter as far as polperro and left it becalmed on a sea of glass in front of the little white village in the wooded cliffhollow while the sun rose warriner opened the narrow line of blue water which marks the mouth of the fowey river at eleven oclock of the morning and anchored in fowey harbour about twelve it was a sunday and though the monitor was not at fowey warriner determined to stay at his anchorage till the morrow the brixham fisherman who served him upon this cruise relates that warriner displayed no impatience or anxiety at any time of the febrile instability which had set his thoughts flying this way and that during the days of his companionship with charnock there was no longer any trace in his demeanour perhaps it was that he was so certain of attaining his desires perhaps the long lesson of endurance which he had been painfully taught in morocco now bore its fruit perhaps too he had acquired something of the passive fatalism of the moorish race during this sunday afternoon his last sunday as it proved he quietly sculled the dinghy of his cutter when the tide was low through the mud flats of the fowey river to lostwithiel and coming down again when the river was full lay for a long time upon his oars opposite a certain church that lifts above a clump of trees on the riverbank there he remained listening to the roll of the organ and the sweet voices of the singers as they floated out through the painted windows into the quiet of the summer evening when the service was over he bent to his sculls again and rowed back between the steep and narrowing coppices but it was dark before he turned the last shoulder of hill and saw the long lines of ridinglights trembling upon the water warriner raised his anchor early on the monday morning and having the wind on his quarter made falmouth betimes at falmouth he learned that the monitor had put out past st anthonys light only the day before and had sailed westwards to penzance warriner followed without delay and when he was just past the manacle rocks the wind dropped with the help of the tide and an occasional flaw of wind he worked his cutter round the lizard point and laid her head for penzance across the bay and it was then that the fog took him it crept out of the sea at about four of the afternoon a thin grey mist and it thickened into a dense umber fog the fog hung upon the channel for thirty hours the cutter swung into the bay with the tide the brixham fisherman could hear all along to his right hand the muffled roar as the groundswell broke upon the lizard rocks and the sucking withdrawal which told that those rocks were very near the lizard foghorn which sounded a minute ago abreast of them sounded now quite faintly astern the boat swung with the tide and would not steer yet warriner betrayed no alarm and no impatience at the check he sat on the deck with a lantern by his side and drew said the fisherman a little flute or pipe from his pocket on which he played tunes that were no tunes and from which he drew a weird shrill music of an infinite melancholy and of infinite suggestions once the brixham man crouched suddenly by the gunwale and peered intently over the boats side at a little distance off something black loomed through the fog about the height of the masts yard something black which rapidly approached its not a squall said warriner quietly interrupting his music its a rock i know this coast well we had better get the dinghy out and row her head off when that was done he squatted again upon the deck by the side of the lantern and played shrilly upon his pipe while the light threw a grotesque reflection of his figure upon the fog after a while they heard the lizardhorn abreast of them again the tide has turned said warriner and the brixham man dived hurriedly into the well for the poor foghorn which the boat carried the cutter drifted out sternforemost past the lizard rocks and in a little from this side and from that ahead of them astern they heard the throb of engines and the hoarse steamwhistles of the atlantic cargoboats and liners they had drifted across the track of the oceangoing steamers the brixham man blew upon his horn till his lungs cracked he relates that nothing happened until three oclock in the morning as he knows since warriner just at three oclock took his watch from his pocket and looked at the dial by the lanternlight he mentions too as a detail which struck him at the time that the door of the lantern was open and so still was the heavy air that the candle burnt steadily as in a room at three oclock in the morning he suddenly saw a glimmering flash of white upon the cutters beam for a fraction of a second he was dazed then he lifted the horn to his mouth and he was still lifting it so small an interval was there of time when a huge sharp wedge cut through the fog and towered above the cutter out of sight the wedge was the bows of an atlantic liner no one on that liner heard the despairing interrupted moan of the tiny foghorn beneath the ships forefoot no one felt the shock the brixham man was hurled clear of the steamer and after swimming for the best part of an hour was picked up by a smack which he came upon by chance warriners body was washed up three days later upon the lizard rocks this history did not reach charnocks ears for a full year afterwards for within a week of his arrival in london where his unexplained disappearance had puzzled very few since he was known for a man of many disappearances he had started off to asia minor there to survey the line of a projected railway the railway was never more than projected and after a year the survey was abandoned charnock returned to london and heard the story of warriners death from lady donnisthorpes lips at her last reception at the end of
