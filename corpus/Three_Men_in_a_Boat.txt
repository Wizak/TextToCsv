three men in a boat chapter i three invalids sufferings of george and harris a victim to one hundred and seven fatal maladies useful prescriptions cure for liver complaint in children we agree that we are overworked and need rest a week on the rolling deep george suggests the river montmorency lodges an objection original motion carried by majority of three to one there were four of us george and william samuel harris and myself and montmorency we were sitting in my room smoking and talking about how bad we were bad from a medical point of view i mean of course we were all feeling seedy and we were getting quite nervous about it harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at times that he hardly knew what he was doing and then george said that he had fits of giddiness too and hardly knew what he was doing with me it was my liver that was out of order i knew it was my liver that was out of order because i had just been reading a patent liverpill circular in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order i had them all it is a most extraordinary thing but i never read a patent medicine advertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that i am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form the diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that i have ever felt i remember going to the british museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which i had a touch hay fever i fancy it was i got down the book and read all i came to read and then in an unthinking moment i idly turned the leaves and began to indolently study diseases generally i forget which was the first distemper i plunged into some fearful devastating scourge i know and before i had glanced half down the list of premonitory symptoms it was borne in upon me that i had fairly got it i sat for awhile frozen with horror and then in the listlessness of despair i again turned over the pages i came to typhoid fever read the symptoms discovered that i had typhoid fever must have had it for months without knowing it wondered what else i had got turned up st vituss dance found as i expected that i had that too began to get interested in my case and determined to sift it to the bottom and so started alphabetically read up ague and learnt that i was sickening for it and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight brights disease i was relieved to find i had only in a modified form and so far as that was concerned i might live for years cholera i had with severe complications and diphtheria i seemed to have been born with i plodded conscientiously through the twentysix letters and the only malady i could conclude i had not got was housemaids knee i felt rather hurt about this at first it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight why hadnt i got housemaids knee why this invidious reservation after a while however less grasping feelings prevailed i reflected that i had every other known malady in the pharmacology and i grew less selfish and determined to do without housemaids knee gout in its most malignant stage it would appear had seized me without my being aware of it and zymosis i had evidently been suffering with from boyhood there were no more diseases after zymosis so i concluded there was nothing else the matter with me i sat and pondered i thought what an interesting case i must be from a medical point of view what an acquisition i should be to a class students would have no need to walk the hospitals if they had me i was a hospital in myself all they need do would be to walk round me and after that take their diploma then i wondered how long i had to live i tried to examine myself i felt my pulse i could not at first feel any pulse at all then all of a sudden it seemed to start off i pulled out my watch and timed it i made it a hundred and fortyseven to the minute i tried to feel my heart i could not feel my heart it had stopped beating i have since been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the time and must have been beating but i cannot account for it i patted myself all over my front from what i call my waist up to my head and i went a bit round each side and a little way up the back but i could not feel or hear anything i tried to look at my tongue i stuck it out as far as ever it would go and i shut one eye and tried to examine it with the other i could only see the tip and the only thing that i could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that i had scarlet fever i had walked into that readingroom a happy healthy man i crawled out a decrepit wreck i went to my medical man he is an old chum of mine and feels my pulse and looks at my tongue and talks about the weather all for nothing when i fancy im ill so i thought i would do him a good turn by going to him now what a doctor wants i said is practice he shall have me he will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your ordinary commonplace patients with only one or two diseases each so i went straight up and saw him and he said well whats the matter with you i said i will not take up your time dear boy with telling you what is the matter with me life is brief and you might pass away before i had finished but i will tell you what is not the matter with me i have not got housemaids knee why i have not got housemaids knee i cannot tell you but the fact remains that i have not got it everything else however i have got and i told him how i came to discover it all then he opened me and looked down me and clutched hold of my wrist and then he hit me over the chest when i wasnt expecting it a cowardly thing to do i call it and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of his head after that he sat down and wrote out a prescription and folded it up and gave it me and i put it in my pocket and went out i did not open it i took it to the nearest chemists and handed it in the man read it and then handed it back he said he didnt keep it i said you are a chemist he said i am a chemist if i was a cooperative stores and family hotel combined i might be able to oblige you being only a chemist hampers me i read the prescription it ran lb beefsteak with pt bitter beer every hours tenmile walk every morning bed at sharp every night and dont stuff up your head with things you dont understand i followed the directions with the happy result speaking for myself that my life was preserved and is still going on in the present instance going back to the liverpill circular i had the symptoms beyond all mistake the chief among them being a general disinclination to work of any kind what i suffer in that way no tongue can tell from my earliest infancy i have been a martyr to it as a boy the disease hardly ever left me for a day they did not know then that it was my liver medical science was in a far less advanced state than now and they used to put it down to laziness why you skulking little devil you they would say get up and do something for your living cant you not knowing of course that i was ill and they didnt give me pills they gave me clumps on the side of the head and strange as it may appear those clumps on the head often cured me for the time being i have known one clump on the head have more effect upon my liver and make me feel more anxious to go straight away then and there and do what was wanted to be done without further loss of time than a whole box of pills does now you know it often is so those simple oldfashioned remedies are sometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff we sat there for halfanhour describing to each other our maladies i explained to george and william harris how i felt when i got up in the morning and william harris told us how he felt when he went to bed and george stood on the hearthrug and gave us a clever and powerful piece of acting illustrative of how he felt in the night george fancies he is ill but theres never anything really the matter with him you know at this point mrs poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready for supper we smiled sadly at one another and said we supposed we had better try to swallow a bit harris said a little something in ones stomach often kept the disease in check and mrs poppets brought the tray in and we drew up to the table and toyed with a little steak and onions and some rhubarb tart i must have been very weak at the time because i know after the first halfhour or so i seemed to take no interest whatever in my food an unusual thing for me and i didnt want any cheese this duty done we refilled our glasses lit our pipes and resumed the discussion upon our state of health what it was that was actually the matter with us we none of us could be sure of but the unanimous opinion was that it whatever it was had been brought on by overwork what we want is rest said harris rest and a complete change said george the overstrain upon our brains has produced a general depression throughout the system change of scene and absence of the necessity for thought will restore the mental equilibrium george has a cousin who is usually described in the chargesheet as a medical student so that he naturally has a somewhat familyphysicianary way of putting things i agreed with george and suggested that we should seek out some retired and oldworld spot far from the madding crowd and dream away a sunny week among its drowsy lanes some halfforgotten nook hidden away by the fairies out of reach of the noisy world some quaintperched eyrie on the cliffs of time from whence the surging waves of the nineteenth century would sound faroff and faint harris said he thought it would be humpy he said he knew the sort of place i meant where everybody went to bed at eight oclock and you couldnt get a referee for love or money and had to walk ten miles to get your baccy no said harris if you want rest and change you cant beat a sea trip i objected to the sea trip strongly a sea trip does you good when you are going to have a couple of months of it but for a week it is wicked you start on monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are going to enjoy yourself you wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore light your biggest pipe and swagger about the deck as if you were captain cook sir francis drake and christopher columbus all rolled into one on tuesday you wish you hadnt come on wednesday thursday and friday you wish you were dead on saturday you are able to swallow a little beef tea and to sit up on deck and answer with a wan sweet smile when kindhearted people ask you how you feel now on sunday you begin to walk about again and take solid food and on monday morning as with your bag and umbrella in your hand you stand by the gunwale waiting to step ashore you begin to thoroughly like it i remember my brotherinlaw going for a short sea trip once for the benefit of his health he took a return berth from london to liverpool and when he got to liverpool the only thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket it was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction so i am told and was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a biliouslooking youth who had just been advised by his medical men to go to the seaside and take exercise seaside said my brotherinlaw pressing the ticket affectionately into his hand why youll have enough to last you a lifetime and as for exercise why youll get more exercise sitting down on that ship than you would turning somersaults on dry land he himself my brotherinlaw came back by train he said the north western railway was healthy enough for him another fellow i knew went for a weeks voyage round the coast and before they started the steward came to him to ask whether he would pay for each meal as he had it or arrange beforehand for the whole series the steward recommended the latter course as it would come so much cheaper he said they would do him for the whole week at two pounds five he said for breakfast there would be fish followed by a grill lunch was at one and consisted of four courses dinner at six soup fish entree joint poultry salad sweets cheese and dessert and a light meat supper at ten my friend thought he would close on the twopoundfive job he is a hearty eater and did so lunch came just as they were off sheerness he didnt feel so hungry as he thought he should and so contented himself with a bit of boiled beef and some strawberries and cream he pondered a good deal during the afternoon and at one time it seemed to him that he had been eating nothing but boiled beef for weeks and at other times it seemed that he must have been living on strawberries and cream for years neither the beef nor the strawberries and cream seemed happy either seemed discontented like at six they came and told him dinner was ready the announcement aroused no enthusiasm within him but he felt that there was some of that twopoundfive to be worked off and he held on to ropes and things and went down a pleasant odour of onions and hot ham mingled with fried fish and greens greeted him at the bottom of the ladder and then the steward came up with an oily smile and said what can i get you sir get me out of this was the feeble reply and they ran him up quick and propped him up over to leeward and left him for the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life on thin captains biscuits i mean that the biscuits were thin not the captain and sodawater but towards saturday he got uppish and went in for weak tea and dry toast and on monday he was gorging himself on chicken broth he left the ship on tuesday and as it steamed away from the landingstage he gazed after it regretfully there she goes he said there she goes with two pounds worth of food on board that belongs to me and that i havent had he said that if they had given him another day he thought he could have put it straight so i set my face against the sea trip not as i explained upon my own account i was never queer but i was afraid for george george said he should be all right and would rather like it but he would advise harris and me not to think of it as he felt sure we should both be ill harris said that to himself it was always a mystery how people managed to get sick at sea said he thought people must do it on purpose from affectation said he had often wished to be but had never been able then he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the channel when it was so rough that the passengers had to be tied into their berths and he and the captain were the only two living souls on board who were not ill sometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill but it was generally he and one other man if not he and another man then it was he by himself it is a curious fact but nobody ever is seasick on land at sea you come across plenty of people very bad indeed whole boatloads of them but i never met a man yet on land who had ever known at all what it was to be seasick where the thousands upon thousands of bad sailors that swarm in every ship hide themselves when they are on land is a mystery if most men were like a fellow i saw on the yarmouth boat one day i could account for the seeming enigma easily enough it was just off southend pier i recollect and he was leaning out through one of the portholes in a very dangerous position i went up to him to try and save him hi come further in i said shaking him by the shoulder youll be overboard oh my i wish i was was the only answer i could get and there i had to leave him three weeks afterwards i met him in the coffeeroom of a bath hotel talking about his voyages and explaining with enthusiasm how he loved the sea good sailor he replied in answer to a mild young mans envious query well i did feel a little queer once i confess it was off cape horn the vessel was wrecked the next morning i said werent you a little shaky by southend pier one day and wanted to be thrown overboard southend pier he replied with a puzzled expression yes going down to yarmouth last friday three weeks oh ah yes he answered brightening up i remember now i did have a headache that afternoon it was the pickles you know they were the most disgraceful pickles i ever tasted in a respectable boat did you have any for myself i have discovered an excellent preventive against sea sickness in balancing myself you stand in the centre of the deck and as the ship heaves and pitches you move your body about so as to keep it always straight when the front of the ship rises you lean forward till the deck almost touches your nose and when its back end gets up you lean backwards this is all very well for an hour or two but you cant balance yourself for a week george said lets go up the river he said we should have fresh air exercise and quiet the constant change of scene would occupy our minds including what there was of harriss and the hard work would give us a good appetite and make us sleep well harris said he didnt think george ought to do anything that would have a tendency to make him sleepier than he always was as it might be dangerous he said he didnt very well understand how george was going to sleep any more than he did now seeing that there were only twentyfour hours in each day summer and winter alike but thought that if he did sleep any more he might just as well be dead and so save his board and lodging harris said however that the river would suit him to a t i dont know what a t is except a sixpenny one which includes breadand butter and cake ad lib and is cheap at the price if you havent had any dinner it seems to suit everybody however which is greatly to its credit it suited me to a t too and harris and i both said it was a good idea of georges and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that we were surprised that george should have come out so sensible the only one who was not struck with the suggestion was montmorency he never did care for the river did montmorency its all very well for you fellows he says you like it but i dont theres nothing for me to do scenery is not in my line and i dont smoke if i see a rat you wont stop and if i go to sleep you get fooling about with the boat and slop me overboard if you ask me i call the whole thing bally foolishness we were three to one however and the motion was carried chapter ii plans discussed pleasures of campingout on fine nights ditto wet nights compromise decided on montmorency first impressions of fears lest he is too good for this world fears subsequently dismissed as groundless meeting adjourns we pulled out the maps and discussed plans we arranged to start on the following saturday from kingston harris and i would go down in the morning and take the boat up to chertsey and george who would not be able to get away from the city till the afternoon george goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day except saturdays when they wake him up and put him outside at two would meet us there should we camp out or sleep at inns george and i were for camping out we said it would be so wild and free so patriarchal like slowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the cold sad clouds silent like sorrowing children the birds have ceased their song and only the moorhens plaintive cry and the harsh croak of the corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters where the dying day breathes out her last from the dim woods on either bank nights ghostly army the grey shadows creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering rear guard of the light and pass with noiseless unseen feet above the waving rivergrass and through the sighing rushes and night upon her sombre throne folds her black wings above the darkening world and from her phantom palace lit by the pale stars reigns in stillness then we run our little boat into some quiet nook and the tent is pitched and the frugal supper cooked and eaten then the big pipes are filled and lighted and the pleasant chat goes round in musical undertone while in the pauses of our talk the river playing round the boat prattles strange old tales and secrets sings low the old childs song that it has sung so many thousand years will sing so many thousand years to come before its voice grows harsh and old a song that we who have learnt to love its changing face who have so often nestled on its yielding bosom think somehow we understand though we could not tell you in mere words the story that we listen to and we sit there by its margin while the moon who loves it too stoops down to kiss it with a sisters kiss and throws her silver arms around it clingingly and we watch it as it flows ever singing ever whispering out to meet its king the sea till our voices die away in silence and the pipes go out till we commonplace everyday young men enough feel strangely full of thoughts half sad half sweet and do not care or want to speak till we laugh and rising knock the ashes from our burntout pipes and say goodnight and lulled by the lapping water and the rustling trees we fall asleep beneath the great still stars and dream that the world is young again young and sweet as she used to be ere the centuries of fret and care had furrowed her fair face ere her childrens sins and follies had made old her loving heart sweet as she was in those bygone days when a newmade mother she nursed us her children upon her own deep breast ere the wiles of painted civilization had lured us away from her fond arms and the poisoned sneers of artificiality had made us ashamed of the simple life we led with her and the simple stately home where mankind was born so many thousands years ago harris said how about when it rained you can never rouse harris there is no poetry about harris no wild yearning for the unattainable harris never weeps he knows not why if harriss eyes fill with tears you can bet it is because harris has been eating raw onions or has put too much worcester over his chop if you were to stand at night by the seashore with harris and say hark do you not hear is it but the mermaids singing deep below the waving waters or sad spirits chanting dirges for white corpses held by seaweed harris would take you by the arm and say i know what it is old man youve got a chill now you come along with me i know a place round the corner here where you can get a drop of the finest scotch whisky you ever tasted put you right in less than no time harris always does know a place round the corner where you can get something brilliant in the drinking line i believe that if you met harris up in paradise supposing such a thing likely he would immediately greet you with so glad youve come old fellow ive found a nice place round the corner here where you can get some really firstclass nectar in the present instance however as regarded the camping out his practical view of the matter came as a very timely hint camping out in rainy weather is not pleasant it is evening you are wet through and there is a good two inches of water in the boat and all the things are damp you find a place on the banks that is not quite so puddly as other places you have seen and you land and lug out the tent and two of you proceed to fix it it is soaked and heavy and it flops about and tumbles down on you and clings round your head and makes you mad the rain is pouring steadily down all the time it is difficult enough to fix a tent in dry weather in wet the task becomes herculean instead of helping you it seems to you that the other man is simply playing the fool just as you get your side beautifully fixed he gives it a hoist from his end and spoils it all here what are you up to you call out what are you up to he retorts leggo cant you dont pull it youve got it all wrong you stupid ass you shout no i havent he yells back let go your side i tell you youve got it all wrong you roar wishing that you could get at him and you give your ropes a lug that pulls all his pegs out ah the bally idiot you hear him mutter to himself and then comes a savage haul and away goes your side you lay down the mallet and start to go round and tell him what you think about the whole business and at the same time he starts round in the same direction to come and explain his views to you and you follow each other round and round swearing at one another until the tent tumbles down in a heap and leaves you looking at each other across its ruins when you both indignantly exclaim in the same breath there you are what did i tell you meanwhile the third man who has been baling out the boat and who has spilled the water down his sleeve and has been cursing away to himself steadily for the last ten minutes wants to know what the thundering blazes youre playing at and why the blarmed tent isnt up yet at last somehow or other it does get up and you land the things it is hopeless attempting to make a wood fire so you light the methylated spirit stove and crowd round that rainwater is the chief article of diet at supper the bread is two thirds rainwater the beefsteakpie is exceedingly rich in it and the jam and the butter and the salt and the coffee have all combined with it to make soup after supper you find your tobacco is damp and you cannot smoke luckily you have a bottle of the stuff that cheers and inebriates if taken in proper quantity and this restores to you sufficient interest in life to induce you to go to bed there you dream that an elephant has suddenly sat down on your chest and that the volcano has exploded and thrown you down to the bottom of the sea the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom you wake up and grasp the idea that something terrible really has happened your first impression is that the end of the world has come and then you think that this cannot be and that it is thieves and murderers or else fire and this opinion you express in the usual method no help comes however and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you and you are being smothered somebody else seems in trouble too you can hear his faint cries coming from underneath your bed determining at all events to sell your life dearly you struggle frantically hitting out right and left with arms and legs and yelling lustily the while and at last something gives way and you find your head in the fresh air two feet off you dimly observe a halfdressed ruffian waiting to kill you and you are preparing for a lifeanddeath struggle with him when it begins to dawn upon you that its jim oh its you is it he says recognising you at the same moment yes you answer rubbing your eyes whats happened bally tents blown down i think he says wheres bill then you both raise up your voices and shout for bill and the ground beneath you heaves and rocks and the muffled voice that you heard before replies from out the ruin get off my head cant you and bill struggles out a muddy trampled wreck and in an unnecessarily aggressive mood he being under the evident belief that the whole thing has been done on purpose in the morning you are all three speechless owing to having caught severe colds in the night you also feel very quarrelsome and you swear at each other in hoarse whispers during the whole of breakfast time we therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights and hotel it and inn it and pub it like respectable folks when it was wet or when we felt inclined for a change montmorency hailed this compromise with much approval he does not revel in romantic solitude give him something noisy and if a trifle low so much the jollier to look at montmorency you would imagine that he was an angel sent upon the earth for some reason withheld from mankind in the shape of a small foxterrier there is a sort of ohwhatawicked worldthisisandhowiwishicoulddosomethingtomakeitbetterand nobler expression about montmorency that has been known to bring the tears into the eyes of pious old ladies and gentlemen when first he came to live at my expense i never thought i should be able to get him to stop long i used to sit down and look at him as he sat on the rug and looked up at me and think oh that dog will never live he will be snatched up to the bright skies in a chariot that is what will happen to him but when i had paid for about a dozen chickens that he had killed and had dragged him growling and kicking by the scruff of his neck out of a hundred and fourteen street fights and had had a dead cat brought round for my inspection by an irate female who called me a murderer and had been summoned by the man next door but one for having a ferocious dog at large that had kept him pinned up in his own toolshed afraid to venture his nose outside the door for over two hours on a cold night and had learned that the gardener unknown to myself had won thirty shillings by backing him to kill rats against time then i began to think that maybe theyd let him remain on earth for a bit longer after all to hang about a stable and collect a gang of the most disreputable dogs to be found in the town and lead them out to march round the slums to fight other disreputable dogs is montmorencys idea of life and so as i before observed he gave to the suggestion of inns and pubs and hotels his most emphatic approbation having thus settled the sleeping arrangements to the satisfaction of all four of us the only thing left to discuss was what we should take with us and this we had begun to argue when harris said hed had enough oratory for one night and proposed that we should go out and have a smile saying that he had found a place round by the square where you could really get a drop of irish worth drinking george said he felt thirsty i never knew george when he didnt and as i had a presentiment that a little whisky warm with a slice of lemon would do my complaint good the debate was by common assent adjourned to the following night and the assembly put on its hats and went out chapter iii arrangements settled harriss method of doing work how the elderly familyman puts up a picture george makes a sensible remark delights of early morning bathing provisions for getting upset so on the following evening we again assembled to discuss and arrange our plans harris said now the first thing to settle is what to take with us now you get a bit of paper and write down j and you get the grocery catalogue george and somebody give me a bit of pencil and then ill make out a list thats harris all over so ready to take the burden of everything himself and put it on the backs of other people he always reminds me of my poor uncle podger you never saw such a commotion up and down a house in all your life as when my uncle podger undertook to do a job a picture would have come home from the frame makers and be standing in the diningroom waiting to be put up and aunt podger would ask what was to be done with it and uncle podger would say oh you leave that to me dont you any of you worry yourselves about that ill do all that and then he would take off his coat and begin he would send the girl out for sixpenorth of nails and then one of the boys after her to tell her what size to get and from that he would gradually work down and start the whole house now you go and get me my hammer will he would shout and you bring me the rule tom and i shall want the stepladder and i had better have a kitchenchair too and jim you run round to mr goggles and tell him pas kind regards and hopes his legs better and will he lend him his spiritlevel and dont you go maria because i shall want somebody to hold me the light and when the girl comes back she must go out again for a bit of picturecord and tom wheres tom tom you come here i shall want you to hand me up the picture and then he would lift up the picture and drop it and it would come out of the frame and he would try to save the glass and cut himself and then he would spring round the room looking for his handkerchief he could not find his handkerchief because it was in the pocket of the coat he had taken off and he did not know where he had put the coat and all the house had to leave off looking for his tools and start looking for his coat while he would dance round and hinder them doesnt anybody in the whole house know where my coat is i never came across such a set in all my life upon my word i didnt six of you and you cant find a coat that i put down not five minutes ago well of all the then hed get up and find that he had been sitting on it and would call out oh you can give it up ive found it myself now might just as well ask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it and when half an hour had been spent in tying up his finger and a new glass had been got and the tools and the ladder and the chair and the candle had been brought he would have another go the whole family including the girl and the charwoman standing round in a semicircle ready to help two people would have to hold the chair and a third would help him up on it and hold him there and a fourth would hand him a nail and a fifth would pass him up the hammer and he would take hold of the nail and drop it there he would say in an injured tone now the nails gone and we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel for it while he would stand on the chair and grunt and want to know if he was to be kept there all the evening the nail would be found at last but by that time he would have lost the hammer wheres the hammer what did i do with the hammer great heavens seven of you gaping round there and you dont know what i did with the hammer we would find the hammer for him and then he would have lost sight of the mark he had made on the wall where the nail was to go in and each of us had to get up on the chair beside him and see if we could find it and we would each discover it in a different place and he would call us all fools one after another and tell us to get down and he would take the rule and remeasure and find that he wanted half thirtyone and threeeighths inches from the corner and would try to do it in his head and go mad and we would all try to do it in our heads and all arrive at different results and sneer at one another and in the general row the original number would be forgotten and uncle podger would have to measure it again he would use a bit of string this time and at the critical moment when the old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle of fortyfive and trying to reach a point three inches beyond what was possible for him to reach the string would slip and down he would slide on to the piano a really fine musical effect being produced by the suddenness with which his head and body struck all the notes at the same time and aunt maria would say that she would not allow the children to stand round and hear such language at last uncle podger would get the spot fixed again and put the point of the nail on it with his left hand and take the hammer in his right hand and with the first blow he would smash his thumb and drop the hammer with a yell on somebodys toes aunt maria would mildly observe that next time uncle podger was going to hammer a nail into the wall she hoped hed let her know in time so that she could make arrangements to go and spend a week with her mother while it was being done oh you women you make such a fuss over everything uncle podger would reply picking himself up why i like doing a little job of this sort and then he would have another try and at the second blow the nail would go clean through the plaster and half the hammer after it and uncle podger be precipitated against the wall with force nearly sufficient to flatten his nose then we had to find the rule and the string again and a new hole was made and about midnight the picture would be up very crooked and insecure the wall for yards round looking as if it had been smoothed down with a rake and everybody dead beat and wretched except uncle podger there you are he would say stepping heavily off the chair on to the charwomans corns and surveying the mess he had made with evident pride why some people would have had a man in to do a little thing like that harris will be just that sort of man when he grows up i know and i told him so i said i could not permit him to take so much labour upon himself i said no you get the paper and the pencil and the catalogue and george write down and ill do the work the first list we made out had to be discarded it was clear that the upper reaches of the thames would not allow of the navigation of a boat sufficiently large to take the things we had set down as indispensable so we tore the list up and looked at one another george said you know we are on a wrong track altogether we must not think of the things we could do with but only of the things that we cant do without george comes out really quite sensible at times youd be surprised i call that downright wisdom not merely as regards the present case but with reference to our trip up the river of life generally how many people on that voyage load up the boat till it is ever in danger of swamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to the pleasure and comfort of the trip but which are really only useless lumber how they pile the poor little craft masthigh with fine clothes and big houses with useless servants and a host of swell friends that do not care twopence for them and that they do not care three hapence for with expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys with formalities and fashions with pretence and ostentation and with oh heaviest maddest lumber of all the dread of what will my neighbour think with luxuries that only cloy with pleasures that bore with empty show that like the criminals iron crown of yore makes to bleed and swoon the aching head that wears it it is lumber man all lumber throw it overboard it makes the boat so heavy to pull you nearly faint at the oars it makes it so cumbersome and dangerous to manage you never know a moments freedom from anxiety and care never gain a moments rest for dreamy laziness no time to watch the windy shadows skimming lightly oer the shallows or the glittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples or the great trees by the margin looking down at their own image or the woods all green and golden or the lilies white and yellow or the sombre waving rushes or the sedges or the orchis or the blue forgetmenots throw the lumber over man let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasures one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing you will find the boat easier to pull then and it will not be so liable to upset and it will not matter so much if it does upset good plain merchandise will stand water you will have time to think as well as to work time to drink in lifes sunshine time to listen to the aeolian music that the wind of god draws from the human heartstrings around us time to i beg your pardon really i quite forgot well we left the list to george and he began it we wont take a tent suggested george we will have a boat with a cover it is ever so much simpler and more comfortable it seemed a good thought and we adopted it i do not know whether you have ever seen the thing i mean you fix iron hoops up over the boat and stretch a huge canvas over them and fasten it down all round from stem to stern and it converts the boat into a sort of little house and it is beautifully cosy though a trifle stuffy but there everything has its drawbacks as the man said when his motherinlaw died and they came down upon him for the funeral expenses george said that in that case we must take a rug each a lamp some soap a brush and comb between us a toothbrush each a basin some tooth powder some shaving tackle sounds like a french exercise doesnt it and a couple of bigtowels for bathing i notice that people always make gigantic arrangements for bathing when they are going anywhere near the water but that they dont bathe much when they are there it is the same when you go to the seaside i always determine when thinking over the matter in london that ill get up early every morning and go and have a dip before breakfast and i religiously pack up a pair of drawers and a bath towel i always get red bathing drawers i rather fancy myself in red drawers they suit my complexion so but when i get to the sea i dont feel somehow that i want that early morning bathe nearly so much as i did when i was in town on the contrary i feel more that i want to stop in bed till the last moment and then come down and have my breakfast once or twice virtue has triumphed and i have got out at six and halfdressed myself and have taken my drawers and towel and stumbled dismally off but i havent enjoyed it they seem to keep a specially cutting east wind waiting for me when i go to bathe in the early morning and they pick out all the threecornered stones and put them on the top and they sharpen up the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so that i cant see them and they take the sea and put it two miles out so that i have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop shivering through six inches of water and when i do get to the sea it is rough and quite insulting one huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture as hard as ever it can down on to a rock which has been put there for me and before ive said oh ugh and found out what has gone the wave comes back and carries me out to midocean i begin to strike out frantically for the shore and wonder if i shall ever see home and friends again and wish id been kinder to my little sister when a boy when i was a boy i mean just when i have given up all hope a wave retires and leaves me sprawling like a starfish on the sand and i get up and look back and find that ive been swimming for my life in two feet of water i hop back and dress and crawl home where i have to pretend i liked it in the present instance we all talked as if we were going to have a long swim every morning george said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh morning and plunge into the limpid river harris said there was nothing like a swim before breakfast to give you an appetite he said it always gave him an appetite george said that if it was going to make harris eat more than harris ordinarily ate then he should protest against harris having a bath at all he said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food for harris up against stream as it was i urged upon george however how much pleasanter it would be to have harris clean and fresh about the boat even if we did have to take a few more hundredweight of provisions and he got to see it in my light and withdrew his opposition to harriss bath agreed finally that we should take three bath towels so as not to keep each other waiting for clothes george said two suits of flannel would be sufficient as we could wash them ourselves in the river when they got dirty we asked him if he had ever tried washing flannels in the river and he replied no not exactly himself like but he knew some fellows who had and it was easy enough and harris and i were weak enough to fancy he knew what he was talking about and that three respectable young men without position or influence and with no experience in washing could really clean their own shirts and trousers in the river thames with a bit of soap we were to learn in the days to come when it was too late that george was a miserable impostor who could evidently have known nothing whatever about the matter if you had seen these clothes after but as the shilling shockers say we anticipate george impressed upon us to take a change of underthings and plenty of socks in case we got upset and wanted a change also plenty of handkerchiefs as they would do to wipe things and a pair of leather boots as well as our boating shoes as we should want them if we got upset chapter iv the food question objections to paraffine oil as an atmosphere advantages of cheese as a travelling companion a married woman deserts her home further provision for getting upset i pack cussedness of toothbrushes george and harris pack awful behaviour of montmorency we retire to rest then we discussed the food question george said begin with breakfast george is so practical now for breakfast we shall want a fryingpan harris said it was indigestible but we merely urged him not to be an ass and george went on a teapot and a kettle and a methylated spirit stove no oil said george with a significant look and harris and i agreed we had taken up an oilstove once but never again it had been like living in an oilshop that week it oozed i never saw such a thing as paraffine oil is to ooze we kept it in the nose of the boat and from there it oozed down to the rudder impregnating the whole boat and everything in it on its way and it oozed over the river and saturated the scenery and spoilt the atmosphere sometimes a westerly oily wind blew and at other times an easterly oily wind and sometimes it blew a northerly oily wind and maybe a southerly oily wind but whether it came from the arctic snows or was raised in the waste of the desert sands it came alike to us laden with the fragrance of paraffine oil and that oil oozed up and ruined the sunset and as for the moonbeams they positively reeked of paraffine we tried to get away from it at marlow we left the boat by the bridge and took a walk through the town to escape it but it followed us the whole town was full of oil we passed through the churchyard and it seemed as if the people had been buried in oil the high street stunk of oil we wondered how people could live in it and we walked miles upon miles out birmingham way but it was no use the country was steeped in oil at the end of that trip we met together at midnight in a lonely field under a blasted oak and took an awful oath we had been swearing for a whole week about the thing in an ordinary middleclass way but this was a swell affair an awful oath never to take paraffine oil with us in a boat againexcept of course in case of sickness therefore in the present instance we confined ourselves to methylated spirit even that is bad enough you get methylated pie and methylated cake but methylated spirit is more wholesome when taken into the system in large quantities than paraffine oil for other breakfast things george suggested eggs and bacon which were easy to cook cold meat tea bread and butter and jam for lunch he said we could have biscuits cold meat bread and butter and jam but no cheese cheese like oil makes too much of itself it wants the whole boat to itself it goes through the hamper and gives a cheesy flavour to everything else there you cant tell whether you are eating applepie or german sausage or strawberries and cream it all seems cheese there is too much odour about cheese i remember a friend of mine buying a couple of cheeses at liverpool splendid cheeses they were ripe and mellow and with a two hundred horsepower scent about them that might have been warranted to carry three miles and knock a man over at two hundred yards i was in liverpool at the time and my friend said that if i didnt mind he would get me to take them back with me to london as he should not be coming up for a day or two himself and he did not think the cheeses ought to be kept much longer oh with pleasure dear boy i replied with pleasure i called for the cheeses and took them away in a cab it was a ramshackle affair dragged along by a knockkneed brokenwinded somnambulist which his owner in a moment of enthusiasm during conversation referred to as a horse i put the cheeses on the top and we started off at a shamble that would have done credit to the swiftest steamroller ever built and all went merry as a funeral bell until we turned the corner there the wind carried a whiff from the cheeses full on to our steed it woke him up and with a snort of terror he dashed off at three miles an hour the wind still blew in his direction and before we reached the end of the street he was laying himself out at the rate of nearly four miles an hour leaving the cripples and stout old ladies simply nowhere it took two porters as well as the driver to hold him in at the station and i do not think they would have done it even then had not one of the men had the presence of mind to put a handkerchief over his nose and to light a bit of brown paper i took my ticket and marched proudly up the platform with my cheeses the people falling back respectfully on either side the train was crowded and i had to get into a carriage where there were already seven other people one crusty old gentleman objected but i got in notwithstanding and putting my cheeses upon the rack squeezed down with a pleasant smile and said it was a warm day a few moments passed and then the old gentleman began to fidget very close in here he said quite oppressive said the man next him and then they both began sniffing and at the third sniff they caught it right on the chest and rose up without another word and went out and then a stout lady got up and said it was disgraceful that a respectable married woman should be harried about in this way and gathered up a bag and eight parcels and went the remaining four passengers sat on for a while until a solemnlooking man in the corner who from his dress and general appearance seemed to belong to the undertaker class said it put him in mind of dead baby and the other three passengers tried to get out of the door at the same time and hurt themselves i smiled at the black gentleman and said i thought we were going to have the carriage to ourselves and he laughed pleasantly and said that some people made such a fuss over a little thing but even he grew strangely depressed after we had started and so when we reached crewe i asked him to come and have a drink he accepted and we forced our way into the buffet where we yelled and stamped and waved our umbrellas for a quarter of an hour and then a young lady came and asked us if we wanted anything whats yours i said turning to my friend ill have halfacrowns worth of brandy neat if you please miss he responded and he went off quietly after he had drunk it and got into another carriage which i thought mean from crewe i had the compartment to myself though the train was crowded as we drew up at the different stations the people seeing my empty carriage would rush for it here y are maria come along plenty of room all right tom well get in here they would shout and they would run along carrying heavy bags and fight round the door to get in first and one would open the door and mount the steps and stagger back into the arms of the man behind him and they would all come and have a sniff and then droop off and squeeze into other carriages or pay the difference and go first from euston i took the cheeses down to my friends house when his wife came into the room she smelt round for an instant then she said what is it tell me the worst i said its cheeses tom bought them in liverpool and asked me to bring them up with me and i added that i hoped she understood that it had nothing to do with me and she said that she was sure of that but that she would speak to tom about it when he came back my friend was detained in liverpool longer than he expected and three days later as he hadnt returned home his wife called on me she said what did tom say about those cheeses i replied that he had directed they were to be kept in a moist place and that nobody was to touch them she said nobodys likely to touch them had he smelt them i thought he had and added that he seemed greatly attached to them you think he would be upset she queried if i gave a man a sovereign to take them away and bury them i answered that i thought he would never smile again an idea struck her she said do you mind keeping them for him let me send them round to you madam i replied for myself i like the smell of cheese and the journey the other day with them from liverpool i shall ever look back upon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday but in this world we must consider others the lady under whose roof i have the honour of residing is a widow and for all i know possibly an orphan too she has a strong i may say an eloquent objection to being what she terms put upon the presence of your husbands cheeses in her house she would i instinctively feel regard as a put upon and it shall never be said that i put upon the widow and the orphan very well then said my friends wife rising all i have to say is that i shall take the children and go to an hotel until those cheeses are eaten i decline to live any longer in the same house with them she kept her word leaving the place in charge of the charwoman who when asked if she could stand the smell replied what smell and who when taken close to the cheeses and told to sniff hard said she could detect a faint odour of melons it was argued from this that little injury could result to the woman from the atmosphere and she was left the hotel bill came to fifteen guineas and my friend after reckoning everything up found that the cheeses had cost him eightandsixpence a pound he said he dearly loved a bit of cheese but it was beyond his means so he determined to get rid of them he threw them into the canal but had to fish them out again as the bargemen complained they said it made them feel quite faint and after that he took them one dark night and left them in the parish mortuary but the coroner discovered them and made a fearful fuss he said it was a plot to deprive him of his living by waking up the corpses my friend got rid of them at last by taking them down to a seaside town and burying them on the beach it gained the place quite a reputation visitors said they had never noticed before how strong the air was and weakchested and consumptive people used to throng there for years afterwards fond as i am of cheese therefore i hold that george was right in declining to take any we shant want any tea said george harriss face fell at this but well have a good round square slapup meal at seven dinner tea and supper combined harris grew more cheerful george suggested meat and fruit pies cold meat tomatoes fruit and green stuff for drink we took some wonderful sticky concoction of harriss which you mixed with water and called lemonade plenty of tea and a bottle of whisky in case as george said we got upset it seemed to me that george harped too much on the gettingupset idea it seemed to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in but im glad we took the whisky we didnt take beer or wine they are a mistake up the river they make you feel sleepy and heavy a glass in the evening when you are doing a mouch round the town and looking at the girls is all right enough but dont drink when the sun is blazing down on your head and youve got hard work to do we made a list of the things to be taken and a pretty lengthy one it was before we parted that evening the next day which was friday we got them all together and met in the evening to pack we got a big gladstone for the clothes and a couple of hampers for the victuals and the cooking utensils we moved the table up against the window piled everything in a heap in the middle of the floor and sat round and looked at it i said id pack i rather pride myself on my packing packing is one of those many things that i feel i know more about than any other person living it surprises me myself sometimes how many of these subjects there are i impressed the fact upon george and harris and told them that they had better leave the whole matter entirely to me they fell into the suggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it george put on a pipe and spread himself over the easychair and harris cocked his legs on the table and lit a cigar this was hardly what i intended what i had meant of course was that i should boss the job and that harris and george should potter about under my directions i pushing them aside every now and then with oh you here let me do it there you are simple enough really teaching them as you might say their taking it in the way they did irritated me there is nothing does irritate me more than seeing other people sitting about doing nothing when im working i lived with a man once who used to make me mad that way he would loll on the sofa and watch me doing things by the hour together following me round the room with his eyes wherever i went he said it did him real good to look on at me messing about he said it made him feel that life was not an idle dream to be gaped and yawned through but a noble task full of duty and stern work he said he often wondered now how he could have gone on before he met me never having anybody to look at while they worked now im not like that i cant sit still and see another man slaving and working i want to get up and superintend and walk round with my hands in my pockets and tell him what to do it is my energetic nature i cant help it however i did not say anything but started the packing it seemed a longer job than i had thought it was going to be but i got the bag finished at last and i sat on it and strapped it aint you going to put the boots in said harris and i looked round and found i had forgotten them thats just like harris he couldnt have said a word until id got the bag shut and strapped of course and george laughed one of those irritating senseless chuckleheaded crackjawed laughs of his they do make me so wild i opened the bag and packed the boots in and then just as i was going to close it a horrible idea occurred to me had i packed my tooth brush i dont know how it is but i never do know whether ive packed my toothbrush my toothbrush is a thing that haunts me when im travelling and makes my life a misery i dream that i havent packed it and wake up in a cold perspiration and get out of bed and hunt for it and in the morning i pack it before i have used it and have to unpack again to get it and it is always the last thing i turn out of the bag and then i repack and forget it and have to rush upstairs for it at the last moment and carry it to the railway station wrapped up in my pocket handkerchief of course i had to turn every mortal thing out now and of course i could not find it i rummaged the things up into much the same state that they must have been before the world was created and when chaos reigned of course i found georges and harriss eighteen times over but i couldnt find my own i put the things back one by one and held everything up and shook it then i found it inside a boot i repacked once more when i had finished george asked if the soap was in i said i didnt care a hang whether the soap was in or whether it wasnt and i slammed the bag to and strapped it and found that i had packed my tobaccopouch in it and had to reopen it it got shut up finally at pm and then there remained the hampers to do harris said that we should be wanting to start in less than twelve hours time and thought that he and george had better do the rest and i agreed and sat down and they had a go they began in a lighthearted spirit evidently intending to show me how to do it i made no comment i only waited when george is hanged harris will be the worst packer in this world and i looked at the piles of plates and cups and kettles and bottles and jars and pies and stoves and cakes and tomatoes c and felt that the thing would soon become exciting it did they started with breaking a cup that was the first thing they did they did that just to show you what they could do and to get you interested then harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashed it and they had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon and then it was georges turn and he trod on the butter i didnt say anything but i came over and sat on the edge of the table and watched them it irritated them more than anything i could have said i felt that it made them nervous and excited and they stepped on things and put things behind them and then couldnt find them when they wanted them and they packed the pies at the bottom and put heavy things on top and smashed the pies in they upset salt over everything and as for the butter i never saw two men do more with oneandtwopence worth of butter in my whole life than they did after george had got it off his slipper they tried to put it in the kettle it wouldnt go in and what was in wouldnt come out they did scrape it out at last and put it down on a chair and harris sat on it and it stuck to him and they went looking for it all over the room ill take my oath i put it down on that chair said george staring at the empty seat i saw you do it myself not a minute ago said harris then they started round the room again looking for it and then they met again in the centre and stared at one another most extraordinary thing i ever heard of said george so mysterious said harris then george got round at the back of harris and saw it why here it is all the time he exclaimed indignantly where cried harris spinning round stand still cant you roared george flying after him and they got it off and packed it in the teapot montmorency was in it all of course montmorencys ambition in life is to get in the way and be sworn at if he can squirm in anywhere where he particularly is not wanted and be a perfect nuisance and make people mad and have things thrown at his head then he feels his day has not been wasted to get somebody to stumble over him and curse him steadily for an hour is his highest aim and object and when he has succeeded in accomplishing this his conceit becomes quite unbearable he came and sat down on things just when they were wanted to be packed and he laboured under the fixed belief that whenever harris or george reached out their hand for anything it was his cold damp nose that they wanted he put his leg into the jam and he worried the teaspoons and he pretended that the lemons were rats and got into the hamper and killed three of them before harris could land him with the fryingpan harris said i encouraged him i didnt encourage him a dog like that dont want any encouragement its the natural original sin that is born in him that makes him do things like that the packing was done at and harris sat on the big hamper and said he hoped nothing would be found broken george said that if anything was broken it was broken which reflection seemed to comfort him he also said he was ready for bed we were all ready for bed harris was to sleep with us that night and we went upstairs we tossed for beds and harris had to sleep with me he said do you prefer the inside or the outside j i said i generally preferred to sleep inside a bed harris said it was old george said what time shall i wake you fellows harris said seven i said no six because i wanted to write some letters harris and i had a bit of a row over it but at last split the difference and said halfpast six wake us at george we said george made no answer and we found on going over that he had been asleep for some time so we placed the bath where he could tumble into it on getting out in the morning and went to bed ourselves chapter v mrs p arouses us george the sluggard the weather forecast swindle our luggage depravity of the small boy the people gather round us we drive off in great style and arrive at waterloo innocence of south western officials concerning such worldly things as trains we are afloat afloat in an open boat it was mrs poppets that woke me up next morning she said do you know that its nearly nine oclock sir nine o what i cried starting up nine oclock she replied through the keyhole i thought you was a oversleeping yourselves i woke harris and told him he said i thought you wanted to get up at six so i did i answered why didnt you wake me how could i wake you when you didnt wake me he retorted now we shant get on the water till after twelve i wonder you take the trouble to get up at all um i replied lucky for you that i do if i hadnt woke you youd have lain there for the whole fortnight we snarled at one another in this strain for the next few minutes when we were interrupted by a defiant snore from george it reminded us for the first time since our being called of his existence there he lay the man who had wanted to know what time he should wake us on his back with his mouth wide open and his knees stuck up i dont know why it should be i am sure but the sight of another man asleep in bed when i am up maddens me it seems to me so shocking to see the precious hours of a mans life the priceless moments that will never come back to him again being wasted in mere brutish sleep there was george throwing away in hideous sloth the inestimable gift of time his valuable life every second of which he would have to account for hereafter passing away from him unused he might have been up stuffing himself with eggs and bacon irritating the dog or flirting with the slavey instead of sprawling there sunk in soulclogging oblivion it was a terrible thought harris and i appeared to be struck by it at the same instant we determined to save him and in this noble resolve our own dispute was forgotten we flew across and slung the clothes off him and harris landed him one with a slipper and i shouted in his ear and he awoke wasermarrer he observed sitting up get up you fatheaded chunk roared harris its quarter to ten what he shrieked jumping out of bed into the bath who the thunder put this thing here we told him he must have been a fool not to see the bath we finished dressing and when it came to the extras we remembered that we had packed the toothbrushes and the brush and comb that toothbrush of mine will be the death of me i know and we had to go downstairs and fish them out of the bag and when we had done that george wanted the shaving tackle we told him that he would have to go without shaving that morning as we werent going to unpack that bag again for him nor for anyone like him he said dont be absurd how can i go into the city like this it was certainly rather rough on the city but what cared we for human suffering as harris said in his common vulgar way the city would have to lump it we went downstairs to breakfast montmorency had invited two other dogs to come and see him off and they were whiling away the time by fighting on the doorstep we calmed them with an umbrella and sat down to chops and cold beef harris said the great thing is to make a good breakfast and he started with a couple of chops saying that he would take these while they were hot as the beef could wait george got hold of the paper and read us out the boating fatalities and the weather forecast which latter prophesied rain cold wet to fine whatever more than usually ghastly thing in weather that may be occasional local thunderstorms east wind with general depression over the midland counties london and channel bar falling i do think that of all the silly irritating tomfoolishness by which we are plagued this weatherforecast fraud is about the most aggravating it forecasts precisely what happened yesterday or a the day before and precisely the opposite of what is going to happen today i remember a holiday of mine being completely ruined one late autumn by our paying attention to the weather report of the local newspaper heavy showers with thunderstorms may be expected today it would say on monday and so we would give up our picnic and stop indoors all day waiting for the rain and people would pass the house going off in wagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be the sun shining out and not a cloud to be seen ah we said as we stood looking out at them through the window wont they come home soaked and we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get and came back and stirred the fire and got our books and arranged our specimens of seaweed and cockle shells by twelve oclock with the sun pouring into the room the heat became quite oppressive and we wondered when those heavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin ah theyll come in the afternoon youll find we said to each other oh wont those people get wet what a lark at one oclock the landlady would come in to ask if we werent going out as it seemed such a lovely day no no we replied with a knowing chuckle not we we dont mean to get wet no no and when the afternoon was nearly gone and still there was no sign of rain we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea that it would come down all at once just as the people had started for home and were out of the reach of any shelter and that they would thus get more drenched than ever but not a drop ever fell and it finished a grand day and a lovely night after it the next morning we would read that it was going to be a warm fine to setfair day much heat and we would dress ourselves in flimsy things and go out and halfanhour after we had started it would commence to rain hard and a bitterly cold wind would spring up and both would keep on steadily for the whole day and we would come home with colds and rheumatism all over us and go to bed the weather is a thing that is beyond me altogether i never can understand it the barometer is useless it is as misleading as the newspaper forecast there was one hanging up in a hotel at oxford at which i was staying last spring and when i got there it was pointing to set fair it was simply pouring with rain outside and had been all day and i couldnt quite make matters out i tapped the barometer and it jumped up and pointed to very dry the boots stopped as he was passing and said he expected it meant tomorrow i fancied that maybe it was thinking of the week before last but boots said no he thought not i tapped it again the next morning and it went up still higher and the rain came down faster than ever on wednesday i went and hit it again and the pointer went round towards set fair very dry and much heat until it was stopped by the peg and couldnt go any further it tried its best but the instrument was built so that it couldnt prophesy fine weather any harder than it did without breaking itself it evidently wanted to go on and prognosticate drought and water famine and sunstroke and simooms and such things but the peg prevented it and it had to be content with pointing to the mere commonplace very dry meanwhile the rain came down in a steady torrent and the lower part of the town was under water owing to the river having overflowed boots said it was evident that we were going to have a prolonged spell of grand weather some time and read out a poem which was printed over the top of the oracle about long foretold long last short notice soon past the fine weather never came that summer i expect that machine must have been referring to the following spring then there are those new style of barometers the long straight ones i never can make head or tail of those there is one side for am yesterday and one side for am today but you cant always get there as early as ten you know it rises or falls for rain and fine with much or less wind and one end is nly and the other ely whats ely got to do with it and if you tap it it doesnt tell you anything and youve got to correct it to sealevel and reduce it to fahrenheit and even then i dont know the answer but who wants to be foretold the weather it is bad enough when it comes without our having the misery of knowing about it beforehand the prophet we like is the old man who on the particularly gloomylooking morning of some day when we particularly want it to be fine looks round the horizon with a particularly knowing eye and says oh no sir i think it will clear up all right it will break all right enough sir ah he knows we say as we wish him goodmorning and start off wonderful how these old fellows can tell and we feel an affection for that man which is not at all lessened by the circumstances of its not clearing up but continuing to rain steadily all day ah well we feel he did his best for the man that prophesies us bad weather on the contrary we entertain only bitter and revengeful thoughts going to clear up dye think we shout cheerily as we pass well no sir im afraid its settled down for the day he replies shaking his head stupid old fool we mutter whats he know about it and if his portent proves correct we come back feeling still more angry against him and with a vague notion that somehow or other he has had something to do with it it was too bright and sunny on this especial morning for georges blood curdling readings about bar falling atmospheric disturbance passing in an oblique line over southern europe and pressure increasing to very much upset us and so finding that he could not make us wretched and was only wasting his time he sneaked the cigarette that i had carefully rolled up for myself and went then harris and i having finished up the few things left on the table carted out our luggage on to the doorstep and waited for a cab there seemed a good deal of luggage when we put it all together there was the gladstone and the small handbag and the two hampers and a large roll of rugs and some four or five overcoats and macintoshes and a few umbrellas and then there was a melon by itself in a bag because it was too bulky to go in anywhere and a couple of pounds of grapes in another bag and a japanese paper umbrella and a frying pan which being too long to pack we had wrapped round with brown paper it did look a lot and harris and i began to feel rather ashamed of it though why we should be i cant see no cab came by but the street boys did and got interested in the show apparently and stopped biggss boy was the first to come round biggs is our greengrocer and his chief talent lies in securing the services of the most abandoned and unprincipled errandboys that civilisation has as yet produced if anything more than usually villainous in the boyline crops up in our neighbourhood we know that it is biggss latest i was told that at the time of the great coram street murder it was promptly concluded by our street that biggss boy for that period was at the bottom of it and had he not been able in reply to the severe crossexamination to which he was subjected by no when he called there for orders the morning after the crime assisted by no who happened to be on the step at the time to prove a complete alibi it would have gone hard with him i didnt know biggss boy at that time but from what i have seen of them since i should not have attached much importance to that alibi myself biggss boy as i have said came round the corner he was evidently in a great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision but on catching sight of harris and me and montmorency and the things he eased up and stared harris and i frowned at him this might have wounded a more sensitive nature but biggss boys are not as a rule touchy he came to a dead stop a yard from our step and leaning up against the railings and selecting a straw to chew fixed us with his eye he evidently meant to see this thing out in another moment the grocers boy passed on the opposite side of the street biggss boy hailed him hi ground floor o s amoving the grocers boy came across and took up a position on the other side of the step then the young gentleman from the bootshop stopped and joined biggss boy while the emptycan superintendent from the blue posts took up an independent position on the curb they aint agoing to starve are they said the gentleman from the bootshop ah youd want to take a thing or two with you retorted the blue posts if you was agoing to cross the atlantic in a small boat they aint agoing to cross the atlantic struck in biggss boy theyre agoing to find stanley by this time quite a small crowd had collected and people were asking each other what was the matter one party the young and giddy portion of the crowd held that it was a wedding and pointed out harris as the bridegroom while the elder and more thoughtful among the populace inclined to the idea that it was a funeral and that i was probably the corpses brother at last an empty cab turned up it is a street where as a rule and when they are not wanted empty cabs pass at the rate of three a minute and hang about and get in your way and packing ourselves and our belongings into it and shooting out a couple of montmorencys friends who had evidently sworn never to forsake him we drove away amidst the cheers of the crowd biggss boy shying a carrot after us for luck we got to waterloo at eleven and asked where the elevenfive started from of course nobody knew nobody at waterloo ever does know where a train is going to start from or where a train when it does start is going to or anything about it the porter who took our things thought it would go from number two platform while another porter with whom he discussed the question had heard a rumour that it would go from number one the stationmaster on the other hand was convinced it would start from the local to put an end to the matter we went upstairs and asked the traffic superintendent and he told us that he had just met a man who said he had seen it at number three platform we went to number three platform but the authorities there said that they rather thought that train was the southampton express or else the windsor loop but they were sure it wasnt the kingston train though why they were sure it wasnt they couldnt say then our porter said he thought that must be it on the highlevel platform said he thought he knew the train so we went to the high level platform and saw the enginedriver and asked him if he was going to kingston he said he couldnt say for certain of course but that he rather thought he was anyhow if he wasnt the for kingston he said he was pretty confident he was the for virginia water or the am express for the isle of wight or somewhere in that direction and we should all know when we got there we slipped halfacrown into his hand and begged him to be the for kingston nobody will ever know on this line we said what you are or where youre going you know the way you slip off quietly and go to kingston well i dont know gents replied the noble fellow but i suppose some trains got to go to kingston and ill do it gimme the half crown thus we got to kingston by the london and southwestern railway we learnt afterwards that the train we had come by was really the exeter mail and that they had spent hours at waterloo looking for it and nobody knew what had become of it our boat was waiting for us at kingston just below bridge and to it we wended our way and round it we stored our luggage and into it we stepped are you all right sir said the man right it is we answered and with harris at the sculls and i at the tillerlines and montmorency unhappy and deeply suspicious in the prow out we shot on to the waters which for a fortnight were to be our home chapter vi kingston instructive remarks on early english history instructive observations on carved oak and life in general sad case of stivvings junior musings on antiquity i forget that i am steering interesting result hampton court maze harris as a guide it was a glorious morning late spring or early summer as you care to take it when the dainty sheen of grass and leaf is blushing to a deeper green and the year seems like a fair young maid trembling with strange wakening pulses on the brink of womanhood the quaint back streets of kingston where they came down to the waters edge looked quite picturesque in the flashing sunlight the glinting river with its drifting barges the wooded towpath the trimkept villas on the other side harris in a red and orange blazer grunting away at the sculls the distant glimpses of the grey old palace of the tudors all made a sunny picture so bright but calm so full of life and yet so peaceful that early in the day though it was i felt myself being dreamily lulled off into a musing fit i mused on kingston or kyningestun as it was once called in the days when saxon kinges were crowned there great caesar crossed the river there and the roman legions camped upon its sloping uplands caesar like in later years elizabeth seems to have stopped everywhere only he was more respectable than good queen bess he didnt put up at the publichouses she was nuts on publichouses was englands virgin queen theres scarcely a pub of any attractions within ten miles of london that she does not seem to have looked in at or stopped at or slept at some time or other i wonder now supposing harris say turned over a new leaf and became a great and good man and got to be prime minister and died if they would put up signs over the publichouses that he had patronised harris had a glass of bitter in this house harris had two of scotch cold here in the summer of harris was chucked from here in december no there would be too many of them it would be the houses that he had never entered that would become famous only house in south london that harris never had a drink in the people would flock to it to see what could have been the matter with it how poor weakminded king edwy must have hated kyningestun the coronation feast had been too much for him maybe boars head stuffed with sugarplums did not agree with him it wouldnt with me i know and he had had enough of sack and mead so he slipped from the noisy revel to steal a quiet moonlight hour with his beloved elgiva perhaps from the casement standing handinhand they were watching the calm moonlight on the river while from the distant halls the boisterous revelry floated in broken bursts of faintheard din and tumult then brutal odo and st dunstan force their rude way into the quiet room and hurl coarse insults at the sweetfaced queen and drag poor edwy back to the loud clamour of the drunken brawl years later to the crash of battlemusic saxon kings and saxon revelry were buried side by side and kingstons greatness passed away for a time to rise once more when hampton court became the palace of the tudors and the stuarts and the royal barges strained at their moorings on the rivers bank and brightcloaked gallants swaggered down the watersteps to cry what ferry ho gadzooks gramercy many of the old houses round about speak very plainly of those days when kingston was a royal borough and nobles and courtiers lived there near their king and the long road to the palace gates was gay all day with clanking steel and prancing palfreys and rustling silks and velvets and fair faces the large and spacious houses with their oriel latticed windows their huge fireplaces and their gabled roofs breathe of the days of hose and doublet of pearlembroidered stomachers and complicated oaths they were upraised in the days when men knew how to build the hard red bricks have only grown more firmly set with time and their oak stairs do not creak and grunt when you try to go down them quietly speaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a magnificent carved oak staircase in one of the houses in kingston it is a shop now in the marketplace but it was evidently once the mansion of some great personage a friend of mine who lives at kingston went in there to buy a hat one day and in a thoughtless moment put his hand in his pocket and paid for it then and there the shopman he knows my friend was naturally a little staggered at first but quickly recovering himself and feeling that something ought to be done to encourage this sort of thing asked our hero if he would like to see some fine old carved oak my friend said he would and the shopman thereupon took him through the shop and up the staircase of the house the balusters were a superb piece of workmanship and the wall all the way up was oakpanelled with carving that would have done credit to a palace from the stairs they went into the drawingroom which was a large bright room decorated with a somewhat startling though cheerful paper of a blue ground there was nothing however remarkable about the apartment and my friend wondered why he had been brought there the proprietor went up to the paper and tapped it it gave forth a wooden sound oak he explained all carved oak right up to the ceiling just the same as you saw on the staircase but great caesar man expostulated my friend you dont mean to say you have covered over carved oak with blue wallpaper yes was the reply it was expensive work had to matchboard it all over first of course but the room looks cheerful now it was awful gloomy before i cant say i altogether blame the man which is doubtless a great relief to his mind from his point of view which would be that of the average householder desiring to take life as lightly as possible and not that of the oldcuriosityshop maniac there is reason on his side carved oak is very pleasant to look at and to have a little of but it is no doubt somewhat depressing to live in for those whose fancy does not lie that way it would be like living in a church no what was sad in his case was that he who didnt care for carved oak should have his drawingroom panelled with it while people who do care for it have to pay enormous prices to get it it seems to be the rule of this world each person has what he doesnt want and other people have what he does want married men have wives and dont seem to want them and young single fellows cry out that they cant get them poor people who can hardly keep themselves have eight hearty children rich old couples with no one to leave their money to die childless then there are girls with lovers the girls that have lovers never want them they say they would rather be without them that they bother them and why dont they go and make love to miss smith and miss brown who are plain and elderly and havent got any lovers they themselves dont want lovers they never mean to marry it does not do to dwell on these things it makes one so sad there was a boy at our school we used to call him sandford and merton his real name was stivvings he was the most extraordinary lad i ever came across i believe he really liked study he used to get into awful rows for sitting up in bed and reading greek and as for french irregular verbs there was simply no keeping him away from them he was full of weird and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents and an honour to the school and he yearned to win prizes and grow up and be a clever man and had all those sorts of weakminded ideas i never knew such a strange creature yet harmless mind you as the babe unborn well that boy used to get ill about twice a week so that he couldnt go to school there never was such a boy to get ill as that sandford and merton if there was any known disease going within ten miles of him he had it and had it badly he would take bronchitis in the dogdays and have hayfever at christmas after a six weeks period of drought he would be stricken down with rheumatic fever and he would go out in a november fog and come home with a sunstroke they put him under laughinggas one year poor lad and drew all his teeth and gave him a false set because he suffered so terribly with toothache and then it turned to neuralgia and earache he was never without a cold except once for nine weeks while he had scarlet fever and he always had chilblains during the great cholera scare of our neighbourhood was singularly free from it there was only one reputed case in the whole parish that case was young stivvings he had to stop in bed when he was ill and eat chicken and custards and hothouse grapes and he would lie there and sob because they wouldnt let him do latin exercises and took his german grammar away from him and we other boys who would have sacrificed ten terms of our schoollife for the sake of being ill for a day and had no desire whatever to give our parents any excuse for being stuckup about us couldnt catch so much as a stiff neck we fooled about in draughts and it did us good and freshened us up and we took things to make us sick and they made us fat and gave us an appetite nothing we could think of seemed to make us ill until the holidays began then on the breakingup day we caught colds and whooping cough and all kinds of disorders which lasted till the term recommenced when in spite of everything we could manoeuvre to the contrary we would get suddenly well again and be better than ever such is life and we are but as grass that is cut down and put into the oven and baked to go back to the carvedoak question they must have had very fair notions of the artistic and the beautiful our greatgreatgrandfathers why all our art treasures of today are only the dugup commonplaces of three or four hundred years ago i wonder if there is real intrinsic beauty in the old soupplates beermugs and candlesnuffers that we prize so now or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that gives them their charms in our eyes the old blue that we hang about our walls as ornaments were the common everyday household utensils of a few centuries ago and the pink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses that we hand round now for all our friends to gush over and pretend they understand were the unvalued mantelornaments that the mother of the eighteenth century would have given the baby to suck when he cried will it be the same in the future will the prized treasures of today always be the cheap trifles of the day before will rows of our willow pattern dinnerplates be ranged above the chimneypieces of the great in the years and odd will the white cups with the gold rim and the beautiful gold flower inside species unknown that our sarah janes now break in sheer lightheartedness of spirit be carefully mended and stood upon a bracket and dusted only by the lady of the house that china dog that ornaments the bedroom of my furnished lodgings it is a white dog its eyes blue its nose is a delicate red with spots its head is painfully erect its expression is amiability carried to verge of imbecility i do not admire it myself considered as a work of art i may say it irritates me thoughtless friends jeer at it and even my landlady herself has no admiration for it and excuses its presence by the circumstance that her aunt gave it to her but in years time it is more than probable that that dog will be dug up from somewhere or other minus its legs and with its tail broken and will be sold for old china and put in a glass cabinet and people will pass it round and admire it they will be struck by the wonderful depth of the colour on the nose and speculate as to how beautiful the bit of the tail that is lost no doubt was we in this age do not see the beauty of that dog we are too familiar with it it is like the sunset and the stars we are not awed by their loveliness because they are common to our eyes so it is with that china dog in people will gush over it the making of such dogs will have become a lost art our descendants will wonder how we did it and say how clever we were we shall be referred to lovingly as those grand old artists that flourished in the nineteenth century and produced those china dogs the sampler that the eldest daughter did at school will be spoken of as tapestry of the victorian era and be almost priceless the blueand white mugs of the presentday roadside inn will be hunted up all cracked and chipped and sold for their weight in gold and rich people will use them for claret cups and travellers from japan will buy up all the presents from ramsgate and souvenirs of margate that may have escaped destruction and take them back to jedo as ancient english curios at this point harris threw away the sculls got up and left his seat and sat on his back and stuck his legs in the air montmorency howled and turned a somersault and the top hamper jumped up and all the things came out i was somewhat surprised but i did not lose my temper i said pleasantly enough hulloa whats that for whats that for why no on second thoughts i will not repeat what harris said i may have been to blame i admit it but nothing excuses violence of language and coarseness of expression especially in a man who has been carefully brought up as i know harris has been i was thinking of other things and forgot as any one might easily understand that i was steering and the consequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the tow path it was difficult to say for the moment which was us and which was the middlesex bank of the river but we found out after a while and separated ourselves harris however said he had done enough for a bit and proposed that i should take a turn so as we were in i got out and took the towline and ran the boat on past hampton court what a dear old wall that is that runs along by the river there i never pass it without feeling better for the sight of it such a mellow bright sweet old wall what a charming picture it would make with the lichen creeping here and the moss growing there a shy young vine peeping over the top at this spot to see what is going on upon the busy river and the sober old ivy clustering a little farther down there are fifty shades and tints and hues in every ten yards of that old wall if i could only draw and knew how to paint i could make a lovely sketch of that old wall im sure ive often thought i should like to live at hampton court it looks so peaceful and so quiet and it is such a dear old place to ramble round in the early morning before many people are about but there i dont suppose i should really care for it when it came to actual practice it would be so ghastly dull and depressing in the evening when your lamp cast uncanny shadows on the panelled walls and the echo of distant feet rang through the cold stone corridors and now drew nearer and now died away and all was deathlike silence save the beating of ones own heart we are creatures of the sun we men and women we love light and life that is why we crowd into the towns and cities and the country grows more and more deserted every year in the sunlight in the daytime when nature is alive and busy all around us we like the open hillsides and the deep woods well enough but in the night when our mother earth has gone to sleep and left us waking oh the world seems so lonesome and we get frightened like children in a silent house then we sit and sob and long for the gaslit streets and the sound of human voices and the answering throb of human life we feel so helpless and so little in the great stillness when the dark trees rustle in the nightwind there are so many ghosts about and their silent sighs make us feel so sad let us gather together in the great cities and light huge bonfires of a million gasjets and shout and sing together and feel brave harris asked me if id ever been in the maze at hampton court he said he went in once to show somebody else the way he had studied it up in a map and it was so simple that it seemed foolish hardly worth the twopence charged for admission harris said he thought that map must have been got up as a practical joke because it wasnt a bit like the real thing and only misleading it was a country cousin that harris took in he said well just go in here so that you can say youve been but its very simple its absurd to call it a maze you keep on taking the first turning to the right well just walk round for ten minutes and then go and get some lunch they met some people soon after they had got inside who said they had been there for threequarters of an hour and had had about enough of it harris told them they could follow him if they liked he was just going in and then should turn round and come out again they said it was very kind of him and fell behind and followed they picked up various other people who wanted to get it over as they went along until they had absorbed all the persons in the maze people who had given up all hopes of ever getting either in or out or of ever seeing their home and friends again plucked up courage at the sight of harris and his party and joined the procession blessing him harris said he should judge there must have been twenty people following him in all and one woman with a baby who had been there all the morning insisted on taking his arm for fear of losing him harris kept on turning to the right but it seemed a long way and his cousin said he supposed it was a very big maze oh one of the largest in europe said harris yes it must be replied the cousin because weve walked a good two miles already harris began to think it rather strange himself but he held on until at last they passed the half of a penny bun on the ground that harriss cousin swore he had noticed there seven minutes ago harris said oh impossible but the woman with the baby said not at all as she herself had taken it from the child and thrown it down there just before she met harris she also added that she wished she never had met harris and expressed an opinion that he was an impostor that made harris mad and he produced his map and explained his theory the map may be all right enough said one of the party if you know whereabouts in it we are now harris didnt know and suggested that the best thing to do would be to go back to the entrance and begin again for the beginning again part of it there was not much enthusiasm but with regard to the advisability of going back to the entrance there was complete unanimity and so they turned and trailed after harris again in the opposite direction about ten minutes more passed and then they found themselves in the centre harris thought at first of pretending that that was what he had been aiming at but the crowd looked dangerous and he decided to treat it as an accident anyhow they had got something to start from then they did know where they were and the map was once more consulted and the thing seemed simpler than ever and off they started for the third time and three minutes later they were back in the centre again after that they simply couldnt get anywhere else whatever way they turned brought them back to the middle it became so regular at length that some of the people stopped there and waited for the others to take a walk round and come back to them harris drew out his map again after a while but the sight of it only infuriated the mob and they told him to go and curl his hair with it harris said that he couldnt help feeling that to a certain extent he had become unpopular they all got crazy at last and sang out for the keeper and the man came and climbed up the ladder outside and shouted out directions to them but all their heads were by this time in such a confused whirl that they were incapable of grasping anything and so the man told them to stop where they were and he would come to them they huddled together and waited and he climbed down and came in he was a young keeper as luck would have it and new to the business and when he got in he couldnt find them and he wandered about trying to get to them and then he got lost they caught sight of him every now and then rushing about the other side of the hedge and he would see them and rush to get to them and they would wait there for about five minutes and then he would reappear again in exactly the same spot and ask them where they had been they had to wait till one of the old keepers came back from his dinner before they got out harris said he thought it was a very fine maze so far as he was a judge and we agreed that we would try to get george to go into it on our way back chapter vii the river in its sunday garb dress on the river a chance for the men absence of taste in harris georges blazer a day with the fashionplate young lady mrs thomass tomb the man who loves not graves and coffins and skulls harris mad his views on george and banks and lemonade he performs tricks it was while passing through moulsey lock that harris told me about his maze experience it took us some time to pass through as we were the only boat and it is a big lock i dont think i ever remember to have seen moulsey lock before with only one boat in it it is i suppose boulters not even excepted the busiest lock on the river i have stood and watched it sometimes when you could not see any water at all but only a brilliant tangle of bright blazers and gay caps and saucy hats and manycoloured parasols and silken rugs and cloaks and streaming ribbons and dainty whites when looking down into the lock from the quay you might fancy it was a huge box into which flowers of every hue and shade had been thrown pellmell and lay piled up in a rainbow heap that covered every corner on a fine sunday it presents this appearance nearly all day long while up the stream and down the stream lie waiting their turn outside the gates long lines of still more boats and boats are drawing near and passing away so that the sunny river from the palace up to hampton church is dotted and decked with yellow and blue and orange and white and red and pink all the inhabitants of hampton and moulsey dress themselves up in boating costume and come and mouch round the lock with their dogs and flirt and smoke and watch the boats and altogether what with the caps and jackets of the men the pretty coloured dresses of the women the excited dogs the moving boats the white sails the pleasant landscape and the sparkling water it is one of the gayest sights i know of near this dull old london town the river affords a good opportunity for dress for once in a way we men are able to show our taste in colours and i think we come out very natty if you ask me i always like a little red in my things red and black you know my hair is a sort of golden brown rather a pretty shade ive been told and a dark red matches it beautifully and then i always think a lightblue necktie goes so well with it and a pair of those russianleather shoes and a red silk handkerchief round the waist a handkerchief looks so much better than a belt harris always keeps to shades or mixtures of orange or yellow but i dont think he is at all wise in this his complexion is too dark for yellows yellows dont suit him there can be no question about it i want him to take to blue as a background with white or cream for relief but there the less taste a person has in dress the more obstinate he always seems to be it is a great pity because he will never be a success as it is while there are one or two colours in which he might not really look so bad with his hat on george has bought some new things for this trip and im rather vexed about them the blazer is loud i should not like george to know that i thought so but there really is no other word for it he brought it home and showed it to us on thursday evening we asked him what colour he called it and he said he didnt know he didnt think there was a name for the colour the man had told him it was an oriental design george put it on and asked us what we thought of it harris said that as an object to hang over a flowerbed in early spring to frighten the birds away he should respect it but that considered as an article of dress for any human being except a margate nigger it made him ill george got quite huffy but as harris said if he didnt want his opinion why did he ask for it what troubles harris and myself with regard to it is that we are afraid it will attract attention to the boat girls also dont look half bad in a boat if prettily dressed nothing is more fetching to my thinking than a tasteful boating costume but a boating costume it would be as well if all ladies would understand ought to be a costume that can be worn in a boat and not merely under a glasscase it utterly spoils an excursion if you have folk in the boat who are thinking all the time a good deal more of their dress than of the trip it was my misfortune once to go for a water picnic with two ladies of this kind we did have a lively time they were both beautifully got up all lace and silky stuff and flowers and ribbons and dainty shoes and light gloves but they were dressed for a photographic studio not for a river picnic they were the boating costumes of a french fashionplate it was ridiculous fooling about in them anywhere near real earth air and water the first thing was that they thought the boat was not clean we dusted all the seats for them and then assured them that it was but they didnt believe us one of them rubbed the cushion with the forefinger of her glove and showed the result to the other and they both sighed and sat down with the air of early christian martyrs trying to make themselves comfortable up against the stake you are liable to occasionally splash a little when sculling and it appeared that a drop of water ruined those costumes the mark never came out and a stain was left on the dress for ever i was stroke i did my best i feathered some two feet high and i paused at the end of each stroke to let the blades drip before returning them and i picked out a smooth bit of water to drop them into again each time bow said after a while that he did not feel himself a sufficiently accomplished oarsman to pull with me but that he would sit still if i would allow him and study my stroke he said it interested him but notwithstanding all this and try as i would i could not help an occasional flicker of water from going over those dresses the girls did not complain but they huddled up close together and set their lips firm and every time a drop touched them they visibly shrank and shuddered it was a noble sight to see them suffering thus in silence but it unnerved me altogether i am too sensitive i got wild and fitful in my rowing and splashed more and more the harder i tried not to i gave it up at last i said id row bow bow thought the arrangement would be better too and we changed places the ladies gave an involuntary sigh of relief when they saw me go and quite brightened up for a moment poor girls they had better have put up with me the man they had got now was a jolly lighthearted thickheaded sort of a chap with about as much sensitiveness in him as there might be in a newfoundland puppy you might look daggers at him for an hour and he would not notice it and it would not trouble him if he did he set a good rollicking dashing stroke that sent the spray playing all over the boat like a fountain and made the whole crowd sit up straight in no time when he spread more than pint of water over one of those dresses he would give a pleasant little laugh and say i beg your pardon im sure and offer them his handkerchief to wipe it off with oh its of no consequence the poor girls would murmur in reply and covertly draw rugs and coats over themselves and try and protect themselves with their lace parasols at lunch they had a very bad time of it people wanted them to sit on the grass and the grass was dusty and the treetrunks against which they were invited to lean did not appear to have been brushed for weeks so they spread their handkerchiefs on the ground and sat on those bolt upright somebody in walking about with a plate of beefsteak pie tripped up over a root and sent the pie flying none of it went over them fortunately but the accident suggested a fresh danger to them and agitated them and whenever anybody moved about after that with anything in his hand that could fall and make a mess they watched that person with growing anxiety until he sat down again now then you girls said our friend bow to them cheerily after it was all over come along youve got to wash up they didnt understand him at first when they grasped the idea they said they feared they did not know how to wash up oh ill soon show you he cried its rare fun you lie down on your i mean you lean over the bank you know and sloush the things about in the water the elder sister said that she was afraid that they hadnt got on dresses suited to the work oh theyll be all right said he lightheartedly tuck em up and he made them do it too he told them that that sort of thing was half the fun of a picnic they said it was very interesting now i come to think it over was that young man as denseheaded as we thought or was he no impossible there was such a simple childlike expression about him harris wanted to get out at hampton church to go and see mrs thomass tomb who is mrs thomas i asked how should i know replied harris shes a lady thats got a funny tomb and i want to see it i objected i dont know whether it is that i am built wrong but i never did seem to hanker after tombstones myself i know that the proper thing to do when you get to a village or town is to rush off to the churchyard and enjoy the graves but it is a recreation that i always deny myself i take no interest in creeping round dim and chilly churches behind wheezy old men and reading epitaphs not even the sight of a bit of cracked brass let into a stone affords me what i call real happiness i shock respectable sextons by the imperturbability i am able to assume before exciting inscriptions and by my lack of enthusiasm for the local family history while my illconcealed anxiety to get outside wounds their feelings one golden morning of a sunny day i leant against the low stone wall that guarded a little village church and i smoked and drank in deep calm gladness from the sweet restful scene the grey old church with its clustering ivy and its quaint carved wooden porch the white lane winding down the hill between tall rows of elms the thatchedroof cottages peeping above their trimkept hedges the silver river in the hollow the wooded hills beyond it was a lovely landscape it was idyllic poetical and it inspired me i felt good and noble i felt i didnt want to be sinful and wicked any more i would come and live here and never do any more wrong and lead a blameless beautiful life and have silver hair when i got old and all that sort of thing in that moment i forgave all my friends and relations for their wickedness and cussedness and i blessed them they did not know that i blessed them they went their abandoned way all unconscious of what i far away in that peaceful village was doing for them but i did it and i wished that i could let them know that i had done it because i wanted to make them happy i was going on thinking away all these grand tender thoughts when my reverie was broken in upon by a shrill piping voice crying out all right sur im acoming im acoming its all right sur dont you be in a hurry i looked up and saw an old baldheaded man hobbling across the churchyard towards me carrying a huge bunch of keys in his hand that shook and jingled at every step i motioned him away with silent dignity but he still advanced screeching out the while im acoming sur im acoming im a little lame i aint as spry as i used to be this way sur go away you miserable old man i said ive come as soon as i could sur he replied my missis never see you till just this minute you follow me sur go away i repeated leave me before i get over the wall and slay you he seemed surprised dont you want to see the tombs he said no i answered i dont i want to stop here leaning up against this gritty old wall go away and dont disturb me i am chock full of beautiful and noble thoughts and i want to stop like it because it feels nice and good dont you come fooling about making me mad chivying away all my better feelings with this silly tombstone nonsense of yours go away and get somebody to bury you cheap and ill pay half the expense he was bewildered for a moment he rubbed his eyes and looked hard at me i seemed human enough on the outside he couldnt make it out he said yuise a stranger in these parts you dont live here no i said i dont you wouldnt if i did well then he said you want to see the tombs graves folks been buried you know coffins you are an untruther i replied getting roused i do not want to see tombs not your tombs why should i we have graves of our own our family has why my uncle podger has a tomb in kensal green cemetery that is the pride of all that countryside and my grandfathers vault at bow is capable of accommodating eight visitors while my greataunt susan has a brick grave in finchley churchyard with a headstone with a coffee pot sort of thing in basrelief upon it and a sixinch best white stone coping all the way round that cost pounds when i want graves it is to those places that i go and revel i do not want other folks when you yourself are buried i will come and see yours that is all i can do for you he burst into tears he said that one of the tombs had a bit of stone upon the top of it that had been said by some to be probably part of the remains of the figure of a man and that another had some words carved upon it that nobody had ever been able to decipher i still remained obdurate and in brokenhearted tones he said well wont you come and see the memorial window i would not even see that so he fired his last shot he drew near and whispered hoarsely ive got a couple of skulls down in the crypt he said come and see those oh do come and see the skulls you are a young man out for a holiday and you want to enjoy yourself come and see the skulls then i turned and fled and as i sped i heard him calling to me oh come and see the skulls come back and see the skulls harris however revels in tombs and graves and epitaphs and monumental inscriptions and the thought of not seeing mrs thomass grave made him crazy he said he had looked forward to seeing mrs thomass grave from the first moment that the trip was proposed said he wouldnt have joined if it hadnt been for the idea of seeing mrs thomass tomb i reminded him of george and how we had to get the boat up to shepperton by five oclock to meet him and then he went for george why was george to fool about all day and leave us to lug this lumbering old topheavy barge up and down the river by ourselves to meet him why couldnt george come and do some work why couldnt he have got the day off and come down with us bank be blowed what good was he at the bank i never see him doing any work there continued harris whenever i go in he sits behind a bit of glass all day trying to look as if he was doing something whats the good of a man behind a bit of glass i have to work for my living why cant he work what use is he there and whats the good of their banks they take your money and then when you draw a cheque they send it back smeared all over with no effects refer to drawer whats the good of that thats the sort of trick they served me twice last week im not going to stand it much longer i shall withdraw my account if he was here we could go and see that tomb i dont believe hes at the bank at all hes larking about somewhere thats what hes doing leaving us to do all the work im going to get out and have a drink i pointed out to him that we were miles away from a pub and then he went on about the river and what was the good of the river and was everyone who came on the river to die of thirst it is always best to let harris have his head when he gets like this then he pumps himself out and is quiet afterwards i reminded him that there was concentrated lemonade in the hamper and a gallonjar of water in the nose of the boat and that the two only wanted mixing to make a cool and refreshing beverage then he flew off about lemonade and suchlike sundayschool slops as he termed them gingerbeer raspberry syrup c c he said they all produced dyspepsia and ruined body and soul alike and were the cause of half the crime in england he said he must drink something however and climbed upon the seat and leant over to get the bottle it was right at the bottom of the hamper and seemed difficult to find and he had to lean over further and further and in trying to steer at the same time from a topsyturvy point of view he pulled the wrong line and sent the boat into the bank and the shock upset him and he dived down right into the hamper and stood there on his head holding on to the sides of the boat like grim death his legs sticking up into the air he dared not move for fear of going over and had to stay there till i could get hold of his legs and haul him back and that made him madder than ever chapter viii blackmailing the proper course to pursue selfish boorishness of riverside landowner notice boards unchristianlike feelings of harris how harris sings a comic song a highclass party shameful conduct of two abandoned young men some useless information george buys a banjo we stopped under the willows by kempton park and lunched it is a pretty little spot there a pleasant grass plateau running along by the waters edge and overhung by willows we had just commenced the third course the bread and jam when a gentleman in shirtsleeves and a short pipe came along and wanted to know if we knew that we were trespassing we said we hadnt given the matter sufficient consideration as yet to enable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on that point but that if he assured us on his word as a gentleman that we were trespassing we would without further hesitation believe it he gave us the required assurance and we thanked him but he still hung about and seemed to be dissatisfied so we asked him if there was anything further that we could do for him and harris who is of a chummy disposition offered him a bit of bread and jam i fancy he must have belonged to some society sworn to abstain from bread and jam for he declined it quite gruffly as if he were vexed at being tempted with it and he added that it was his duty to turn us off harris said that if it was a duty it ought to be done and asked the man what was his idea with regard to the best means for accomplishing it harris is what you would call a wellmade man of about number one size and looks hard and bony and the man measured him up and down and said he would go and consult his master and then come back and chuck us both into the river of course we never saw him any more and of course all he really wanted was a shilling there are a certain number of riverside roughs who make quite an income during the summer by slouching about the banks and blackmailing weakminded noodles in this way they represent themselves as sent by the proprietor the proper course to pursue is to offer your name and address and leave the owner if he really has anything to do with the matter to summon you and prove what damage you have done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it but the majority of people are so intensely lazy and timid that they prefer to encourage the imposition by giving in to it rather than put an end to it by the exertion of a little firmness where it is really the owners that are to blame they ought to be shown up the selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows with every year if these men had their way they would close the river thames altogether they actually do this along the minor tributary streams and in the backwaters they drive posts into the bed of the stream and draw chains across from bank to bank and nail huge noticeboards on every tree the sight of those noticeboards rouses every evil instinct in my nature i feel i want to tear each one down and hammer it over the head of the man who put it up until i have killed him and then i would bury him and put the board up over the grave as a tombstone i mentioned these feelings of mine to harris and he said he had them worse than that he said he not only felt he wanted to kill the man who caused the board to be put up but that he should like to slaughter the whole of his family and all his friends and relations and then burn down his house this seemed to me to be going too far and i said so to harris but he answered not a bit of it serve em all jolly well right and id go and sing comic songs on the ruins i was vexed to hear harris go on in this bloodthirsty strain we never ought to allow our instincts of justice to degenerate into mere vindictiveness it was a long while before i could get harris to take a more christian view of the subject but i succeeded at last and he promised me that he would spare the friends and relations at all events and would not sing comic songs on the ruins you have never heard harris sing a comic song or you would understand the service i had rendered to mankind it is one of harriss fixed ideas that he can sing a comic song the fixed idea on the contrary among those of harriss friends who have heard him try is that he cant and never will be able to and that he ought not to be allowed to try when harris is at a party and is asked to sing he replies well i can only sing a comic song you know and he says it in a tone that implies that his singing of that however is a thing that you ought to hear once and then die oh that is nice says the hostess do sing one mr harris and harris gets up and makes for the piano with the beaming cheeriness of a generousminded man who is just about to give somebody something now silence please everybody says the hostess turning round mr harris is going to sing a comic song oh how jolly they murmur and they hurry in from the conservatory and come up from the stairs and go and fetch each other from all over the house and crowd into the drawingroom and sit round all smirking in anticipation then harris begins well you dont look for much of a voice in a comic song you dont expect correct phrasing or vocalization you dont mind if a man does find out when in the middle of a note that he is too high and comes down with a jerk you dont bother about time you dont mind a man being two bars in front of the accompaniment and easing up in the middle of a line to argue it out with the pianist and then starting the verse afresh but you do expect the words you dont expect a man to never remember more than the first three lines of the first verse and to keep on repeating these until it is time to begin the chorus you dont expect a man to break off in the middle of a line and snigger and say its very funny but hes blest if he can think of the rest of it and then try and make it up for himself and afterwards suddenly recollect it when he has got to an entirely different part of the song and break off without a word of warning to go back and let you have it then and there you dont well i will just give you an idea of harriss comic singing and then you can judge of it for yourself harris standing up in front of piano and addressing the expectant mob im afraid its a very old thing you know i expect you all know it you know but its the only thing i know its the judges song out of pinafore no i dont mean pinafore i mean you know what i mean the other thing you know you must all join in the chorus you know murmurs of delight and anxiety to join in the chorus brilliant performance of prelude to the judges song in trial by jury by nervous pianist moment arrives for harris to join in harris takes no notice of it nervous pianist commences prelude over again and harris commencing singing at the same time dashes off the first two lines of the first lords song out of pinafore nervous pianist tries to push on with prelude gives it up and tries to follow harris with accompaniment to judges song out trial by jury finds that doesnt answer and tries to recollect what he is doing and where he is feels his mind giving way and stops short harris with kindly encouragement its all right youre doing it very well indeed go on nervous pianist im afraid theres a mistake somewhere what are you singing harris promptly why the judges song out of trial by jury dont you know it some friend of harriss from the back of the room no youre not you chucklehead youre singing the admirals song from pinafore long argument between harris and harriss friend as to what harris is really singing friend finally suggests that it doesnt matter what harris is singing so long as harris gets on and sings it and harris with an evident sense of injustice rankling inside him requests pianist to begin again pianist thereupon starts prelude to the admirals song and harris seizing what he considers to be a favourable opening in the music begins harris when i was young and called to the bar general roar of laughter taken by harris as a compliment pianist thinking of his wife and family gives up the unequal contest and retires his place being taken by a strongernerved man the new pianist cheerily now then old man you start off and ill follow we wont bother about any prelude harris upon whom the explanation of matters has slowly dawned laughing by jove i beg your pardon of course ive been mixing up the two songs it was jenkins confused me you know now then singing his voice appearing to come from the cellar and suggesting the first low warnings of an approaching earthquake when i was young i served a term as officeboy to an attorneys firm aside to pianist it is too low old man well have that over again if you dont mind sings first two lines over again in a high falsetto this time great surprise on the part of the audience nervous old lady near the fire begins to cry and has to be led out harris continuing i swept the windows and i swept the door and i no no i cleaned the windows of the big front door and i polished up the floor no dash it i beg your pardon funny thing i cant think of that line and i and i oh well well get on to the chorus and chance it sings and i diddlediddlediddlediddlediddlediddlede till now i am the ruler of the queens navee now then chorus it is the last two lines repeated you know general chorus and he diddlediddlediddlediddlediddlediddledeed till now he is the ruler of the queens navee and harris never sees what an ass he is making of himself and how he is annoying a lot of people who never did him any harm he honestly imagines that he has given them a treat and says he will sing another comic song after supper speaking of comic songs and parties reminds me of a rather curious incident at which i once assisted which as it throws much light upon the inner mental working of human nature in general ought i think to be recorded in these pages we were a fashionable and highly cultured party we had on our best clothes and we talked pretty and were very happy all except two young fellows students just returned from germany commonplace young men who seemed restless and uncomfortable as if they found the proceedings slow the truth was we were too clever for them our brilliant but polished conversation and our highclass tastes were beyond them they were out of place among us they never ought to have been there at all everybody agreed upon that later on we played morceaux from the old german masters we discussed philosophy and ethics we flirted with graceful dignity we were even humorous in a highclass way somebody recited a french poem after supper and we said it was beautiful and then a lady sang a sentimental ballad in spanish and it made one or two of us weep it was so pathetic and then those two young men got up and asked us if we had ever heard herr slossenn boschen who had just arrived and was then down in the supperroom sing his great german comic song none of us had heard it that we could remember the young men said it was the funniest song that had ever been written and that if we liked they would get herr slossenn boschen whom they knew very well to sing it they said it was so funny that when herr slossenn boschen had sung it once before the german emperor he the german emperor had had to be carried off to bed they said nobody could sing it like herr slossenn boschen he was so intensely serious all through it that you might fancy he was reciting a tragedy and that of course made it all the funnier they said he never once suggested by his tone or manner that he was singing anything funny that would spoil it it was his air of seriousness almost of pathos that made it so irresistibly amusing we said we yearned to hear it that we wanted a good laugh and they went downstairs and fetched herr slossenn boschen he appeared to be quite pleased to sing it for he came up at once and sat down to the piano without another word oh it will amuse you you will laugh whispered the two young men as they passed through the room and took up an unobtrusive position behind the professors back herr slossenn boschen accompanied himself the prelude did not suggest a comic song exactly it was a weird soulful air it quite made ones flesh creep but we murmured to one another that it was the german method and prepared to enjoy it i dont understand german myself i learned it at school but forgot every word of it two years after i had left and have felt much better ever since still i did not want the people there to guess my ignorance so i hit upon what i thought to be rather a good idea i kept my eye on the two young students and followed them when they tittered i tittered when they roared i roared and i also threw in a little snigger all by myself now and then as if i had seen a bit of humour that had escaped the others i considered this particularly artful on my part i noticed as the song progressed that a good many other people seemed to have their eye fixed on the two young men as well as myself these other people also tittered when the young men tittered and roared when the young men roared and as the two young men tittered and roared and exploded with laughter pretty continuously all through the song it went exceedingly well and yet that german professor did not seem happy at first when we began to laugh the expression of his face was one of intense surprise as if laughter were the very last thing he had expected to be greeted with we thought this very funny we said his earnest manner was half the humour the slightest hint on his part that he knew how funny he was would have completely ruined it all as we continued to laugh his surprise gave way to an air of annoyance and indignation and he scowled fiercely round upon us all except upon the two young men who being behind him he could not see that sent us into convulsions we told each other that it would be the death of us this thing the words alone we said were enough to send us into fits but added to his mock seriousness oh it was too much in the last verse he surpassed himself he glowered round upon us with a look of such concentrated ferocity that but for our being forewarned as to the german method of comic singing we should have been nervous and he threw such a wailing note of agony into the weird music that if we had not known it was a funny song we might have wept he finished amid a perfect shriek of laughter we said it was the funniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives we said how strange it was that in the face of things like these there should be a popular notion that the germans hadnt any sense of humour and we asked the professor why he didnt translate the song into english so that the common people could understand it and hear what a real comic song was like then herr slossenn boschen got up and went on awful he swore at us in german which i should judge to be a singularly effective language for that purpose and he danced and shook his fists and called us all the english he knew he said he had never been so insulted in all his life it appeared that the song was not a comic song at all it was about a young girl who lived in the hartz mountains and who had given up her life to save her lovers soul and he died and met her spirit in the air and then in the last verse he jilted her spirit and went on with another spirit im not quite sure of the details but it was something very sad i know herr boschen said he had sung it once before the german emperor and he the german emperor had sobbed like a little child he herr boschen said it was generally acknowledged to be one of the most tragic and pathetic songs in the german language it was a trying situation for us very trying there seemed to be no answer we looked around for the two young men who had done this thing but they had left the house in an unostentatious manner immediately after the end of the song that was the end of that party i never saw a party break up so quietly and with so little fuss we never said goodnight even to one another we came downstairs one at a time walking softly and keeping the shady side we asked the servant for our hats and coats in whispers and opened the door for ourselves and slipped out and got round the corner quickly avoiding each other as much as possible i have never taken much interest in german songs since then we reached sunbury lock at halfpast three the river is sweetly pretty just there before you come to the gates and the backwater is charming but dont attempt to row up it i tried to do so once i was sculling and asked the fellows who were steering if they thought it could be done and they said oh yes they thought so if i pulled hard we were just under the little footbridge that crosses it between the two weirs when they said this and i bent down over the sculls and set myself up and pulled i pulled splendidly i got well into a steady rhythmical swing i put my arms and my legs and my back into it i set myself a good quick dashing stroke and worked in really grand style my two friends said it was a pleasure to watch me at the end of five minutes i thought we ought to be pretty near the weir and i looked up we were under the bridge in exactly the same spot that we were when i began and there were those two idiots injuring themselves by violent laughing i had been grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that bridge i let other people pull up backwaters against strong streams now we sculled up to walton a rather large place for a riverside town as with all riverside places only the tiniest corner of it comes down to the water so that from the boat you might fancy it was a village of some halfdozen houses all told windsor and abingdon are the only towns between london and oxford that you can really see anything of from the stream all the others hide round corners and merely peep at the river down one street my thanks to them for being so considerate and leaving the riverbanks to woods and fields and waterworks even reading though it does its best to spoil and sully and make hideous as much of the river as it can reach is goodnatured enough to keep its ugly face a good deal out of sight caesar of course had a little place at walton a camp or an entrenchment or something of that sort caesar was a regular upriver man also queen elizabeth she was there too you can never get away from that woman go where you will cromwell and bradshaw not the guide man but the king charless head man likewise sojourned here they must have been quite a pleasant little party altogether there is an iron scolds bridle in walton church they used these things in ancient days for curbing womens tongues they have given up the attempt now i suppose iron was getting scarce and nothing else would be strong enough there are also tombs of note in the church and i was afraid i should never get harris past them but he didnt seem to think of them and we went on above the bridge the river winds tremendously this makes it look picturesque but it irritates you from a towing or sculling point of view and causes argument between the man who is pulling and the man who is steering you pass oatlands park on the right bank here it is a famous old place henry viii stole it from some one or the other i forget whom now and lived in it there is a grotto in the park which you can see for a fee and which is supposed to be very wonderful but i cannot see much in it myself the late duchess of york who lived at oatlands was very fond of dogs and kept an immense number she had a special graveyard made in which to bury them when they died and there they lie about fifty of them with a tombstone over each and an epitaph inscribed thereon well i dare say they deserve it quite as much as the average christian does at corway stakes the first bend above walton bridge was fought a battle between caesar and cassivelaunus cassivelaunus had prepared the river for caesar by planting it full of stakes and had no doubt put up a noticeboard but caesar crossed in spite of this you couldnt choke caesar off that river he is the sort of man we want round the backwaters now halliford and shepperton are both pretty little spots where they touch the river but there is nothing remarkable about either of them there is a tomb in shepperton churchyard however with a poem on it and i was nervous lest harris should want to get out and fool round it i saw him fix a longing eye on the landingstage as we drew near it so i managed by an adroit movement to jerk his cap into the water and in the excitement of recovering that and his indignation at my clumsiness he forgot all about his beloved graves at weybridge the wey a pretty little stream navigable for small boats up to guildford and one which i have always been making up my mind to explore and never have the bourne and the basingstoke canal all enter the thames together the lock is just opposite the town and the first thing that we saw when we came in view of it was georges blazer on one of the lock gates closer inspection showing that george was inside it montmorency set up a furious barking i shrieked harris roared george waved his hat and yelled back the lockkeeper rushed out with a drag under the impression that somebody had fallen into the lock and appeared annoyed at finding that no one had george had rather a curious oilskincovered parcel in his hand it was round and flat at one end with a long straight handle sticking out of it whats that said harris a fryingpan no said george with a strange wild look glittering in his eyes they are all the rage this season everybody has got them up the river its a banjo i never knew you played the banjo cried harris and i in one breath not exactly replied george but its very easy they tell me and ive got the instruction book chapter ix george is introduced to work heathenish instincts of towlines ungrateful conduct of a doublesculling skiff towers and towed a use discovered for lovers strange disappearance of an elderly lady much haste less speed being towed by girls exciting sensation the missing lock or the haunted river music saved we made george work now we had got him he did not want to work of course that goes without saying he had had a hard time in the city so he explained harris who is callous in his nature and not prone to pity said ah and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change change is good for everyone out you get he could not in conscience not even georges conscience object though he did suggest that perhaps it would be better for him to stop in the boat and get tea ready while harris and i towed because getting tea was such a worrying work and harris and i looked tired the only reply we made to this however was to pass him over the towline and he took it and stepped out there is something very strange and unaccountable about a towline you roll it up with as much patience and care as you would take to fold up a new pair of trousers and five minutes afterwards when you pick it up it is one ghastly soulrevolting tangle i do not wish to be insulting but i firmly believe that if you took an average towline and stretched it out straight across the middle of a field and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds that when you looked round again you would find that it had got itself altogether in a heap in the middle of the field and had twisted itself up and tied itself into knots and lost its two ends and become all loops and it would take you a good halfhour sitting down there on the grass and swearing all the while to disentangle it again that is my opinion of towlines in general of course there may be honourable exceptions i do not say that there are not there may be towlines that are a credit to their profession conscientious respectable towlines towlines that do not imagine they are crochet work and try to knit themselves up into antimacassars the instant they are left to themselves i say there may be such towlines i sincerely hope there are but i have not met with them this towline i had taken in myself just before we had got to the lock i would not let harris touch it because he is careless i had looped it round slowly and cautiously and tied it up in the middle and folded it in two and laid it down gently at the bottom of the boat harris had lifted it up scientifically and had put it into georges hand george had taken it firmly and held it away from him and had begun to unravel it as if he were taking the swaddling clothes off a newborn infant and before he had unwound a dozen yards the thing was more like a badlymade doormat than anything else it is always the same and the same sort of thing always goes on in connection with it the man on the bank who is trying to disentangle it thinks all the fault lies with the man who rolled it up and when a man up the river thinks a thing he says it what have you been trying to do with it make a fishingnet of it youve made a nice mess you have why couldnt you wind it up properly you silly dummy he grunts from time to time as he struggles wildly with it and lays it out flat on the towpath and runs round and round it trying to find the end on the other hand the man who wound it up thinks the whole cause of the muddle rests with the man who is trying to unwind it it was all right when you took it he exclaims indignantly why dont you think what you are doing you go about things in such a slapdash style youd get a scaffolding pole entangled you would and they feel so angry with one another that they would like to hang each other with the thing ten minutes go by and the first man gives a yell and goes mad and dances on the rope and tries to pull it straight by seizing hold of the first piece that comes to his hand and hauling at it of course this only gets it into a tighter tangle than ever then the second man climbs out of the boat and comes to help him and they get in each others way and hinder one another they both get hold of the same bit of line and pull at it in opposite directions and wonder where it is caught in the end they do get it clear and then turn round and find that the boat has drifted off and is making straight for the weir this really happened once to my own knowledge it was up by boveney one rather windy morning we were pulling down stream and as we came round the bend we noticed a couple of men on the bank they were looking at each other with as bewildered and helplessly miserable expression as i have ever witnessed on any human countenance before or since and they held a long towline between them it was clear that something had happened so we eased up and asked them what was the matter why our boats gone off they replied in an indignant tone we just got out to disentangle the towline and when we looked round it was gone and they seemed hurt at what they evidently regarded as a mean and ungrateful act on the part of the boat we found the truant for them half a mile further down held by some rushes and we brought it back to them i bet they did not give that boat another chance for a week i shall never forget the picture of those two men walking up and down the bank with a towline looking for their boat one sees a good many funny incidents up the river in connection with towing one of the most common is the sight of a couple of towers walking briskly along deep in an animated discussion while the man in the boat a hundred yards behind them is vainly shrieking to them to stop and making frantic signs of distress with a scull something has gone wrong the rudder has come off or the boathook has slipped overboard or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating rapidly down stream he calls to them to stop quite gently and politely at first hi stop a minute will you he shouts cheerily ive dropped my hat overboard then hi tom dick cant you hear not quite so affably this time then hi confound you you dunderheaded idiots hi stop oh you after that he springs up and dances about and roars himself red in the face and curses everything he knows and the small boys on the bank stop and jeer at him and pitch stones at him as he is pulled along past them at the rate of four miles an hour and cant get out much of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who are towing would keep remembering that they are towing and give a pretty frequent look round to see how their man is getting on it is best to let one person tow when two are doing it they get chattering and forget and the boat itself offering as it does but little resistance is of no real service in reminding them of the fact as an example of how utterly oblivious a pair of towers can be to their work george told us later on in the evening when we were discussing the subject after supper of a very curious instance he and three other men so he said were sculling a very heavily laden boat up from maidenhead one evening and a little above cookham lock they noticed a fellow and a girl walking along the towpath both deep in an apparently interesting and absorbing conversation they were carrying a boathook between them and attached to the boathook was a towline which trailed behind them its end in the water no boat was near no boat was in sight there must have been a boat attached to that towline at some time or other that was certain but what had become of it what ghastly fate had overtaken it and those who had been left in it was buried in mystery whatever the accident may have been however it had in no way disturbed the young lady and gentleman who were towing they had the boathook and they had the line and that seemed to be all that they thought necessary to their work george was about to call out and wake them up but at that moment a bright idea flashed across him and he didnt he got the hitcher instead and reached over and drew in the end of the towline and they made a loop in it and put it over their mast and then they tidied up the sculls and went and sat down in the stern and lit their pipes and that young man and young woman towed those four hulking chaps and a heavy boat up to marlow george said he never saw so much thoughtful sadness concentrated into one glance before as when at the lock that young couple grasped the idea that for the last two miles they had been towing the wrong boat george fancied that if it had not been for the restraining influence of the sweet woman at his side the young man might have given way to violent language the maiden was the first to recover from her surprise and when she did she clasped her hands and said wildly oh henry then where is auntie did they ever recover the old lady asked harris george replied he did not know another example of the dangerous want of sympathy between tower and towed was witnessed by george and myself once up near walton it was where the towpath shelves gently down into the water and we were camping on the opposite bank noticing things in general byandby a small boat came in sight towed through the water at a tremendous pace by a powerful barge horse on which sat a very small boy scattered about the boat in dreamy and reposeful attitudes lay five fellows the man who was steering having a particularly restful appearance i should like to see him pull the wrong line murmured george as they passed and at that precise moment the man did it and the boat rushed up the bank with a noise like the ripping up of forty thousand linen sheets two men a hamper and three oars immediately left the boat on the larboard side and reclined on the bank and one and a half moments afterwards two other men disembarked from the starboard and sat down among boathooks and sails and carpetbags and bottles the last man went on twenty yards further and then got out on his head this seemed to sort of lighten the boat and it went on much easier the small boy shouting at the top of his voice and urging his steed into a gallop the fellows sat up and stared at one another it was some seconds before they realised what had happened to them but when they did they began to shout lustily for the boy to stop he however was too much occupied with the horse to hear them and we watched them flying after him until the distance hid them from view i cannot say i was sorry at their mishap indeed i only wish that all the young fools who have their boats towed in this fashion and plenty do could meet with similar misfortunes besides the risk they run themselves they become a danger and an annoyance to every other boat they pass going at the pace they do it is impossible for them to get out of anybody elses way or for anybody else to get out of theirs their line gets hitched across your mast and overturns you or it catches somebody in the boat and either throws them into the water or cuts their face open the best plan is to stand your ground and be prepared to keep them off with the buttend of a mast of all experiences in connection with towing the most exciting is being towed by girls it is a sensation that nobody ought to miss it takes three girls to tow always two hold the rope and the other one runs round and round and giggles they generally begin by getting themselves tied up they get the line round their legs and have to sit down on the path and undo each other and then they twist it round their necks and are nearly strangled they fix it straight however at last and start off at a run pulling the boat along at quite a dangerous pace at the end of a hundred yards they are naturally breathless and suddenly stop and all sit down on the grass and laugh and your boat drifts out to mid stream and turns round before you know what has happened or can get hold of a scull then they stand up and are surprised oh look they say hes gone right out into the middle they pull on pretty steadily for a bit after this and then it all at once occurs to one of them that she will pin up her frock and they ease up for the purpose and the boat runs aground you jump up and push it off and you shout to them not to stop yes whats the matter they shout back dont stop you roar dont what dont stop go on go on go back emily and see what it is they want says one and emily comes back and asks what it is what do you want she says anything happened no you reply its all right only go on you know dont stop why not why we cant steer if you keep stopping you must keep some way on the boat keep some what some way you must keep the boat moving oh all right ill tell em are we doing it all right oh yes very nicely indeed only dont stop it doesnt seem difficult at all i thought it was so hard oh no its simple enough you want to keep on steady at it thats all i see give me out my red shawl its under the cushion you find the shawl and hand it out and by this time another one has come back and thinks she will have hers too and they take marys on chance and mary does not want it so they bring it back and have a pocketcomb instead it is about twenty minutes before they get off again and at the next corner they see a cow and you have to leave the boat to chivy the cow out of their way there is never a dull moment in the boat while girls are towing it george got the line right after a while and towed us steadily on to penton hook there we discussed the important question of camping we had decided to sleep on board that night and we had either to lay up just about there or go on past staines it seemed early to think about shutting up then however with the sun still in the heavens and we settled to push straight on for runnymead three and a half miles further a quiet wooded part of the river and where there is good shelter we all wished however afterward that we had stopped at penton hook three or four miles up stream is a trifle early in the morning but it is a weary pull at the end of a long day you take no interest in the scenery during these last few miles you do not chat and laugh every halfmile you cover seems like two you can hardly believe you are only where you are and you are convinced that the map must be wrong and when you have trudged along for what seems to you at least ten miles and still the lock is not in sight you begin to seriously fear that somebody must have sneaked it and run off with it i remember being terribly upset once up the river in a figurative sense i mean i was out with a young lady cousin on my mothers side and we were pulling down to goring it was rather late and we were anxious to get in at least she was anxious to get in it was halfpast six when we reached bensons lock and dusk was drawing on and she began to get excited then she said she must be in to supper i said it was a thing i felt i wanted to be in at too and i drew out a map i had with me to see exactly how far it was i saw it was just a mile and a half to the next lock wallingford and five on from there to cleeve oh its all right i said well be through the next lock before seven and then there is only one more and i settled down and pulled steadily away we passed the bridge and soon after that i asked if she saw the lock she said no she did not see any lock and i said oh and pulled on another five minutes went by and then i asked her to look again no she said i cant see any signs of a lock you you are sure you know a lock when you do see one i asked hesitatingly not wishing to offend her the question did offend her however and she suggested that i had better look for myself so i laid down the sculls and took a view the river stretched out straight before us in the twilight for about a mile not a ghost of a lock was to be seen you dont think we have lost our way do you asked my companion i did not see how that was possible though as i suggested we might have somehow got into the weir stream and be making for the falls this idea did not comfort her in the least and she began to cry she said we should both be drowned and that it was a judgment on her for coming out with me it seemed an excessive punishment i thought but my cousin thought not and hoped it would all soon be over i tried to reassure her and to make light of the whole affair i said that the fact evidently was that i was not rowing as fast as i fancied i was but that we should soon reach the lock now and i pulled on for another mile then i began to get nervous myself i looked again at the map there was wallingford lock clearly marked a mile and a half below bensons it was a good reliable map and besides i recollected the lock myself i had been through it twice where were we what had happened to us i began to think it must be all a dream and that i was really asleep in bed and should wake up in a minute and be told it was past ten i asked my cousin if she thought it could be a dream and she replied that she was just about to ask me the same question and then we both wondered if we were both asleep and if so who was the real one that was dreaming and who was the one that was only a dream it got quite interesting i still went on pulling however and still no lock came in sight and the river grew more and more gloomy and mysterious under the gathering shadows of night and things seemed to be getting weird and uncanny i thought of hobgoblins and banshees and willothewisps and those wicked girls who sit up all night on rocks and lure people into whirl pools and things and i wished i had been a better man and knew more hymns and in the middle of these reflections i heard the blessed strains of hes got em on played badly on a concertina and knew that we were saved i do not admire the tones of a concertina as a rule but oh how beautiful the music seemed to us both then far far more beautiful than the voice of orpheus or the lute of apollo or anything of that sort could have sounded heavenly melody in our then state of mind would only have still further harrowed us a soulmoving harmony correctly performed we should have taken as a spiritwarning and have given up all hope but about the strains of hes got em on jerked spasmodically and with involuntary variations out of a wheezy accordion there was something singularly human and reassuring the sweet sounds drew nearer and soon the boat from which they were worked lay alongside us it contained a party of provincial arrys and arriets out for a moonlight sail there was not any moon but that was not their fault i never saw more attractive lovable people in all my life i hailed them and asked if they could tell me the way to wallingford lock and i explained that i had been looking for it for the last two hours wallingford lock they answered lor love you sir thats been done away with for over a year there aint no wallingford lock now sir youre close to cleeve now blow me tight if ere aint a gentleman been looking for wallingford lock bill i had never thought of that i wanted to fall upon all their necks and bless them but the stream was running too strong just there to allow of this so i had to content myself with mere coldsounding words of gratitude we thanked them over and over again and we said it was a lovely night and we wished them a pleasant trip and i think i invited them all to come and spend a week with me and my cousin said her mother would be so pleased to see them and we sang the soldiers chorus out of faust and got home in time for supper after all chapter x our first night under canvas an appeal for help contrariness of teakettles how to overcome supper how to feel virtuous wanted a comfortablyappointed welldrained desert island neighbourhood of south pacific ocean preferred funny thing that happened to georges father a restless night harris and i began to think that bell weir lock must have been done away with after the same manner george had towed us up to staines and we had taken the boat from there and it seemed that we were dragging fifty tons after us and were walking forty miles it was halfpast seven when we were through and we all got in and sculled up close to the left bank looking out for a spot to haul up in we had originally intended to go on to magna charta island a sweetly pretty part of the river where it winds through a soft green valley and to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round that tiny shore but somehow we did not feel that we yearned for the picturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day a bit of water between a coalbarge and a gasworks would have quite satisfied us for that night we did not want scenery we wanted to have our supper and go to bed however we did pull up to the point picnic point it is called and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a great elmtree to the spreading roots of which we fastened the boat then we thought we were going to have supper we had dispensed with tea so as to save time but george said no that we had better get the canvas up first before it got quite dark and while we could see what we were doing then he said all our work would be done and we could sit down to eat with an easy mind that canvas wanted more putting up than i think any of us had bargained for it looked so simple in the abstract you took five iron arches like gigantic croquet hoops and fitted them up over the boat and then stretched the canvas over them and fastened it down it would take quite ten minutes we thought that was an underestimate we took up the hoops and began to drop them into the sockets placed for them you would not imagine this to be dangerous work but looking back now the wonder to me is that any of us are alive to tell the tale they were not hoops they were demons first they would not fit into their sockets at all and we had to jump on them and kick them and hammer at them with the boathook and when they were in it turned out that they were the wrong hoops for those particular sockets and they had to come out again but they would not come out until two of us had gone and struggled with them for five minutes when they would jump up suddenly and try and throw us into the water and drown us they had hinges in the middle and when we were not looking they nipped us with these hinges in delicate parts of the body and while we were wrestling with one side of the hoop and endeavouring to persuade it to do its duty the other side would come behind us in a cowardly manner and hit us over the head we got them fixed at last and then all that was to be done was to arrange the covering over them george unrolled it and fastened one end over the nose of the boat harris stood in the middle to take it from george and roll it on to me and i kept by the stern to receive it it was a long time coming down to me george did his part all right but it was new work to harris and he bungled it how he managed it i do not know he could not explain himself but by some mysterious process or other he succeeded after ten minutes of superhuman effort in getting himself completely rolled up in it he was so firmly wrapped round and tucked in and folded over that he could not get out he of course made frantic struggles for freedom the birthright of every englishman and in doing so i learned this afterwards knocked over george and then george swearing at harris began to struggle too and got himself entangled and rolled up i knew nothing about all this at the time i did not understand the business at all myself i had been told to stand where i was and wait till the canvas came to me and montmorency and i stood there and waited both as good as gold we could see the canvas being violently jerked and tossed about pretty considerably but we supposed this was part of the method and did not interfere we also heard much smothered language coming from underneath it and we guessed that they were finding the job rather troublesome and concluded that we would wait until things had got a little simpler before we joined in we waited some time but matters seemed to get only more and more involved until at last georges head came wriggling out over the side of the boat and spoke up it said give us a hand here cant you you cuckoo standing there like a stuffed mummy when you see we are both being suffocated you dummy i never could withstand an appeal for help so i went and undid them not before it was time either for harris was nearly black in the face it took us half an hours hard labour after that before it was properly up and then we cleared the decks and got out supper we put the kettle on to boil up in the nose of the boat and went down to the stern and pretended to take no notice of it but set to work to get the other things out that is the only way to get a kettle to boil up the river if it sees that you are waiting for it and are anxious it will never even sing you have to go away and begin your meal as if you were not going to have any tea at all you must not even look round at it then you will soon hear it sputtering away mad to be made into tea it is a good plan too if you are in a great hurry to talk very loudly to each other about how you dont need any tea and are not going to have any you get near the kettle so that it can overhear you and then you shout out i dont want any tea do you george to which george shouts back oh no i dont like tea well have lemonade instead teas so indigestible upon which the kettle boils over and puts the stove out we adopted this harmless bit of trickery and the result was that by the time everything else was ready the tea was waiting then we lit the lantern and squatted down to supper we wanted that supper for fiveandthirty minutes not a sound was heard throughout the length and breadth of that boat save the clank of cutlery and crockery and the steady grinding of four sets of molars at the end of fiveandthirty minutes harris said ah and took his left leg out from under him and put his right one there instead five minutes afterwards george said ah too and threw his plate out on the bank and three minutes later than that montmorency gave the first sign of contentment he had exhibited since we had started and rolled over on his side and spread his legs out and then i said ah and bent my head back and bumped it against one of the hoops but i did not mind it i did not even swear how good one feels when one is full how satisfied with ourselves and with the world people who have tried it tell me that a clear conscience makes you very happy and contented but a full stomach does the business quite as well and is cheaper and more easily obtained one feels so forgiving and generous after a substantial and welldigested meal so nobleminded so kindlyhearted it is very strange this domination of our intellect by our digestive organs we cannot work we cannot think unless our stomach wills so it dictates to us our emotions our passions after eggs and bacon it says work after beefsteak and porter it says sleep after a cup of tea two spoonsful for each cup and dont let it stand more than three minutes it says to the brain now rise and show your strength be eloquent and deep and tender see with a clear eye into nature and into life spread your white wings of quivering thought and soar a god like spirit over the whirling world beneath you up through long lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity after hot muffins it says be dull and soulless like a beast of the field a brainless animal with listless eye unlit by any ray of fancy or of hope or fear or love or life and after brandy taken in sufficient quantity it says now come fool grin and tumble that your fellowmen may laugh drivel in folly and splutter in senseless sounds and show what a helpless ninny is poor man whose wit and will are drowned like kittens side by side in half an inch of alcohol we are but the veriest sorriest slaves of our stomach reach not after morality and righteousness my friends watch vigilantly your stomach and diet it with care and judgment then virtue and contentment will come and reign within your heart unsought by any effort of your own and you will be a good citizen a loving husband and a tender father a noble pious man before our supper harris and george and i were quarrelsome and snappy and illtempered after our supper we sat and beamed on one another and we beamed upon the dog too we loved each other we loved everybody harris in moving about trod on georges corn had this happened before supper george would have expressed wishes and desires concerning harriss fate in this world and the next that would have made a thoughtful man shudder as it was he said steady old man ware wheat and harris instead of merely observing in his most unpleasant tones that a fellow could hardly help treading on some bit of georges foot if he had to move about at all within ten yards of where george was sitting suggesting that george never ought to come into an ordinary sized boat with feet that length and advising him to hang them over the side as he would have done before supper now said oh im so sorry old chap i hope i havent hurt you and george said not at all that it was his fault and harris said no it was his it was quite pretty to hear them we lit our pipes and sat looking out on the quiet night and talked george said why could not we be always like this away from the world with its sin and temptation leading sober peaceful lives and doing good i said it was the sort of thing i had often longed for myself and we discussed the possibility of our going away we four to some handy wellfitted desert island and living there in the woods harris said that the danger about desert islands as far as he had heard was that they were so damp but george said no not if properly drained and then we got on to drains and that put george in mind of a very funny thing that happened to his father once he said his father was travelling with another fellow through wales and one night they stopped at a little inn where there were some other fellows and they joined the other fellows and spent the evening with them they had a very jolly evening and sat up late and by the time they came to go to bed they this was when georges father was a very young man were slightly jolly too they georges father and georges fathers friend were to sleep in the same room but in different beds they took the candle and went up the candle lurched up against the wall when they got into the room and went out and they had to undress and grope into bed in the dark this they did but instead of getting into separate beds as they thought they were doing they both climbed into the same one without knowing it one getting in with his head at the top and the other crawling in from the opposite side of the compass and lying with his feet on the pillow there was silence for a moment and then georges father said joe whats the matter tom replied joes voice from the other end of the bed why theres a man in my bed said georges father heres his feet on my pillow well its an extraordinary thing tom answered the other but im blest if there isnt a man in my bed too what are you going to do asked georges father well im going to chuck him out replied joe so am i said georges father valiantly there was a brief struggle followed by two heavy bumps on the floor and then a rather doleful voice said i say tom yes how have you got on well to tell you the truth my mans chucked me out sos mine i say i dont think much of this inn do you what was the name of that inn said harris the pig and whistle said george why ah no then it isnt the same replied harris what do you mean queried george why its so curious murmured harris but precisely that very same thing happened to my father once at a country inn ive often heard him tell the tale i thought it might have been the same inn we turned in at ten that night and i thought i should sleep well being tired but i didnt as a rule i undress and put my head on the pillow and then somebody bangs at the door and says it is halfpast eight but tonight everything seemed against me the novelty of it all the hardness of the boat the cramped position i was lying with my feet under one seat and my head on another the sound of the lapping water round the boat and the wind among the branches kept me restless and disturbed i did get to sleep for a few hours and then some part of the boat which seemed to have grown up in the night for it certainly was not there when we started and it had disappeared by the morning kept digging into my spine i slept through it for a while dreaming that i had swallowed a sovereign and that they were cutting a hole in my back with a gimlet so as to try and get it out i thought it very unkind of them and i told them i would owe them the money and they should have it at the end of the month but they would not hear of that and said it would be much better if they had it then because otherwise the interest would accumulate so i got quite cross with them after a bit and told them what i thought of them and then they gave the gimlet such an excruciating wrench that i woke up the boat seemed stuffy and my head ached so i thought i would step out into the cool nightair i slipped on what clothes i could find about some of my own and some of georges and harriss and crept under the canvas on to the bank it was a glorious night the moon had sunk and left the quiet earth alone with the stars it seemed as if in the silence and the hush while we her children slept they were talking with her their sister conversing of mighty mysteries in voices too vast and deep for childish human ears to catch the sound they awe us these strange stars so cold so clear we are as children whose small feet have strayed into some dimlit temple of the god they have been taught to worship but know not and standing where the echoing dome spans the long vista of the shadowy light glance up half hoping half afraid to see some awful vision hovering there and yet it seems so full of comfort and of strength the night in its great presence our small sorrows creep away ashamed the day has been so full of fret and care and our hearts have been so full of evil and of bitter thoughts and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us then night like some great loving mother gently lays her hand upon our fevered head and turns our little tearstained faces up to hers and smiles and though she does not speak we know what she would say and lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom and the pain is gone sometimes our pain is very deep and real and we stand before her very silent because there is no language for our pain only a moan nights heart is full of pity for us she cannot ease our aching she takes our hand in hers and the little world grows very small and very far away beneath us and borne on her dark wings we pass for a moment into a mightier presence than her own and in the wondrous light of that great presence all human life lies like a book before us and we know that pain and sorrow are but the angels of god only those who have worn the crown of suffering can look upon that wondrous light and they when they return may not speak of it or tell the mystery they know once upon a time through a strange country there rode some goodly knights and their path lay by a deep wood where tangled briars grew very thick and strong and tore the flesh of them that lost their way therein and the leaves of the trees that grew in the wood were very dark and thick so that no ray of light came through the branches to lighten the gloom and sadness and as they passed by that dark wood one knight of those that rode missing his comrades wandered far away and returned to them no more and they sorely grieving rode on without him mourning him as one dead now when they reached the fair castle towards which they had been journeying they stayed there many days and made merry and one night as they sat in cheerful ease around the logs that burned in the great hall and drank a loving measure there came the comrade they had lost and greeted them his clothes were ragged like a beggars and many sad wounds were on his sweet flesh but upon his face there shone a great radiance of deep joy and they questioned him asking him what had befallen him and he told them how in the dark wood he had lost his way and had wandered many days and nights till torn and bleeding he had lain him down to die then when he was nigh unto death lo through the savage gloom there came to him a stately maiden and took him by the hand and led him on through devious paths unknown to any man until upon the darkness of the wood there dawned a light such as the light of day was unto but as a little lamp unto the sun and in that wondrous light our wayworn knight saw as in a dream a vision and so glorious so fair the vision seemed that of his bleeding wounds he thought no more but stood as one entranced whose joy is deep as is the sea whereof no man can tell the depth and the vision faded and the knight kneeling upon the ground thanked the good saint who into that sad wood had strayed his steps so he had seen the vision that lay there hid and the name of the dark forest was sorrow but of the vision that the good knight saw therein we may not speak nor tell chapter xi how george once upon a time got up early in the morning george harris and montmorency do not like the look of the cold water heroism and determination on the part of j george and his shirt story with a moral harris as cook historical retrospect specially inserted for the use of schools i woke at six the next morning and found george awake too we both turned round and tried to go to sleep again but we could not had there been any particular reason why we should not have gone to sleep again but have got up and dressed then and there we should have dropped off while we were looking at our watches and have slept till ten as there was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another two hours at the very least and our getting up at that time was an utter absurdity it was only in keeping with the natural cussedness of things in general that we should both feel that lying down for five minutes more would be death to us george said that the same kind of thing only worse had happened to him some eighteen months ago when he was lodging by himself in the house of a certain mrs gippings he said his watch went wrong one evening and stopped at a quarterpast eight he did not know this at the time because for some reason or other he forgot to wind it up when he went to bed an unusual occurrence with him and hung it up over his pillow without ever looking at the thing it was in the winter when this happened very near the shortest day and a week of fog into the bargain so the fact that it was still very dark when george woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the time he reached up and hauled down his watch it was a quarterpast eight angels and ministers of grace defend us exclaimed george and here have i got to be in the city by nine why didnt somebody call me oh this is a shame and he flung the watch down and sprang out of bed and had a cold bath and washed himself and dressed himself and shaved himself in cold water because there was not time to wait for the hot and then rushed and had another look at the watch whether the shaking it had received in being thrown down on the bed had started it or how it was george could not say but certain it was that from a quarterpast eight it had begun to go and now pointed to twenty minutes to nine george snatched it up and rushed downstairs in the sittingroom all was dark and silent there was no fire no breakfast george said it was a wicked shame of mrs g and he made up his mind to tell her what he thought of her when he came home in the evening then he dashed on his greatcoat and hat and seizing his umbrella made for the front door the door was not even unbolted george anathematized mrs g for a lazy old woman and thought it was very strange that people could not get up at a decent respectable time unlocked and unbolted the door and ran out he ran hard for a quarter of a mile and at the end of that distance it began to be borne in upon him as a strange and curious thing that there were so few people about and that there were no shops open it was certainly a very dark and foggy morning but still it seemed an unusual course to stop all business on that account he had to go to business why should other people stop in bed merely because it was dark and foggy at length he reached holborn not a shutter was down not a bus was about there were three men in sight one of whom was a policeman a marketcart full of cabbages and a dilapidated looking cab george pulled out his watch and looked at it it was five minutes to nine he stood still and counted his pulse he stooped down and felt his legs then with his watch still in his hand he went up to the policeman and asked him if he knew what the time was whats the time said the man eyeing george up and down with evident suspicion why if you listen you will hear it strike george listened and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged but its only gone three said george in an injured tone when it had finished well and how many did you want it to go replied the constable why nine said george showing his watch do you know where you live said the guardian of public order severely george thought and gave the address oh thats where it is is it replied the man well you take my advice and go there quietly and take that watch of yours with you and dont lets have any more of it and george went home again musing as he walked along and let himself in at first when he got in he determined to undress and go to bed again but when he thought of the redressing and rewashing and the having of another bath he determined he would not but would sit up and go to sleep in the easychair but he could not get to sleep he never felt more wakeful in his life so he lit the lamp and got out the chessboard and played himself a game of chess but even that did not enliven him it seemed slow somehow so he gave chess up and tried to read he did not seem able to take any sort of interest in reading either so he put on his coat again and went out for a walk it was horribly lonesome and dismal and all the policemen he met regarded him with undisguised suspicion and turned their lanterns on him and followed him about and this had such an effect upon him at last that he began to feel as if he really had done something and he got to slinking down the bystreets and hiding in dark doorways when he heard the regulation flipflop approaching of course this conduct made the force only more distrustful of him than ever and they would come and rout him out and ask him what he was doing there and when he answered nothing he had merely come out for a stroll it was then four oclock in the morning they looked as though they did not believe him and two plainclothes constables came home with him to see if he really did live where he had said he did they saw him go in with his key and then they took up a position opposite and watched the house he thought he would light the fire when he got inside and make himself some breakfast just to pass away the time but he did not seem able to handle anything from a scuttleful of coals to a teaspoon without dropping it or falling over it and making such a noise that he was in mortal fear that it would wake mrs g up and that she would think it was burglars and open the window and call police and then these two detectives would rush in and handcuff him and march him off to the policecourt he was in a morbidly nervous state by this time and he pictured the trial and his trying to explain the circumstances to the jury and nobody believing him and his being sentenced to twenty years penal servitude and his mother dying of a broken heart so he gave up trying to get breakfast and wrapped himself up in his overcoat and sat in the easychair till mrs g came down at halfpast seven he said he had never got up too early since that morning it had been such a warning to him we had been sitting huddled up in our rugs while george had been telling me this true story and on his finishing it i set to work to wake up harris with a scull the third prod did it and he turned over on the other side and said he would be down in a minute and that he would have his laceup boots we soon let him know where he was however by the aid of the hitcher and he sat up suddenly sending montmorency who had been sleeping the sleep of the just right on the middle of his chest sprawling across the boat then we pulled up the canvas and all four of us poked our heads out over the offside and looked down at the water and shivered the idea overnight had been that we should get up early in the morning fling off our rugs and shawls and throwing back the canvas spring into the river with a joyous shout and revel in a long delicious swim somehow now the morning had come the notion seemed less tempting the water looked damp and chilly the wind felt cold well whos going to be first in said harris at last there was no rush for precedence george settled the matter so far as he was concerned by retiring into the boat and pulling on his socks montmorency gave vent to an involuntary howl as if merely thinking of the thing had given him the horrors and harris said it would be so difficult to get into the boat again and went back and sorted out his trousers i did not altogether like to give in though i did not relish the plunge there might be snags about or weeds i thought i meant to compromise matters by going down to the edge and just throwing the water over myself so i took a towel and crept out on the bank and wormed my way along on to the branch of a tree that dipped down into the water it was bitterly cold the wind cut like a knife i thought i would not throw the water over myself after all i would go back into the boat and dress and i turned to do so and as i turned the silly branch gave way and i and the towel went in together with a tremendous splash and i was out midstream with a gallon of thames water inside me before i knew what had happened by jove old js gone in i heard harris say as i came blowing to the surface i didnt think hed have the pluck to do it did you is it all right sung out george lovely i spluttered back you are duffers not to come in i wouldnt have missed this for worlds why wont you try it it only wants a little determination but i could not persuade them rather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning i was very cold when i got back into the boat and in my hurry to get my shirt on i accidentally jerked it into the water it made me awfully wild especially as george burst out laughing i could not see anything to laugh at and i told george so and he only laughed the more i never saw a man laugh so much i quite lost my temper with him at last and i pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was but he only roared the louder and then just as i was landing the shirt i noticed that it was not my shirt at all but georges which i had mistaken for mine whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for the first time and i began to laugh and the more i looked from georges wet shirt to george roaring with laughter the more i was amused and i laughed so much that i had to let the shirt fall back into the water again arnt you you going to get it out said george between his shrieks i could not answer him at all for a while i was laughing so but at last between my peals i managed to jerk out it isnt my shirt its yours i never saw a mans face change from lively to severe so suddenly in all my life before what he yelled springing up you silly cuckoo why cant you be more careful what youre doing why the deuce dont you go and dress on the bank youre not fit to be in a boat youre not gimme the hitcher i tried to make him see the fun of the thing but he could not george is very dense at seeing a joke sometimes harris proposed that we should have scrambled eggs for breakfast he said he would cook them it seemed from his account that he was very good at doing scrambled eggs he often did them at picnics and when out on yachts he was quite famous for them people who had once tasted his scrambled eggs so we gathered from his conversation never cared for any other food afterwards but pined away and died when they could not get them it made our mouths water to hear him talk about the things and we handed him out the stove and the fryingpan and all the eggs that had not smashed and gone over everything in the hamper and begged him to begin he had some trouble in breaking the eggs or rather not so much trouble in breaking them exactly as in getting them into the fryingpan when broken and keeping them off his trousers and preventing them from running up his sleeve but he fixed some halfadozen into the pan at last and then squatted down by the side of the stove and chivied them about with a fork it seemed harassing work so far as george and i could judge whenever he went near the pan he burned himself and then he would drop everything and dance round the stove flicking his fingers about and cursing the things indeed every time george and i looked round at him he was sure to be performing this feat we thought at first that it was a necessary part of the culinary arrangements we did not know what scrambled eggs were and we fancied that it must be some red indian or sandwich islands sort of dish that required dances and incantations for its proper cooking montmorency went and put his nose over it once and the fat spluttered up and scalded him and then he began dancing and cursing altogether it was one of the most interesting and exciting operations i have ever witnessed george and i were both quite sorry when it was over the result was not altogether the success that harris had anticipated there seemed so little to show for the business six eggs had gone into the fryingpan and all that came out was a teaspoonful of burnt and unappetizing looking mess harris said it was the fault of the fryingpan and thought it would have gone better if we had had a fishkettle and a gasstove and we decided not to attempt the dish again until we had those aids to housekeeping by us the sun had got more powerful by the time we had finished breakfast and the wind had dropped and it was as lovely a morning as one could desire little was in sight to remind us of the nineteenth century and as we looked out upon the river in the morning sunlight we could almost fancy that the centuries between us and that evertobefamous june morning of had been drawn aside and that we english yeomens sons in homespun cloth with dirk at belt were waiting there to witness the writing of that stupendous page of history the meaning whereof was to be translated to the common people some four hundred and odd years later by one oliver cromwell who had deeply studied it it is a fine summer morning sunny soft and still but through the air there runs a thrill of coming stir king john has slept at duncroft hall and all the day before the little town of staines has echoed to the clang of armed men and the clatter of great horses over its rough stones and the shouts of captains and the grim oaths and surly jests of bearded bowmen billmen pikemen and strangespeaking foreign spearmen gaycloaked companies of knights and squires have ridden in all travel stained and dusty and all the evening long the timid townsmens doors have had to be quick opened to let in rough groups of soldiers for whom there must be found both board and lodging and the best of both or woe betide the house and all within for the sword is judge and jury plaintiff and executioner in these tempestuous times and pays for what it takes by sparing those from whom it takes it if it pleases it to do so round the campfire in the marketplace gather still more of the barons troops and eat and drink deep and bellow forth roystering drinking songs and gamble and quarrel as the evening grows and deepens into night the firelight sheds quaint shadows on their piledup arms and on their uncouth forms the children of the town steal round to watch them wondering and brawny country wenches laughing draw near to bandy ale house jest and jibe with the swaggering troopers so unlike the village swains who now despised stand apart behind with vacant grins upon their broad peering faces and out from the fields around glitter the faint lights of more distant camps as here some great lords followers lie mustered and there false johns french mercenaries hover like crouching wolves without the town and so with sentinel in each dark street and twinkling watchfires on each height around the night has worn away and over this fair valley of old thame has broken the morning of the great day that is to close so big with the fate of ages yet unborn ever since grey dawn in the lower of the two islands just above where we are standing there has been great clamour and the sound of many workmen the great pavilion brought there yester eve is being raised and carpenters are busy nailing tiers of seats while prentices from london town are there with manycoloured stuffs and silks and cloth of gold and silver and now lo down upon the road that winds along the rivers bank from staines there come towards us laughing and talking together in deep guttural bass a halfascore of stalwart halbertmen barons men these and halt at a hundred yards or so above us on the other bank and lean upon their arms and wait and so from hour to hour march up along the road ever fresh groups and bands of armed men their casques and breastplates flashing back the long low lines of morning sunlight until as far as eye can reach the way seems thick with glittering steel and prancing steeds and shouting horsemen are galloping from group to group and little banners are fluttering lazily in the warm breeze and every now and then there is a deeper stir as the ranks make way on either side and some great baron on his warhorse with his guard of squires around him passes along to take his station at the head of his serfs and vassals and up the slope of coopers hill just opposite are gathered the wondering rustics and curious townsfolk who have run from staines and none are quite sure what the bustle is about but each one has a different version of the great event that they have come to see and some say that much good to all the people will come from this days work but the old men shake their heads for they have heard such tales before and all the river down to staines is dotted with small craft and boats and tiny coracles which last are growing out of favour now and are used only by the poorer folk over the rapids where in after years trim bell weir lock will stand they have been forced or dragged by their sturdy rowers and now are crowding up as near as they dare come to the great covered barges which lie in readiness to bear king john to where the fateful charter waits his signing it is noon and we and all the people have been waiting patient for many an hour and the rumour has run round that slippery john has again escaped from the barons grasp and has stolen away from duncroft hall with his mercenaries at his heels and will soon be doing other work than signing charters for his peoples liberty not so this time the grip upon him has been one of iron and he has slid and wriggled in vain far down the road a little cloud of dust has risen and draws nearer and grows larger and the pattering of many hoofs grows louder and in and out between the scattered groups of drawnup men there pushes on its way a brilliant cavalcade of gaydressed lords and knights and front and rear and either flank there ride the yeomen of the barons and in the midst king john he rides to where the barges lie in readiness and the great barons step forth from their ranks to meet him he greets them with a smile and laugh and pleasant honeyed words as though it were some feast in his honour to which he had been invited but as he rises to dismount he casts one hurried glance from his own french mercenaries drawn up in the rear to the grim ranks of the barons men that hem him in is it too late one fierce blow at the unsuspecting horseman at his side one cry to his french troops one desperate charge upon the unready lines before him and these rebellious barons might rue the day they dared to thwart his plans a bolder hand might have turned the game even at that point had it been a richard there the cup of liberty might have been dashed from englands lips and the taste of freedom held back for a hundred years but the heart of king john sinks before the stern faces of the english fighting men and the arm of king john drops back on to his rein and he dismounts and takes his seat in the foremost barge and the barons follow in with each mailed hand upon the swordhilt and the word is given to let go slowly the heavy brightdecked barges leave the shore of runningmede slowly against the swift current they work their ponderous way till with a low grumble they grate against the bank of the little island that from this day will bear the name of magna charta island and king john has stepped upon the shore and we wait in breathless silence till a great shout cleaves the air and the great cornerstone in englands temple of liberty has now we know been firmly laid chapter xii henry viii and anne boleyn disadvantages of living in same house with pair of lovers a trying time for the english nation a night search for the picturesque homeless and houseless harris prepares to die an angel comes along effect of sudden joy on harris a little supper lunch high price for mustard a fearful battle maidenhead sailing three fishers we are cursed i was sitting on the bank conjuring up this scene to myself when george remarked that when i was quite rested perhaps i would not mind helping to wash up and thus recalled from the days of the glorious past to the prosaic present with all its misery and sin i slid down into the boat and cleaned out the fryingpan with a stick of wood and a tuft of grass polishing it up finally with georges wet shirt we went over to magna charta island and had a look at the stone which stands in the cottage there and on which the great charter is said to have been signed though as to whether it really was signed there or as some say on the other bank at runningmede i decline to commit myself as far as my own personal opinion goes however i am inclined to give weight to the popular island theory certainly had i been one of the barons at the time i should have strongly urged upon my comrades the advisability of our getting such a slippery customer as king john on to the island where there was less chance of surprises and tricks there are the ruins of an old priory in the grounds of ankerwyke house which is close to picnic point and it was round about the grounds of this old priory that henry viii is said to have waited for and met anne boleyn he also used to meet her at hever castle in kent and also somewhere near st albans it must have been difficult for the people of england in those days to have found a spot where these thoughtless young folk were not spooning have you ever been in a house where there are a couple courting it is most trying you think you will go and sit in the drawingroom and you march off there as you open the door you hear a noise as if somebody had suddenly recollected something and when you get in emily is over by the window full of interest in the opposite side of the road and your friend john edward is at the other end of the room with his whole soul held in thrall by photographs of other peoples relatives oh you say pausing at the door i didnt know anybody was here oh didnt you says emily coldly in a tone which implies that she does not believe you you hang about for a bit then you say its very dark why dont you light the gas john edward says oh he hadnt noticed it and emily says that papa does not like the gas lit in the afternoon you tell them one or two items of news and give them your views and opinions on the irish question but this does not appear to interest them all they remark on any subject is oh is it did he yes and you dont say so and after ten minutes of such style of conversation you edge up to the door and slip out and are surprised to find that the door immediately closes behind you and shuts itself without your having touched it half an hour later you think you will try a pipe in the conservatory the only chair in the place is occupied by emily and john edward if the language of clothes can be relied upon has evidently been sitting on the floor they do not speak but they give you a look that says all that can be said in a civilised community and you back out promptly and shut the door behind you you are afraid to poke your nose into any room in the house now so after walking up and down the stairs for a while you go and sit in your own bedroom this becomes uninteresting however after a time and so you put on your hat and stroll out into the garden you walk down the path and as you pass the summerhouse you glance in and there are those two young idiots huddled up into one corner of it and they see you and are evidently under the idea that for some wicked purpose of your own you are following them about why dont they have a special room for this sort of thing and make people keep to it you mutter and you rush back to the hall and get your umbrella and go out it must have been much like this when that foolish boy henry viii was courting his little anne people in buckinghamshire would have come upon them unexpectedly when they were mooning round windsor and wraysbury and have exclaimed oh you here and henry would have blushed and said yes hed just come over to see a man and anne would have said oh im so glad to see you isnt it funny ive just met mr henry viii in the lane and hes going the same way i am then those people would have gone away and said to themselves oh wed better get out of here while this billing and cooing is on well go down to kent and they would go to kent and the first thing they would see in kent when they got there would be henry and anne fooling round hever castle oh drat this they would have said here lets go away i cant stand any more of it lets go to st albans nice quiet place st albans and when they reached st albans there would be that wretched couple kissing under the abbey walls then these folks would go and be pirates until the marriage was over from picnic point to old windsor lock is a delightful bit of the river a shady road dotted here and there with dainty little cottages runs by the bank up to the bells of ouseley a picturesque inn as most up river inns are and a place where a very good glass of ale may be drunk so harris says and on a matter of this kind you can take harriss word old windsor is a famous spot in its way edward the confessor had a palace here and here the great earl godwin was proved guilty by the justice of that age of having encompassed the death of the kings brother earl godwin broke a piece of bread and held it in his hand if i am guilty said the earl may this bread choke me when i eat it then he put the bread into his mouth and swallowed it and it choked him and he died after you pass old windsor the river is somewhat uninteresting and does not become itself again until you are nearing boveney george and i towed up past the home park which stretches along the right bank from albert to victoria bridge and as we were passing datchet george asked me if i remembered our first trip up the river and when we landed at datchet at ten oclock at night and wanted to go to bed i answered that i did remember it it will be some time before i forget it it was the saturday before the august bank holiday we were tired and hungry we same three and when we got to datchet we took out the hamper the two bags and the rugs and coats and such like things and started off to look for diggings we passed a very pretty little hotel with clematis and creeper over the porch but there was no honeysuckle about it and for some reason or other i had got my mind fixed on honeysuckle and i said oh dont lets go in there lets go on a bit further and see if there isnt one with honeysuckle over it so we went on till we came to another hotel that was a very nice hotel too and it had honeysuckle on it round at the side but harris did not like the look of a man who was leaning against the front door he said he didnt look a nice man at all and he wore ugly boots so we went on further we went a goodish way without coming across any more hotels and then we met a man and asked him to direct us to a few he said why you are coming away from them you must turn right round and go back and then you will come to the stag we said oh we had been there and didnt like it no honeysuckle over it well then he said theres the manor house just opposite have you tried that harris replied that we did not want to go there didnt like the looks of a man who was stopping there harris did not like the colour of his hair didnt like his boots either well i dont know what youll do im sure said our informant because they are the only two inns in the place no other inns exclaimed harris none replied the man what on earth are we to do cried harris then george spoke up he said harris and i could get an hotel built for us if we liked and have some people made to put in for his part he was going back to the stag the greatest minds never realise their ideals in any matter and harris and i sighed over the hollowness of all earthly desires and followed george we took our traps into the stag and laid them down in the hall the landlord came up and said good evening gentlemen oh good evening said george we want three beds please very sorry sir said the landlord but im afraid we cant manage it oh well never mind said george two will do two of us can sleep in one bed cant we he continued turning to harris and me harris said oh yes he thought george and i could sleep in one bed very easily very sorry sir again repeated the landlord but we really havent got a bed vacant in the whole house in fact we are putting two and even three gentlemen in one bed as it is this staggered us for a bit but harris who is an old traveller rose to the occasion and laughing cheerily said oh well we cant help it we must rough it you must give us a shakedown in the billiardroom very sorry sir three gentlemen sleeping on the billiardtable already and two in the coffeeroom cant possibly take you in to night we picked up our things and went over to the manor house it was a pretty little place i said i thought i should like it better than the other house and harris said oh yes it would be all right and we neednt look at the man with the red hair besides the poor fellow couldnt help having red hair harris spoke quite kindly and sensibly about it the people at the manor house did not wait to hear us talk the landlady met us on the doorstep with the greeting that we were the fourteenth party she had turned away within the last hour and a half as for our meek suggestions of stables billiardroom or coalcellars she laughed them all to scorn all these nooks had been snatched up long ago did she know of any place in the whole village where we could get shelter for the night well if we didnt mind roughing it she did not recommend it mind but there was a little beershop half a mile down the eton road we waited to hear no more we caught up the hamper and the bags and the coats and rugs and parcels and ran the distance seemed more like a mile than half a mile but we reached the place at last and rushed panting into the bar the people at the beershop were rude they merely laughed at us there were only three beds in the whole house and they had seven single gentlemen and two married couples sleeping there already a kindhearted bargeman however who happened to be in the taproom thought we might try the grocers next door to the stag and we went back the grocers was full an old woman we met in the shop then kindly took us along with her for a quarter of a mile to a lady friend of hers who occasionally let rooms to gentlemen this old woman walked very slowly and we were twenty minutes getting to her lady friends she enlivened the journey by describing to us as we trailed along the various pains she had in her back her lady friends rooms were let from there we were recommended to no no was full and sent us to no and was full then we went back into the high road and harris sat down on the hamper and said he would go no further he said it seemed a quiet spot and he would like to die there he requested george and me to kiss his mother for him and to tell all his relations that he forgave them and died happy at that moment an angel came by in the disguise of a small boy and i cannot think of any more effective disguise an angel could have assumed with a can of beer in one hand and in the other something at the end of a string which he let down on to every flat stone he came across and then pulled up again this producing a peculiarly unattractive sound suggestive of suffering we asked this heavenly messenger as we discovered him afterwards to be if he knew of any lonely house whose occupants were few and feeble old ladies or paralysed gentlemen preferred who could be easily frightened into giving up their beds for the night to three desperate men or if not this could he recommend us to an empty pigstye or a disused limekiln or anything of that sort he did not know of any such place at least not one handy but he said that if we liked to come with him his mother had a room to spare and could put us up for the night we fell upon his neck there in the moonlight and blessed him and it would have made a very beautiful picture if the boy himself had not been so overpowered by our emotion as to be unable to sustain himself under it and sunk to the ground letting us all down on top of him harris was so overcome with joy that he fainted and had to seize the boys beercan and half empty it before he could recover consciousness and then he started off at a run and left george and me to bring on the luggage it was a little fourroomed cottage where the boy lived and his mother good soul gave us hot bacon for supper and we ate it all five pounds and a jam tart afterwards and two pots of tea and then we went to bed there were two beds in the room one was a ft in truckle bed and george and i slept in that and kept in by tying ourselves together with a sheet and the other was the little boys bed and harris had that all to himself and we found him in the morning with two feet of bare leg sticking out at the bottom and george and i used it to hang the towels on while we bathed we were not so uppish about what sort of hotel we would have next time we went to datchet to return to our present trip nothing exciting happened and we tugged steadily on to a little below monkey island where we drew up and lunched we tackled the cold beef for lunch and then we found that we had forgotten to bring any mustard i dont think i ever in my life before or since felt i wanted mustard as badly as i felt i wanted it then i dont care for mustard as a rule and it is very seldom that i take it at all but i would have given worlds for it then i dont know how many worlds there may be in the universe but anyone who had brought me a spoonful of mustard at that precise moment could have had them all i grow reckless like that when i want a thing and cant get it harris said he would have given worlds for mustard too it would have been a good thing for anybody who had come up to that spot with a can of mustard then he would have been set up in worlds for the rest of his life but there i daresay both harris and i would have tried to back out of the bargain after we had got the mustard one makes these extravagant offers in moments of excitement but of course when one comes to think of it one sees how absurdly out of proportion they are with the value of the required article i heard a man going up a mountain in switzerland once say he would give worlds for a glass of beer and when he came to a little shanty where they kept it he kicked up a most fearful row because they charged him five francs for a bottle of bass he said it was a scandalous imposition and he wrote to the times about it it cast a gloom over the boat there being no mustard we ate our beef in silence existence seemed hollow and uninteresting we thought of the happy days of childhood and sighed we brightened up a bit however over the appletart and when george drew out a tin of pine apple from the bottom of the hamper and rolled it into the middle of the boat we felt that life was worth living after all we are very fond of pineapple all three of us we looked at the picture on the tin we thought of the juice we smiled at one another and harris got a spoon ready then we looked for the knife to open the tin with we turned out everything in the hamper we turned out the bags we pulled up the boards at the bottom of the boat we took everything out on to the bank and shook it there was no tinopener to be found then harris tried to open the tin with a pocketknife and broke the knife and cut himself badly and george tried a pair of scissors and the scissors flew up and nearly put his eye out while they were dressing their wounds i tried to make a hole in the thing with the spiky end of the hitcher and the hitcher slipped and jerked me out between the boat and the bank into two feet of muddy water and the tin rolled over uninjured and broke a teacup then we all got mad we took that tin out on the bank and harris went up into a field and got a big sharp stone and i went back into the boat and brought out the mast and george held the tin and harris held the sharp end of his stone against the top of it and i took the mast and poised it high up in the air and gathered up all my strength and brought it down it was georges straw hat that saved his life that day he keeps that hat now what is left of it and of a winters evening when the pipes are lit and the boys are telling stretchers about the dangers they have passed through george brings it down and shows it round and the stirring tale is told anew with fresh exaggerations every time harris got off with merely a flesh wound after that i took the tin off myself and hammered at it with the mast till i was worn out and sick at heart whereupon harris took it in hand we beat it out flat we beat it back square we battered it into every form known to geometry but we could not make a hole in it then george went at it and knocked it into a shape so strange so weird so unearthly in its wild hideousness that he got frightened and threw away the mast then we all three sat round it on the grass and looked at it there was one great dent across the top that had the appearance of a mocking grin and it drove us furious so that harris rushed at the thing and caught it up and flung it far into the middle of the river and as it sank we hurled our curses at it and we got into the boat and rowed away from the spot and never paused till we reached maidenhead maidenhead itself is too snobby to be pleasant it is the haunt of the river swell and his overdressed female companion it is the town of showy hotels patronised chiefly by dudes and ballet girls it is the witchs kitchen from which go forth those demons of the river steam launches the london journal duke always has his little place at maidenhead and the heroine of the threevolume novel always dines there when she goes out on the spree with somebody elses husband we went through maidenhead quickly and then eased up and took leisurely that grand reach beyond boulters and cookham locks clieveden woods still wore their dainty dress of spring and rose up from the waters edge in one long harmony of blended shades of fairy green in its unbroken loveliness this is perhaps the sweetest stretch of all the river and lingeringly we slowly drew our little boat away from its deep peace we pulled up in the backwater just below cookham and had tea and when we were through the lock it was evening a stiffish breeze had sprung up in our favour for a wonder for as a rule on the river the wind is always dead against you whatever way you go it is against you in the morning when you start for a days trip and you pull a long distance thinking how easy it will be to come back with the sail then after tea the wind veers round and you have to pull hard in its teeth all the way home when you forget to take the sail at all then the wind is consistently in your favour both ways but there this world is only a probation and man was born to trouble as the sparks fly upward this evening however they had evidently made a mistake and had put the wind round at our back instead of in our face we kept very quiet about it and got the sail up quickly before they found it out and then we spread ourselves about the boat in thoughtful attitudes and the sail bellied out and strained and grumbled at the mast and the boat flew i steered there is no more thrilling sensation i know of than sailing it comes as near to flying as man has got to yet except in dreams the wings of the rushing wind seem to be bearing you onward you know not where you are no longer the slow plodding puny thing of clay creeping tortuously upon the ground you are a part of nature your heart is throbbing against hers her glorious arms are round you raising you up against her heart your spirit is at one with hers your limbs grow light the voices of the air are singing to you the earth seems far away and little and the clouds so close above your head are brothers and you stretch your arms to them we had the river to ourselves except that far in the distance we could see a fishingpunt moored in midstream on which three fishermen sat and we skimmed over the water and passed the wooded banks and no one spoke i was steering as we drew nearer we could see that the three men fishing seemed old and solemnlooking men they sat on three chairs in the punt and watched intently their lines and the red sunset threw a mystic light upon the waters and tinged with fire the towering woods and made a golden glory of the piledup clouds it was an hour of deep enchantment of ecstatic hope and longing the little sail stood out against the purple sky the gloaming lay around us wrapping the world in rainbow shadows and behind us crept the night we seemed like knights of some old legend sailing across some mystic lake into the unknown realm of twilight unto the great land of the sunset we did not go into the realm of twilight we went slap into that punt where those three old men were fishing we did not know what had happened at first because the sail shut out the view but from the nature of the language that rose up upon the evening air we gathered that we had come into the neighbourhood of human beings and that they were vexed and discontented harris let the sail down and then we saw what had happened we had knocked those three old gentlemen off their chairs into a general heap at the bottom of the boat and they were now slowly and painfully sorting themselves out from each other and picking fish off themselves and as they worked they cursed us not with a common cursory curse but with long carefullythoughtout comprehensive curses that embraced the whole of our career and went away into the distant future and included all our relations and covered everything connected with us good substantial curses harris told them they ought to be grateful for a little excitement sitting there fishing all day and he also said that he was shocked and grieved to hear men their age give way to temper so but it did not do any good george said he would steer after that he said a mind like mine ought not to be expected to give itself away in steering boats better let a mere commonplace human being see after that boat before we jolly well all got drowned and he took the lines and brought us up to marlow and at marlow we left the boat by the bridge and went and put up for the night at the crown chapter xiii marlow bisham abbey the medmenham monks montmorency thinks he will murder an old tom cat but eventually decides that he will let it live shameful conduct of a fox terrier at the civil service stores our departure from marlow an imposing procession the steam launch useful receipts for annoying and hindering it we decline to drink the river a peaceful dog strange disappearance of harris and a pie marlow is one of the pleasantest river centres i know of it is a bustling lively little town not very picturesque on the whole it is true but there are many quaint nooks and corners to be found in it nevertheless standing arches in the shattered bridge of time over which our fancy travels back to the days when marlow manor owned saxon algar for its lord ere conquering william seized it to give to queen matilda ere it passed to the earls of warwick or to worldlywise lord paget the councillor of four successive sovereigns there is lovely country round about it too if after boating you are fond of a walk while the river itself is at its best here down to cookham past the quarry woods and the meadows is a lovely reach dear old quarry woods with your narrow climbing paths and little winding glades how scented to this hour you seem with memories of sunny summer days how haunted are your shadowy vistas with the ghosts of laughing faces how from your whispering leaves there softly fall the voices of long ago from marlow up to sonning is even fairer yet grand old bisham abbey whose stone walls have rung to the shouts of the knights templars and which at one time was the home of anne of cleves and at another of queen elizabeth is passed on the right bank just half a mile above marlow bridge bisham abbey is rich in melodramatic properties it contains a tapestry bedchamber and a secret room hid high up in the thick walls the ghost of the lady holy who beat her little boy to death still walks there at night trying to wash its ghostly hands clean in a ghostly basin warwick the kingmaker rests there careless now about such trivial things as earthly kings and earthly kingdoms and salisbury who did good service at poitiers just before you come to the abbey and right on the rivers bank is bisham church and perhaps if any tombs are worth inspecting they are the tombs and monuments in bisham church it was while floating in his boat under the bisham beeches that shelley who was then living at marlow you can see his house now in west street composed the revolt of islam by hurley weir a little higher up i have often thought that i could stay a month without having sufficient time to drink in all the beauty of the scene the village of hurley five minutes walk from the lock is as old a little spot as there is on the river dating as it does to quote the quaint phraseology of those dim days from the times of king sebert and king offa just past the weir going up is danes field where the invading danes once encamped during their march to gloucestershire and a little further still nestling by a sweet corner of the stream is what is left of medmenham abbey the famous medmenham monks or hell fire club as they were commonly called and of whom the notorious wilkes was a member were a fraternity whose motto was do as you please and that invitation still stands over the ruined doorway of the abbey many years before this bogus abbey with its congregation of irreverent jesters was founded there stood upon this same spot a monastery of a sterner kind whose monks were of a somewhat different type to the revellers that were to follow them five hundred years afterwards the cistercian monks whose abbey stood there in the thirteenth century wore no clothes but rough tunics and cowls and ate no flesh nor fish nor eggs they lay upon straw and they rose at midnight to mass they spent the day in labour reading and prayer and over all their lives there fell a silence as of death for no one spoke a grim fraternity passing grim lives in that sweet spot that god had made so bright strange that natures voices all around them the soft singing of the waters the whisperings of the river grass the music of the rushing wind should not have taught them a truer meaning of life than this they listened there through the long days in silence waiting for a voice from heaven and all day long and through the solemn night it spoke to them in myriad tones and they heard it not from medmenham to sweet hambledon lock the river is full of peaceful beauty but after it passes greenlands the rather uninteresting looking river residence of my newsagent a quiet unassuming old gentleman who may often be met with about these regions during the summer months sculling himself along in easy vigorous style or chatting genially to some old lockkeeper as he passes through until well the other side of henley it is somewhat bare and dull we got up tolerably early on the monday morning at marlow and went for a bathe before breakfast and coming back montmorency made an awful ass of himself the only subject on which montmorency and i have any serious difference of opinion is cats i like cats montmorency does not when i meet a cat i say poor pussy and stop down and tickle the side of its head and the cat sticks up its tail in a rigid castiron manner arches its back and wipes its nose up against my trousers and all is gentleness and peace when montmorency meets a cat the whole street knows about it and there is enough bad language wasted in ten seconds to last an ordinarily respectable man all his life with care i do not blame the dog contenting myself as a rule with merely clouting his head or throwing stones at him because i take it that it is his nature foxterriers are born with about four times as much original sin in them as other dogs are and it will take years and years of patient effort on the part of us christians to bring about any appreciable reformation in the rowdiness of the foxterrier nature i remember being in the lobby of the haymarket stores one day and all round about me were dogs waiting for the return of their owners who were shopping inside there were a mastiff and one or two collies and a st bernard a few retrievers and newfoundlands a boarhound a french poodle with plenty of hair round its head but mangy about the middle a bulldog a few lowther arcade sort of animals about the size of rats and a couple of yorkshire tykes there they sat patient good and thoughtful a solemn peacefulness seemed to reign in that lobby an air of calmness and resignation of gentle sadness pervaded the room then a sweet young lady entered leading a meeklooking little fox terrier and left him chained up there between the bulldog and the poodle he sat and looked about him for a minute then he cast up his eyes to the ceiling and seemed judging from his expression to be thinking of his mother then he yawned then he looked round at the other dogs all silent grave and dignified he looked at the bulldog sleeping dreamlessly on his right he looked at the poodle erect and haughty on his left then without a word of warning without the shadow of a provocation he bit that poodles near foreleg and a yelp of agony rang through the quiet shades of that lobby the result of his first experiment seemed highly satisfactory to him and he determined to go on and make things lively all round he sprang over the poodle and vigorously attacked a collie and the collie woke up and immediately commenced a fierce and noisy contest with the poodle then foxey came back to his own place and caught the bulldog by the ear and tried to throw him away and the bulldog a curiously impartial animal went for everything he could reach including the hallporter which gave that dear little terrier the opportunity to enjoy an uninterrupted fight of his own with an equally willing yorkshire tyke anyone who knows canine nature need hardly be told that by this time all the other dogs in the place were fighting as if their hearths and homes depended on the fray the big dogs fought each other indiscriminately and the little dogs fought among themselves and filled up their spare time by biting the legs of the big dogs the whole lobby was a perfect pandemonium and the din was terrific a crowd assembled outside in the haymarket and asked if it was a vestry meeting or if not who was being murdered and why men came with poles and ropes and tried to separate the dogs and the police were sent for and in the midst of the riot that sweet young lady returned and snatched up that sweet little dog of hers he had laid the tyke up for a month and had on the expression now of a newborn lamb into her arms and kissed him and asked him if he was killed and what those great nasty brutes of dogs had been doing to him and he nestled up against her and gazed up into her face with a look that seemed to say oh im so glad youve come to take me away from this disgraceful scene she said that the people at the stores had no right to allow great savage things like those other dogs to be put with respectable peoples dogs and that she had a great mind to summon somebody such is the nature of foxterriers and therefore i do not blame montmorency for his tendency to row with cats but he wished he had not given way to it that morning we were as i have said returning from a dip and halfway up the high street a cat darted out from one of the houses in front of us and began to trot across the road montmorency gave a cry of joy the cry of a stern warrior who sees his enemy given over to his hands the sort of cry cromwell might have uttered when the scots came down the hill and flew after his prey his victim was a large black tom i never saw a larger cat nor a more disreputablelooking cat it had lost half its tail one of its ears and a fairly appreciable proportion of its nose it was a long sinewy looking animal it had a calm contented air about it montmorency went for that poor cat at the rate of twenty miles an hour but the cat did not hurry up did not seem to have grasped the idea that its life was in danger it trotted quietly on until its wouldbe assassin was within a yard of it and then it turned round and sat down in the middle of the road and looked at montmorency with a gentle inquiring expression that said yes you want me montmorency does not lack pluck but there was something about the look of that cat that might have chilled the heart of the boldest dog he stopped abruptly and looked back at tom neither spoke but the conversation that one could imagine was clearly as follows the cat can i do anything for you montmorency no no thanks the cat dont you mind speaking if you really want anything you know montmorency backing down the high street oh no not at all certainly dont you trouble i i am afraid ive made a mistake i thought i knew you sorry i disturbed you the cat not at all quite a pleasure sure you dont want anything now montmorency still backing not at all thanks not at all very kind of you good morning the cat goodmorning then the cat rose and continued his trot and montmorency fitting what he calls his tail carefully into its groove came back to us and took up an unimportant position in the rear to this day if you say the word cats to montmorency he will visibly shrink and look up piteously at you as if to say please dont we did our marketing after breakfast and revictualled the boat for three days george said we ought to take vegetables that it was unhealthy not to eat vegetables he said they were easy enough to cook and that he would see to that so we got ten pounds of potatoes a bushel of peas and a few cabbages we got a beefsteak pie a couple of gooseberry tarts and a leg of mutton from the hotel and fruit and cakes and bread and butter and jam and bacon and eggs and other things we foraged round about the town for our departure from marlow i regard as one of our greatest successes it was dignified and impressive without being ostentatious we had insisted at all the shops we had been to that the things should be sent with us then and there none of your yes sir i will send them off at once the boy will be down there before you are sir and then fooling about on the landingstage and going back to the shop twice to have a row about them for us we waited while the basket was packed and took the boy with us we went to a good many shops adopting this principle at each one and the consequence was that by the time we had finished we had as fine a collection of boys with baskets following us around as heart could desire and our final march down the middle of the high street to the river must have been as imposing a spectacle as marlow had seen for many a long day the order of the procession was as follows montmorency carrying a stick two disreputablelooking curs friends of montmorencys george carrying coats and rugs and smoking a short pipe harris trying to walk with easy grace while carrying a bulgedout gladstone bag in one hand and a bottle of limejuice in the other greengrocers boy and bakers boy with baskets boots from the hotel carrying hamper confectioners boy with basket grocers boy with basket longhaired dog cheesemongers boy with basket odd man carrying a bag bosom companion of odd man with his hands in his pockets smoking a short clay fruiterers boy with basket myself carrying three hats and a pair of boots and trying to look as if i didnt know it six small boys and four stray dogs when we got down to the landingstage the boatman said let me see sir was yours a steamlaunch or a houseboat on our informing him it was a doublesculling skiff he seemed surprised we had a good deal of trouble with steam launches that morning it was just before the henley week and they were going up in large numbers some by themselves some towing houseboats i do hate steam launches i suppose every rowing man does i never see a steam launch but i feel i should like to lure it to a lonely part of the river and there in the silence and the solitude strangle it there is a blatant bumptiousness about a steam launch that has the knack of rousing every evil instinct in my nature and i yearn for the good old days when you could go about and tell people what you thought of them with a hatchet and a bow and arrows the expression on the face of the man who with his hands in his pockets stands by the stern smoking a cigar is sufficient to excuse a breach of the peace by itself and the lordly whistle for you to get out of the way would i am confident ensure a verdict of justifiable homicide from any jury of river men they used to have to whistle for us to get out of their way if i may do so without appearing boastful i think i can honestly say that our one small boat during that week caused more annoyance and delay and aggravation to the steam launches that we came across than all the other craft on the river put together steam launch coming one of us would cry out on sighting the enemy in the distance and in an instant everything was got ready to receive her i would take the lines and harris and george would sit down beside me all of us with our backs to the launch and the boat would drift out quietly into mresolutely carried out their purpose to preserve the constitutional rights of the people of the province but no war cloud darkened the skies for many years after the indian troubles were over not until was there again a call to arms heard in north carolina then trouble arose between spain and england and the colonists in america were called upon to aid their sovereign king george ii in his war against the haughty don the real cause of this war was the constant violation on the part of the english of the commercial laws which spain had made to exclude foreign nations from the trade of her american colonies but the event which precipitated matters and gave to the conflict which followed the name of the war of jenkins ear was as follows the spanish captured an english merchant vessel whose master they accused of violating the trade laws of spain in order to wring a confession from the master captain jenkins his captors hung him up to the yard arms of his ship until he was nearly dead and then let him down thinking he would confess but on his stoutly denying that he had been engaged in any nefarious dealings and since no proof could be found against him the captain of the spanish ship cut off one of the english captains ears and insolently told him to show it to his countrymen as a warning of what englishmen might expect who were caught trading with spains colonies in america captain jenkins put the ear in his pocket sailed home as fast as wind and wave would carry him and was taken straight to the house of parliament with his story such was the indignation of both lords and commons at this insult to one of their nation and so loud was the clamor for vengeance that even walpole who for years had managed to hold the english dogs of war in leash was now compelled to yield to the will of the people and parliament declared war with spain immediately upon this declaration king george called upon his trusty and well beloved subjects in carolina and the other twelve colonies to raise troops to help the mother country in her struggle with arrogant spain carolina responded nobly to the call for troops as the following extract from a letter from governor gabriel johnston to the duke of newcastle will testify i can now assure your grace that we have raised men in this province who are just going to put to sea in those northern parts of the colony adjoining to virginia we have got men each though some few deserted since they began to send them on board the transports at cape fear i have good reason to believe we could have raised more if it had been possible to negotiate the bills of exchange in this part of the continent but as that was impossible we were obliged to rest satisfied with four companies i must in justice to the assembly of the province inform your grace that they were very zealous and unanimous in promoting this service they have raised a subsidy of pounds as it is reckoned hereby on which the men have subsisted ever since august and all the transports are victualed while no mention is made of pasquotank in this war nor of men from any other county save new hanover we may reasonably infer that among the three hundred troops from the northern counties adjoining virginia men from our own county were included no record has been kept of the names of the privates who enlisted from carolina in this war nor do we know how many of those who at the kings call left home and country to fight a foreign land ever returned to their native shores but we do know that these carolina troops took part in the disastrous engagements of cartagena and bocachica and that king georges troops saw fulfilled walpoles prophecy made at the time of the rejoicing over the news that parliament had declared war with spain you are ringing the joy bells now said the great prime minister but before this war is over you will all be wringing your hands after the two crushing defeats of cartagena and bocachica the troops from the colonies who still survived embarked upon their ships to return home but while homeward bound a malignant fever broke out among the soldiers which destroyed nine out of every ten men on the ships but few of those from carolina lived to see their native home again that they bore themselves bravely on the field of battle none who know the war record of north carolina will dare deny though as regards her private soldiers in this war history is silent one of the officers from carolina captain innes of wilmington made such a record for gallantry during the two engagements mentioned that in the french and indian war in which fourteen years later not only the thirteen colonies but most of the countries of europe as well were embroiled he was made commanderinchief of all the american forces george washington himself gladly serving under this distinguished carolinian pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfs cf chapter xi pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfsfsmilli cf a soldier of the revolution the story of a pasquotank boy who followed washington it is a well known fact that the records of the services of the north carolina soldiers who took part in the revolutionary war are very meagre of the private and other officers of leaser rank this is especially true therefore it is not surprising that a search through the colonial records for a statement of the services rendered his country by john koen a brave soldier of the revolution from pasquotank county reveals only this fact that he enlisted in moores company tenth regiment on may and served for three years but in addition to the above information the following incidents in the life of john koen have been furnished the writer of this history by mrs margaret temple formerly of rosedale now a resident of elizabeth city mrs temple is a granddaughter of colonel koen the widow of william s temple a brave confederate soldier from pasquotank and the mother of two of our former townsmen hon oscar temple of denver colorado and robert temple of new orleans mrs temple was about twelve years old at the time of colonel koens death and retains a very vivid recollection of the stirring stories of the revolution told by her grandfather during the long winter evenings when the family gathered around the big fireplace in the old koen homestead near rosedale a record copied from the koen family bible states that john koen son of daniel koen and grace koen his wife was born on the th day of january and years later this record was entered john koen departed this life september th aged yrs at the age of eighteen he entered his countrys service as a volunteer and served through the revolution participating in many of the greatest victories won by the americans sharing the worst hardships of the war with his fellow patriots and laying down his arms only after cornwallis had surrendered his sword at yorktown at the beginning of the winter of north carolina was confronting the most perilous conditions which she had ever been called to face from the north east and west the foe was pressing while within her own borders the tories were rising and planning to join the british in the subjection of this rebellious state the plan formulated by the enemy was this sir henry clinton with troops of british regulars was to come down the coast to the mouth of the cape fear river where lord cornwallis who with seven regiments from england was hastening across the atlantic was to join him lord dunmore royal governor of virginia was to incite the slaves and indentured servants in the albemarle district to unite with the tories in the state and the indians in the western counties were to be induced to take up arms against the whites if these plans had matured north carolina would have been overpowered but one by one they were frustrated the battle of great bridge defeated dunmore in his purpose the snow campaign quieted the indian uprising the battle of moores creek bridge crashed the tories and the heavy winter storms delayed cornwallis and prevented him from joining clinton at the mouth of the cape fear when lord dunmore issued his proclamation offering freedom to the slaves and indentured servants who should join his majestys forces and then followed up this notice by burning and ravaging the plantations around norfolk virginia called upon her sister state for help and long and sumner from halifax and warren skinner and dauge from perquimans and pasquotank counties hastened with their minute men and volunteers to great bridge where colonel woodford in command of the virginia troops had thrown up fortifications among the volunteers who were hastening to the scene of action was john koen of pasquotank a boy in years but a man in purpose and resolution on december the british attacked the fortifications and the sound of heavy firing at great bridge the first battle in which the men of the albemarle section had been called to participate was heard by the dwellers in the counties nearest norfolk the story is still told by old residents of rosedale that john koens mother who was washing the breakfast dishes when the firing began hearing the first heavy reverberations from the cannon some thirty miles away dropped the dish she was wiping and in her motherly anxiety for the safety of her boy cried out dodge john dodge whether john dodged or not we do not know but we do know that he bore his part manfully in this his first battle and shared in the victory which drove dunmore from virginia and saved north carolina from invasion from that direction and a threatened uprising of the slaves on february the battle of moores creek bridge was fought which defeated the tories in carolina and convinced the british that further attempts at this time to conquer the state were useless so toward the end of may clintons fleet sailed from the mouth of cape fear river to charleston south carolina where his intention was to reduce that city generals charles lee and robert howe of the continental army hastened immediately to the defense of that city and among the soldiers who followed them was john koen here again the british were defeated colonel moultries palmetto fortifications proving an effective defense to the city by the sea and thompsons south carolinians and north carolinians bravely repelling the british land troops here koen fought by the side of the soldiers of north carolina and here possibly he was an eye witness of the brave deed by which sergeant jasper won undying fame the british fleet repulsed in the attempt to capture charleston sailed northward the danger of invasion that for six months threatened the south was over and we find many of the soldiers in north carolina released from duty and returning to their homes but john koens heart was filled with boyish love and admiration for the commanderinchief of the american army and his one desire now was to follow washington so shouldering his musket the hardy young soldier marched away to offer his services to the great general we do not know whether or not john koen was with washington in the battle at long island and at white plains but from his own account as related by him to his family he did have the glorious honor of sharing in the victory at trenton on december most of us are familiar with the picture of washington crossing the delaware wherein he is represented standing erect in a small boat that seems about to be dashed to pieces by the heavy waves and the cakes of ice but according to colonel koen who was with washington on that momentous night no boats were used the river was frozen over and the soldiers in order to keep their footing on the slippery ice laid their muskets down on the frozen river and walked across on them to the jersey shore at times the ice bent so beneath the tread of the men that they momentarily expected to be submerged in the dark waters but the dangerous crossing was safely made the british and hessian troops spending the holiday hours in feasting and carousing at trenton were captured and a great victory won for the american army some time in the spring of john koen must have returned to his home in pasquotank county for we find in the colonial records that in the month of may he enlisted in moores company tenth regiment from north carolina and that in june he was promoted to the rank of corporal according to the fireside tales told by colonel koen to the household in the old koen homestead this young soldier then only twenty years old was with gates army that under the valiant leadership of morgan and arnold won for the newly born nation the great victory of saratoga and the winter of that same year we find him sharing with washingtons army the trials and privations of the days of suffering at valley forge i have seen the tears trickling down my grandfathers face when he told of the sufferings of that awful winter said his granddaughter mrs temple to the writer and i used to wonder at seeing a grown man cry and often i said in my childish way that war should never bring a tear in my eyes little did i know then that the bitterest tears i should ever shed would be caused by war and for eighteen months during the terrible struggle between the north and the south i should mourn as dead my soldier husband whom god in his mercy restored to me after all hope of seeing him alive again was over although the colonial records state that koen enlisted for only three years in may he must have reenlisted in for he has left with his family a graphic description of general lincolns surrender of charleston in that year and of the horrible treatment to which the continental troops were subjected who found themselves prisoners of the victorious british army the hot climate the wretched condition of the prison ships the unwholesome and insufficient food made these days of imprisonment at charleston equal in horror to the worst days at valley forge of the prisoners who were taken captive on may only survived when they were paroled and of these our hero was one in what other battles or experiences colonel koen shared we have no record historical or traditional but according to his granddaughters account learned from his own lips he served his country until the victory of yorktown was won and peace was declared and it is easy to believe that this gallant soldier who was one of the first to volunteer at great bridge and who fought so bravely in many of the sharpest struggles of the great conflict would not have been willing to lay down his arms until his country was freed from the power that had so long held it in thrall so we can imagine him following greene in his retreat across the state taking part in the battle of guilford courthouse and possibly present when the proud cornwallis was forced to surrender at yorktown when the struggle at last had ended john koen returned to his home during the years of his absence his plantation was managed by william temple whose pretty young daughter susannah soon won the heart of the brave soldier and consented to become his bride after some years of happy married life the young wife died and a few years later we find john koen making a second marriage his bride being christian hollowell of perquimans county owing to his gallant conduct in the revolutionary war john koen a few years after the war was over was appointed colonel of the militia in pasquotank county and the government awarded him a pension which was paid until his death in pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfs cf chapter xii pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfsfsmilli cf general isaac gregory a revolutionary officer of pasquotankcamden during the war of the revolution the albemarle region though threatened with invasion time and again by the british seldom heard the tread of the enemys army or felt the shock of battle for this immunity from the destruction of life and property such as the citizens whose homes lay in the path of cornwallis and tarleton suffered this section of north carolina is largely indebted to general isaac gregory one of the bravest officers who ever drew sword in defense of his native home and country both pasquotank and camden claim this gallant officer for their son and both have a right to that claim for the two counties were one until in that year a petition was presented to the general assembly by joseph jones of pasquotank from citizens living in what is now camden county that the portion of pasquotank lying on the northeast bank of the river should be formed into a separate county and have a courthouse of its own in order to do away with the inconvenience the people of that section suffered in having to cross the river to attend court military drills and other public gatherings the general assembly passed an act providing for the erection of a new county and this county was named for charles pratt earl of camden a member of parliament and chancellor who in the stormy days of worked for the repeal of the hated stamp act and justice to the colonies before the long and bloody days of the revolution proved his worth as a soldier isaac gregory had won a prominent place in the public affairs of his county his name first occurs in the colonial records in when he was elected sheriff of pasquotank in the same year he was appointed one of the trustees of st martins chapel in indian town currituck county a settlement whose citizens were many of them to become honored in the civil and military history of our state ever since the passing of the stamp act in low mutterings of the storm that was soon to sweep over the country some ten years later had disturbed the peace of the thirteen colonies and events in north carolina showed that this colony was standing shoulder to shoulder with her american sisters in their endeavor to obtain justice from england in john harveys trumpet call to the people of north carolina to circumvent governor martins attempt to deprive them of representation in the continental congress at philadelphia had resulted in the convention at new bern the first meeting in america at which the representatives of a colony as a whole had ever gathered in direct defiance of orders from a royal governor the next year in april harvey again called a convention of the people to meet in new bern again governor martin was defied again the north carolinians taking matters into their own hands elected delegates to philadelphia and before adjourning added carolinas name to the association of colonies pasquotank was represented in this convention by edward jones joseph redding edward everigen john hearing and isaac gregory the last named being by now an acknowledged leader in his county was appointed by this body a member of the committee of safety in the edenton district the path toward separation from the mother country was now being rapidly trod by the american colonies though few as yet realized whither their steps were tending in the vanguard of this march toward liberty and independence north carolina kept a conspicuous place the edenton tea party in october had proved the mettle of her women the farmers of mecklenburg had struck the first chord in the song of independence hardly a note of which had been sounded by the other colonies governor martin had fled from new bern and in august the hillsboro convention had organized a temporary form of government and had placed at the head of public affairs cornelius harnett who as president of the provincial council had more power in the state than is generally delegated to a governor in december lord dunmores attempted invasion of the state had been thwarted largely by the aid of the minute men from albemarle then came the famous snow campaign in which the militia of the western counties joined the patriots of south carolina in defeating the tories of that state and in february the important victory at moores creek bridge had completely for a time broken the power of the loyalists in north carolina there was no longer any hope of obtaining justice from england nor after such open and steady rebellion against the kings officers civil and military could there be any hope of conciliation with the mother country save on terms too humiliating to even contemplate north carolina recognizing these facts called another convention to meet at halifax in april and there sounded her defiance as a state to king and parliament and boldly authorized her delegates to the next continental congress at philadelphia to vote for independence the convention then proceeded to make further preparations for the war which all now felt was inevitable pasquotank in response to the call immediately issued for more troops raised two regiments of militia isaac gregory who had been appointed lieutenantcolonel of the pasquotank militia by the convention of was promoted and made colonel of the second regiment of pasquotank militia the other officers being dempsey burgess lieutenantcolonel joshua campbell major and peter dauge second major independence having been declared by the continental congress of the thirteen colonies now independent states proceeded to organize a permanent government within their several borders in north carolina a state convention was called to meet at halifax in november to frame a constitution for the government of that state to this convention isaac gregory henry abbott devotion davis dempsey burgess and lemuel burgess were elected to represent pasquotank and abbott was appointed on the committee to frame the constitution by the th of december the work was completed and the constitution adopted which with amendments is still the organic law of the state after clintons unsuccessful attempt to invade north carolina in may no further effort to place the state under british control was made until but during the intervening years the carolina troops had not been idle their valor had been proved at brandywine germantown and stony point and during the winter at valley forge of her soldiers shared with their comrades from the other states the hunger cold and suffering that was the portion of washingtons army throughout those dreary months the north carolina troops had aided in the brave but unsuccessful attempt to drive the british from savannah and of her soldiers had been sent to prevent the capture of charleston but the patriot forces had been unable to repulse the invaders savannah fell then charleston and by the last of may both georgia and south carolina were in the hands of the enemy and cornwallis was threatening north carolina so great was the blow to the american cause from the loss of these southern states and so great the danger confronting north carolina that congress ordered dekalb of the continental line with the regulars from maryland and delaware to march to the rescue of the patriots in the south general gates the reputed victor at saratoga was also ordered south and put in command of the southern forces for awhile the enemy remained quiet cornwallis delaying the devastation of south carolina until the maturing crops should be safe this respite gave the carolinians time to collect their forces on the south carolina border in order to drive back the enemy isaac gregory who in may had been promoted to the office of brigadiergeneral of the edenton district on the resignation of john pugh williams was ordered to join general caswell in south carolina as soon as he could collect his men gregory marched towards the piedmont section on his way to caswells army and by june he was with rutherfords brigade at yadkins ford in rowan near this place the tories had collected some strong and rutherford hoped with gregorys aid to crush them but to his disappointment no opportunity was given for general bryan the tory leader hearing of the defeat of the loyalists at ramseurs mill a few days before crossed the yadkin and united with general macarthur whom cornwallis had sent to anson county by july gregorys men with rutherford and his brigade were with general caswell at the cheraws just across the south carolina border for several weeks there was much suffering among the men on account of the lack of food for though corn was plentiful the rivers were so high that the mills could not grind the meal lord rawdons army was stationed near camden south carolina and gates who had joined caswell on august having learned that the british general was daily expecting a supply of food and stores for his men determined to intercept the convoy and capture the supplies for his own army in the meantime cornwallis unknown to gates had joined lord rawdon gates ignorant of this reinforcement of cornwallis troops marched leisurely towards camden to capture the coveted stores the result of the battle that followed is known only too well the american militia panicstricken at the furious onslaught of the enemy threw down their arms and fled general gates after a vain attempt to rally his troops lost courage and abandoning his forces and his stores brought everlasting disgrace upon his name by fleeing in hot haste from the field but the cowardly conduct of gates and several of the other officers of the american army as well as many of the militia in this disastrous battle was offset by the heroism and courage of others and among those who won undying fame on that fatal field none is more worthy of praise than general gregory roger lamb a british officer writing an account of the battle and speaking of the disgraceful conduct of those officers and men whose flight from the field brought shame upon the american army gives this account of isaac gregorys heroic struggle to withstand the enemy at this bloody field in justice to north carolina it should be remarked that general gregorys brigade acquitted themselves well they formed on the left of the continentals and kept the field while they had a cartridge left gregory himself was twice wounded by bayonets in bringing off his men and many in his brigade had only bayonet wounds as to fight hand to hand with bayonets requires far more courage than to stand at a distance and fire a musket this account of gregory and his troops proves the bravery with which they fought during those terrible hours general gregorys horse was shot from under him while the battle was raging and seeing him fall so sure was the enemy of his death that cornwallis in his official report of the battle gave in his name in the list of the american officers killed on the field two days after the battle of camden the patriots shelby clarke and williams defeated a band of tories at musgroves mill in south carolina but hearing of the disaster at camden these officers now withdrew from the state sumters corps near rocky mount had been put to flight by tarleton gates had fled the state and only davies men were left between the army of cornwallis and charlotte north carolina had the british general pressed on into the state north carolina must have inevitably fallen into the hands of the enemy but cornwallis delayed the invasion for nearly a month thus giving the carolinians time to collect their forces to repel his attempt the general assembly which met in september acting upon governor nashs advice created a board of war to assist him in conducting the military affairs of the state this board now proceeded to put general smallwood of maryland in command of all the forces in the state giving him authority over all the officers in the southern army the honor being conferred upon him on account of his gallant conduct at camden general gregory was consequently ordered to hold himself in readiness to obey general smallwoods orders with the other officers in north carolina the board of war then proceeded to raise money arms and men for the army that would soon be called upon to drive cornwallis from the state gregorys brigade received of the funds raised and flints and guns were distributed among his soldiers the british now confidently expected that cornwallis would quickly subdue north carolina then sweep over the state into virginia in order to prevent the americans from hurrying into that state to join forces against cornwallis general leslie was ordered from new york to the chesapeake and in october his army was stationed near south quays in virginia not far from norfolk the presence of leslies army so close to the carolina border caused much alarm for the safety of the albemarle section which for the second time was in danger of invasion general gregory who after the battle of camden had joined exum and jarvis in front of cornwallis had recently returned to albemarle he was now ordered to take the field against leslie and to prevent him from entering the state from his camp at great swamp near north river he wrote to governor nash in november reporting the repulse of the enemy he also warned the governor that the british were planning to attack edenton and he set forth in his letter the blow that the capture of this town would be to the commerce of the state general gregorys post at great swamp was no sinecure he had only about men to withstand leslie whose forces at portsmouth amounted to nearly men his troops were poorly equipped half naked and illfed and his situation seemed almost desperate to add to his troubles an attempt was made at this time by colonel blount of the edenton district to deprive him of his command but a council of state held at camp norfleet mills to inquire into the matter declared that as colonel blount had resigned of his own free will and accord in favor of gregory he should not now take the command from him in spite of the troubles and perplexities that beset gregory in the fall of he bravely held his ground and by the end of november he wrote governor nash from his camp at north west that the british had abandoned portsmouth and had departed for parts unknown while these events were taking place in the east cornwallis whose left wing under ferguson had suffered a crushing defeat at kings mountain disappointed at the humbling of the tories at that battle had left north carolina on october th and returned to south carolina the heavy rains encountered by his army on his retreat caused much sickness among his men and himself falling ill he was obliged to give up his command temporarily to lord rawdon general leslies destination soon became known on november he had abandoned the vicinity of norfolk and had sailed to wilmington nc hoping to rouse the tories in that section but lord rawdons army being now in great danger leslie was ordered to his assistance and he accordingly set out for the british army near camden but southern virginia and the albemarle region were not long to be free from the fear of invasion for soon another british army under the command of the traitor benedict arnold sailed into chesapeake bay and gregory was again sent to keep the enemy in check during this campaign a serious charge was brought against gregory which though soon proved to be wholly unfounded caused the gallant officer lifelong mortification and distress the circumstances of this unfortunate occurrence were as follows captain stevens a british officer in arnolds corps while sitting idly by his fire one night just for a joke as he afterwards explained wrote two notes to general gregory which he intended to destroy as they were simply the product of his own imagination and were never intended to go out of his hands in some unknown way these papers came into the hands of an american officer who deeming from their contents that gregory was a traitor carried them to headquarters their purport being made public even gregorys most loyal friends began to look upon him with suspicion and distrust the first of these two notes was as follows general gregory your wellformed plans of delivering into the hands of the british these people now in your command gives me much pleasure your next i hope will mention place of ambuscade and manner you wish to fall into my hands the second note was equally incriminating general gregory a mr ventriss was last night made prisoner by three or four of your people i only wish to inform you that ventriss could not help doing what he did in helping to destroy the logs i myself delivered him the order from colonel simcox great was the excitement and consternation in gregorys brigade and indeed throughout the american army when these notes were read arnolds treason early in was still fresh in the minds of all and it was natural that the accusation now brought against general gregory should find ready and widespread credence gregory was arrested and courtmartialed by his own men but his innocence was soon established for as soon as colonel stevens heard of the disgrace he had unintentionally brought upon an innocent man he hastened to make amends for his thoughtless act by a full explanation of his part in the affair colonel parker a british officer and a friend of stevens had been informed of the writing of the notes and he now joined stevens in furnishing testimony at the trial that fully exonerated the brave general from the hateful charge but though friends and brother officers now crowded around him with sincere and cordial congratulations upon the happy termination of the affair and with heartfelt expressions of regret at the unfortunate occurrence the brave and gallant officer crushed and almost heartbroken at the readiness with which his men and many of his fellow officers had accepted what seemed proofs of his guilt never recovered from the hurt caused by the cruel charge for though he nobly put aside his just resentment and remained at his post of duty guarding the albemarle counties from danger of invasion until the withdrawal of the british troops from southeastern virginia removed the danger his life was ever afterwards shadowed by the mortification he had been called upon to undergo in february the enemys army in virginia became such a source of terror to the people of that section that general allen jones was ordered to reinforce gregory with troops from the halifax district but later that same month a greater danger confronted the patriot army in the south and this order was countermanded most of the forces in the states were now hurried to the aid of general greene who had superseded gates after the battle of camden and was leading cornwallis an eventful chase across the piedmont section of north carolina cornwallis after having been reinforced by general leslie had planned to invade north carolina conquer that state march through virginia and join clinton in a fierce onslaught against washingtons army in the north to foil the plans of the british officers greene was concentrating the patriot troops in the south in the catawba valley and gregory was left with only a handful of men to hold the enemy at norfolk in check in june general gregorys situation was so desperate that the assembly again ordered general allan jones to send men from halifax district to north west bridge to reinforce gregory and the latter officer was authorized to draft as many men as possible from the edenton district general jones informed the assembly that he would send the troops as soon as possible but that gregory would have to provide arms as he had no means of furnishing equipments for them several engagements took place in june between the british and americans in the dismal swamp region and in one of them gregory was repulsed and driven from his position but in july he wrote to colonel blount reporting that his losses were trifling and that he had regained his old post from the enemy in august a letter from general gregory conveyed the joyful tidings that the enemy had evacuated portsmouth as his troops were no longer needed to guard against the danger of invasion from that direction and as smallpox had broken out in his camp general gregory now released his men from duty and they returned to their homes the british army that had just left portsmouth was now on its way to yorktown whither cornwallis after his fruitless chase of greene his disastrous victory at guilford courthouse and his retreat to wilmington was now directing his army there on the th of october the famous battle of yorktown was fought and cornwallis and his entire army forced to surrender this battle virtually ended the war but peace did not come to carolina immediately upon the surrender the tories in the state kept up a constant warfare upon their whig neighbors and in march general greene who not long after the battle of guilford courthouse had won a decisive victory at eutaw springs and was still in south carolina sent the alarming intelligence to the towns on the coast that the british had sent four vessels from charleston harbor to plunder and burn new bern and edenton to meet this unexpected emergency general rutherford was ordered to quell the tories in the cape fear section who were terrorizing the people in that region and in april general gregory received orders from general burke to take men to edenton for the defense of that town and to notify count de rochambeau as soon as the enemy should appear in albemarle sound in august no sign of the british ships had as yet been seen though the coast towns were still in daily dread of their arrival governor martin who had succeeded burke wrote gregory to purchase whatever number of vessels the edenton merchants considered necessary for the protection of the town to buy cannon and to draft men to man the boats but edenton was spared the horror of a second raid such as she had suffered in in december the british army in south carolina which since the battle of eutaw springs had been hemmed in at charleston by general greene finally embarked for england the ships that had been keeping the towns near the coast in north carolina in terror departed with them and the states that had for so many long and bitter years been engaged in the terrific struggle with england were left to enjoy the fruits of their splendid victory without further molestation from the enemy in september the treaty of peace was signed by great britain and the united states separately and individually were declared to be free sovereign and independent states general gregorys services to his state did not end with the war eight times from to we find him representing camden county in the state senate serving on important committees and lending the weight of his influence to every movement tending toward the prosperity and welfare of the state in the local affairs of his neighborhood he also took a prominent part in the currituck seminary was established at indian town and isaac gregory and his friend and brother officer colonel peter dauge were appointed on the board of trustees of this school which for many years was one of the leading educational institutions of the albemarle section general gregory lived at the ferebee place in camden county in a large brick house known then as now as fairfax hall the old building is still standing a well known landmark in the county a letter from james iredell to his wife written while this famous north carolina judge was a guest at fairfax gives a pleasant account of an evening spent in general gregorys home with parson pettigrew and gideon lamb and also of the kindness and hospitality of the camden people in volume of the iredell letters this description of general gregorys personal appearance is given a lady who remembers general gregory well says that he was a large fine looking man he was exceedingly polite had a very grand air and in dress was something of a fop in the same volume the following interesting account of an incident in the life of the famous general is found general gregory lived in his latter years so secluded a life and knew so little of events beyond his own family circle that he addressed to a lady the widow of governor stone a letter making a formal proposal of marriage full six months after her death general isaac gregory was the son of general william gregory an officer who took a prominent part in the french and indian wars he married miss elizabeth whedbee and had two children sarah and matilda sarah married dempsey burgess of camden and matilda married a young german john christopher ehringhaus many of the descendants of this brave revolutionary officer are living in the albemarle region today and claim with pride this ancestor who as captain ashe in his history of north carolina says was one of the few who won honor at camden and whose good fame was never tarnished by a single unworthy action illustration fairfax camden county the home of general gregory the sir walter raleigh chapter of the

its hidden source in the southern fringe of the farfamed dismal swamp the perquimans river lovely as its indian name which being interpreted signifies the land of beautiful women comes winding down past marshes green with flags and rushes and starred with flowers of every hue through forests dense with pine and cypress with gum and juniper the amber waters of the ancient stream pursue their tranquil way lazily but steadily and untiringly the river journeys on in obedience to the eternal insistent call of the sea till its waves meeting and mingling with those of the great sound and its numerous tributaries finally find their way through the sand bars that bound our coast to the stormy atlantic save for the fields of corn and cotton that lie along its banks and an occasional sawmill whose whirring wheels break at long intervals the silence of its wooded shores the peaceful river through the greater part of its way is undisturbed by signs of mans presence only twice in its course do its banks resound to the hum of town and village life once when shortly emerging from the great swamp the river in its winding flows by the sleepy little quaker village of belvidere and again when its tranquility is suddenly broken by the stir and bustle of mill and factory upon whose existence depends the prosperity of the old colonial town of hertford there the river suddenly as wide awake as the beautiful town by which it flows changes its narrow tortuous leisurely course and broadening out from a slender stream sweeps on to the sea a river grown whose shores from this point on lie apart from each other a distance of more than a mile of all the streams that flow down to the sea from albemarle none exceeds in beauty or historic interest the lovely perquimans river on its eastern banks lies durants neck the home of george durant the first settler in our state who in left his virginia home and came into albemarle and being well pleased with the beauty and fertility of fair wikacome was content to abide thenceforth in that favored spot on the banks of the streams flowing on either side of wikacome roamed an indian tribe the yeopims whose great chief kilcokonen gave to george durant the first deed for land ever recorded in our state durant his friend and comrade samuel pricklove and their families and servants proved to be the vanguard of a long procession of settlers who following the footsteps of these first pioneers made their homes upon the shores of the albemarle streams soon the dense forests that stretched down to the river brinks fell beneath the axe of these homeseekers and small farms and great plantations fringed the borders of the streams at the narrows of the perquimans where the waters widen into a broad majestic river a sturdy pioneer henry phillips or phelps had built his home thither in the spring of came a missionary william edmundson a friend and follower of george fox who some years before had over in england founded the society of friends henry phelps was a member of this society also and the meeting between the two godly men was a joyful one during the ten years that had passed since the indian chief had signed his first grant of land to the white man the settlers of albemarle had had no opportunity of assembling together for public worship phelps knowing how gladly the call would be answered at the bidding of edmundson summoned such of his friends and neighbors as he could reach to his home to hear the word preached by this zealous man of god not since the days of little virginia dare had a body of christian men and women met together in carolina to offer in public worship their prayer and praises to the loving father who had led them safely over stormtossed waters through tangled wilderness into this land of promise rough and uncultured as most of the congregation were they listened quietly and reverently to the good missionary and received the word with gladness there were present at the meeting one tems and his wife who earnestly entreated edmundson to hold another service at their home three miles away so the next day he journeyed to the home of tems and there another blessed meeting was held and there was founded a society whose members were to be for many years the most prominent religious body in the state in the fall of the hearts of the members of this infant church were gladdened by the tidings that george fox himself was on his way to visit the little band of brethren in the wilds of carolina one cool crisp october morning the great preacher arrived again was the home of phelps chosen for the meeting but so great was the crowd that gathered to hear him that the house would not hold the congregation standing a little distance from phelps simple dwelling were two great cypress trees close down by the waters edge they grew their feathery branches shading the rippling waves and shielding the listeners from the glare of a sun whose rays had not yet lost their summers heat under one of these trees the preacher stood and spoke to the assembled crowd as the spirit gave him utterance it was a tender meeting as fox reports in his letters describing his stay in perquimans many who were present became converts to the faith of fox and edmundson and perquimans county and her sister pasquotank became for many years the stronghold of the society of friends in carolina for a number of years after george foxs visit to perquimans the quakers were the only religious body in the colony that regularly assembled its members together for divine service their ministers were for the most part from the congregation itself no salary was demanded by them and the home of some friends was the scene of their religious meetings in a new country where ready money is a scarce commodity a church that could be conducted without any expenditure of cash could more easily take root than one whose existence depended upon a certain amount however small of filthy lucre the lords proprietors members for the most part of the church of england were too intent upon extracting wealth from their colony in carolina to be willing to expend any of their gains for the good of the colonists disregarding the petitions of their officers in albemarle who saw the great need for missionaries in the struggling settlements they refused to become responsible for the salary of a minister but after a while the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts took hold of the matter and in a church was built in chowan near where edenton now stands by rev mr gordon who was one of the two ministers sent out by the spg writes to the secretary of the society from perquimans in perquimans there is a compact little church built with care and express and better than that in chowan it continues yet unfinished by reason of the death of major swann who fostered the building of this church among the vestrymen of this new parish may be found the following names francis forbes colonel maurice moore captain hecklefield thomas hardy captain richard saunderson henry clayton joseph jessups samuel phelps and richard whedbee most of these gentlemen were men of note in the colony and many of their descendants are now living in perquimans county that the wealthy planters in albemarle felt a certain responsibility for the spiritual welfare of their slaves was shown by the fact that master and slave alike gathered together to join in the services held by the early missionaries of the church of england and that the master willingly allowed his servant to share in the blessings of the sacraments of the church a letter from rev mr taylor written from perquimans in records that he had just baptized a young woman slave of mr duckinfield to whom i have taught the whole of the church catechism but the letter further reveals that our early colonists cherished their worldly possessions fully as fondly as their descendants who pursue with avidity the chase after the dollar and when it came to the question of the slaves spiritual welfare or the masters temporal prosperity the master did not hesitate to show which he considered of the most importance for as mr taylor writes when it was rumored in that the general assembly of that year had decreed that all baptized slaves should be set free and when immediately and by a strange coincidence the reverend gentleman was suddenly besieged by bands of men and women all loudly clamoring to receive the rite of holy baptism duckinfield and others of the planters prudently restrained the poor darkies from entering the churchs folds until that law could be repealed in secular as well as religious affairs perquimans precinct in those early days took an active part men of political and social prominence resided within her borders and at their homes for lack of other shelter for public gatherings much of the business of the colony legislative and judicial was transacted as early as the population of albemarle had grown so numerous that the settlers found themselves strong enough to successfully resist the oppressive rule of the unworthy governors set over them by the lords proprietors and in that year led by john culpeper and george durant a revolt against the tyrannical miller which began in pasquotank spread through the surrounding precincts among the men from perquimans who took part in this disturbance known in history as culpepers rebellion were george durant alexander lillington samuel pricklove jenkins sherrell and greene so successfully did they and their comrades strive against millers tyranny that that worthy was driven out of carolina and the reins of government fell into the hands of culpeper and durant and at the home of the latter on durants neck a fair and equitable peoples government was organized the first of the kind framed in america alexander lillington who lent the weight of his wealth and influence to the people in their struggle against miller was a rich planter who in bought a tract of land from stephen pane and john foster on yeopim creek and soon became one of the leading men in the colony his descendants moved to new hanover and a namesake of his in later years won for himself undying fame at the battle of moores creek bridge at the homes of captain john hecklefield and captain richard saunderson the general assembly and the governors council often convened the famous glovercary controversy was temporarily settled at the home of the former by the assembly of while captain saundersons dwelling sheltered the assembly of whose important acts were for the first time formally recorded and published the courts were frequently held at the home of dinah maclenden and james thickpenny james oates captain james cole and captain anthony dawson also bore their share in entertaining the judicial assemblies as the population of the colony increased facilities for carrying on commerce and for traveling through the country became one of the crying needs of the day the numerous rivers of albemarle made provision for ferries imperative and as early as we find record made of ye ferre over ye mane road in perquimans in it is recorded that samuel phelps was appointed keeper of ye toll boke at ye head of perquimans river a council held at the home of captain saunderson in ordered that for the better convenience of people passing through the country a good and sufficient ferry be duly kept and attended over perquimans river from mrs anne wilsons to james thickpenny and that mrs wilson do keep the same and that no other persons presume to ferry over horse or man within five miles above or below that place as time went on the crowds attending the courts and assemblies became too large to be accommodated in private dwellings as early as the general assembly ordered a courthouse to be built at phelps point now the town of hertford and tradition states that the old building was erected on the point near the bridge where the home of mr thomas mcmullan now stands one of the most interesting spots in perquimans county is the strip of land lying between the perquimans and the yeopim rivers known as harveys neck this was the home of the harveys men who for over a century bore an important part in the history of our state it was in older days as now a fair and fertile land herds of deer wandered through its forests and great flocks of swan and wild geese floated upon its silver streams feeding upon the sweet grass which then grew in those rivers the waters were then salt but with the choking up of the inlets that let in the saline waves of the atlantic the grass disappeared and with it the wild fowl who wintered there of all the members of the famous harvey family whose homes were builded on this spot none proved more worthy of the fame he won than john harvey son of thomas harvey and elizabeth coles elected when just of age to the assembly of he continued to serve his state in a public capacity until his death in resisting the tyrannical endeavor of governor dobbs to tax the people against their rights he nevertheless stood by the same governor in his efforts to raise men and money for the french and indian war serving as speaker of the house in he took an active part in opposing the stamp act and boldly declared in the assembly that north carolina would not pay those taxes in the assembly of he proposed that carolina should form a nonimportation association and when governor tryon thereupon angrily dismissed the assembly and ordered its members home harvey called a convention independent of the governor and the association was formed when governor martin refused to call the assembly of for fear that it would elect delegates to the continental congress john harvey declared then the people will call an assembly themselves and following their intrepid leader the people did call the convention of elected their delegates to philadelphia and openly and boldly joined and led their sister colonies in the gigantic struggle with the mother country that now began in the time of bostons need when her ports were closed by englands orders and her people were threatened with starvation john harvey and joseph hewes together caused the ship penelope to be loaded with corn and meal flour and pork which they solicited from the generous people of albemarle and sent it with words of cheer and sympathy to their brethren in the new england town in harvey again braved the anger of the royal governor and called another peoples convention whose purpose and work was to watch and circumvent the tyrant in his endeavor to crush the patriots in the state the father of the revolution in carolina he was to his native state what patrick henry was to virginia in the early days of the revolution and what hancock and adams were to massachusetts his untimely death in caused by a fall from a horse was deeply mourned by patriots throughout the land among other eminent sons of perquimans during the revolutionary period the names of miles harvey colonel of the regiment from that county william skinner lieutenantcolonel of the same regiment thomas harvey major and major richard clayton are recorded in history among the delegates to the peoples convention called by harvey and johnston we find the harveys whedbees blounts skinners and moores men whose names were prominent then as now in the social and political life of the state as time went on phelps point at the narrows of the perquimans river became so thickly populated that by june a petition was presented to the general assembly praying for an act to be passed to lay out acres of land in perquimans including phelps point for a town and a town commons but a disturbance arose in the state about that time concerning the right of the northern counties to send five delegates each to the assembly while the southern counties were allowed to send only two governor gabriel johnson sided with the southern section and ordered the assembly to meet at wilmington in november on which occasion he and the southern delegates proposed to make a strong fight to reduce the representation from the albemarle counties the northern counties tenaciously clinging to their rights established in the early days of the colony when the counties south of albemarle sound had not been organized refused to send delegates to this assembly whereupon that body though a majority of its members were absent passed an act reducing the representation from the albemarle region to two members from each county indignant at this act which they considered illegal the citizens in the northern counties refused to subscribe to it and for eight years declined to send any delegates at all to the assembly and the bill for establishing a town in perquimans was heard from no more until the trouble between the two sections was settled finally the people of albemarle sent a petition to george iii praying him to restore their rights in the general assembly and the king graciously granted their request in an assembly met at new bern at which delegates from all sections of the colony were present and in answer to a petition presented by john harvey it passed an act for the erection of a town at phelps point in perquimans county the little village was called hertford a word of saxon origin signifying red ford it was named for the marquis of hertford an english noble who moved for the repeal of the stamp act in and who was ambassador at paris in the reign of george iii and lord lieutenant of ireland the settlement at phelps point was already an important rendezvous for the dwellers in the county the cypress trees under which fox had stood and preached to the little band of brethren still stood as they stand today bending lovingly over the stream close to the end of the point a little church of england chapel farther down had since been the center of the religious life of its members in the county and the courthouse on the point since had been the scene of the political and judicial gatherings in perquimans the assembly of realizing the importance of the little town to the community decreed that a public ferry should be established from newbys point to phelps point where the courthouse now stands and in seth sumner william skinner francis nixon john harvey and henry clayton were appointed trustees of the ferry a threepenny tax was laid on all taxable persons to defray the expenses of the ferry and all persons crossing to attend vestry meetings elections military musters court martials and sessions of the court were to be carried over free of charge the site of the town described in colonial records as healthy pleasantly situated well watered and commodious for commerce was the property of john phelps who gave his consent to the laying off of acres for the town on condition that he should retain his own house and lot and four lots adjoining him the public ferry having fallen into his hands the further condition was made that the town should allow no ferry other than his to be run so long as he complied with the ferry laws the subscribers for the lots were ordered to build within three years one wellframed or brick house at least feet square and in one month from purchase were to pay the trustees the sum of shillings for each lot as early as before the little settlement began to assume the airs of a town the old eagle tavern still standing on church street was a registered hotel and there when court week appeared on the calendar the representative men of the county and the surrounding precincts would gather quiet quaker folk from piney woods eight miles down from newbys point whites and nicholsons albertsons newbys and symmes jogged along the country roads behind their sleek wellfed nags to answer with serene yea or nay the questions asked on witness stand or in jury room powdered and bewigged judge and lawyer high and mighty kings officers from edenton or new bern

host of the inn much inward concern lest their cordial invitation lure from his door the guest whose bill he could see in his minds eye pleasantly lengthen as the crowded court docket slowly cleared very sure were the guests at the tavern that horse and man would be well cared for by the genial landlord for the law required that the host of eagle tavern should give ample compensation for the gold he pocketed when business was ended the strangers within his gates wended their way homeward no skimping of the bill of fare no inattention to the comfort of the wayfarer did the landlord dare allow lest his license be taken from him for violation of the tavern laws many an illustrious guest the ancient inn has known and a story cherished by the hertford people ascribes to the quaint old structure the honor of having on one occasion sheltered beneath its roof the illustrious father of his country george washington illustration eagle tavern hertford north carolina whether our first president came to hertford on business connected with lands in the dismal swamp in which he was interested or whether he tarried at the old tavern while on his triumphal journey through the south in no one now knows but the room is still shown and the tale still told of the great mans stay therein diagonally across the street from the eagle tavern at the end of the yard enclosing the old harvey home may be seen two great stones which are said to mark the grave of a mighty indian chief possibly kilcokonen friend of george durant lies buried there the hertford children in olden days when tales of ghost and goblin were more readily believed than they are today used to thrill with delicious fear whenever in the dusk of the evening they passed the spot and warily they would step over the stones halfdreading halfhoping to see as legend said was possible the spirit of the old warrior rise from the grave swinging his gory tomahawk and uttering his bloodchilling war cry during the long years that have passed since the white man came into albemarle old perquimans has borne an enviable part in making the history of our state hertford itself felt little of the fury of the storm of the war of secession though during the awful cataclysm the peaceful perquimans was often disturbed by the gunboats of the northern army one brief battle was fought in the town in which one man was killed on each side and the old residents still love to boast of the heroism shown by the courageous hertford women who while the skirmish was going on came out on their piazzas and heedless of the shot and shell flying thick and fast around them cheered on the soldiers battling to defend their homes a ball from one of the gunboats on the river while this skirmish was taking place went through one of the houses down near the shore and tore the covering from the bed on which the mistress of the house had just been lying the cruel war at last was over the darker days of reconstruction passed heavily and stressfully by the south began to recover from the ruin wrought by the awful struggle and its aftermath and in the quiet years that followed the spirit of god brooded over her rivers hills and plains and brought peace and prosperity to the troubled land her farms were tilled again the wheels of mills and factories were set whirling and new business enterprises offered to the laboring man opportunities to earn a fair living and the old colonial town of hertford sharing with her sister towns and cities in the southland the prosperity for which her children for many weary painful years

pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfsfsmilli cf currituck the haunt of the wild fowl currituck county is known the country over as the sportsmans paradise thither when the first sharp frost gives warning that the clear autumn skies will soon be banked with gray snow clouds the wild fowl from the far north come flocking and as the swiftwinged procession skims through the starry skies and the hoarse cry of the aerial voyagers resounds over head then do the dwellers in eastern albemarle know for a surety that the year is far spent and the winter days close at hand guided by unerring instinct the feathered tribes of the north pursue through the boundless sky their certain flight till the shallow waters of currituck sound and its reedy shores greet their eager sight there they find the wild celery and other aquatic plants upon which they love to feed growing in abundance and there they make their winter home and rest and scream among their fellows preferring the risk of death at the hands of the sportsman to the certain starvation that would confront them in their native arctic clime vast as are today the clouds of wild fowl that every year descend upon the shores and waters of currituck their numbers were far greater in years long gone before the white man with shot and gun came roving among the reedy marshes long before george durants advent into the state the indians with that aptness for nomenclature for which they are noted had given to this haunt of the wild fowl the name of coretonk or currituck as now called in imitation of the cry of the feathered visitors but not alone as the winter home of the winged creatures of the northern wilds was currituck noted in the early days of our state this county formerly much larger than it is today for many years embraced the region known as dare county and to currituck belongs the distinction of having once included within its borders the spot upon which raleighs colonies tried to establish their homes the history of that event is too well known to bear repetition the story of amadas and barlowes expedition of ralph lanes bold adventures in exploration of albemarle sound chowan river and chesapeake bay of the return of his disappointed colony to england in drakes vessels and the tragic fate of little virginia dare and of john whites colony have all been told in fiction song and verse the failure of raleighs colonies to establish a permanent settlement in the new world discouraged the english for many years from making any further attempts to settle america from the date of governor whites return to roanoke and of his unsuccessful search for the lost colony that lovely island for many years disappears from the white mans gaze and save for a few scattered unrecorded settlements in northern albemarle carolina itself was almost unknown to the world but in september according to the colonial records a young fur trader from virginia had the misfortune to lose his sloop in which he was about to embark for the purpose of trading with the indians in the albemarle country for reasons not stated he supposed she had gone to roanoke so he hired a small boat and with three companions set out in search of the runaway vessel they entered at coratoke inlet ten miles to the north of cape henry so reads the ancient chronicle and so went to roanoke island where or near thereabouts they found the great commander of those parts with his indians ahunting who received them civilly and showed them the ruins of sir walter raleighs fort from which i received a sure token of their being there a few months before this journey of the young fur trader charles ii had bestowed upon eight of his favorites all the territory in america lying between the thirtyfirst and thirtysixth parallels of latitude a princely gift indeed and worthy of the loyal friends who had devoted their lives and fortunes to the stuart cause during the dark days when that cause seemed hopelessly lost this grant embraced the land adjacent to the north shore of albemarle sound and extending to florida but it failed to include a strip of territory about thirty miles broad lying between the thirtysixth degree and the virginia line in this fertile region george durant and other settlers had as early as established their homes buying from kilcokonen the great chief of the yeopims their right to the lands and there these hardy pioneers were swiftly converting the primeval wilderness into fertile and productive fields governor berkeley of virginia looked with covetous eye upon this fair strip of land and with a view to planting settlements there in order to establish virginias claim to the territory he had offered in the name of king charles extensive grants in this region to planters who would bring a certain number of people into albemarle in berkeley granted to john harvey acres of land lying in a small creek called curratuck probably indian creek today falling into the river kecoughtancke now north river which falls in the carolina river known today as albemarle sound the land was given mr harvey for bringing into the colony twelve new settlers many other settlers in this region had acquired their lands by patents from virginia but after the kings gift to his friends berkeley himself one of the lords proprietors was no longer desirous to consider the albemarle region a part of the virginia colony and henceforth the grants of land were all issued in the name of the lords proprietors for several years however the albemarle counties were really separate and to all practical purposes independent territory the proprietors had no legal claim to the region and there was nothing in virginias charter to show that she could rightfully lay claim to it nevertheless the proprietors did claim it and authorized berkeley to appoint a governor for that region berkeley therefore journeyed into the settlement organized a government and appointed drummond governor of albemarle in the lords realizing the confusion that would arise unless their claim to the land was made good induced the king to include albemarle in their grant but virginia was by no means ready to relinquish her claim to this promising settlement and after berkeleys day a long struggle began between the royal governors of that colony over the question as to who should collect the rents and taxes from the inhabitants of this disputed tract as late as the quarrel was still going on and the governor and council of virginia appealed to william and mary to restrain the governor of north carolina from collecting taxes in currituck county and the question of the boundary line between virginia and carolina still being uncertain the sovereigns were asked to have the bounds surveyed and settled not for many years was this request regarded though in commissioners from virginia went to currituck to meet those from carolina for the purpose of surveying the land and establishing the boundary between the two colonies for some reason the carolina commissioners failed to appear and not till did the work of settling the disputed boundaries really begin in march of that year commissioners from the two colonies met on the north shore of currituck inlet and a cedar post on the seashore was fixed as the beginning of the line the result of the survey was that many thousand acres and several hundred people whom virginia had claimed were found to be in the albemarle district this was naturally a great disappointment to virginia and equally a matter of rejoicing to carolina not only on account of the extra territory and inhabitants she now could lawfully claim but because currituck inlet the only entrance from the sea north of roanoke island was thereafter indisputably thrown within her borders this inlet now closed by the shifting sands that form the long sand bars on the carolina coast was of great importance in the early days of the colony forming an entrance from the sea to the sound through which the trading vessels could slip so necessary was this inlet to the commerce of the colony that in the general assembly ordered that the powder money accruing to the government by vessels coming into currituck inlet should be appropriated for beaconing and staking out the channel at that entrance but by the steady beating of the waves on the coast had deposited a bank of sand at the inlet governor burrington wrote to the board of trade that it was no longer possible for large vessels to enter there nor at roanoke inlet which had also become so dangerous that no one cared to use it but that the vessels now were obliged to go around by ocracoke inlet to make their exit and entrance from and into albemarle sound the closing of the inlet was such a serious misfortune to the state that time and again efforts were made to reopen it and the assembly of appropriated money for that purpose but mans control stops with the sea the waves continued to drop their burden of sand at the entrance to the inlet and finally the attempt was abandoned the great atlantic had made the entrance and the same force had closed it seemingly forever though small sloops still slipped in and out over the bar until when it was entirely closed so necessary was an outlet to the sea to the people of the albemarle region that the assembly of passed an act providing for the digging of a canal from currituck sound to the head of north river from thence vessels could go up north river and into elizabeth river and on to norfolk and so to the sea this proposed plan was not carried out until many years later for it was not until almost that the albemarle and chesapeake canal following closely the route proposed in was dug though long before that date the dismal swamp canal had been opened and a flourishing traffic was carried on between virginia and carolina waters a traveler in eastern carolina writing for fi harpers magazine fi in an account of his journeyings in the albemarle region gives a most interesting description of his trip on the albemarle and chesapeake canal the calypso was the first steamer to go through the canal and on her maiden journey from norfolk to currituck county in she was the observed of all observers furthermore continues mr bruce the writer of the article who stopped at currituck courthouse for several days we must say that for average culture intelligence and physical vigor the people of this kingdom by the sea will hold their own with most other communities north or south currituck being the sea frontier of albemarle her waterways were naturally of prime importance to the state but other matters of as great importance are found in reading the annals of this windblown wavewashed county in religious affairs we find that she early begins to make history in governor glover wrote to the bishop of london pasquotank and currituck are now under the care of rev james adams to their general satisfaction to whom they have presented the small provision of pounds a year in rev james adams informed the spga that he had been living for over a year in the home of a mr richard saunderson a former member of the governors council who had made a will in which after his own and his wifes death he had left considerable legacy for the encouragement of a minister in currituck parish where he lived namely a good plantation with all the houses and furniture slaves and their increase and stock of cows sheep and horses and hogs with their increase forever this was later declared void by the courts on account of sandersons incapacity so acceptable did mr adams prove to the parish that in the vestry wrote a letter of thanks to thomas archbishop of canterbury thanking him for sending this godly clergyman of the church of england to the parish in on the death of mr adams the rev mr rainsford was sent to take his place he wrote back to england that on reaching currituck he found a small chapel at indian town and there in june of that year he preached to vast crowds that came to hear him in a legally appointed vestry was organized for the parish of currituck among the most prominent of whose members were richard saunderson colonel william reed foster jarvis william swann and william williams the services of the church of england were conducted in the county during those early days with as much regularity as the scattered congregations and the lack of facilities for traveling in that waterbound region permitted in the general assembly passed an act to establish st martins chapel at belleville and isaac gregory peter dauge and a mr ferebee were appointed to take this matter in charge in educational matters currituck was wonderfully alert in colonial days for a county so inaccessible from the rest of the state probably the most noted of her schools was the indian town academy built in by william ferebee one of the most prominent men in north carolina on his plantation called by the indians culong and by the whites indian town many of the students at this academy were in later days to be counted among the states most famous and useful men william ferebees family alone furnished six members of the legislature three revolutionary officers and one colonel in the confederacy in the war of secession for a hundred years this famous old school kept up its career of usefulness but in the socalled negro raid of it met the fate that befell so many of the souths cherished institutions during the dark days of and was reduced to ashes by the incendiarys torch another well known school in indian town the most prominent settlement in currituck in colonial days was the currituck seminary of learning which was built in and which numbered among its trustees isaac gregory peter dauge and william ferebee this building served the triple purpose of school church and masons hall the upper story being used for holding church service and by the masons for their meetings and the lower for the school the principal of this school was called the provost a highsounding title which must have made even the most insignificant of pedagogues feel proud and important among the teachers employed at this institution during the later years of its existence was ezekiel gilman of massachusetts a graduate of harvard who came to currituck in and who taught in currituck and camden fifty consecutive years mr gilman is still well and affectionately remembered by citizens of these counties who as lads were fortunate enough to be his pupils though somewhat eccentric in manner and dress he was a man of deep learning whose kindness of heart was proverbial throughout the counties which were the scene of his labors when the storm of the revolutionary war broke over the american colonies the men of currituck came gallantly to the front and with comrade soldiers from the other colonies doggedly and persistently fought the foe till the last british trooper was driven from the land and independence was not only declared but won few counties in the state gave more freely of her sons than did this county by the sea few can show a longer list of brave and gallant officers among the most noted of these were the three sons of william ferebee of culong plantation joseph william and samuel joseph was a lieutenant in colonel jarvis tenth north carolina militia and was at valley forge during the terrible winter of there is a family tradition that he killed general fordyce of the british army at the battle of great bridge near norfolk william was appointed captain in the seventh regiment of continentals from north carolina and was later a member of the convention of which ratified the federal constitution samuel ferebee served as sergeant and ensign in the companies of captain william russell and colonel samuel jarvis he volunteered in captain joseph ferebees company was ensign under captain james phillips and was commissioned lieutenant and collected troops by order of general gregory for baron von steuben samuel ferebee was also the last surviving member of the fayetteville convention which ratified the federal constitution he was married three times and as the family chronicle quaintly puts it was always married on sunday and on the fourteenth day of the month among the prominent families of currituck during the colonial and revolutionary days as well as in our own times was the jarvis family whose members have been men of note in the state since her history began at the two conventions called at new bern by john harvey in samuel jarvis represented his county and he also figured prominently in the halifax convention that framed our state constitution in he was appointed colonel of the minute men from currituck in he was the recruiting officer from his county and in he received his commission as colonel of the militia by the advice of the governors council in place of colonel perkins who had recently died during this year jarvis wrote to governor ashe asking that he would grant the petition of the men living on the banks who had asked to be excused from enlisting the dwellers on the coast were exposed to attacks from the enemy and should the husbands and fathers of that section of the county be forced to the field their homes would be defenceless how great the danger was had been realized a few days before jarvis wrote this letter for a british ship had entered the inlet burned two vessels belonging to the patriots and killed the cattle in the nearby marshes the governor granted the petition and seeing the peril to which the dwellers on the banks were exposed he ordered ammunition and food to be sent to jarvis for their use and protection the names of thomas jarvis judge of the admiralty court of currituck and later lieutenant colonel in samuel jarvis regiment and of john jarvis first lieutenant in an independent company stationed between currituck and roanoke inlets for the safeguard of the coast section are also familiar to students of the revolutionary history of our state while in recent times exgovernor thomas jarvis in his services to the south during the war between the states his educational campaign while governor of north carolina his distinguished career as minister to brazil and as one of the most prominent members of the state bar has added further distinction to the honored name he bears throughout the revolution from the battle of great bridge where her men fought gallantly in repelling lord dunmores invasion through the siege of charleston in the long and dreary winter at valley forge on the fatal field of camden and in many other important crises of the war the soldiers of currituck were found in the front ranks of the american army lustily shouting the battlecry of freedom and not until the last british trooper had left our shores did they lay down their arms and return to their long neglected and deserted fields and farms but though the county gave freely of her sons to the american ranks there were some within her borders who deserted the cause and either openly or secretly sympathized with the enemy the most noted of these tories was thomas mcknight who showed his colors early in the struggle mcknight was a prominent citizen of indian town this colonial settlement was built on land reserved by the lords proprietors in to yeopim indians whose chief town was called by them culong in these indians with permission of the general assembly sold their lands and with their king john durant left the state the lands were bought by thomas mcknight gideon lamb peter dauge major taylor jones john humphries william ferebee and thomas pool williams all revolutionary soldiers or members of the legislative bodies before or after the war a white settlement grew up on the site of ancient culong and the name of the red mans village was changed to indian town in memory of its former inhabitants mcknight represented currituck at the new bern convention of and there refusing to sign the document approving the continental congress at philadelphia and withdrawing from the convention he was accused of being a tory by the house and denounced as a traitor to his country though in an open letter to joseph jones of pasquotank mcknight indignantly denied the charges against his loyalty to america the halifax convention of ordered his estate to be confiscated and rented out for benefit of the state by isaac gregory william ferebee and abram harrison an amusing story is told of how mcknight acquired one of his plantations in currituck john durant the chief of the yeopims had very astutely made it known to his own braves as well as to his white neighbors that the visions that visited him in his somnolent hours must somehow somewhere if within the range of possibility materialize into visible tangible realities and that those who could and did not help in their materialization would incur the anger of the great chief now it was the habit of the wily red man whenever he greatly desired to acquire a new possession to dream that the owner of the coveted article had presented it to him having dwelt near the paleface for a number of years the old chief adopted the white mans mode of dress to a certain extent needing or coveting a new coat he very conveniently dreamed that mcknight who had kept a trading store on indian ridge gave him a bolt of bright cloth which appealed strongly to his innate love of bright colors presenting himself at the traders store he related his dream to the owner of the cloth and mcknight not daring to incur the enmity of the indian by refusing to let him have the coveted article presented it to him forthwith but mcknight equally as shrewd as the chief soon did some dreaming on his own account and in his vision he saw himself the owner of some four hundred acres of land in indian ridge the property of john durant so with due ceremony he approached the chief and solemnly related his dream and the old indian realizing that in the anglosaxon he had met his match nay his superior in cunning made over to mcknight the land this plantation was afterwards bought by doctor marchant a prominent citizen of currituck the friend and patron of colonel henry shaw whose gallant though unsuccessful defense of roanoke island during the war between the states brought honor and distinction to his native county currituck in the past has played well her part in making the history of the old north state and that a bright and prosperous future awaits her may easily be seen by all who can read the signs of the times though nature on the one hand has placed many obstacles in the way of her progress by barring her coast to incoming vessels and by surrounding her with barren shores and impenetrable marshes on the other hand she has been abundantly generous to the ancient district where her marshes are drained as in the region around moyock the richest corn land in the world is found her vast forests supply the great lumber mills of the albemarle region her sound and reedy shores provide her children with an abundance of fish and game and with the completion of the inland waterway which in carolina follows the course of the old albemarle and chesapeake canal currituck will be placed in closer touch with the great world from which she has so long been in a measure isolated material prosperity far in excess of the homely comforts which her people have always enjoyed will inevitably be the heritage of her children pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfs cf chapter xv pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfsfsmilli cf edenton in the revolution from the day when the war cloud of the revolution first began to gather upon the american horizon until the storm was spent and peace descended upon the land the little coast town of edenton played a conspicuous and heroic part in the struggle which for seven weary years wrought ruin and desolation throughout the thirteen colonies as early as when the oppressive rule of england reached its culmination in the iniquitous stamp act edenton joined with the other carolina towns in adopting resolutions expressing the strong indignation of her citizens at this act of tyranny on the part of george iii and his parliament in three of her prominent citizens joseph hewes samuel johnston and edward vail were appointed on the carolina committee of correspondence which wrote to the other colonies that north carolina was ready to join them against the king and parliament when england put into operation the famous boston port bill and that sturdy little new england city was on the verge of starvation joseph hewes a merchant of edenton who was later to play a prominent part in revolutionary events in north carolina joined with john harvey of perquimans in collecting supplies and provisions from the patriotic people of albemarle which they sent in the sloop penelope to their distressed compatriots in far away boston gratefully was the donation received by the inhabitants of that city and a letter of thanks from the boston committee amply repaid the donors for their generosity one of the earliest and certainly one of the most interesting events in the revolutionary annals of edenton was the farfamed edenton tea party held at the home of mrs elizabeth king on october this famous gathering of the edenton women was convened for the purpose of protesting against the tax on tea which england had lately begun to extort from the colonies and also for heartily endorsing the work of the first peoples convention which at the call of john harvey had met at new bern in august before the meeting adjourned these brave and patriotic women had drawn up resolutions firmly declaring their intention to drink no more of the taxed tea and to uphold and encourage in every possible way the men of the colony in their struggle to gain all the rights due them as british subjects illustration the cupola house edenton north carolina the news of this bold stand of the edenton women spread far and wide and was commented upon by the newspapers of the day both in america and england arthur iredell of london brother of james iredell of edenton who married the sister of samuel johnston on hearing of the event which seemed to have caused considerable stir in london as well as throughout the thirteen colonies wrote to his brother from his home in london the following letter anent the affair i see by the papers the edenton ladies have signalized themselves by their protest against teadrinking the name of johnston i see among them are any of my sisters relatives patriotic i hope not for we english are afraid of the male congress but if the ladies should attack us the most fatal consequences are to be dreaded so dextrous in the handling of a dart each wound they give is mortal while we so unhappily formed by nature the more we strive to conquer them the more we are conquered the edenton ladies conscious of this superiority on their side by former experiences are willing to crush us into atoms by their omnipotency the only security on our side to prevent impending ruin is the probability that there are few places in america which possess so much female artillery as edenton pray let me know all the particulars when you favor us with a letter the old house under whose roof this historic tea party was held has only of recent years been destroyed age and decay undermined its walls and it was found necessary to tear it down but a handsome bronze teapot on an iron pedestal now marks the site of the ancient building and within the halls of the state capitol the daughters of the revolution have placed a bronze tablet in commemoration of this spirited act of the women of edenton when john harvey of perquimans the father of the revolution in north carolina died his mantle fell upon samuel johnston of edenton whose residence at hayes now became the headquarters of the whig party in north carolina and his office the rendezvous of the leaders of the patriots in the state among whom hewes iredell and johnston all of edenton stood foremost so active were these three men in arousing and spreading the spirit of patriotism among their fellowcountrymen that mccree in his iredell letters declares that much of the triumph at moores creek must be ascribed to those three men who at one time held frequent consultations in johnstons office by the close of and the beginning of the flames of the revolution which had been slowly kindling now burst into open conflagration and edenton began to experience something of the consequences of war her militia had for some time been drilling in preparation for the inevitable struggle and mrs iredell in a letter to her husband written in the spring of thus expresses the general anxiety and the apprehensive state of mind of the edenton people the drum which is now beating while our soldiers exercise drives every cheerful thought from my mind and leaves it oppressed with melancholy reflections on the horrors of war in november of that year emissaries sent by lord dunmore the governor of virginia were discovered near the town endeavoring to incite the slaves of that section to rise against their masters murder them and join the tory army but general robert howe at the head of a detachment from his regiment quickly drove these agents away and thwarted the dastardly attempt then marching on with six hundred north carolina militia into virginia the gallant general reached norfolk two days after the victory of the patriots at great bridge helped to expel dunmore from norfolk and to take possession of the city for the americans in april the halifax convention authorized the delegates from north carolina to the continental congress of that year to concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring independence and upon joseph hewes of edenton fell the honor of presenting the halifax resolution of to the congress at philadelphia to the instructions of the state he represented hewes added his own urgent plea for immediate action and cast his states vote squarely against postponing the declaration of independence when the continental congress finally agreed to secede from the english government hewes with john penn and william hooper of north carolina affixed his name to that famous document in which the thirteen colonies foreswore their allegiance to king george some two months after the halifax convention and two weeks before the continental congress had formally declared independence the vestry of old st pauls church in edenton met in solemn conclave and impelled by the wave of intense patriotism now sweeping over the land drew up the socalled declaration of independence of st pauls parish the context of which is as follows we the subscribers professing our allegiance to the king and acknowledging the constitutional executive power of government do solemnly profess testify and declare that we do absolutely believe that neither the parliament of great britain nor any member nor any constituent branch thereof have a right to impose taxes upon these colonies or to regulate the internal policy thereof and that all attempts by fraud or force to establish and exercise such claims and powers are violation of the peace and security of the people and ought to be resisted to the utmost and the people of this province singly and collectively are bound by the acts and resolutions of the continental and provincial congresses because in both they are freely represented by persons chosen by themselves and we do solemnly and sincerely promise and engage under the sanction of virtue honor and the sacred love of liberty and our country to maintain and support all and every acts resolutions and regulations of the said continental and provincial congresses to the utmost of our power and ability in testimony whereof we have set our hands this th day of june during the winter of and nine battalions of soldiers from north carolina were sharing with their comrades from the other colonies the hardships of those terrible months at valley forge half naked and starving the soldiers would doubtless have given up the struggle to live through the awful winter had not governor caswell of north carolina energetically set about securing the needed supplies for the army joseph hewes responding generously to the call for help sent his own ships to the west indies to obtain necessaries for the army had them brought to edenton and from there sent by wagon to valley forge after the american victory at saratoga france who had been until then hesitating as to what course she should pursue in regard to helping the americans against the ancient foe of the french now yielded at last to franklins persuasions and promised to send a large fleet and four thousand troops to aid the colonies a party of french gentlemen sympathizing with the americans and anxious to aid in the cause came over to the states in advance of the army sent by the government and landing in edenton were so agreeably impressed with the social life of the hospitable town that they spent several weeks in the little metropolis three of these foreigners messieurs pinchieu noirmont de la neuville and la tours seem to have made many friends in the town and to have been the recipients of much hospitality on the part of the gentlefolk of edenton judge iredell who spoke french fluently made a strong impression upon the strangers and m pinchieu became one of his warm friends the visit of the french officers to edenton was made the occasion of many social functions and before the foreigners departed from the town they gave a grand ball to the edenton ladies who had made their stay so pleasant the modest colonial maidens of old edenton though dazzled and charmed by the airs and graces of the gay and debonair strangers at times found the manners of their foreign guests a little too free for their comfort miss nellie blair in a letter to her uncle judge iredell declares most emphatically her displeasure at the decidedly french behavior of one of her too attentive foreign admirers on leaving edenton the frenchmen proceeded to new bern where they tendered their swords to the general assembly and offered their services in the american cause but for reasons not stated their offer was declined the many acts of open rebellion on the part of prominent citizens of edenton had by this time made the town a marked spot in the eyes of the enemy and the fact that she was the most important port in the albemarle region and that her destruction would be a heavy blow to the entire state also singled her out as an important point of attack so in when sir george collier entered hampton roads gutted norfolk took possession of portsmouth and burned suffolk the citizens of edenton were thoroughly alarmed the dismal swamp was on fire and the crackling of the burning reed resembling the reports of musket shot caused many to think that a battle was going on near the town many of the inhabitants began to pack up their household goods ready to leave when the british should enter the town but for some unknown reason the enemy though so near failed to descend upon the town and as days and weeks passed by the cloud of apprehension began to disperse and life in the village to resume its normal course events however were to prove that the danger of invasion was averted for a time only in the fall of just after the disastrous defeat of the americans at camden and prior to cornwallis march into north carolina general leslie of the british army was sent from new york to virginia to keep the americans in southeastern virginia and albemarle from joining greenes army in the effort to repel the invasion of cornwallis edenton was again in danger the enemy two thousand strong were camped at portsmouth and one thousand were reported to have set out from virginia on their way to attack the town to add to the terror of the inhabitants two british galleys with sixty men each had slipped through roanoke inlet and were making for the little port a letter from mrs blair to james iredell written during those anxious days gives a graphic description of conditions in edenton at this juncture vessels cannot get in she writes two row galleys are between us and the bar and are daily expected in edenton if they come i do not know what we shall do we are unable to run away and i have hardly a negro well enough to dress us a little of anything to eat we hear that there is an english fleet in virginia landing men at kempes governor nash realizing that the town was in imminent danger now ordered general benbury of edenton to join general isaac gregory at great swamp near the virginia border and aid him in preventing general leslie from entering albemarle at this post a battle was fought between leslies men and the militia under benbury and gregory in which the latter were victorious a little later gregory wrote governor nash that leslies army had withdrawn from virginia but that he had not been able to ascertain the destination of the enemy however it soon became known that leslie was hurrying to camden south carolina to join cornwallis in his attempt to sweep through north carolina and conquer that state as he had conquered her sister state on the south with leslies army removed from the vicinity edenton remained for a few months free from the fear of invasion but not for long did her citizens enjoy a respite from anxiety for in january the traitor benedict arnold was sent by the british to occupy the posts in virginia lately deserted by leslie from portsmouth arnold wrote to general sir henry clinton kcb that he was planning to send boats carrying five hundred men through currituck inlet sweep the sound as high as edenton destroy that town and its shipping and then proceed to new bern which he hoped to serve in like manner then he expected to post armed vessels outside currituck inlet distress the people of the coast country and thus keep the people of eastern carolina so busy defending their own homes that they would not be able to send men to interfere with the plans of cornwallis arnh and kept it up all the afternoon just leaving a little space in the bow from which one of us could paddle and keep a lookout in this way we made nine miles and pulled up for the night a little below days lock i cannot honestly say that we had a merry evening the rain poured down with quiet persistency everything in the boat was damp and clammy supper was not a success cold veal pie when you dont feel hungry is apt to cloy i felt i wanted whitebait and a cutlet harris babbled of soles and whitesauce and passed the remains of his pie to montmorency who declined it and apparently insulted by the offer went and sat over at the other end of the boat by himself george requested that we would not talk about these things at all events until he had finished his cold boiled beef without mustard we played penny nap after supper we played for about an hour and a half by the end of which time george had won fourpence george always is lucky at cards and harris and i had lost exactly twopence each we thought we would give up gambling then as harris said it breeds an unhealthy excitement when carried too far george offered to go on and give us our revenge but harris and i decided not to battle any further against fate after that we mixed ourselves some toddy and sat round and talked george told us about a man he had known who had come up the river two years ago and who had slept out in a damp boat on just such another night as that was and it had given him rheumatic fever and nothing was able to save him and he had died in great agony ten days afterwards george said he was quite a young man and was engaged to be married he said it was one of the saddest things he had ever known and that put harris in mind of a friend of his who had been in the volunteers and who had slept out under canvas one wet night down at aldershot on just such another night as this said harris and he had woke up in the morning a cripple for life harris said he would introduce us both to the man when we got back to town it would make our hearts bleed to see him this naturally led to some pleasant chat about sciatica fevers chills lung diseases and bronchitis and harris said how very awkward it would be if one of us were taken seriously ill in the night seeing how far away we were from a doctor there seemed to be a desire for something frolicksome to follow upon this conversation and in a weak moment i suggested that george should get out his banjo and see if he could not give us a comic song i will say for george that he did not want any pressing there was no nonsense about having left his music at home or anything of that sort he at once fished out his instrument and commenced to play two lovely black eyes i had always regarded two lovely black eyes as rather a commonplace tune until that evening the rich vein of sadness that george extracted from it quite surprised me the desire that grew upon harris and myself as the mournful strains progressed was to fall upon each others necks and weep but by great effort we kept back the rising tears and listened to the wild yearnful melody in silence when the chorus came we even made a desperate effort to be merry we re filled our glasses and joined in harris in a voice trembling with emotion leading and george and i following a few words behind two lovely black eyes oh what a surprise only for telling a man he was wrong two there we broke down the unutterable pathos of georges accompaniment to that two we were in our then state of depression unable to bear harris sobbed like a little child and the dog howled till i thought his heart or his jaw must surely break george wanted to go on with another verse he thought that when he had got a little more into the tune and could throw more abandon as it were into the rendering it might not seem so sad the feeling of the majority however was opposed to the experiment there being nothing else to do we went to bed that is we undressed ourselves and tossed about at the bottom of the boat for some three or four hours after which we managed to get some fitful slumber until five am when we all got up and had breakfast the second day was exactly like the first the rain continued to pour down and we sat wrapped up in our mackintoshes underneath the canvas and drifted slowly down one of us i forget which one now but i rather think it was myself made a few feeble attempts during the course of the morning to work up the old gipsy foolishness about being children of nature and enjoying the wet but it did not go down well at all that i care not for the rain not i was so painfully evident as expressing the sentiments of each of us that to sing it seemed unnecessary on one point we were all agreed and that was that come what might we would go through with this job to the bitter end we had come out for a fortnights enjoyment on the river and a fortnights enjoyment on the river we meant to have if it killed us well that would be a sad thing for our friends and relations but it could not be helped we felt that to give in to the weather in a climate such as ours would be a most disastrous precedent its only two days more said harris and we are young and strong we may get over it all right after all at about four oclock we began to discuss our arrangements for the evening we were a little past goring then and we decided to paddle on to pangbourne and put up there for the night another jolly evening murmured george we sat and mused on the prospect we should be in at pangbourne by five we should finish dinner at say halfpast six after that we could walk about the village in the pouring rain until bedtime or we could sit in a dimlylit barparlour and read the almanac why the alhambra would be almost more lively said harris venturing his head outside the cover for a moment and taking a survey of the sky with a little supper at the to follow i added half unconsciously a capital little outoftheway restaurant in the neighbourhood of where you can get one of the bestcooked and cheapest little french dinners or suppers that i know of with an excellent bottle of beaune for threeandsix and which i am not going to be idiot enough to advertise yes its almost a pity weve made up our minds to stick to this boat answered harris and then there was silence for a while if we hadnt made up our minds to contract our certain deaths in this bally old coffin observed george casting a glance of intense malevolence over the boat it might be worth while to mention that theres a train leaves pangbourne i know soon after five which would just land us in town in comfortable time to get a chop and then go on to the place you mentioned afterwards nobody spoke we looked at one another and each one seemed to see his own mean and guilty thoughts reflected in the faces of the others in silence we dragged out and overhauled the gladstone we looked up the river and down the river not a soul was in sight twenty minutes later three figures followed by a shamedlooking dog might have been seen creeping stealthily from the boathouse at the swan towards the railway station dressed in the following neither neat nor gaudy costume black leather shoes dirty suit of boating flannels very dirty brown felt hat much battered mackintosh very wet umbrella we had deceived the boatman at pangbourne we had not had the face to tell him that we were running away from the rain we had left the boat and all it contained in his charge with instructions that it was to be ready for us at nine the next morning if we said if anything unforeseen should happen preventing our return we would write to him we reached paddington at seven and drove direct to the restaurant i have before described where we partook of a light meal left montmorency together with suggestions for a supper to be ready at halfpast ten and then continued our way to leicester square we attracted a good deal of attention at the alhambra on our presenting ourselves at the paybox we were gruffly directed to go round to castle street and were informed that we were halfanhour behind our time we convinced the man with some difficulty that we were not the world renowned contortionists from the himalaya mountains and he took our money and let us pass inside we were a still greater success our fine bronzed countenances and picturesque clothes were followed round the place with admiring gaze we were the cynosure of every eye it was a proud moment for us all we adjourned soon after the first ballet and wended our way back to the restaurant where supper was already awaiting us i must confess to enjoying that supper for about ten days we seemed to have been living more or less on nothing but cold meat cake and bread and jam it had been a simple a nutritious diet but there had been nothing exciting about it and the odour of burgundy and the smell of french sauces and the sight of clean napkins and long loaves knocked as a very welcome visitor at the door of our inner man we pegged and quaffed away in silence for a while until the time came when instead of sitting bolt upright and grasping the knife and fork firmly we leant back in our chairs and worked slowly and carelessly when we stretched out our legs beneath the table let our napkins fall unheeded to the floor and found time to more critically examine the smoky ceiling than we had hitherto been able to do when we rested our glasses at armslength upon the table and felt good and thoughtful and forgiving then harris who was sitting next the window drew aside the curtain and looked out upon the street it glistened darkly in the wet the dim lamps flickered with each gust the rain splashed steadily into the puddles and trickled down the water spouts into the running gutters a few soaked wayfarers hurried past crouching beneath their dripping umbrellas the women holding up their skirts well said harris reaching his hand out for his glass we have had a pleasant trip and my hearty thanks for it to old father thames but i think we did well to chuck it when we did heres to three men well out of a boat and montmorency standing on his hind legs before the window peering out into the night gave a short bark of decided concurrence with the toast
