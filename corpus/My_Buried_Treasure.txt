 my buried treasure by richard harding davis this is a true story of a search for buried treasure the only part that is not true is the name of the man with whom i searched for the treasure unless i keep his name out of it he will not let me write the story and as it was his expedition and as my share of the treasure is only what i can make by writing the story i must write as he dictates i think the story should be told because our experience was unique and might be of benefit to others and besides i need the money there is however no agreement preventing me from describing him as i think he is or reporting as accurately as i can what he said and did as he said and did it for purposes of identification i shall call him edgar powell the last name has no significance but the first name is not chosen at random the leader of our expedition the head and brains of it was and is the sort of man one would address as edgar no one would think of calling him ed or eddie any more than he would consider slapping him on the back we were together at college but as six hundred other boys were there at the same time that gives no clew to his identity since those days until he came to see me about the treasure we had not met all i knew of him was that he had succeeded his father in manufacturing unshrinkable flannels of course the reader understands that is not the article of commerce he manufactures but it is near enough and it suggests the line of business to which he gives his lifes blood it is not similar to my own line of work and in consequence when he wrote me on the unshrinkable flannels official writingpaper that he wished to see me in reference to a matter of business of mutual benefit i was considerably puzzled a few days later at nine in the morning an hour of his own choosing he came to my rooms in new york city except that he had grown a beard he was as i remembered him thin and tall but with no chest and stooping shoulders he wore eyeglasses and as of old through these he regarded you disapprovingly and warily as though he suspected you might try to borrow money or even joke with him as with edgar i had never felt any temptation to do either this was irritating but from force of former habit we greeted each other by our first names and he suspiciously accepted a cigar then after fixing me both with his eyes and with his eyeglasses and swearing me to secrecy he began abruptly our mills he said are in new bedford and i own several small cottages there and in fairhaven i rent them out at a moderate rate the other day one of my tenants a portuguese sailor was taken suddenly ill and sent for me he had made many voyages in and out of bedford to the south seas whaling and he told me on his last voyage he had touched at his former home at teneriffe there his grandfather had given him a document that had been left him by his father his grandfather said it contained an important secret but one that was of value only in america and that when he returned to that continent he must be very careful to whom he showed it he told me it was written in a kind of english he could not understand and that he had been afraid to let any one see it he wanted me to accept the document in payment of the rent he owed me with the understanding that i was not to look at it and that if he got well i was to give it back if he pulled through he was to pay me in some other way but if he died i was to keep the document about a month ago he died and i examined the paper it purports to tell where there is buried a pirates treasure and added edgar gazing at me severely and as though he challenged me to contradict him i intend to dig for it had he told me he contemplated crossing the rocky mountains in a baby wright or leading a cotillon i could not have been more astonished i am afraid i laughed aloud you i exclaimed search for buried treasure my tone visibly annoyed him even the eyeglasses radiated disapproval i see nothing amusing in the idea edgar protested coldly it is a plain business proposition i find the outlay will be small and if i am successful the returns should be large at a rough estimate about one million dollars even today no true american at the thought of one million dollars can remain covered his letter to me had said for our mutual benefit i became respectful and polite i might even say abject after all the ties that bind us in those dear old college days are not lightly to be disregarded if i can be of any service to you edgar old man i assured him heartily if i can help you find it you know i shall be only too happy with regret i observed that my generous offer did not seem to deeply move him i came to you in this matter he continued stiffly because you seemed to be the sort of person who would be interested in a search for buried treasure i am i exclaimed always have been have you he demanded searchingly any practical experience i tried to appear at ease but i knew then just how the man who applies to look after your furnace feels when you ask him if he can also run a sixty horsepower dynamo i have never actually found any buried treasure i admitted but i know where lots of it is and i know just how to go after it i endeavored to dazzle him with expert knowledge of course i went on airily i am familiar with all the expeditions that have tried for the one on cocos island and i know all about the peruvian treasure on trinidad and the lost treasures of jalisco near guadalajara and the sunken galleon on the grand cayman and when i was on the isle of pines i had several very tempting offers to search there and the late captain boynton invited me but interrupted edgar in a tone that would tolerate no trifling you yourself have never financed or organized an expedition with the object in view of oh that parts easy i assured him the fittingout part you can safely leave to me i assumed a confidence that i hoped he might believe was real theres always a tramp steamer in the erie basin i said that one can charter for any kind of adventure and i have the addresses of enough soldiers of fortune filibusters and professional revolutionists to man a battleship all fine fellows in a tight corner and ill promise you theyll follow us to hell and back that exclaimed edgar is exactly what i feared i beg your pardon i exclaimed thats exactly what i dont want said edgar sternly i dont intend to get into any tight corners i dont want to go to hell i saw that in my enthusiasm i had perhaps alarmed him i continued more temperately any expedition after treasure i pointed out is never without risk you must have discipline and you must have picked men suppose theres a mutiny suppose they try to rob us of the treasure on our way home we must have men we can rely on and men who know how to pump a winchester i can get you both and bannerman will furnish me with anything from a pair of leggins to a quick firing gun and on clark street theyll quote me a special rate on ship stores hydraulic pumps divers helmets edgars eyeglasses became frosted with cold condemnatory scorn he shook his head disgustedly i was afraid of this he murmured i endeavored to reassure him a little danger i laughed only adds to the fun i want you to understand exclaimed edgar indignantly there isnt going to be any danger there isnt going to be any fun this is a plain business proposition i asked you those questions just to test you and you approached the matter exactly as i feared you would i was prepared for it in fact he explained shamefacedly ive read several of your little stories and i find they run to adventure and blood and thunder they are not of the analytical school of fiction judging from them he added accusingly you have a tendency to the romantic he spoke reluctantly as though saying i had a tendency to epileptic fits or the morphine habit i am afraid i was forced to admit that to me pirates and buried treasure always suggest adventure and your criticism of my writings is well observed others have discovered the same fatal weakness we cannot all i pointed out manufacture unshrinkable flannels at this compliment to his more fortunate condition edgar seemed to soften i grant you he said that the subject has almost invariably been approached from the point of view you take and what he demanded triumphantly has been the result failure or at least before success was attained a most unnecessary and regrettable loss of blood and life now on my expedition i do not intend that any blood shall be shed or that anybody shall lose his life i have not entered into this matter hastily i have taken out information and mean to benefit by other peoples mistakes when i decided to go on with this he explained i read all the books that bear on searches for buried treasure and i found that in each case the same mistakes were made and that then in order to remedy the mistakes it was invariably necessary to kill somebody now by not making those mistakes it will not be necessary for me to kill any one and nobody is going to have a chance to kill me you propose that we fit out a schooner and sign on a crew what will happen a man with a sabre cut across his forehead or with a black patch over one eye will inevitably be one of that crew and as soon as we sail he will at once begin to plot against us a cabin boy who the conspirators think is asleep in his bunk will overhear their plot and will run to the quarterdeck to give warning but a pistol shot rings out and the cabin boy falls at the foot of the companion ladder the cabin boy is always the first one to go after that the mutineers kill the first mate and lock us in our cabin and take over the ship they will then broach a cask of rum and all through the night we will listen to their drunken howlings and from the cabin airport watch the body of the first mate rolling in the lee scuppers but you forget i protested eagerly there is always one faithful member of the crew who edgar interrupted me impatiently i have not overlooked him he said he is a jamaica negro of gigantic proportions or the ships cook but he always gets his too and he gets it good they throw him to the sharks then we all camp out on a desert island inhabited only by goats and we build a stockade and the mutineers come to treat with us under a white flag and we trusting entirely to their honor are fools enough to go out and talk with them at which they shoot us up and withdraw laughing scornfully edgar fixed his eyeglasses upon me accusingly am i right or am i wrong he demanded i was unable to answer the only man continued edgar warmly who ever showed the slightest intelligence in the matter was the fellow in the gold bug he kept his mouth shut he never let any one know that he was after buried treasure until he found it thats me now i know exactly where this treasure is and i suppose involuntarily i must have given a start of interest for edgar paused and shook his head slyly and cunningly and if you think i have the map on my person now he declared in triumph youll have to guess again really i protested i had no intention not you perhaps said edgar grudgingly but your japanese valet conceals himself behind those curtains follows me home and at night i havent got a valet i objected edgar merely smiled with the most aggravating selfsufficiency it makes no difference he declared no one will ever find that map or see that map or know where that treasure is until i point to the spot your caution is admirable i said but what i jeered makes you think you can point to the spot because your map says something like through the sunken valley to witchs caldron four points n by n e to gallows hill where the shadow falls at sunrise fifty fathoms west fifty paces north as the crow flies to the seven wells how the deuce i demanded is any one going to point to that spot it isnt that kind of map shouted edgar triumphantly if it had been i wouldnt have gone on with it its a map anybody can read except a halfcaste portuguese sailor its as plain as a laundry bill it says he paused apprehensively and then continued with caution it says at such and such a place there is a something so many somethings from that something are three whatyoumaycallems and in the centre of these three whatyoumaycallems is buried the treasure its as plain as that even with the few details you have let escape you i said i could find that spot in my sleep i dont think you could said edgar uncomfortably but i could see that he had mentally warned himself to be less communicative and he went on i am willing to lead you to it if you subscribe to certain conditions edgars insulting caution had ruffled my spirit why do you think you can trust me i asked haughtily and then remembering my share of the million dollars i added in haste i accept the conditions of course as you say one has got to take some risk edgar continued but i feel sure he said regarding me doubtfully you would not stoop to open robbery i thanked him well until one is tempted said edgar one never knows what he might do and ive simply got to have one other man and i picked on you because i thought you could write about it i see i said i am to act as the historian of the expedition that will be arranged later said edgar what i chiefly want you for is to dig can you dig he asked eagerly i told him i could but that i would rather do almost anything else i must have one other man repeated edgar a man who is strong enough to dig and strong enough to resist the temptation to murder me the retort was so easy that i let it pass besides on edgar it would have been wasted i think you will do he said with reluctance and now the conditions i smiled agreeably you are already sworn to secrecy said edgar and you now agree in every detail to obey me implicitly and to accompany me to a certain place where you will dig if i find the treasure you agree to help me guard it and convey it to wherever i decide it is safe to leave it your responsibility is then at an end one year after the treasure is discovered you will be free to write the account of the expedition for what you write some magazine may pay you what it pays you will be your share of the treasure of my part of the million dollars which i had hastily calculated could not be less than onefifth i had already spent over one hundred thousand dollars and was living far beyond my means i had bought a farm with a waterfront on the sound a motorboat and as i was not sure which make i preferred three automobiles i had at my own expense produced a play of mine that no manager had appreciated and its name in electric lights was already blinding broadway i had purchased a hollander express rifle a real amber cigar holder a private secretary who could play both ragtime and tennis and a fur coat so edgars generous offer left me naked when i had again accustomed myself to the narrow confines of my flat and the jolt of the surface cars i asked humbly is that all i get why should you expect any more demanded edgar it isnt your treasure you wouldnt expect me to make you a present of an interest in my mills why should you get a share of my treasure he gazed at me reproachfully i thought youd be pleased he said it must be hard to think of things to write about and im giving you a subject for nothing i thought he remonstrated youd jump at the chance it isnt every day a man can dig for buried treasure thats all right i said perhaps i appreciate that quite as well as you do but my time has a certain small value and i cant leave my work just for excitement we may be weeks months how long do you think we behind his eyeglasses edgar winked reprovingly that is a leading question he said i will pay all your legitimate expenses transportation food lodging it wont cost you a cent and you write the story with my name left out he added hastily it would hurt my standing in the trade he explained and get paid for it i saw a sea voyage at edgars expense i saw palm leaves coral reefs i felt my muscles aching and the sweat run from my neck and shoulders as i drove my pick into the chest of gold ill go with you i said we shook hands on it when do we start i asked now said edgar i thought he wished to test me he had touched upon one of my pet vanities you cant do that with me i said my bags are packed and ready for any place in the wide world except the cold places i can start this minute where is it the gold coast the ivory coast the spanish main edgar frowned inscrutably have you an empty suitcase he asked why empty i demanded to carry the treasure said edgar i left mine in the hall we will need two and your trunks i said there arent going to be any trunks said edgar from his pocket he had taken a folder of the new jersey central railroad if we hurry he exclaimed we can catch the tenthirty express and return to new york in time for dinner and what about the treasure i roared well bring it with us said edgar i asked for information i demanded confidences edgar refused both i insisted that i might be allowed at least to carry my automatic pistol suppose some one tries to take the treasure from us i pointed out no one said edgar severely would be such an ass as to imagine we are carrying buried treasure in a suitcase he will think it contains pajamas for local color then i begged i want to say in my story that i went heavily armed say it then snapped edgar but you cant do it not with me you cant how do i know you mightnt he shook his head warily it was a day in early october the haze of indian summer was in the air and as we crossed the north river by the twentythird street ferry the sun flashed upon the white clouds overhead and the tumbling waters below on each side of us great vessels with the blue peter at the fore lay at the wharfs ready to cast off or were already nosing their way down the channel toward strange and beautiful ports lamport and holt were rolling down to rio the royal mails magdalena no longer white and gold was off to kingston where once seven pirates swung in chains the clyde was on her way to hayti where the buccaneers came from the morro castle was bound for havana which morgan king of all the pirates had once made his own and the red d was steaming to porto cabello where sir francis drake as big a buccaneer as any of them lies entombed in her harbor and i was setting forth on a buriedtreasure expedition on a snubnosed flatbellied freshwater ferryboat bound for jersey city no one will ever know my sense of humiliation and when the italian boy insulted my immaculate tan shoes by pointing at them and saying shine i could have slain him fancy digging for buried treasure in freshly varnished boots but edgar did not mind to him there was nothing lacking it was just as it should be he was deeply engrossed in calculating how many offices were for rent in the singer building when we reached the other side he refused to answer any of my eager questions he would not let me know even for what place on the line he had purchased our tickets and as a hint that i should not disturb him he stuffed into my hands the latest magazines at least tell me this i demanded have you ever been to this place before today nce said edgar shortly last week thats when i found out i would need some one with me who could dig how do you know its the right place i whispered the summer season was over and of the chair car we were the only occupants but before he answered edgar looked cautiously round him and out of the window we had just passed red bank because the map told me he answered suppose he continued fretfully you had a map of new york city with the streets marked on it plainly suppose the map said that if you walked to where broadway and fifth avenue meet you would find the flatiron building do you think you could find it was it as easy as that i gasped it was as easy as that said edgar i sank back into my chair and let the magazines slide to the floor what fiction story was there in any one of them so enthralling as the actual possibilities that lay before me in two hours i might be bending over a pot of gold a sea chest stuffed with pearls and rubies i began to recall all the stories i had heard as a boy of treasure buried along the coast by kidd on his return voyage from the indies where along the jersey sealine were there safe harbors the train on which we were racing south had its rail head at barnegat bay and between barnegat and red bank there now was but one other inlet that of the manasquan river it might be barnegat it might be manasquan it could not be a great distance from either toward the ocean down a broad sandy road the season had passed and the windows of the cottages and bungalows on either side of the road were barricaded with planks on the verandas hammocks abandoned to the winds hung in tatters on the back porches the doors of empty refrigerators swung open on one hinge and on every side above the fields of gorgeous goldenrod rose signs reading for rent when we had progressed in silence for a mile the sandy avenue lost itself in the deeper sand of the beach and the horse of his own will came to a halt on one side we were surrounded by locked and deserted bathing houses on the other by empty pavilions shuttered and barred against the winter but still inviting one to try our salt water taffy or to keep cool with an icecream soda rupert turned and looked inquiringly at edgar to the north the beach stretched in an unbroken line to manasquan inlet to the south three miles away we could see floating on the horizonlike a mirage the hotels and summer cottages of bay head drive toward the inlet directed edgar this gentleman and i will walk relieved of our weight the horse stumbled bravely into the trackless sand while below on the damper and firmer shingle we walked by the edge of the water the tide was coming in and the spent waves spreading before them an advance guard of tiny shells and pebbles threatened our boots and at the same time in soothing lazy whispers warned us of their attack these lisping murmurs and the crash and roar of each incoming wave as it broke were the only sounds and on the beach we were the only human figures at last the scene began to bear some resemblance to one set for an adventure the rolling ocean a coast steamer dragging a great column of black smoke and cast high upon the beach the wreck of a schooner her masts tilting drunkenly gave color to our purpose it became filled with greater promise of drama more picturesque i began to thrill with excitement i regarded edgar appealingly in eager supplication at last he broke the silence that was torturing me we will now walk higher up he commanded if we get our feet wet we may take cold my spirit was too far broken to make reply but to my relief i saw that in leaving the beach edgar had some second purpose with each heavy step he was drawing toward two high banks of sand in a hollow behind which protected by the banks were three stunted winddriven pines his words came back to me so many whatyoumaycallems were these pines the three somethings from something the whatyoumaycallems the thought chilled me to the spine i gazed at them fascinated i felt like falling on my knees in the sand and tearing their secret from them with my bare hands i was strong enough to dig them up by the roots strong enough to dig the panama canal i glanced tremulously at edgar his eyes were wide open and eloquent with dismay his lower jaw had fallen he turned and looked at me for the first time with consideration apology and remorse were written in every line of his countenance im sorry he stammered i had a cruel premonition i exclaimed with distress you have lost the map i hissed no no protested edgar but i entirely forgot to bring any lunch with violent mutterings i tore off my upper and outer garments and tossed them into the hack where do i begin i asked edgar pointed to a spot inside the triangle formed by the three trees and equally distant from each put that horse behind the bank i commanded where no one can see him and both you and rupert keep off the skyline from the north and south we were now all three hidden by the two high banks of sand to the east lay the beach and the atlantic ocean and to the west stretches of marshes that a mile away met a wood of pine trees and the railroad roundhouse i began to dig i knew that weary hours lay before me and i attacked the sand leisurely and with deliberation it was at first no great effort but as the hole grew in depth and the roots of the trees were exposed the work was sufficient for several men still as edgar had said it is not every day that one can dig for treasure and in thinking of what was to come i forgot my hands that quickly blistered and my breaking back after an hour i insisted that edgar should take a turn but he made such poor headway that my patience could not contain me and i told him i was sufficiently rested and would continue with alacrity he scrambled out of the hole and taking a cigar from my case seated himself comfortably in the hack i took my comfort in anticipating the thrill that would be mine when the spade would ring on the ironbound chest when with a blow of the axe i would expose to view the hidden jewels the pieces of eight coated with verdigris the string of pearls the chains of yellow gold edgar had said a million dollars that must mean there would be diamonds many diamonds i would hold them in my hands watch them at the sudden sunshine blink their eyes and burst into tiny burning fires in imagination i would replace them in the setting from which years before they had been stolen i would try to guess whence they came from a jewelled chalice in some dim cathedral from the breast of a great lady from the hilt of an admirals sword after another hour i lifted my aching shoulders and wiping the sweat from my eyes looked over the edge of the hole rupert with his back to the sandhill was asleep edgar with one hand was waving away the mosquitoes and in the other was holding one of the magazines he had bought on the way down i could even see the page upon which his eyes were riveted it was an advertisement for breakfast food in my indignation the spade slipped through my cramped and perspiring fingers and as it struck the bottom of the pit something a band of iron a steel lock an iron ring gave forth a muffled sound my heart stopped beating as suddenly as though mr corbett had hit it with his closed fist my blood turned to melted ice i drove the spade down as fiercely as though it was a dagger it sank into rotten wood i had made no sound for i could hardly breathe but the slight noise of the blow had reached edgar i heard the springs of the hack creak as he vaulted from it and the next moment he was towering above me peering down into the pit his eyes were wide with excitement greed and fear in his hands he clutched the two suitcases like a lion defending his cubs he glared at me get out he shouted like hell i said get out he roared ill do the rest thats mine not yours get out with a swift kick i brushed away the sand i found i was standing on a squat wooden box bound with bands of rusty iron i had only to stoop to touch it it was so rotten that i could have torn it apart with my bare hands edgar was dancing on the edge of the pit incidentally kicking sand into my mouth and nostrils you promised me he roared you promised to obey me you ass i shouted havent i done all the work dont i get you get out roared edgar slowly disgustedly with what dignity one can display in crawling out of a sandpit i scrambled to the top go over there commanded edgar pointing and sit down in furious silence i seated myself beside rupert he was still slumbering and snoring happily from where i sat i could see nothing of what was going forward in the pit save once when the head of edgar his eyes aflame and his hair and eyeglasses sprinkled with sand appeared above it apparently he was fearful lest i had moved from the spot where he had placed me i had not but had he known my inmost feelings he would have taken the axe into the pit with him i must have sat so for half an hour in the sky above me a fishhawk drifted lazily from the beach sounded the steady beat of the waves and from the town across the marshes came the puffing of a locomotive and the clanging bells of the freight trains the breeze from the sea cooled the sweat on my aching body but it could not cool the rage in my heart if i had the courage of my feelings i would have cracked edgar over head with the spade buried him in the pit bribed rupert and forever after lived happily on my illgotten gains that was how kidd or morgan or blackbeard would have acted i cursed the effete civilization which had taught me to want many pleasures but had left me with a conscience that would not let me take human life to obtain them not even edgars life in half an hour a suitcase was lifted into view and dropped on the edge of the pit it was followed by the other and then by edgar without asking me to help him because he probably knew i would not he shovelled the sand into the hole and then placed the suitcases in the carriage with increasing anger i observed that the contents of each were so heavy that to lift it he used both hands there is no use your asking any questions he announced because i wont answer them i gave him minute directions as to where he could go but instead we drove in black silence to the station there edgar rewarded rupert with a dime and while we waited for the train to new york placed the two suitcases against the wall of the ticket office and sat upon them when the train arrived he warned me in a hoarse whisper that i had promised to help him guard the treasure and gave me one of the suitcases it weighed a ton just to spite edgar i had a plan to kick it open so that every one on the platform might scramble for the contents but again my infernal new england conscience restrained me edgar had secured the drawingroom in the parlorcar and when we were safely inside and the door bolted my curiosity became stronger than my pride edgar i said your ingratitude is contemptible your suspicions are ridiculous but under these most unusual conditions i dont blame you but we are quite safe now the door is fastened i pointed out ingratiatingly it and this train doesnt stop for another forty minutes i think this would be an excellent time to look at the treasure i dont said edgar i sank back into my chair with intense enjoyment i imagined the train in which we were seated hurling itself into another train and everybody including edgar or rather especially edgar being instantly but painlessly killed by such an act of an allwise providence i would at once become heir to one million dollars it was a beautiful satisfying dream even my conscience accepted it with a smug smile it was so vivid a dream that i sat guiltily expectant waiting for the crash to come for the shrieks and screams for the rush of escaping steam and breaking windowpanes but it was far too good to be true without a jar the train carried us and its precious burden in safety to the jersey city terminal and each with half a million dollars in his hand hurried to the ferry assailed by porters newsboys hackmen to them we were a couple of commuters saving a dime by carrying our own handbags it was now six oclock and i pointed out to edgar that at that hour the only vaults open were those of the night and day bank and to that institution in a taxicab we at once made our way i paid the chauffeur and two minutes later with a gasp of relief and rejoicing i dropped the suitcase i had carried on a table in the steelwalled fastnesses of the vaults gathered excitedly around us were the officials of the bank summoned hastily from above and watchmen in plain clothes and watchmen in uniforms of gray great bars as thick as my leg protected us walls of chilled steel rising from solid rock stood between our treasure and the outer world until then i had not known how tremendous the nervous strain had been but now it came home to me i mopped the perspiration from my forehead i drew a deep breath edgar i exclaimed happily i congratulate you i found edgar extending toward me a twodollar bill you gave the chauffeur two dollars he said the fare was really one dollar eighty so you owe me twenty cents mechanically i laid two dimes upon the table all the other expenses continued edgar which i agreed to pay i have paid he made a peremptory gesture i wont detain you any longer he said goodnight goodnight i cried dont i see the treasure against the walls of chilled steel my voice rose like that of a tortured soul dont i touch it i yelled dont i even get a squint even the watchmen looked sorry for me you do not said edgar calmly you have fulfilled your part of the agreement i have fulfilled mine a year from now you can write the story as i moved in a dazed state toward the steel door his voice halted me and you can say in your story called edgar that there is only one way to get a buried treasure that is to go and get it the consul for over forty years in one part of the world or another old man marshall had served his country as a united states consul he had been appointed by lincoln for a quarter of a century that fact was his distinction it was now his epitaph but in former years as each new administration succeeded the old it had again and again saved his official head when victorious and voracious placehunters searching the map of the world for spoils dug out his hidingplace and demanded his consular sign as a reward for a younger and more aggressive party worker the ghost of the dead president protected him in the state department marshall had become a tradition you cant touch him the state department would say why he was appointed by lincoln secretly for this weapon against the hungry headhunters the department was infinitely grateful old man marshall was a consul after its own heart like a soldier he was obedient disciplined wherever he was sent there without question he would go never against exile against illhealth against climate did he make complaint nor when he was moved on and down to make way for some neerdowell with influence with a brotherinlaw in the senate with a cousin owning a newspaper with rich relatives who desired him to drink himself to death at the expense of the government rather than at their own did old man marshall point to his record as a claim for more just treatment and it had been an excellent record his official reports in a quaint stately hand were models of english full of information intelligent valuable well observed and those few of his countrymen who stumbled upon him in the outoftheworld places to which of late he had been banished wrote of him to the department in terms of admiration and awe never had he or his friends petitioned for promotion until it was at last apparent that save for his record and the memory of his dead patron he had no friends but still in the department the tradition held and though he was not advanced he was not dismissed if that old mans been feeding from the public trough ever since the civil war protested a practical politician it seems to me mr secretary that hes about had his share aint it time he give some one else a bite some of us that has done the work that has borne the brunt this place he now holds interrupted the secretary of state suavely is one hardly commensurate with services like yours i cant pronounce the name of it and im not sure just where it is but i see that of the last six consuls we sent there three resigned within a month and the other three died of yellowfever still if you insist the practical politician reconsidered hastily im not the sort he protested to turn out a man appointed by our martyred president besides hes so old now if the fever dont catch him hell die of old age anyway the secretary coughed uncomfortably and they say he murmured republics are ungrateful i dont quite get that said the practical politician of porto banos of the republic of colombia where as consul mr marshall was upholding the dignity of the united states little could be said except that it possessed a sure harbor when driven from the caribbean sea by stress of weather the largest of ocean tramps and even battleships could find in its protecting arms of coral a safe shelter but as young mr aiken the wireless operator pointed out unless driven by a hurricane and the fear of death no one ever visited it back of the ancient wharfs that dated from the days when porto banos was a receiver of stolen goods for buccaneers and pirates were rows of thatched huts streets according to the season of dust or mud a few ironbarred jaillike barracks customhouses municipal buildings and the whitewashed adobe houses of the consuls the backyard of the town was a swamp through this at five each morning a rusty engine pulled a train of flat cars to the base of the mountains and if meanwhile the rails had not disappeared into the swamp at five in the evening brought back the flat cars laden with odorous coffeesacks in the daily life of porto banos waiting for the return of the train and betting if it would return was the chief interest each night the consuls the foreign residents the wireless operator the manager of the rusty railroad met for dinner there at the head of the long table by virtue of his years of his courtesy and distinguished manner of his office mr marshall presided of the little band of exiles he was the chosen ruler his rule was gentle by force of example he had made existence in porto banos more possible for women and children porto banos was a deathtrap and before old man marshall came there had been no influence to remind the enforced bachelors of other days they had lost interest had grown lax irritable morose their white duck was seldom white their cheeks were unshaven when the sun sank into the swamp and the heat still turned porto banos into a turkish bath they threw dice on the greasy tables of the cafe bolivar for drinks the petty gambling led to petty quarrels the drinks to fever the coming of mr marshall changed that his standard of life his tact his worldly wisdom his cheerful courtesy his fastidious personal neatness shamed the younger men the desire to please him to stand well in his good opinion brought back pride and selfesteem the lieutenant of her majestys gunboat plover noted the change used to be he exclaimed you couldnt get out of the cafe bolivar without some one sticking a knife in you now its a debating club they all sit round a table and listen to an old gentleman talk world politics if henry marshall brought content to the exiles of porto banos there was little in return that porto banos could give to him magazines and correspondents in six languages kept him in touch with those foreign lands in which he had represented his country but of the country he had represented newspapers and periodicals showed him only too clearly that in forty years it had grown away from him had changed beyond recognition when last he had called at the state department he had been made to feel he was a man without a country and when he visited his home town in vermont he was looked upon as a rip van winkle those of his boyhood friends who were not dead had long thought of him as dead and the sleepy pretty village had become a bustling commercial centre in the lanes where as a young man he had walked among wheatfields trolleycars whirled between rows of mills and factories the children had grown to manhood with children of their own like a ghost he searched for house after house where once he had been made welcome only to find in its place a towering office building all had gone the old familiar faces in vain he scanned even the shop fronts for a friendly homelike name whether the fault was his whether he would better have served his own interests than those of his government it now was too late to determine in his own home he was a stranger among strangers in the service he had so faithfully followed rank by rank he had been dropped until now he who twice had been a consulgeneral was an exile banished to a fever swamp the great ship of state had dropped him overside had marooned him and sailed away twice a day he walked along the shell road to the cafe bolivar and back again to the consulate there as he entered the outer office jose the colombian clerk would rise and bow profoundly any papers for me to sign jose the consul would ask not today excellency the clerk would reply then jose would return to writing a letter to his ladylove not that there was anything to tell her but because writing on the official paper of the consulate gave him importance in his eyes and in hers and in the inner office the consul would continue to gaze at the empty harbor the empty coral reefs the empty burning sky the little band of exiles were at second break fast when the wireless man came in late to announce that a red d boat and the island of curacao had both reported a hurricane coming north also that much concern was felt for the safety of the yacht serapis three days before in advance of her coming she had sent a wireless to wilhelmstad asking the captain of the port to reserve a berth for her she expected to arrive the following morning but for fortyeight hours nothing had been heard from her and it was believed she had been overhauled by the hurricane owing to the presence on board of senator hanley the closest friend of the new president the man who had made him president much concern was felt at washington to try to pick her up by wireless the gunboat newark had been ordered from culebra the cruiser raleigh with admiral hardy on board from colon it was possible she would seek shelter at porto banos the consul was ordered to report as marshall wrote out his answer the french consul exclaimed with interest he is of importance then this senator he asked is it that in your country ships of war are at the service of a senator aiken the wireless operator grinned derisively at the service of this senator they are he answered they call him the kingmaker the man behind the throne but in your country protested the frenchman there is no throne i thought your president was elected by the people thats what the people think answered aiken in gods country he explained the trusts want a rich man in the senate with the same interests as their own to represent them they chose hanley he picked out of the candidates for the presidency the man he thought would help the interests he nominated him and the people voted for him hanley is what we call a boss the frenchman looked inquiringly at marshall the position of the boss is the more dangerous said marshall gravely because it is unofficial because there are no laws to curtail his powers men like senator hanley are a menace to good government they see in public office only a reward for party workers thats right assented aiken your forty years service mr consul wouldnt count with hanley if he wanted your job hed throw you out as quick as he would a drunken cook mr marshall flushed painfully and the french consul hastened to interrupt then let us pray he exclaimed with fervor that the hurricane has sunk the serapis and all on board two hours later the serapis showing she had met the hurricane and had come out second best steamed into the harbor her owner was young herbert livingstone of washington he once had been in the diplomatic service and as minister to the hague wished to return to it in order to bring this about he had subscribed liberally to the party campaign fund with him among other distinguished persons was the allpowerful hanley the kidnapping of hanley for the cruise in itself demonstrated the ability of livingstone as a diplomat it was the opinion of many that it would surely lead to his appointment as a minister plenipotentiary livingstone was of the same opinion he had not lived long in the nations capital without observing the value of propinquity how many men he knew were now paymasters and secretaries of legation solely because those high in the government met them daily at the metropolitan club and preferred them in almost any other place and if after three weeks as his guest on board what the newspapers called his floating palace the senator could refuse him even the prize legation of europe there was no value in modest merit as yet livingstone had not hinted at his ambition there was no need to a statesman of hanleys astuteness the largeness of livingstones contribution to the campaign fund was selfexplanatory after her wrestlingmatch with the hurricane all those on board the serapis seemed to find in land even in the swamp land of porto banos a compelling attraction before the anchors hit the water they were in the launch on reaching shore they made at once for the consulate there were many cables they wished to start on their way by wireless cables to friends to newspapers to the government jose the colombian clerk appalled by the unprecedented invasion of visitors of visitors so distinguished and marshall grateful for a chance to serve his fellowcountrymen and especially his countrywomen were ubiquitous eager indispensable at joses desk the great senator rolling his cigar between his teeth was using to joses ecstasy joses own pen to write a reassuring message to the white house at the consuls desk a beautiful creature all in lace and pearls was struggling to compress the very low opinion she held of a hurricane into ten words on his knee henry cairns the banker was inditing instructions to his wall street office and upon himself livingstone had taken the responsibility of replying to the inquiries heaped upon marshalls desk from many newspapers it was just before sunset and marshall produced his tea things and the young person in pearls and lace who was miss cairns made tea for the women and the men mixed gin and limes with tepid water the consul apologized for proposing a toast in which they could not join he begged to drink to those who had escaped the perils of the sea had they been his oldest and nearest friends his little speech could not have been more heartfelt and sincere to his distress it moved one of the ladies to tears and in embarrassment he turned to the men i regret there is no ice he said but you know the rule of the tropics as soon as a ship enters port the icemachine bursts ill tell the steward to send you some sir said livingstone and as long as were here the senator showed his concern as long as were here he gasped not over two days answered the owner nervously the chief says it will take all of that to get her in shape as you ought to know senator she was pretty badly mauled the senator gazed blankly out of the window beyond it lay the naked coral reefs the empty sky and the ragged palms of porto banos livingstone felt that his legation was slipping from him that wireless operator he continued hastily tells me there is a most amusing place a few miles down the coast las bocas a sort of coney island where the government people go for the summer theres surf bathing and roulette and cafes chantants he says theres some spanish dancers the guests of the serapis exclaimed with interest the senator smiled to marshall the general enthusiasm over the thought of a ride on a merrygoround suggested that the friends of mr livingstone had found their own society far from satisfying greatly encouraged livingstone continued with enthusiasm and that wireless man said he added that with the launch we can get there in half an hour we might run down after dinner he turned to marshall will you join us mr consul he asked and dine with us first marshall accepted with genuine pleasure it had been many months since he had sat at table with his own people but he shook his head doubtfully i was wondering about las bocas he explained if your going there might not get you in trouble at the next port with a yacht i think it is different but las bocas is under quarantine there was a chorus of exclamations its not serious marshall explained there was bubonic plague there or something like it you would be in no danger from that it is only that you might be held up by the regulations passenger steamers cant land any one who has been there at any other port of the west indies the english are especially strict the royal mail wont even receive any one on board here without a certificate from the english consul saying he has not visited las bocas for an american they would require the same guarantee from me but i dont think the regulations extend to yachts i will inquire i dont wish to deprive you of any of the many pleasures of porto banos he added smiling but if you were refused a landing at your next port i would blame myself its all right declared livingstone decidedly its just as you say yachts and warships are exempt besides i carry my own doctor and if he wont give us a clean bill of health ill make him walk the plank at eight then at dinner ill send the cutter for you i cant give you a salute mr consul but you shall have all the side boys i can muster those from the yacht parted from their consul in the most friendly spirit i think hes charming exclaimed miss cairns and did you notice his novels they were in every language it must be terribly lonely down here for a man like that hes the first of our consuls weve met on this trip growled her father that weve caught sober sober exclaimed his wife indignantly hes one of the marshalls of vermont i asked him i wonder mused hanley how much the place is worth hamilton one of the new senators has been deviling the life out of me to send his son somewhere says if he stays in washington hell disgrace the family i should think this place would drive any man to drink himself to death in three months and young hamilton from what ive seen of him ought to be able to do it in a week that would leave the place open for the next man theres a postmaster in my state thinks he carried it the senator smiled grimly he has consumption and wants us to give him a consulship in the tropics ill tell him ive seen porto banos and that its just the place for him the senators pleasantry was not well received but miss cairns alone had the temerity to speak of what the others were thinking what would become of mr marshall she asked the senator smiled tolerantly i dont know that i was thinking of mr marshall he said i cant recall anything he has done for this administration you see miss cairns he explained in the tone of one addressing a small child marshall has been abroad now for forty years at the expense of the taxpayers some of us think men who have lived that long on their fellowcountrymen had better come home and get to work livingstone nodded solemnly in assent he did not wish a post abroad at the expense of the taxpayers he was willing to pay for it and then with exminister on his visiting cards and a sense of duty well performed for the rest of his life he could join the other expatriates in paris just before dinner the cruiser raleigh having discovered the whereabouts of the serapis by wireless entered the harbor and admiral hardy came to the yacht to call upon the senator in whose behalf he had been scouring the caribbean seas having paid his respects to that personage the admiral fell boisterously upon marshall the two old gentlemen were friends of many years they had met officially and unofficially in many strange parts of the world to each the chance reunion was a piece of tremendous good fortune and throughout dinner the guests of livingstone already bored with each other found in them and their talk of former days new and delightful entertainment so much so that when marshall having assured them that the local quarantine regulations did not extend to a yacht the men departed for las bocas the women insisted that he and admiral remain behind it was for marshall a wondrous evening to foregather with his old friend whom he had known since hardy was a mad midshipman to sit at the feet of his own charming countrywomen to listen to their soft modulated laughter to note how quickly they saw that to him the evening was a great event and with what tact each contributed to make it the more memorable all served to wipe out the months of bitter loneliness the stigma of failure the sense of undeserved neglect in the moonlight on the cool quarterdeck they sat in a halfcircle each of the two friends telling tales out of school tales of which the other was the hero or the victim inside stories of great occasions ceremonies bombardments unrecorded shirtsleeve diplomacy hardy had helped to open the suez canal marshall had assisted the queen of madagascar to escape from the french invaders on the barbary coast hardy had chased pirates in edinburgh marshall had played chess with carlyle he had seen paris in mourning in the days of the siege paris in terror in the days of the commune he had known garibaldi gambetta the younger dumas the creator of pickwick do you remember that time in tangier the admiral urged when i was a midshipman and got into the bashaws harem do you remember how i got you out marshall replied grimly and demanded hardy do you remember when adelina patti paid a visit to the kearsarge at marseilles in george dewey was our second officer and you were bowing and backing away from her and you backed into an open hatch and she said my french isnt up to it what was it she said i didnt hear it said marshall i was too far down the hatch do you mean the old kearsarge asked mrs cairns were you in the service then mr marshall with loyal pride in his friend the admiral answered for him he was our consulgeneral at marseilles there was an uncomfortable moment even those denied imagination could not escape the contrast could see in their minds eye the great harbor of marseilles crowded with the shipping of the world surrounding it the beautiful city the rival of paris to the north and on the battleship the young consulgeneral making his bow to the young empress of song and now before their actual eyes they saw the village of porto banos a black streak in the night a row of mud shacks at the end of the wharf a single lantern yellow in the clear moonlight later in the evening miss cairns led the admiral to one side admiral she began eagerly tell me about your friend why is he here why dont they give him a place worthy of him ive seen many of our representatives abroad and i know we cannot afford to waste men like that the girl exclaimed indignantly hes one of the most interesting men ive ever met hes lived everywhere known every one hes a distinguished man a cultivated man even i can see he knows his work that hes a diplomat born trained that hes the admiral interrupted with a growl you dont have to tell me about henry he protested ive known henry twentyfive years if henry got his deserts he exclaimed hotly he wouldnt be a consul on this coral reef hed be a minister in europe look at me were the same age we started together when lincoln sent him to morocco as consul he signed my commission as a midshipman now im an admiral henry has twice my brains and hes been a consulgeneral and hes here back at the foot of the ladder why demanded the girl because the navy is a service and the consular service isnt a service men like senator hanley use it to pay their debts while henrys been serving his country abroad hes lost his friends lost his pull those politicians up at washington have no use for him they dont consider that a consul like henry can make a million dollars for his countrymen he can keep them from shipping goods where theres no market show them where there is a market the admiral snorted contemptuously you dont have to tell me the value of a good consul but those politicians dont consider that they only see that he has a job worth a few hundred dollars and they want it and if he hasnt other politicians to protect him theyll take it the girl raised her head why dont you speak to the senator she asked tell him youve known him for years that glad to do it exclaimed the admiral heartily it wont be the first time but henry mustnt know hes too confoundedly touchy he hates the idea of influence hates men like hanley who abuse it if he thought anything was given to him except on his merits he wouldnt take it then we wont tell him said the girl for a moment she hesitated if i spoke to mr hanley she asked told him what i learned tonight of mr marshall would it have any effect dont know how it will affect hanley said the sailor but if you asked me to make anybody a consulgeneral id make him an ambassador later in the evening hanley and livingstone were seated alone on deck the visit to las bocas had not proved amusing but much to livingstones relief his honored guest was now in goodhumor he took his cigar from his lips only to sip at a long cool drink he was in a mood flatteringly confidential and communicative people have the strangest idea of what i can do for them he laughed it was his pose to pretend he was without authority they believe ive only to wave a wand and get them anything they want i thought id be safe from them on board a yacht livingstone in ignorance of what was coming squirmed apprehensively but it seems the senator went on im at the mercy of a conspiracy the women folk want me to do something for this fellow marshall if they had their way theyd send him to the court of st james and old hardy too tackled me about him so did miss cairns and then marshall himself got me behind the wheelhouse and i thought he was going to tell me how good he was too i but he didnt as though the joke were on himself the senator laughed appreciatively told me instead that hardy ought to be a viceadmiral livingstone also laughed with the satisfied air of one who cannot be tricked they fixed it up between them he explained each was to put in a good word for the other he nodded eagerly thats what i think there were moments during the cruise when senator hanley would have found relief in dropping his host overboard with mock deference the older man inclined his head thats what you think is it he asked livingstone he added you certainly are a great judge of men the next morning old man marshall woke with a lightness at his heart that had been long absent for a moment conscious only that he was happy he lay between sleep and waking frowning up at his canopy of mosquito net trying to realize what change had come to him then he remembered his old friend had returned new friends had come into his life and welcomed him kindly he was no longer lonely as eager as a boy he ran to the window he had not been dreaming in the harbor lay the pretty yacht the stately whitehulled warship the flag that drooped from the stern of each caused his throat to tighten brought warm tears to his eyes fresh resolve to his discouraged troubled spirit when he knelt beside his bed his heart poured out his thanks in gratitude and gladness while he was dressing a bluejacket brought a note from the admiral it invited him to tea on board the warship with the guests of the serapis his old friend added that he was coming to lunch with his consul and wanted time reserved for a long talk the consul agreed gladly he was in holiday humor the day promised to repeat the good moments of the night previous at nine oclock through the open door of the consulate marshall saw aiken the wireless operator signaling from the wharf excitedly to the yacht and a boat leave the ship and return almost immediately the launch carrying several passengers again made the trip shoreward half an hour later senator hanley miss cairns and livingstone came up the waterfront and entering the consulate seated themselves around marshalls desk livingstone was sunk in melancholy the senator on the contrary was smiling broadly his manner was one of distinct relief he greeted the consul with hearty goodhumor im ordered home he announced gleefully then remembering the presence of livingstone he hastened to add i neednt say how sorry i am to give up my yachting trip but orders are orders the president he explained to marshall cables me this morning to come back and take my coat off the prospect as a change from playing bridge on a pleasure boat seemed far from depressing him those filibusters in the senate he continued genially are making trouble again they think theyve got me out of the way for another month but theyll find theyre wrong when that bill comes up theyll find me at the old stand and ready for business marshall did not attempt to conceal his personal disappointment i am so sorry you are leaving he said selfishly sorry i mean id hoped you all would be here for several days he looked inquiringly toward livingstone i understood the serapis was disabled he explained she is answered hanley sos the raleigh at a pinch the admiral might have stretched the regulations and carried me to jamaica but the raleighs engines are knocked about too ive got to reach kingston thursday the german boat leaves there thursday for new york at first it looked as though i couldnt do it but we find that the royal mail is due today and she can get to kingston wednesday night its a great piece of luck i wouldnt bother you with my troubles the senator explained pleasantly but the agent of the royal mail here wont sell me a ticket until youve put your seal to this he extended a piece of printed paper as hanley had been talking the face of the consul had grown grave he accepted the paper but did not look at it instead he regarded the senator with troubled eyes when he spoke his tone was one of genuine concern it is most unfortunate he said but i am afraid the royal mail will not take you on board because of las bocas he explained if we had only known he added remorsefully it is most unfortunate because of las bocas echoed hanley you dont mean theyll refuse to take me to jamaica because i spent half an hour at the end of a wharf listening to a squeaky gramophone the trouble explained marshall is this if they carried you all the other passengers would be held in quarantine for ten days and there are fines to pay and there would be difficulties over the mails but he added hopefully maybe the regulations have been altered i will see her captain and tell him see her captain objected hanley why see the captain he doesnt know ive been to that place why tell him all i need is a clean bill of health from you thats all he wants you have only to sign that paper marshall regarded the senator with surprise but i cant he said you cant why not because it certifies to the fact that you have not visited las bocas unfortunately you have visited las bocas the senator had been walking up and down the room now he seated himself and stared at marshall curiously its like this mr marshall he began quietly the president desires my presence in washington thinks i can be of some use to him there in helping carry out certain party measures measures to which he pledged himself before his election down here a british steamship line has laid down local rules which in my case anyway are ridiculous the question is are you going to be bound by the red tape of a hapenny british colony or by your oath to the president of the united states the sophistry amused marshall he smiled goodnaturedly and shook his head im afraid senator he said that way of putting it is hardly fair unfortunately the question is one of fact i will explain to the captain you will explain nothing to the captain interrupted hanley this is a matter which concerns no one but our two selves i am not asking favors of steamboat captains i am asking an american consul to assist an american citizen in trouble and he added with heavy sarcasm incidentally to carry out the wishes of his president marshall regarded the senator with an expression of both surprise and disbelief are you asking me to put my name to what is not so he said are you serious that paper mr marshall returned hanley steadily is a mere form a piece of red tape theres no more danger of my carrying the plague to jamaica than of my carrying a dynamite bomb you know that i do know that assented marshall heartilyi appreciate your position and i regret it exceedingly you are the innocent victim of a regulation which is a wise regulation but which is most unfair to you my own position he added is not important but you can believe me it is not easy it is certainly no pleasure for me to be unable to help you hanley was leaning forward his hands on his knees his eyes watching marshall closely then you refuse he said why marshall regarded the senator steadily his manner was untroubled the look he turned upon hanley was one of grave disapproval you know why he answered quietly it is impossible in sudden anger hanley rose marshall who had been seated behind his desk also rose for a moment in silence the two men confronted each other then hanley spoke his tone was harsh and threatening then i am to understand he exclaimed that you refuse to carry out the wishes of a united states senator and of the president of the united states in front of marshall on his desk was the little iron stamp of the consulate protectingly almost caressingly he laid his hand upon it i refuse he corrected to place the seal of this consulate on a lie there was a moments pause miss cairns unwilling to remain and unable to withdraw clasped her hands unhappily and stared at the floor livingstone exclaimed in indignant protest hanley moved a step nearer and to emphasize what he said tapped his knuckles on the desk with the air of one confident of his advantage he spoke slowly and softly do you appreciate he asked that while you may be of some importance down here in this fever swamp in washington i am supposed to carry some weight do you appreciate that i am a senator from a state that numbers four millions of people and that you are preventing me from serving those people marshall inclined his head gravely and politely and i want you to appreciate he said that while i have no weight at washington in this fever swamp i have the honor to represent eighty millions of people and as long as that consular sign is over my door i dont intend to prostitute it for you or the president of the united states or any one of those eighty millions of the two men the first to lower his eyes was hanley he laughed shortly and walked to the door there he turned and indifferently as though the incident no longer interested him drew out his watch mr marshall he said if the cable is working ill take your tin sign away from you by sunset for one of marshalls traditions to such a speech there was no answer save silence he bowed and apparently serene and undismayed resumed his seat from the contest judging from the manner of each it was marshall not hanley who had emerged victorious but miss cairns was not deceived under the unexpected blow marshall had turned older his clear blue eyes had grown less alert his broad shoulders seemed to stoop in sympathy her own eyes filled with sudden tears what will you do she whispered i dont know what i shall do said marshall simply i should have liked to have resigned its a prettier finish after forty years to be dismissed by cable is its a poor way of ending it miss cairns rose and walked to the door there she turned and looked back i am sorry she said and both understood that in saying no more than that she had best shown her sympathy an hour later the sympathy of admiral hardy was expressed more directly if he comes on board my ship roared that gentleman ill push him down an ammunition hoist and break his damned neck marshall laughed delightedly the loyalty of his old friend was never so welcome youll treat him with every courtesy he said the only satisfaction he gets out of this is to see that he has hurt me we will not give him that satisfaction but marshall found that to conceal his wound was more difficult than he had anticipated when at tea time on the deck of the warship he again met senator hanley and the guests of the serapis he could not forget that his career had come to an end there was much to remind him that this was so he was made aware of it by the sad sympathetic glances of the women by their tactful courtesies by the fact that livingstone anxious to propitiate hanley treated him rudely by the sight of the young officers each just starting upon a career of honor and possible glory as his career ended in humiliation and by the big warship herself that recalled certain crises when he had only to press a button and warships had come at his bidding at five oclock there was an awkward moment the royal mail boat having taken on her cargo passed out of the harbor on her way to jamaica and dipped her colors senator hanley abandoned to his fate observed her departure in silence livingstone hovering at his side asked sympathetically have they answered your cable sir they have said hanley gruffly was it was it satisfactory pursued the diplomat it was said the senator with emphasis far from discouraged livingstone continued his inquiries and when he asked eagerly are you going to tell him now said the senator the guests were leaving the ship when all were seated in the admirals steam launch the admiral descended the accommodation ladder and himself picked up the tiller ropes mr marshall he called when i bring the launch broadside to the ship and stop her you will stand ready to receive the consuls salute involuntarily marshall uttered an exclamation of protest he had forgotten that on leaving the warship as consul he was entitled to seven guns had he remembered he would have insisted that the ceremony be omitted he knew that the admiral wished to show his loyalty knew that his old friend was now paying him this honor only as a rebuke to hanley but the ceremony was no longer an honor hanley had made of it a mockery it served only to emphasize what had been taken from him but without a scene it now was too late to avoid it the first of the seven guns had roared from the bow and as often he had stood before as never he would so stand again marshall took his place at the gangway of the launch his eyes were fixed on the flag his gray head was uncovered his hat was pressed above his heart for the first time since hanley had left the consulate he fell into sudden terror lest he might give way to his emotions indignant at the thought he held himself erect his face was set like a mask his eyes were untroubled he was determined they should not see that he was suffering another gun spat out a burst of white smoke a stab of flame there was an echoing roar another and another followed marshall counted seven and then with a bow to the admiral backed from the gangway and then another gun shattered the hot heavy silence marshall confused embarrassed assuming he had counted wrong hastily returned to his place but again before he could leave it in savage haste a ninth gun roared out its greeting he could not still be mistaken he turned appealingly to his friend the eyes of the admiral were fixed upon the warship again a gun shattered the silence was it a jest were they laughing at him marshall flushed miserably he gave a swift glance toward the others they were smiling then it was a jest behind his back something of which they all were cognizant was going forward the face of livingstone alone betrayed a like bewilderment to his own but the others who knew were mocking him for the thirteenth time a gun shook the brooding swamp land of porto banos and then and not until then did the flag crawl slowly from the masthead mary cairns broke the tenseness by bursting into tears but marshall saw that every one else save she and livingstone were still smiling even the bluejackets in charge of the launch were grinning at him he was beset by smiling faces and then from the warship unchecked came against all regulations three long splendid cheers marshall felt his lips quivering the warm tears forcing their way to his eyes he turned beseechingly to his friend his voice trembled charles he begged are they laughing at me eagerly before the other would answer senator hanley tossed his cigar into the water and scrambling forward seized marshall by the hand mr marshall he cried our president has great faith in abraham lincolns judgment of men and this salute means that this morning he appointed you our new minister to the hague im one of those politicians who keeps his word i told you id take your tin sign away from you by sunset ive done it end ofproject gutenberg etext of my buried treasure by r h davis my buried treasure a free ebook from httpmanybooksnet
