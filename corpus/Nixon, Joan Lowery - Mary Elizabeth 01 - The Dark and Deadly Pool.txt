joan lowery nixon the dark and deadly pool moonlight drizzled down the wide glass wall that touched the surface of the hotel swimming pool dividing it into two parts the windflicked waters of the outer pool glittered with reflected pinlights from the moon and stars but the silent water in the indoor section had been sucked into the blackness of the room i blinked trying to adjust my eyes to the darkness trying to see the edge of the pool that curved near my feet i pressed my back against the wall and forced myself to breathe evenly i whispered aloud mary elizabeth rafferty there is nothing to be afraid of here nothing but even the sound of my own wobbly words terrified me i remembered how glad id been to get this summer replacement job at the ridley hotel health club the ridley is one of those superbeautiful hotels with fresh flowers in silver urns on all their gigantic carved tables and sideboards and paintings that are the real thing and a whole collection of sterling pieces which they plan to use if the president ever stays there which so far he hasnt their health club was designed by an interior decorator in coral and green with loads of looming ficus trees and palms and whiteblossomed closet plants and giantleaved philodendron all in huge brass planters which right away tells you that nobody really goes there to get healthy theres a small room with weight equipment separate dressing rooms for men and women with a large sauna in each a bubbling jacuzzi and the pool which is magnificent even though the salary wasnt anything to cheer about i eagerly agreed to five days a week of scrubbing the tiles around the pool manning the desk in the healthclub office and keeping a sharp eye through the office windowwall on the swimmers in the indoor section of the pool as mom told me it was the perfect job for someone who had grown too tall too fast and had been politely dismissed from her first summer job at a hamburger chain because she knocked over too many filled glasses of cola and stumbled over too many table legs and as usual mom was right during the three days id been working at the health club no one seemed to pay attention to a little clumsiness except for the first day on duty when i fell into the swimming pool but lets not talk about that and so far no one here had asked me if i played basketball or what the weather was like up there or if i got my red hair from being so close to the sun at least here at the health club i wasnt made to feel like an ungainly klutz what you need is confidence in yourself dad had said a summer job should help you gain confidence we hope it will help you learn to appreciate yourself mom had wistfully added mary elizabeth you have got to begin to think good positive things about yourself concentrate on all your best qualities thats a blank i said dad put an arm around my shoulders youre a wonderful girl and the world is filled with wonderful things for you just concentrate on what you can put into life and what you want from it what do you want mom asked a tall boyfriend i said flippantly i wasnt going to tell them what i dreamed of being someday it was an impossible dream for that matter i supposed that a tall boyfriend was too i thought about some of the tall guys i knew at school they were all dating girls who were under five feet two might as well make him handsome while youre at it i added mom sighed and began to say be serious you dont understand what were trying to but dad held up a hand and said all right sweetheart if thats what you want right now keep your goal in mind and dont settle for less he kissed the end of my nose were proud of you good luck with your new job i may have flubbed the first job but here i was with a secondchance fivedayaweek job that lasted from three in the afternoon until eleven at night when the health club closed it was a good job and i liked it with one exception those few terrifying minutes at closing when i was alone in that echoing cavernous room with the dark lonely pool the first two nights i had to shoo out a few dawdling guests politely of course then i checked both the mens and womens dressing rooms to make sure everyone had left locked the door to the outside deck and turned out the pool lights and club lights in the office in the dark i secured the office door with a loud click that shuddered through the steamy silence then trembled across the twenty feet between the office door and the door to the corridor leading from the club to the side lobby of the hotel i frantically slammed and locked the large door to the health club grateful to be out in the brightly lit corridor glad to be leaving that humid watery darkness and thankful that no one had heard those little gasping noises id been making i couldnt help feeling ashamed that i was behaving not like a sixteenyearold with my first real job but like a child who was afraid of being alone in the dark i knew i had to grow up and the only way to do it was to conquer this childish fear so on this the third night at work i deliberately waited outside the locked office door next to the dark pool i pressed my back against the cold roughtextured wall and quietly willed myself to relax i squeezed my eyes shut while i took two deep breaths it worked i my breathing slowed and my shoulders relaxed against the wall but droplets of sweat trickled down my backbone and my bare legs were clammy from the humidity in the room as i waited shapes crept out of shadows and became familiar patio chairs and tables and potted palms and ferns shining tiles edged the pool and the surface of the black water gleamed like polished jet stone i had to smile it wasnt so bad here in the dark this room was a crazy place in which to be alone but i could manage i was proud of myself i would never let that unreasonable fear get to me again when i heard the splash outside i first thought it must be my imagination it was a small noise not the wild splashing the kids made and certainly not the loud bellyflopping splash caused by some of the overweight hotel conventioneers who were under the impression they were diving i listened carefully and stared into the darkness stepping to the very edge of the pool a shadow at the bottom of the pool blacker than the dark water above it slipped under the glass divider and quivered in my direction like a shimmer of lightning i watched u come too terrified to move too frightened to scream as the shadow loomed upward ripping the water hands clutched at the edge of the pool one of them grabbing the toe of my sneaker which was in the way and a face eyes and mouth gaping and gasping met my own i screamed and an echoing scream came from the mouth below mine with a loud gulp of air and thrashing of water the face disappeared under the dark surface i could see the shadow quickly slip under the glass wall and enter the outside part of the pool i stumbled and tripped to the office door dropping the keys somehow i managed to find them get the door open and turn on the office light sprawling across the desk i grabbed the telephone and rang the hotels security office number yo a deep voice answered i couldnt mistake the voice it came from lamar boudry ridley chief of security who styled himself a symbol of controlled confidence and who periodically roamed through the corridors and lobby of the hotel like a marked patrol car his impressive appearance in black from his tightly cropped hair and moustache down to his shining black shoes with elevator heels silently informed the guests they could retire with ease knowing they were well protected at the ridley hotel mr boudry i shouted its me liz rafferty help me theres someone in the swimming pool tell him its closing time and hes got to get out lamar boudry yawned loudly into the phone and my ear i cant tell him anything he grabbed my foot screamed in my face and disappeared under the water can you describe him did he have webbed fingers or green fangs im not kidding mr boudry come and help me ive got both the inside and outside pool area on camera right now liz and i dont see anyone there except you in the office but outside nobodys outside place is empty somebody must have sneaked in no way to get over those walls he yawned again i saw you turn off the lights in the club ten minutes ago how come youre still hanging around there well i that is i wanted to get over being scared in the dark and i i stopped and took a deep breath let me start over it sounds like it sounds like youve got a big imagination maybe the hotel should get you a nightlight mr boudry arent you even going to come down here and look im looking im looking thats what these monitors are for why dont you just lock up now and go on home no i thumped a fist on the desk and managed to upset ajar of pens and pencils which rolled off the desk and over the floor whoever was in the pool might be hiding somewhere around here and i cant lock up the club with him in it okay okay boudry drawled tina hasnt checked out yet ill send her down to look around and ill keep an eye on the area through the cameras thanks i mumbled and hung up i flipped on all the switches so that the entire area inside and outside was colored in intense artificial light the pool became a brightblue jewel the trees and shrubs that rimmed the outside tiles dripped in lemongreen with the black sky beyond the club resembled one of those garish paintings on black velvet that were sold on vacant lots along highway and westheimer the door to the club swung open and tina called out help has arrived where are you liz i skidded across the pencils managing to steady myself by hanging onto the door frame as i swung out of the office to face tina martinez tinas dark hair was cut short and straight in line with boudrys regulations for security personnel but tina filled out her uniform of white shirt maroon jacket and slacks so well that her hair was not the first thing people noticed about her when tina was my age she had worked at the hotel health club but this summer she was nineteen and had been hired for a fulltime position with security she nagged me into hiring her boudry told everyone but he let everyone know that tina was good at her job according to tina however her mind was set on higher things shed enrolled in a couple of summer college courses and was going to work and study her way eventually into a masters degree in psychology at least then she could analyze everyone legally legal or not id never met anyone so full of advice as i regained my balance tina tried to peer around me somebody chasing you or what she asked i shook the hair from my eyes no no he was in the pool i told tina what had happened what did he look like i dont know it was dark and i was scared tina it all happened in just a few seconds records show tina said that most eyewitnesses are not very accurate so dont worry if you cant give me details basically its an emotional problem your space is threatened that sort of stuff its in all the books she walked to the glass wall and tried to open the door get your key liz well check around outside my fingers trembled but i managed to unlock the door the slight breeze was warm and heavy with moisture yet i realized i was shivering what if hes hiding out here somewhere i whispered while she talked tina poked in and under the shrubbery that lined the outer brick wall you forget liz youre protected by the ridley hotel security force our brave leader has put down the espionage novel he was reading to keep us on camera and im here did i tell you that i made top scores in my marksmanship test last week i didnt know you took the test tina scowled at me over her shoulder and mouthed something that i couldnt make out she gave a final sweeping glance to the pool area then came over to join me whoever he was hes not here she said my guess is that he went over the wall probably the same way he came in isnt the wall too high tina shrugged maybe hes a super athlete we have to keep our options open she gave one last glance around i dont think theres anything to worry about and since you lock the door between the club and the hotel whoever it was couldnt get into the hotel at least the symbol of controlled confidence and his security staff protect the guests while theyre inside the hotel she sighed i wish we could do something about protecting them when theyre outside protecting them from what tina lowered her voice dont blab it around because the hotel is trying to keep a lid on it and lamar is having fits about whats happening a lot of the guests are having their wallets lifted during their first or second day in houston you mean pickpockets right but that could happen to anyone in any city not in such quantity not from one hotel in particular i dont see how the hotel could be involved i told her none of us can she said thats the trouble she led the way back inside and waited while i once again locked the glass door you shouldnt have said what you did about the marksmanship test im sorry i told her i didnt know about the test there wasnt any test then what are you talking about dont you see i was psyching him out in case he was hiding somewhere tina smiled my theory is that the mind is a more potent weapon than a gun when im a psychologist the telephone rang in the healthclub office i rushed to answer it it was boudry since everythings okay down there tell tina to get herself to room some complaints about a noisy party tell her after shes handled that she can go on home before i had a chance to answer boudry hung up i relayed the message to tina i grabbed my handbag and turned off the lights scrambling to follow tina out of the health club in the corridor tina turned to face me this guy you think you saw in the pool tonight theres another possibility to consider but i did see him i began tina interrupted judging by the way you were breathing after you turned out the lights sort of like the way a fish gasps when he flops around we could be looking at something deeper what tina nodded solemnly and said perhaps you saw only a manifestation of your inner fears i did not i yelled i saw somebody a person he screamed at me you were afraid of the dark when you were little and thought that something lived under your bed right that stopped me for a moment and i stammered well sure but who didnt i didnt tina said you have unresolved conflicts in your life right but everybody be specific is there something youd like to do but think you cant immediately a picture came to my eyes it was the same picture that i liked to dwell on before i fell asleep at night in the picture im standing at the podium in jones hall in front of the houston symphony orchestra i nod to the first violinist raise my baton and music swirls and swells to the back row of the top balcony as i once again conduct the orchestra to greatness fame and good reviews in the houston post and chronicle but how can a superb conductor not be a superb musician over the last few years ive tried piano guitar and drums in that order but mom kept getting migraine headaches the band director at school suggested i learn the flute but every time i practiced at home dad rushed out to take a walk houston symphony orchestra conductor the only symphonies ill ever conduct are those in the car when i tune in klef i didnt like tina prying into my private dreams no one knew about them and she wouldnt either i stretched to my full height and yelled down at tina my private life has nothing to do with what i saw in the swimming pool tonight someone was there and i saw him okay okay tina said im not a psychologist yet so well handle it your way she paused however theres a noisy party in room i shouted youre kind of a noisy party yourself tina said and giggled i couldnt help laughing i was being pretty huffy i relaxed a little and said ill see you tomorrow afternoon ill probably be on camera duty tina said give me a call if any goodlooking hunks come in i know you youll find them before i do i told her i followed tina down the corridor and into the lobby as tina headed for the elevators i went toward the back of the hotel and out through the employees checkpoint i guess all big hotels have a certain amount of theft from employees but according to tina the ridley had been having a higher rate than usual lamar had set up both rules and equipment we could take nothing out with us except small clear plastic handbags and we had to exit and enter by one door only we walked through a metal detector and a swiveling camera followed us through the door to the parking lot i turned in my keys the metal detector remained silent as i passed through so the elderly guard at the desk reached for my handbag examined it and handed it back nodding me through i thought about what tina had said about unresolved conflicts and what dad had said about going for what i wanted and not accepting anything less the symphony orchestra was too far out of reach but the tall handsome guy maybe dad was right i could give it a try why not the employee exit was near the outside kitchen door and the huge trash containers there was a car parked next to the containers the drivers door was open and the inside light was on as i approached something my size leapt up from the dark plastic bags of trash and squeaked in fright fortunately i recognized one of the assistant chefs in the main kitchen and just as fortunately he recognized me his face had a kind of yellow color and it wasnt from the car lights you scared me to death he mumbled what were you doing in the trash bags i asked emptying my ashtray he snapped i didnt know i had to get your permission without waiting for me to answer he whirled and leapt into his car and drove off with a squeal of tires apparently i wasnt the only employee who was ready to chew fingernails but i couldnt understand why i had frightened him so badly the roofs of the cars row after row in the hotel parking lot gleamed a weird greenblue under powerful arc lamps i had parked as close to the hotel as i could but the tar dad had lent me old junk bucket was off to one side the fifth row back i looked around nervously i was the only one in the parking lot i tucked my car and house keys between the fingers on my right hand so that they faced outward like small daggers and made a fist tina had shown me how to do this selfpreservation is our basic instinct tina had said if some bozo wants to give you trouble this will change his mind i began walking briskly toward old junk bucket but soon broke into a run as i got to the car i was embarrassed to realize that i was making that darned fish noise again i dropped my keys scooped them up and tried to find the one that would open the car door i dropped them again where were they i squatted to find and retrieve them but my fingers were shaking so much it was hard to pick up the keys i tried that relaxing thing again squeezing my eyes shut and taking two deep breaths then slowly i said mary elizabeth rafferty there is nothing to be afraid of i opened my eyes and found i was staring at a pair of dark trousers and shoes with somebody in them i screamed somewhere high above the shoes someone yelled dont do that and the shoes jumped back i shot to my feet slamming against the side of the car and stared down at a guy who seemed to be as scared as i was he was smallboned with lightbrown hair that stuck up in a cowlick making a point at the top of his head he had a pug nose and a narrow chin and looked something like i had imagined puck ought to look when i read shakespeares midsummer nights dream what are you doing here i screeched at him room service in the parking lot youre crazy hey im just telling you what im doing here i work in room service i was on my way home and saw you drop your keys and thought i could help i leaned against the side of the car and tried to calm down im sorry i yelled at you i was scared he looked around then back at me those arc lamps make the lot bright enough theres nothing to be scared of i know i said its just that a few minutes ago somebody came up from the bottom of the pool and grabbed my foot he gave me kind of a strange look yeah well i suppose that could scare some people although ive done that in swimming pools when i was younger i shook my head you dont understand everybody had gone home and the pool was dark and he sneaked in somehow oh forget it youre very pretty he suddenly said it took me by surprise i dropped my keys again he picked them up youre really unstrung arent you if youll wait until i get in my car ill follow you home i dont even know you i said i was going to tell you my name but when you screamed at me i forgot to i didnt scream well it wasnt a real scream francis liverpool iii what thats my given name given meaning i didnt choose it call me fran okay im i know who you are fran said were in the same class at memorial high we are but i know because im short you think im younger than you are right well im not i didnt choose being short either i didnt i dont think lack of height is necessarily genetic ive got two younger brothers who are going to be tall one of them is taller than i am already i think shortness of stature is a direct result of stress as a matter of fact someday im going to be a geneticist and prove that stress in the classroom inhibits growth stress in the classroom but everybody has some people more than others thats going to be part of my study does it affect the sincerely conscientious and the creative more than the others for example look at football players you keep interrupting me i said fran looked surprised oh sorry what did you want to say i thought a moment uh nothing i guess great conversationalist mary elizabeth rafferty i told myself i was glad that fran couldnt see my cheeks turn red then why dont we go home he said remember ill follow you i dont need yes you do fran turned and walked away i drove home with the headlights of frans car shining in my rearview mirror as i pulled into the driveway of our house he paused gave a wave then drove away even though fran drove something that made old junk bucket look good it had been comforting to have his company on the way home i had left a light on in the house it felt a little funny to be at home alone but everything in the house was so comfortably familiar i could handle it dad had been sent to dallas on company business and mom had gone with him are you sure you wont mind being alone mom had asked weve never left you alone before of course mrs zellendorf next door has promised to keep an eye on you uh on the house dont talk babysitters im a big girl now i grinned at mom you could come with us she suggested no i said i took a job remember responsibility and all that stuff anyhow im going to like the job and i want to stick with it good for you mom had said as she hugged me but i had to remind her at least forty times before they drove to the airport that i was going to be all right during the week theyd be gone now i sleepily gave the house a checkover and washed down two of moms doublechocolatechip cookies with a glass of milk i debated about writing another letter to my best and shortest friend amy peters who was spending the summer with her father in connecticut but i was too tired so i went to bed i had time only to smile at the bejeweled audience in jones hall and raise my baton before i fell asleep art marl was working out with the weights when i arrived at the health club the next afternoon his name is really arthur martin director of the health club and my boss i have to talk to you i said he put down the barbell and flexed his muscles smiling smugly at his deeply tanned reflection in the huge mirror across the room tina told me that art is the one who had the mirror put in art i went on i have to tell you what happened last night he managed to pull his gaze away from the mirror and turned his attention to me i was reminded of the facial exercises we had to do in juniorhigh drama class first he stared trying to remember who i was then he smiled and finally as what i said dawned on him he scowled what happened you didnt disturb any of the hotel guests did you of course not i said and told him about the latenight swimmer art sighed hitched up his shorts and started for the outdoor section of the pool come on he said well take a look i followed him but not as closely as the appreciative stares of two girls who were splashing around in the shallow water of the indoor pool they were welcome to him art wasnt my type if you think that art is nothing but a pretty face tina had told me during my first day on the job youre right mrs bandini one of the afternoon regulars yoohooed at me from her chair across the pool i just waved back and managed to bang into the edge of the glass door as it swung shut i rubbed my shoulder and hurried to catch up with art some little boy was cannonballing into the pool drenching the sunbathers who yelled at him its against the rules i said to the boy but he made a face at me and leapt into the water i wasnt going to worry about him now i had to keep up with art who dove into a gap in the shrubbery and worked his way along the brick wall moving toward the left i thought id help so i did the same thing working my way toward the right near what should have been a ninetydegree angle in the wall where a jasmine vine spread itself over the mottled brick i saw bright cracks of light i pulled back a handful of vine startled that it swung so easily and there it was a gap at least a foot wide where the two walls didnt meet the shrubs on both sides of the walls were so thick that the gap was well hidden i struggled from the shrubbery pulling twigs from my hair and bumped into art so there you are he said i thought you must have gone back inside to start your shift he wasnt very subtle he stared at his watch and then at me i was helping you look i said its a waste of time art said no way anyone could get in or out of here yes there is i said theres a gap where the walls dont meet i found it he looked surprised youre kidding no im not go look for yourself art looked at his watch again okay but youd better get into the office and scrub the tiles around the jacuzzi before you leave tonight deeley called in sick this morning so they didnt get taken care of i thought hed be more excited by my news but somebody got into the pool last night he must have squeezed through that gap some kid probably art said we should have somebody close it ill get maintenance on it do you want me to call them when i get to the office i want you to do your job he said youll be the only one on duty ill take care of it later gwan liz get busy mrs bandini waved at me again her friend mrs larabee had joined her she waved too ive got something to tell you mrs bandini called ill be there in a minute i called back quickly i locked my handbag in the bottom desk drawer and checked the womens dressing room picking up a few towels that had been dropped on a bench under the sign saying please put towels in the basket i turned off a shower that had been left dripping and gave the rest room a onceover i put a fresh stack of towels on the little table next to the door leading from the office to the exercise room and scanned the pool area from the office window there seemed to be only four hotel guests and eight club members it was always pretty quiet in midafternoon the hotel guests began to arrive around fivethirty their business meetings were over and they were ready for a swim the club could gel pretty crowded during weekday evenings even though art mart had undoubtedly done the crosscheck with the photoid cards i went over them too the photoid cards were lamars idea as the hotel guests registered at the front desk they were also automatically registered on film by hidden cameras they didnt know they were being photographed and lamar thought it was better that way no nonsense about posing or wanting a copy or getting embarrassed because it was a bad shot he wasnt looking for star quality lamar had said he was simply taking one more step to guard the safety and wellbeing of all guests of the ridley hotel the security force studied those photographs and believe me there were no strangers wandering around the ridley hotel duplicate cards were sent each morning and afternoon to the health club along with a list of guests who had checked out so their cards could be tossed the cards of regular club members who lived in houston were also on file i liked to go over the cards it helped me to remember names and everyone likes to be addressed by name it was also fun to study the types of faces and wonder who each person was and what he or she was like there were glum faces and eager faces and faces with expressions from peevish to placid opening the card file and thumbing through it guessing about the people behind the faces made me think of opening a box of smoothlooking chocolates and trying to figure out which hid the chocolate creams and which held the cherries some of the faces stayed a few days and became familiar some came and disappeared and came back again some popped in on an afternoon but were on their way the next day and never returned i glanced at sylvia bandinis card she was a club member here every day tina said that mrs bandini had celebrated her seventieth birthday last may mrs bandinis white hair curled around her face like the frame around a portrait she read all the latest exercise books and tried to look like the models on the book jackets once she even wore striped redandgreen leg warmers with her blue bathing suit on a scale of one to ten she would have got a ten for trying but her figure was kind of a minus five she was really nice her smile was always a brightred gleam across the room and i liked to talk to her her friend mrs opal larabee was five years younger than mrs bandini mrs larabee pointedly mentioned this soon after i met the two women mrs bandini just smiled and added that mrs larabee was one up on her there and was also one up on her where weight was concerned being fifteen pounds heavier mrs larabee smiled and said something about being an inch and three quarters taller and i left in a hurry not wanting to hear the rest mr asmir kamara was at the club as usual i twisted to glance through the wide glass window wall that divided the office from the pool area and saw his shining bald head leading the way back and forth in a straight path from one end of the pool to the other his daily routine as usual his terrycloth robe was folded neatly over the back of a chair and his thongs were placed side by side under the chair mr kamara a wealthy retiree who lived at the ridley hotel seemed to speak only enough english to imperiously insult all the male employees of the hotel and extravagantly flatter all the female employees watch out for that old buzzard tina had told me in his country they have some funny ideas about women if he pesters you give me a call and ill come running art mart was more blunt hell probably ask you to go away with him for a weekend so far hes tried it with all the women who work in the hotel when you turn him down remember hes a guest of the ridley and go easy mr kamara introduced himself to me on my first day at work the next afternoon when he arrived at the club wearing a terrycloth robe over his bathing trunks he brought me a bunch of bluedyed carnations and a bag of apples you will drive to new orleans with me this weekend he asked i tried to remember the clever retort i had planned to answer but all that came out was no he just shrugged maybe later no i said he seemed to hesitate then shoved the flowers and bag of apples at me keep anyway he said and flashed an expensive porcelain smile no thanks i said yes thanks he said firmly put them on my desk and disappeared into the mens dressing room to lock his room key and wallet in his locker he returned in a few minutes going straight through the office to his favorite somewhat secluded table and chair where he was joined by a club member named c l jones mr jones who was pale and long and skinny had what my pe teacher called sloppy posture his shoulders were so rounded he looked like the top of a question mark he was as unusual as mr kamara tina told me that mr jones came every day to the club but he rarely went swimming and never stayed very long sometimes he rode the exercise bike but mostly he chatted awhile with mr kamara and left his membership seemed like a waste of money mrs bandinis arms rippled up and down in some kind of a signal to me so i put the box of photoid cards back in the desk left the office and walked over to where she and mrs larabee were ensconced in their deck chairs with cups of coffee such a nice girl mrs bandini said and gleamed at me i would like to have a granddaughter like you mary elizabeth you would like to have a granddaughter period mrs larabee said although theres small chance of that mrs bandini looked pained i have two grandsons who are a constant joy as you well know and if my daughter rosa wanted to go to law school instead of becoming mother to a beautiful little daughter who was i to tell her what a mistake she was making my legs were suddenly splattered with cold water and i jumped back climbing out of the pool was the boy whod been cannonballing listen you i began but mrs bandini interrupted me mary elizabeth id like you to meet my youngest grandson paul canelli hes ten years old and getting straight as in school and you should hear him play the piano paulys teacher says he has exceptional talent shake hands with mary elizabeth pauly she was so proud of him i ignored paulys smirk i held out my hand hoping he wouldnt bite it he shook my hand as quickly as possible grabbed a towel and wrapped it around himself he flopped into a chair and said could i have a hamburger grandma youll spoil your dinner mrs bandini said but im hungry please grandma well mrs bandini hesitated only a second if you promise to eat all your dinner tonight you may phone for room service room service i thought about fran he was a funny little guy but i hoped id see him again today maybe i should look him up id like to thank him for escorting me home last night id like him to see that i wasnt always as weird as i must have seemed last night pauly ran over to the phone mr kamara was just putting the receiver on its hook pauly ducked in to grab it and mr kamara nearly fell over him he caught his balance and snapped something at pauly in a language i didnt understand it was probably just as well mrs bandini was speaking to me so i made myself pay attention my other grandson eric she said all the girls like eric hes very handsome very tall too i told him about you mary elizabeth she stopped and seemed to be waiting for an answer i stammered the first thing that came to mind he must be wonderful oh he is she said im going to make sure that the two of you meet each other great i said trying to sound enthusiastic the last thing i wanted to do was meet mrs bandinis other grandson one was more than enough i went toward the office as floyd parmlee came into the room with a covered tray i had met floyd on monday he was as bland on the inside as he was on the outside he reminded me of yellow wax beans i hate yellow wax beans mr kamara had picked a table off to the side behind a large potted plant where he couldnt be seen by the people at the pool but as i neared the office door i saw floyd put the tray on the table next to mr kamara who signed for whatever it was he ordered then i saw something strange it took only a second but through the fronds of the potted plant i know i saw mr kamara shove some money into floyds hand it looked like a lot of money wow talk about big tippers i was seated at the desk getting ready to start writing my daily report when floyd poked his head in the door he shoved a goldfoilcovered box at me whats that i asked from mr kamara floyd said its chocolates from the gift shop i dont want them why not because i cant accept them i cant have mr kamara giving me presents will you tell him that floyd tell him yourself floyd said its no skin off my nose he disappeared i picked up the box of chocolates as though it were a bomb and carried it out to where mr kamara was sitting eating a dish of strawberry ice cream im sorry mr kamara i said knowing that mrs bandini and mrs larabee were as intent on what i was saying as mr kamara was but i cant accept your presents yes mr kamara said his broad smile was decorated with a strand of crushed strawberry i want you to take i cant take i mean its not proper for an employee to accept gifts from a hotel guest i not understand mr kamara said is chocolates girls like chocolates you eat no thank you i said firmly placing the box in front of him yes thank you he said just as firmly from the corner of my eye i saw fran enter the room with a tray and make a beeline to where pauly was silting i stood as tall as i could and tried to intimidate mr kamara you must stop giving me gifts mr kamara yes he said no more but you take now he handed the box of chocolates to me again as i hesitated he repeated no more without a word mainly because i couldnt think of the right thing to say i took the box and marched back to the office in a few minutes fran appeared hi he said hi im glad youre here his eyes seemed to spark you are really yes thanks for escorting me home last night yeah well sure he looked pleased with himself now i know where you live maybe i could come by sometime if its all right with you four inches shorter than i am and asking me for a date how could i go out with a guy whod make me look even taller than i am besides i had a goal to work on tall and handsome keep the thought in mind uh im uh kind of busy right now i said fran just shrugged he glanced at a slip of paper in his hand those women over there mrs bandini and mrs larabee they said if you didnt want to eat the chocolates if you were worried that chocolate might cause skin problems in teenagers theyd help you out in other words they wish id give them the box of chocolates mrs bandini said to tell you that box sells for twentyfour dollars and ninetyeight cents in the gift shop i giggled and fran laughed too what should i do about mr kamara i asked hes uh unusual weird fran said floyd usually gets him and complains about it what do you mean mr kamaras order he always wants floyd to deliver it and floyd grumbles about it a lot because he says mr kamara hardly ever tips and then its only a quarter or fifty cents no matter how much the order is but i said fran went on hes a real tightwad and crabby to everyone and i stopped listening i was thinking about the fistful of bills i had seen mr kamara hand to floyd something about that transaction was decidedly strange fran finally ran down and i said listen to me a few minutes ago i saw mr kamara hand floyd what looked like a fistful of bills maybe to buy the candy for you fran glanced down at the goldfoil box theres one way to find out i rang the gift shop and mrs landon answered we had the same shift and wed eaten dinner together in the employee cafeteria two days in a row i was sure shed answer my question and she did i thanked her hung up and said to fran he charged it to his room he charges everything to his room so fran asked there are lots of reasons he could be giving floyd money like maybe floyd asked for a loan maybe i said it just didnt seem right and there are so many strange things going on that i never mind its really not my business what mr kamara does i suppose im poking my nose where it doesnt belong its a goodlooking nose take care of it fran said he smiled and left the office he was a nice guy with a kind of relaxed friendliness that made him easy to talk to but four inches shorter forget it i took the box of candy to mrs bandini staying only long enough to watch pauly dive into ii with both hands mr kamara was in the pool again swimming back and forth he opened one eye and rolled it until it focused on me he reminded me of a film id seen on whales and i wouldnt have been surprised if hed suddenly spouted water he scowled at the box of chocolates dived underwater with a snort and returned to his rhythmic pattern ignoring us my grandson eric is even taller than you are and very handsome mrs bandini said youd like him the girls he knows always telephoning him always chasing him he needs to meet a nice girl like you i wondered if he shoveled chocolates into his face as fast as pauly did ive got to get back to work i told her and hurried to the office a deep canvas cart which was piled to the top with freshly laundered towels had been brought down and i had to stack them in the office closet a towel cart came down twice a day in the morning before the club opened and in the middle of the afternoon art mart took care of the towels in the morning even before the club opened and deeley arrived deeley johnson who worked in the health club on the morning shift said that art was really fussy about having the fresh towels stacked before the first swimmer arrived the rest of the afternoon and evening were busier than usual a convention group registered and many of their members seemed to head for the pool and jacuzzi as soon as they had checked in tina brought in a batch of photoid cards and i studied them carefully doing my best to tie faces to names tina who had stayed and was staring out the office window toward the inside section of the pool nudged my shoulder whos the hunk over there with the red hair look him up quick hes married and has eight children i said tina whirled and blinked at me a couple of limes before she met my answering grin i knew that stuff wasnt on the card she said come on whats his name i pulled the card and told her see you later she said and sauntered around the pool in the guys direction deeley called in to report that shed be out sick again the next day deeley was always ready to leave as i arrived so besides comparing notes on our jobs and some of the people who came to the club we hadnt had much chance to talk i told her that i hoped shed be well soon and went back to work finally as the crowd began thinning art mart returned to the club he sat at the desk humming to himself then seemed to notice me how about the tiles liz its a good time to clean them theres no one in the jacuzzi right now okay i said i pulled the brush i needed from the closet an had tilted back his chair and propped his feet on the desk will you be here until closing time as i asked the question i knew it came out sounding desperate art didnt notice maybe it was all that carefully combed thick blond hair that kept subtleties from penetrating his mind something certainly got in the way naw an drawled i got a date i shifted the brush from one hand to the other and back again what did maintenance say about what about the gap between the walls art mulled this over for a moment then said guess i forgot to tell them about it but what if whoever sneaked in last night comes back he grinned he wont from what you told me you probably scared him worse than he scared you why dont you call maintenance right now wont do any good nobodys there at night somebodys always there nobody but one nightman on duty in case a pipe breaks or something ill call in the morning you wont forget he just stared at me with a disgusted look dont rub it in didnt you ever forget something oh i said i almost forgot to tell you that deeley wont be back tomorrow morning shes still sick he let out an obscenity and grumbled something about not wanting to get up that early but his mood suddenly changed and he leaned across the desk to point a finger at me hal you almost forgot to tell met dont get after me ever again for forgetting something i wont i said and scooted out of the office scrubbing tiles is hard work but i did a good thorough job of it now and then someone would call out a friendly goodbye to me and id sit back on my heels and chat a moment before getting back to work but when i finally stood mission accomplished i found it was five minutes to closing time and i was the only one in the health club the swimming pool was bright and gleaming with light and it was going to stay that way until the moment i left this place my steps quickened and i went through the routine of tidying both locker rooms and checking to make sure no one was left in the rest rooms or saunas with everything taken care of i unlocked the bottom desk drawer and retrieved my handbag clutching it and the healthclub keys tightly i flipped off all the lights as fast as i could locked the office door and sprinted toward the door that connected the health club with the hotel so much for plans in the darkness i slammed into a body that made an oofing sound and wrapped its arms lightly around me down we dropped legs thrashing i fell on top of whoever it was and he let out a yell i have a weapon i said fiercely wondering where my handbag and key ring had landed dont move or youre dead i hope you move youre squashing me he grunted i recognized his voice fran what are you doing there you knocked me down his words came out in gasps get up liz youre heavy and your elbow is in my stomach i quickly rolled away and sat up fran sat up too my eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness so i could see fran rubbing the back of his head im sorry i said i didnt know you were in the club i thought id help you close up he said i guessed that you were still a little jumpy i was really touched fran i said what a nice kind thing to do he reached for my hand and held it his hand was warm and strong what kind of a weapon he asked what are you talking about you said you had a weapon you said if i moved youd kill me oh i said the healthclub keys but i dropped them along with my handbag how do you key somebody to death fran asked he put an arm around my shoulders and moved closer dont be so literal dont make threats you cant carry out without a pause he added very interesting your height is in your legs what you have very long legs he said which look good in shorts i noticed but all legs aside the point im trying to make is that when were sitting down our bodies are the same height see oh i said youre right so maybe we could meet in a cafe something elegant like flakey jakes or showtime pizza those arent elegant theyre fastfood restaurants look i dont have all the money in the world youll have to restrain your greedy impulses my what pay attention you can be seated looking lonely and romantic and ill come in and sit across from you and take your hand come on fran im trying to listen he just smiled see how it works we can both be sitting down the whole time and relative heights wont matter what about when we leave one of us will just have to leave before the other one it will be me i said ill arise still looking lonely and romantic and drift out of your life were losing something here he said let me think of another example i heard the whirr of the camera in the corner as it swept the room in a few seconds the telephone in the office began to ring i know just who that is i said and ran toward the office turning on the light i was right what happened to you liz tina asked i knew you were scared so i kept you on camera you turned off the lights but you didnt leave the room are you still testing your subconscious minds resistance to the dark something like that i said well after this warn me she said i got worried about you and i couldnt leave the camera because lamars on duty checking the bar im sorry i said you were right she said hes married lamar no the guy with red hair there was another cute one though broad shoulders brown hair if hes still here tomorrow ill take a look at his card tina hung up lets go i said to fran we locked up and headed for the employee checkout lamar was there chatting with his assistant at the desk he was leaning casually against the wall although he managed to give the impression of being ready to spring into action i dont know how he did it maybe it was the way he made his eyes into slits and looked at us down the end of his nose we may soon have to insist on body searches lamar said i think that would be illegal fran told him illegal lamar straightened and glared down at fran were talking about major theft and youre bringing up trivia but there are laws protecting human rights lamar sighed human with the amount of stuff being snatched out of this hotel it couldnt be done by any human hmmm fran said trained dogs lamar gave fran a withering look that would have made glint eastwood jealous this is serious business he said yesterday someone made it out of here with an antique silver tray a waterford vase from the presidential suite fourteen boxes of brie cheese and five standing rib roasts this is the only employee exit to the hotel now you tell me how the thief managed it maybe he threw everything out of a window fran said a waterford vase lamar sneered besides the hotel is designed for airconditioning none of the windows open then maybe he just walked out the front door no way one of my assistants is at the front door at all limes fran rubbed his chin and his eyes began to gleam i could tell he was enjoying matching his wits against the thiefs maybe the guests are stealing the things you talked about guests do a lot of stealing thats true lamar said but we can tell when the thief is a guest and when its an employee because guests will steal from their own rooms or restaurant tables employees steal from places the guests dont go suppose the thief disguised himself dressed like a guest and walked out with a suitcase full of stuff it wouldnt work lamar said remember our photoid cards wed spot anyone who didnt match one of the cards okay then fran said this guys got an accomplice they meet in the bar and he passes the stuff to him or maybe its a her nope lamar said my scrutinizing systems too good to let that one go by fran thought so hard his forehead wrinkled finally he said let me work on it ill come up with something sure you will lamar said you ready to check out of here yes i stepped forward lamar carefully examined my plastic handbag although it was obvious there was nothing in it but a very thin wallet a lipstick a comb and my car keys i walked through the metal detector which remained silent it wouldnt be possible to sneak anything out under my pink healthclub tshirt and shorts but lamar scowled at me as though id managed to pull a fast one fran sauntered through and again the detector was silent so we said goodnight to lamar and left the hotel the evening is early fran said as we walked toward my car want to meet somewhere for a coke fran its eleventhirty that is not early its all in the point of view fran said besides how can we go home and sleep knowing that while we are secure in our beds a thief is robbing the ridley hotel and sneaking out through a secret exit unknown to our vigilant chief of security secret exit i abruptly stopped gasped and clutched frans arm what where whats the matter his head twisted from side to side as he tried to take in the entire parking lot i didnt see anything i thought of something dont think so violently think gently when you bugged out your eyes and made a kind of fish noise you scared me i thought something was creeping up on us stop trying to be funny and listen to me i said there is a secret exit from the hotel remember when i told you that somebody in the pool had sneaked in and it scared me well i found the way he got in theres a onefoot gap where two walls dont meet but theyre covered with vines so the gap cant be seen frans eyes widened show me lets tell lamar first i can show both of you we walked back to the employee entrance lamar was still there talking to the guard behind the desk in a rush of words i told lamar about the wall for a few moments he contemplated what i had said and as he thought he became even more of a tall straight line well check it out he told us although im looking at one flaw and one distinct impossibility youre talking about liz and me right fran asked lamar stared down his nose at fran as though he were something hed found on his shoe come with me he answered well take a look he picked up the healthclub keys and a flashlight from the desk and strode briskly down the hall across the side lobby and into the hall leading to the health club fran and i trotted after him trying to keep up first lamar tried the door but it was locked just as i had left it he opened it and went inside fran and i were right on his heels literally because it was dark lamar suddenly stopped and we smashed into him ouch he said wheres the light switch they didnt put it near the door i said the switches are all inside the office by this lime our eyes were becoming adjusted to the darkness it helped that a large moon had turned the outside section of the pool into a frosted mirror we could see the shapes of the tables and chairs and each other the limbs and leaves of the large potted plants and trees jutted out in every direction as though they were doing a crazy dance i moved a little closer to fran and took his hand lamar gave a couple of hops as he pulled up the back of his left shoe which i had unfortunately stepped on he strode to the door of the healthclub office tried the door then fiddled with the keys until he found the one that unlocked it while i stared into the glimmering black water of the indoor section of the pool and the puddled tiles near my feet i got that peculiar uncomfortable feeling that something was wrong but what it was i didnt know the office door swung open and in an instant the indoor and outdoor lights flashed on there was no one in the pool of course there wouldnt be wheres this gap in the walls lamar asked we pushed open the door in the glass divider wall to get outside propping it open so it wouldnt close and lock us out we circled the far end of the pool with his flashlight lamar led the way following my directions he pulled back the vines and swept his light over the wall and the surrounding area he focused on the spongy humusearth mixture near the wall plenty of footprints he said this soft earth is good for prints some of them might be mine i told him yep he answered those narrow size nine with the herringbone imprint lets see the bottom of your tennis shoes i wished he hadnt been so explicit i held up one foot and he nodded okay he said lets go back inside and ill go over my findings what findings fran asked all we came up with was a gap between two walls and not a very big one at that big enough for someone to squeeze through i said art mart was probably right it must have been a kid fran said lamar didnt answer he just strode back to the inside section of the health club looking as controlled as ever even struggling through the shrubbery hadnt put a wrinkle in his suit although i had to pull a few more leaves out of my hair and tug my tshirt back into place he locked the glass door and turned to us all right this is what we found although there were no complete footprints we could see a number of fresh partial ones between the walls were adultsized shoeprints heading toward the pool and part of a bare footprint on top of one of them heading out which tells us that someone had entered wearing shoes but had taken them off before returning oh i interrupted he took off his shoes and dived into the pool thats when we saw each other so he swam back and got out of there in a hurry not waiting to put his shoes back on again and it wasnt a kid fran said thats right lamar told him fran rubbed his hands together i could tell he was getting excited there were a number of prints so we can tell that the guys been here before he sneaks in robs the hotel then sneaks out with the stuff the same way wrong lamar said he could get into the pool area but theres no way he could get from there into the main part of the hotel the door would be locked i told him and for that matter so would the door into the healthclub office the office door could be jimmied lamar said which is the flaw i spoke of the door into the hotel however has a deadbolt type of lock and it couldnt be opened without a key thats the impossibility i mentioned youre very clever i was really impressed lamars eyes narrowed and his upper lip curled modestly glint eastwood would have loved this expression its my job lamar said he walked into the office turned out all the lights and locked the office door wait a minute fran said what does all this mean that somebody just wanted a swim lamar said could there be something in the office this guy was after theres nothing valuable in there i told him except the equipment its heavy and its too big to get through anything but a fullsized door forget it lamar said and put a move on ive got other things to do here and your parents are going to start wondering why you didnt get home on time he locked the main door behind us and handed me the keys turn these in when you leave ive got to do another bar check lamar strode off but i turned to fran somethings bothering me probably your conscience have you changed your mind about meeting me for a coke be serious and be quiet im trying to think i spoke aloud the pool the pool the water in the pool the puddles on the tiles i stared at fran thats ill the water on the tiles it shouldnt have been there go on fran said and i was glad that he was paying attention and not trying to be funny what im saying is that my last job is to put the club in order i put away used towels throw out the used soap in the showers toss away paper cups and napkins and rubbish people leave around and do a lastminute inspection around the pool usually there arent many people at the pool during the last hour and the puddles on the tiles drain and dry fast by the time i leave those tiles dont even have wet footprints on them and i could swear there were no puddles on the tiles when i locked up tonight but when we went back there with lamar i noticed water on the tiles near where we were standing can we go back and look again i nodded lets hurry we unlocked the door to the pool area once inside the room we kept our backs to the door breathing in the smell of warm chlorine and jungle dampness until our eyes became accustomed to the darkness no ones here now fran whispered that is i cant see anyone except us as fast as possible i scurried to the office door fumbled the keys and finally got it open i stepped inside and turned on the lights fran was standing outside the office door staring at a spot on the tiles around the pool right over there he said and pointed yes someone used the pool to sneak in here i looked at the puddle of water that dripped across the tiles automatically fran and i moved forward following it it slopped abruptly in front of one of the large potted ficus trees what happened to him fran murmured he couldnt just dissolve he had to go somewhere i held my breath as i slowly looked upward into the slender branches over our heads no one was there if someone had been looking back at me i think i would have fainted or screamed or maybe fallen in the pool and drowned i was that frightened fran wasnt any braver as he felt around the lop of the big brass planter i could see his fingers tremble funny he said his voice cracked and he started over speaking a little more slowly and a little deeper its funny but its damp right here and around the trunk of the tree in this one spot i put my hand where he showed me its like someone took hold of the trunk of the tree fran let out a long sigh maybe weve come across some kind of a relay tag race that involves diving into the pool climbing out touching the tree diving in again and oh well its an idea not a very good one have you got a better one the telephone in the office rang and i jumped straight up in the air i ran to answer and it was tina your mother called from dallas and because the club is officially closed the switchboard referred the call to me she was all excited because you hadnt got home yet anyhow i saw you on camera with lamar so i told her you were helping the chief of security on a special project and would be home in half an hour what are you doing in the health club fran and i were investigating a puddle there are better things to do with your spare time youd better get on home right away and call your mother i thought you were off duty i said i will be as soon as harvey gets here for his shift he forgot to get his car inspected and had to take a bus thanks for covering for me tina i said see you tomorrow i turned off the lights and locked the office door fran and i left the club and the hotel and the parking lot the latter only after i convinced fran i didnt want to go somewhere for a cocacola have you ever heard of the theory of relativity fran asked of course einstein but i dont understand it very few people do fran said sometime ill explain it to you it has to do with height no it doesnt yes it does you said you didnt understand it and you were right basically when you get past all the equations it boils down to the fact that if two people like each other relative heights between them are meaningless good night fran i said ill see you tomorrow i couldnt imagine why but i was looking forward to it with gusto and flair i conducted the most dramatic part of wagners ride of the valkynes as i drove home as soon as i got inside the house i called mom at their hotel in dallas she was still wide awake im fine i said i just wanted to make sure mom said you dont need to worry about me oh darling i wouldnt not for a minute mom answered then began a list of questions beginning with are you eating a nourishing breakfast and ending with are you sure youre fine i just had this strange shivery feeling that everything might not be quite all right relax mom things are okay i said i didnt tell mom that i was carrying around a strange shivery feeling too i arrived at the ridley the next afternoon at the same time as four men dressed in white duck jumpsuits a fifth man had backed a large van up to the double doors next to the employee entrance the men followed me into the hotel i planned to hold out my plastic handbag to be examined but i dropped it and as i suddenly stopped to pick it up one of the men fell over me im very sorry i said trying to help him up pick myself up and get a grip on my handbag at the same time no problem he grumbled and glared at me he was young and tall and kind of cute i smiled and started to say something casually friendly but its hard to be casually friendly to someone whos rubbing his elbow because it hurts and its all your fault so i let the whole thing drop and held my handbag out to the guard at the desk but the man who was carrying a clipboard leaned over the desk and said to the security guard somebody gotta sign this order form the managers always out for lunch at this time so ill get mr boudry for you the guard said and he pressed a couple of buttons will you please look at my handbag i asked the guard he took it and the man with the clipboard looked at it too whats so special about it he asked me ive seen betterlooking handbags than that its a security regulation i told him he shrugged you got tight security here absolutely i said the best the guard said he handed back my handbag just as lamar strode in lamar ignored me eagleeying the men in white uniforms as i left i heard one of them telling lamar we got orders to pick up two tenfoot sofas to be cleaned have you got enough authority to sign this i walked on to the health club through the side lobby glancing into the main lobby as i passed there were only two tenfoot sofas in the hotel and they were gorgeous and probably terribly expensive with handcarved mahogany framing coralandsilver brocade they didnt look as though they needed cleaning to me but hotel managers must know what theyre doing mr jones and mr kamara were seated as far from the pool area as they could get behind a large potted palm tree their plastic lounge chairs sagged under their weight as the men leaned close to each other mr kamara was wearing bathing trunks but mr jones was dressed in a wrinkled gray suit he was probably hot because his face was red and he kept rubbing at his forehead with a handkerchief with his other hand he kept batting away a palm tree frond that dipped low enough to tickle his head all that mopping and batting made him look like a wiggling gray spider but mr kamara wasnt the fly instead he looked as though he could eat mr jones with or without ketchup i couldnt tell what the two men were saying because the gurgling bubbling jacuzzi drowned out their words but each time mr kamara hit his fist on the arm of the lounge chair mr jones winced and shuddered liz i jumped as art mart yelled at me from the open office doorway youre five minutes late sorry it took only seconds to reach the office a large convention of insurance salesmen will be here for the next three days and theyve already started coming into the club so get with it will you id never seen him this grouchy but i didnt let his rudeness bother me what can you expect from someone like art not much im with it i told him on duty bright and cheerful he actually growled at me snatched his car keys out of the desk and said im off got stuff to do are you going to be back maybe yes maybe no but you said the club would be really busy so what i hired you because i thought you could do the job how smart do you have to be to pick up dirty towels if you dont think you can handle it just say so it would have given me a great deal of pleasure to tell him what i was thinking about him but i wanted to hang on to my job so i quietly said i can handle it without another word he strode out of the office i completed my check of the womens dressing room and sauna but there were guests in the mens section art was right the club was getting busy in a hurry i toured the pool area stopping to say hello to mrs bandini and mrs larabee and passed mr jones who was leaving the club goodbye i said cheerfully but he didnt seem to hear me he pushed through the door head down muttering to himself just as i sat at the desk tina popped into the office hi she said ready for what card file she handed me a stack of cards an inch thick here are the new ones and while youre busy filing them lets see if we cant find that goodlooking guys card whats his name i dont know but hes out there right now sunning himself hes already got a great tan i pulled the file from the side drawer and handed it to her here while i study the new ones you can look through the file and find his name while tina was busy with the file i checked in four guests mentally matched their faces to their cards handed them towels and smilingly said that i hoped they enjoyed their stay in the ridley health club as i went back to the desk tina snapped shut the lid of the file and looked puzzled so where is he who the guy with the brown hair his card isnt in here maybe he checked out no i told you hes out there sunning himself maybe the card was misfiled i went through the whole thing do you suppose hes not really a guest here we could ask security to check tina stood up and smiled im security remember and what a good excuse to start a conversation see you later she zipped out the doorway heading for the outside pool just as a small body dashed past her and cannonballed into the pool sending up a sheet of water tina jumped back glaring and muttering and snatched up a towel as she blotted the spots on her uniform she said this is your department yell at him kick him out have him arrested for impersonating a human being i had seen who it was pauly canelli ill be stern i said and marched to the side of the pool pauly had surfaced and was grinning at me i told you not to do that i said i forgot no you didnt what are you gonna do about it i put my fists on my hips and tried to look tough and mean out of the pool ill tell my grandma out he swam to the shallow end near to the chair in which his grandmother was enthroned i walked around the edge of the pool to meet him i noticed two men in business suits standing by the door to the hotel perhaps they were new guests i should find out but i had to take care of pauly first mrs bandini was all smiles as pauly ran to her she enfolded him in a large beach towel and beamed at me isnt he a lovely boy both of my grandchildren are such a joy to me she made me get out of the pool pauly whined mrs bandinis eyes grew wide why he was cannonballing people i said i told him not to mrs bandini chuckled i thought it was something important well pauly wont do it anymore will you pauly my love without waiting for his answer she said to him why dont you ring up room service and get something good to eat like a hamburger and milk shake and later you can go back in the pool if liz says you can and im sure she will its okay i mumbled wishing i had handled things better as pauly ran to the house phone mrs bandini confided hes so much like his big brother eric was at that age so full of life and fun and mischief i just smiled back what could i say i cant wait until you and eric meet each other mrs bandini added as far as i was concerned i hoped that day would never come i glanced at the door and saw that the two men in business suits were still there they were both about my height and stocky they were old enough to have jowls and the darkhaired one could have used a shampoo excuse me i said to mrs bandini and walked toward the guests may i help you i asked them no the greasyhaired one said but the other nudged him maybe he said there was a guy who left here a little while ago kind of skinny and stooped wearing a gray suit the first man added they had to mean mr jones but i didnt see any reason to answer their questions i didnt know who they were i just stared at them until greasy said you know who were talking about are you guests of the ridley hotel whats that got to do with anything do you know the guys name or dont you im sorry but this club is for hotel guests and members only this guy in the gray suit did he meet anybody here ill have to ask you to leave the health club if youre not hotel guests i said firmly are you going to answer our question greasy asked ive got a good idea i said ill call our chief of security you can ask him she doesnt know anything one man muttered to the other they gave one last look around the room and left i decided id better talk to someone in security and tina was closest she was perched on the edge of a lounge chair animatedly chatting with the man with the brown hair i opened the glass door and beckoned to her she nodded and stood up as i walked back to the office i noticed that mr kamara was accepting a tray from floyd their heads were together and mr kamara was complaining about something floyd looked unhappy i supposed from what id heard that mr kamara was awfully difficult to please he was such a predictable person always doing the same thing over and over some people really fall into ruts in their lives since coming to work at the health club id noticed that each afternoon around three oclock mr jones came to the health club chatted with mr kamara and left then about a half hour later mr kamara called room service for something to eat and floyd brought it in a little while mr kamara would go for another swim then leave the club during the late evening hours hed be back for another swim according to deeley mr kamara had a morning swim and mr jones usually joined him for coffee by the pool same dull pattern every day didnt he ever want to do something more interesting tina joined me in the office his name is kurt quentin fraiser hes from new jersey and hes here on computer business but all he can talk about is how much he hates houston and how dangerous the city is which shows a decided lack of social perception and ability to relate to the inner needs of others why does he feel so horrible about houston his wallet got lifted while he was out with some business associates last night you told me that happened to a lot of the guests here i know but they cant blame the ridley because it doesnt happen at the hotel and they shouldnt blame houston because pickpockets are at work in every city of the world did he call the police of course and had to go through all the work of informing creditcard companies which is a big nuisance which reminds me speaking of cards if hes going to be here all week then what about his card it should be tina i interrupted listen for a minute there were two men here asking questions about mr jones and who he was and if he met anyone here they didnt belong here i think you should find out what theyre up to immediately tina was all business what did they look like give me a good description i thought hard trying to remember their faces they were about soso tall one was kind of yucky the other was a greaseball tina rolled her eyes color eyes color hair what were they wearing oh i said and told her what little i could remember she immediately trotted toward the hotel a woman poked her head in the doorway my little girl dropped her doll in the pool she said if i dive for it ill rum my hair can you fish it out certainly i told her i look the long pole with the round taut net and followed her to the shallow end of the pool it took just a few minutes to fish out the doll the little girl grabbed her baby and hugged it say thankyou her mother said but the child turned and ran away her mother strolled after her some children have no manners mrs bandini clucked i saw some leaves floating at the side of the pool so i used the net to fish them out when its windy the leaves from outside fall into the pool mrs larabee said wait till its windy youll get a lot of work fishing out leaves i looked up at the ficus tree nearby the trees in here dont seem to drop many of their leaves mrs bandini and mrs larabee chuckled as though they shared a great joke thats because the ficus trees arent real mrs bandini said i reached out and touched the trees trunk it feels real oh the trunk and branches are from a real tree thats what makes them look like theyre live ficus trees but if you look closely you can see that the leaves are silk and glued on mrs larabee looked smug most people would think what you thought but we know better i glanced around at the other plants are the others fake too dont say fake mrs bandini leaned forward her voice barely above a whisper fake is for cheap plants say artificial it has more quality and believe me you couldnt touch these ficus trees for under apiece the other plants are real mrs larabee said but ficus are hard to grow inside and they make a terrible mess with leaves all over the place so thats why these are artificial i had my mouth open to ask another question but tina suddenly burst through the hotel door and loped to where i was standing liz she said the manager is furious and lamar is furious and youre a witness a witness to what to the thieves she said a couple of hours ago someone stole two of the hotels valuable antique sofas i have never been ordered to march myself to the principals office but i could always imagine how horrifying the experience must be being sent to the ridley hotel managers office was just as terrifying i mentally practiced what i would do and say i would smile graciously charmingly and introduce myself with dignity after all what was i so scared of i hadnt done anything as i entered the office three men slowly rose and stared at me the office was large enough to have a sofaandchairsconversation grouping at one end and a desk at the other the walls and upholstery were in blues and corals and grays all brightened by the glass windowwall at one side a huge bouquet of real flowers was at one end of the desk and another bouquet on the coffee table in front of the sofa the flower tones mirrored the soft room colors so did one of the men he wore a light wool gray suit with a coralandgraystriped lie i assumed he was the manager so i said im mary elizabeth rafferty sir i held out a hand and took a large step forward banging my shin into the coffee table and toppling the small vase of flowers deftly i caught them righted them and held out my hand again he didnt shake my hand he just made an impatient motion as though i were a fly hed like to shoo away and sat down the other two men immediately sat down nobody asked me but i sat down too you know mr boudry the manager said and this is detective jarvis from the houston police department i nodded to lamar whose solemn facial expression didnt change and to the detective who didnt seem to fit either in the chair or in the darkblue suit he was wearing his shoulders were as broad as a football players and what was left of his hair was sunbleached im sorry but no one has ever told me your name i said to the manager i am mr lewis parmegan he said how do you do mr parmegan im mary eli so i have been informed he said i have also been informed that you arrived at the ridley at the same time as the men who came to pick up the sofas his eyes darted like little spears in lamars direction a muscle in lamars chin twitched he must have been terribly upset they claimed they had an order to clean the sofas i said i dont understand what happened did someone steal the sofas from them detective jarvis leaned toward me it was a bogus operation he said the men who took the sofas simply posed as cleaners they had no order to clean the sofas they used the trick to steal them thats awful i said can you give us descriptions of the men he asked i leaned back in my chair and thought a moment yes i said i didnt pay much attention to the driver of the truck so i cant tell you anything about him there were four men who came inside the hotel with me two were just hohum one was kind of a yuck and the other was about an eight detective jarvis looked up from the pad he had balanced on his knee and licked the end of his pencil what does that mean be specific lamar snapped like color of hair and that kind of stuff exactly i wish fran had been with me he probably would have remembered i had to think hard okay two of the men were the kind who show up in a group picture at a company picnic and somebody says who are those guys only nobody remembers that they were even there at all thats what they looked like mr parmegan gave a sigh height weight the same they all stared at me and i added i mean whod notice kind of average the detective shifted and his chair creaked how about the other two anything you could identify about them lets see the man with the clipboard he was kind of a dandruffy type with a moustache that should have been sent to the cleaners jowls too what color moustache detective jarvis asked dirty he just looked at me so i tried to elaborate maybe browndirty i cant remember anything else he was the yuck i said how about the fourth man hes the eight right mr parmegan shook his head wait a minute we established there were only four inside the building not eight eight meaning on a scale of one to ten i told him i was getting warmed up now he was about six one with sandy hair that curled up just a smidgen where it was long on his neck and a dimple in the middle of his chin and blue eyes and broad shoulders and his ears were just a little bit pointy which was kind of cute weight detective jarvis was writing as fast as he could perfect lamar scowled at me we are asking for specifics specifically i couldnt tell you i didnt weigh him i just fell under him detective jarvis looked as puzzled as mr parmegan so i hurried to explain what had happened just what did you hear the men say the detective asked so i told him what i remembered did you see mr boudry sign the order form the manager was glaring at lamar as though the whole thing were lamars fault i felt sorry for him i said no i didnt thank you miss rafferty you may go now the manager said but i wasnt ready to go dont blame mr boudry i said the men couldnt have stolen the sofas if mr parmegan didnt leave for lunch at the exact same time every day what mr parmegans mouth popped open and stayed open sure i said their plan wouldnt work if mr parmegan had been available they had to know he wouldnt be on hand id guess that somebody in the hotel who knew mr parmegans schedule worked it all out detective jarvis licked his pencil point again and smiled at me good thinking he said but mr parmegan scowled at mr boudry so hard that his forehead almost met the end of his nose and his words peppered the room like bb shot mr boudry is one of those who know my daily schedule so does nearly everyone who works at the ridley lamar answered especially mr parmegan i added thanks for your help mary elizabeth detective jarvis said we may want you to look at some mug shots later but for now you can get back to work again i thought about that gap in the walls outside the pool area there didnt seem much point in telling detective jarvis since the gap had nothing to do with the theft of the sofas so i kept my mouth shut lamar and mr parmegan didnt notice when i left the office they were too busy studying each other with deep suspicion i hurried back to the health club since we didnt have a lifeguard it wasnt mandatory that someone be on duty every single minute but the guests liked it better if one of us was there to smile at them and hand them a towel as they checked in and lamar liked it better if we checked names and faces with the photoid cards and made sure that no one sneaked in but i hadnt needed to worry art mart was slouched down in the desk chair admiring his long muscular legs which were stretched out in front of him he barely glanced up as i came into the office look im sorry i had to be gone but it wasnt my fault i began art just slammed his chair upright and snapped i know where you were do you know what happened of course i know everybody in the hotel knows by this time oh i said art gave a wicked chuckle and they even got the security chief to sign for it thats terrific i dont think its so funny i said lamar is very embarrassed about it for the first lime arts eyes met mine he should be embarrassed for all any of us know he was in on it no i dont believe that he slowly stood up and stretched rippling all the way down i wasnt impressed mrs zellendorfs cat can do the same thing now that youre here you can take over he said im off and wont be back until tomorrow am okay dont forget to clean the tiles and pick up the towels he said i had to clamp my teeth together until they hurt to keep from reminding him that i hadnt forgot yet and he knew it he sauntered from the indoor pool area toward the hotel stopping to smile and ripple at two goodlooking women who were lounging near the jacuzzi mr kamara passed him on his way to the pool they said something to each other and i could practically see sparks what was the matter with art he was always preaching to me about keeping the hotel guests happy mr kamara growled something and bellyflopped into the water swimming back and forth back and forth without stopping or paying any more attention to art who wheeled and stomped out of the club as though he were trying to make dents in the floor for the moment the club was fairly quiet pauly was stuffing his face at a table near the pool but his grandmother and mrs larabee were nowhere in sight i checked and tidied the womens dressing area and opened the door of the sauna there sat mrs bandini and mrs larabee the steam swirling around them mrs larabee was wearing her black racer bathing suit but mrs bandini was wrapped in a towel with soggy blue tennis shoes on her feet she smiled at me from under a bouffant plastic shower cap come in come in and shut the door she said as though she were in her own kitchen tell us what happened i shut the door but the steam made my eyes water some thieves claiming to be from a cleaning company took the two big sofas in the lobby only they werent from a cleaning company they stole them my stars mrs bandini turned to mrs larabee those beautiful silverandcream sofas imagine that theyre not silver and cream theyre goldish and pinkish mrs larabee said silver and cream but does it matter what color were talking about the fact that theyre stolen if theyre stolen they have to identify them and how can they identify them if they dont know what color they are i mumbled something and burned out of the sauna strands of my hair were already beginning to damply plaster themselves on my ears and cheeks i strolled back to the desk with no immediate jobs to lake care of i could go through the photoid cards again the cards were alphabetized when they were put into the file box i made a little song in my head about the last names as i mentally recorded them with the photos i was looking at durstan efiendale ender fallen fox fraiser garnett fraiser i went back to his card kurt quentin fraiser a goodlooking guy with brown hair i thought tina had said his card wasnt in here i picked up the phone and rang the security office yo lamar answered this is liz is tina there whats wrong nothing i just need to ask tina about one of the photoid cards something wrong with the card no you want to tell tina about some goodlooking dude well do it when youre both off duty but i also want to ask her about two guys who lamar had cut the connection so i sighed and hung up too once again marveling at how much he knew he was really a good chief of security and it wasnt fair that mr parmegan was blaming him for the sofas being stolen i leaned my chin on my hands and my elbows on the desk gazing out the window between my desk and the pool and trying to think something was peculiar about those photoid cards but what was it i couldnt zero in on the problem because of pauly canelli the precrowd club seemed peaceful even the fake uh artificial trees looked drowsy two women were snoozing next to the pool their towels pulled over them like blankets and mr kamara was chugging a wake back and forth across the pool as regular as a windup boat but pauly wasnt peaceful he had finished his gigantic snack and was obviously bored and looking for something interesting to do i watched his eyes widen and his lips stretch into a wicked grin as he spotted the pair of sleeping women and it wasnt hard to tell what he had in mind he slowly got up from his chair peeled off the tshirt hed been wearing and began an exaggerated tiptoe toward the women i slid out of my chair and zipped to the office doorway by the time i reached it he was already crouching into the cannonball position pauly canelli i yelled dont you dare my shout startled pauly instead of stepping back and behaving himself without looking or caring he flung his round tight little cannonball body smack into the pool and smack on top of mr kamara who sank straight to the bottom i felt as though i were in a slowmotion movie i ran to the edge of the pool tugging off my shoes and flinging them aside then dived it seemed to lake forever because while i was doing this my eyes were on mr kamara he didnt move obviously pauly had knocked him out my momentum carried me across the pool in a matter of seconds i grabbed mr kamaras chin with both hands and pushed hard against the bottom of the pool we rose to the top and i flipped on my side one of my arms was under his chin i used the other in a side stroke to help propel us to shallow water both of the women who had been paulys targets were already in the water they helped me pull mr kamara from the pool mr kamara helped too by this time he was choking and sputtering and conscious again he sat on the edge of the pool and rubbed his head ill call a doctor i said no a doctor not necessary he said i didnt mean to jump on you pauly said his voice quivering he reminded me of the hugeeyed lemurs in the nightanimal section of the zoo that is what happened mr kamara asked he stared at pauly and mumbled something in his native tongue i didnt ask for a translation his tone of voice told me all i needed to know paulys lower lip curled out its her fault he said pointing at me she yelled at me and scared me thats why i didnt see you one of the women said what a rude little boy i heard her tell you earlier not to splash water on people thats what you were planning to do to us wasnt it the other woman pointed at me and said to mr kamara she dived right in and pulled you out thank you he said to me thank them too i answered smiling at the women they helped me mr kamara struggled to his feet and staggered over to the chair on which his robe was neatly folded and hung he pulled on his robe and stepped into his thongs are you sure youre all right i asked him yes all right i turned to pauly brushing back the dripping hair from my eyes as for you i am not going to allow you back in the pool for the rest of the day not all his fault mr kamara said he put a hand on paulys shoulder too much to think about i not pay attention is something wrong mr kamara can i do anything to help for a long moment he looked at me and i saw something bicker in his eyes i wouldnt have been surprised if a light bulb had appeared over his head like in the old cartoon shows he gave a little bow and grinned but oddly the grin seemed to be more for himself than for me ah yes you can help he tugged his robe more tightly around himself turned sharply and wobbled from the pool area to the door to the hotel i wished i could take back my words i wished that i could call out wait mr kamara i didnt mean it for just an instant before he turned away i had glimpsed an almost evil expression of triumph on his face i didnt know what plan mr kamara had in mind but i was sure i was going to regret being any part of it mrs bandini apologized over and over again for paulys actions when he complained that i had ordered him out of the pool for the rest of the day she said i was perfectly right and by pure coincidence it was time they were getting home anyway pauly made a face at me as they left i changed to an extra pair of pink shorts and a club tshirt which fortunately i kept in my locker wrote out a detailed report in the days log and called lamar to tell him what had happened im a little worried about mr kamara i said ill check on him he told me you were right to inform me lamar seemed to be calm and controlled again i was glad he wasnt still so upset for a fun health club in a relaxing restful hotel we were pretty far off base i had no sooner put down the desk telephone than detective jarvis called mr parmegan told me your working hours he said could you make it downtown to the police station tomorrow morning to look at mug shots sure i said what time how about nine oclock just tell me how to get there do you have a car old junk bucket i guess you could call it a car he gave me directions to the hpd main station on riesner and i carefully wrote them down i wished i could talk to tina i wished i could talk to fran i wished i could switch the hotels pipedin music to station klef id feel a lot better if i could conduct an orchestra through an entire symphony a symphony is so beautifully orderly no klutzy people or stupid mistakes or deep black swimming pools the pools in a symphony are bright spots of sound that trill or call or beat or blast or soar each of them different each of them woven together by a conductor with a baton none of my wishes came true instead more people than id ever seen in the health club began to straggle in it was all i could do to unobtrusively check id cards and hand out towels and smiles they must have been with the big convention art mart had told me about meetings were over and they were ready to relax finally for a few moments the office was empty i glanced through the window and surveyed the indoor section of the health club the jacuzzi was loaded a ring of heads and shoulders encircled the bubbles reminding me of one of those battery games in which a ring offish keep opening and closing their mouths and you have to try to catch them just beyond the jacuzzi fran was delivering a tray of drinks to four hairychested potbellied men fran i had to catch him i tugged down the back of my pink shorts and sauntered from the office smiling and surveying and trying to look both official and efficient as i passed fran i murmured we need to get together he straightened and beamed at me i knew youd eventually be attracted to me i felt myself blushing knowing hed been overheard one of the men whod been lazily scratching his chest stopped and studied me be quiet fran i said thats not what i meant i just have to talk to you about about well you know what but of course fran answered trying to look mysterious the usual time the usual place he swung his empty tray to his shoulder picked up the signed check and walked briskly toward the door to the hotel excuse me i said to the row of assorted eyes at the table nervously i stepped back and skidded in a puddle of water i reached out grabbing at anything to keep from falling and found myself gripping the slender trunk of a fake ficus tree the ficus and i spun clockwise but i managed to stay on my feet i caught my balance brushed myself off nonchalantly as though i performed this trick every day and stared hard at the tree it had turned with me i know it had yet the base of the tree with its level layer of wooden chips looked undisturbed i tried to pick up one of the chips but it was glued in place well of course it would be the whole thing was fake wasnt it embarrassed by my clumsiness and as red as those misguided lobsters sunning overlong around the outside section of the pool i dutifully walked my beat around the pool outside and in then dashed into the office to catch the telephone youve got a crowd this afternoon tina said oh tina im glad you called what did you find out about those men who had been in the club nothing she said i couldnt find them they left in an awful hurry i said that should prove they didnt belong here that and the fact that their faces werent on any of the cards dont try to make a mystery out of them tina gave a loud yawn a lot of strange people wander in and out of a hotel but they asked nosy questions about mr jones shouldnt we do something about it theres nothing to do except i guess if you see them again let me know right away did lamar tell you that i tried to reach you earlier no anything important yes i said that guys card that kurt quentin fraiser its back in the file forget him tina said i have but tina ive been thinking about it tina said theres no point in wasting time flirting with men from out of town its an exercise in frustration and could eventually lead to a lower selfimage if im not careful i need a really positive selfimage tina im tired of being a poor nobody tina said and its hard waiting to be rich and famous did i tell you that im going to be famous too probably i said of course if anyone really super comes in i might make an exception tina about the cards lamars coming back ive got to lour the lobby talk to you later tina said and hung up i stared at the telephone for a couple of minutes if tina werent concerned about a card that was missing then wasnt maybe i shouldnt be either i couldnt help it the whole thing made me feel uncomfortable a second wave of guests came into the hotel as the first wave dressed and went out for late dinners very few people wanted to swim outside at this hour so the inside section of the pool was crowded with laughing splashing bodies just tidying up after all those people was a fulltime job and most of them couldnt read i mean people kept taking glasses into the jacuzzi even though right over their heads was a decorative sign asking them not to and one outofshape businessman after another bellyslapped the water right under the sign that said no diving in the pool please maybe whoever had painted the signs shouldnt have included the word please no one seemed to take the rules seriously by eleven oclock when the last guests had been politely edged out of the club i had picked up at least two dozen towels from the floor and bench in front of the towel hamper and made a collection of items that had been left behind and could be claimed in the office two pairs of sunglasses a paperback romance novel four combs one funky earring and a very skimpy top of a bathing suit it was certainly small enough i could see how the owner could misplace it even when it was being worn fran came in one door of the office as i stepped through the other his hair was neatly combed and his smile was as bright as the bowl of daisies he thrust toward me thank you i said theyre beautiful and practically fresh too fran said the people in only had them two days before they checked out secondhand daisies bet you never heard of that before huh his smile didnt waver i put the bowl on the desk as he added where to sit down i said i thought we were going somewhere to talk we can talk right here as he sat in the extra office chair his shoulders slumped just a little his coat wrinkled and his cowlick sprang into action it was the most vivid case of disappointment id ever seen i sat across the desk from him and leaned forward keeping my voice low listen fran this is business important business i need to talk to you about the crimes going on at the hotel you need to talk to lamar not to me i shook my head no i dont have any real facts to give lamar just feelings i cant do much about your feelings ive tried for one thing i said some of the cards in the file are missing then they turn up again he blinked a couple of times thats a crime i dont know what it is its strange and it must mean something he continued to look puzzled so i said and then theres all the valuable stuff thats stolen from the hotel like the two sofas the sofas make the third thing those socalled cleaning men didnt take all the paintings and silver and stuff that lamar told us has been disappearing so weve got three crimes i dont see four dont forget the meat lamar said roasts and turkeys were disappearing from the kitchen for a few minutes fran closed his eyes nodded sagely and kept murmuring urnhum umhum while i wailed eagerly for what he would say finally he opened his eyes looked at me and said you realize that none of this makes a bit of sense but it has to i wailed how as far as we know the men who said they were from a cleaning company had never been seen in the hotel before thered be no way they could take the smaller valuables and if they walked into the kitchens and stole some of the roasts theyd certainly be seen by some of the chefs do you know how many people work in the ridley kitchens he picked up a pencil and tore a sheet of paper off the pad next to the telephone on it he drew three circles here are your crimes he said you can see that none of them is related to the others in any way i reached over and drew a fourth circle the circles now formed a crescent shape dont forget the photoid cards what kind of a crazy criminal would steal cards from the photoid file and then bring them back kurt quentin fraiser had his wallet stolen fran stood up leaned toward me so that our noses were almost touching and said who is quirt kenton fraiser and what has his wallet got to do with anything i leaned back and sighed i wish i knew his voice became soothing youve been working very hard today havent you dont patronize me fran of course not he said lets go somewhere and get ice cream and talk about quirk frentin kaisers wallet i want to go home good idea id like that he said do you have plenty of ice cream there i picked up the telephone and dialed the security office tina answered tina i said you told me that quirk uh kurt quentin fraiser had his wallet stolen who oh yeah i remember yes he did and his card was missing at the time was it it must have been so so what about the others whove had their wallets stolen by pickpockets what about their cards i dont know she said i havent checked on their cards then maybe wed better its all past tense i dont see how we can tina told me anyhow its past time for my shift to end and im leaving as soon as lamar gets back to the office why dont we just sleep on the idea and see if anything else develops thats just an excuse to get out of doing anything tonight i told her youre wrong she said sleeping on it is a valid way of allowing the subconscious mind to wrestle with a problem its been verified by countless researchers okay tina i said see you tomorrow afternoon i replaced the receiver and turned back to fran does it make sense now yes fran said youll be glad to know that ive stopped worrying about your mental condition i had to smile at him he looked like an elf that hoped he wouldnt be stepped on then why dont we get the ice cream i asked none of the icecream shops were open so we ended up buying two pints of double chocolate chip and a bag of plastic spoons in an allnight randalls supermarket we sat in frans car in the stores parking lot under an arc light that turned our lips purple ate the ice cream and talked we didnt talk about crime at the ridley we talked about ourselves fran had dreams too he told me how intensely he had wanted to be an international ski champion and how hard he had worked until three years ago when his family had moved from denver colorado to houston where the only deep snow comes on christmas cards you dont have to be tall to be a skiing champion fran said he looked off into space for a few minutes and a glob of ice cream fell from his spoon back into the carton i knew he was seeing himself soaring out over a ski jump in perfect harmony with the earth and the sky i told fran about my dream of conducting an orchestra he listened seriously and said that he could understand he wiggled over so that our shoulders touched he wiped a smudge of ice cream off my chin and with his spoon he scooped up a blob that had landed on my tshirt sorry i said i tend to be clumsy im always embarrassing myself dont be embarrassed he said youre beautiful enough to get away with a little clumsiness me beautiful of course fran said he took my empty ice cream carton tossed them both in the backseat put his arms around my shoulders and kissed me i liked his kiss i wanted to snuggle right into it obviously skiing was not the only thing that fran was good at but a message of reason kept poking me this wouldnt work i couldnt date a guy who was four inches shorter than me and what about my plan to hold out for what i wanted for the best if i let this go on fran would be hurt i squirmed all the way to the car door and reached behind my back for the handle its late i said mom might decide to call me again id better get home fran didnt say anything he just kept looking at me listen i said were friends okay i dont think we should let romance gel mixed up in our friendship if i were a few inches taller would you feel the same way what could i say that i have another dream that i know somewhere out there is a handsome guy who is so tall that ill have to look up to him please fran i murmured and wished with all my heart that fran could have been that guy he sat up a little straighter gave a shrug and said ill follow you home to make sure you get there all right thanks i said i dont live far from here i know he smiled we can do this again the icecream part that is sure i said and climbed out of his car why did life have to be so darned mixed up the next morning i was too busy to think about anything except getting to the police station on time i left old junk bucket in the parking lot hoping no one would think he was evidence in an accident case and low him away i had dressed in a lightblue tailored shin and denim skirl hoping to look so dignified that no one would mistake me for a criminal i had never been to a police station and i suppose that i expected a scene out of one of the television cop shows but inside the building everything was orderly some welldressed people carrying briefcases strode briskly through the small lobby and down corridors as though they knew exactly where they were going and had a great deal of work to get done a few people not so well dressed who didnt seem to know their destinations were directed by a guard at an information booth i quickly looked around but no one was dragging in a screaming junkie and nobody was yelling threats at anyone else id have to remember to tell fran that this was nothing like the shows on tv someone came up beside me and i heard the deep voice of detective jarvis youre right on lime mary elizabeth he said come upstairs with me we stepped into an elevator with two men dressed in paintsplattered overalls and caps and a woman who looked like an ad in business journal she gave me a sharp speculative glance over the top rim of her glasses it made me feel peculiar so i leaned toward her im not being arrested i whispered the men grinned at me bueno one of them said but the woman narrowed her eyes and pulled back behind her glasses the way a turtle pulls back inside his shell i died until the elevator door opened watch your step detective jarvis said leading the way from the elevator i stumbled into the hallway after him he took me into a room in which a number of large scrapbooks were piled on a long wooden table he pulled back a plasticandchrome chair its legs squeaking against the linoleumcovered floor sit here he said and carefully go through these books see if you recognize any of the faces ive got a couple of things to do and ill be back in a few minutes he walked out into the hall leaving the door wide open the books with their worn heavy covers smelled of stale cigarettes i squirmed into a more comfortable position on the chair opened the first book and plunged into a whirlpool effaces page after page effaces each of them was different yet pretty soon they all began to look alike how in the world would i ever be able to find or recognize the two faces i remembered from the sofa theft detective jarvis swung around the door frame leaning into the room anything yet no i answered stick with it he said did lamar boudry do this i asked yesterday did he find any of the guys well talk about it later i dont want to influence you so i went back to slowly turning pages one book after another i tried so hard but again all the faces began to blend together until i suddenly saw someone i knew i was so surprised that i let out a yelp immediately detective jarvis was back in the room he walked behind me and stared down at the book got one he asked he sounded surprised i shook my head not one of the sofa thieves i told him jabbing a finger at one of the pictures but this man i know him i he comes to the health club every day his name is c l jones detective jarvis pulled up another small chrome chair and sat in it spilling over on both sides he looked at the picture and at me with a strange expression on his face c l jones you say he paused and i asked is something the matter it is to mr jones he said early this morning someone walking through a field off highway found the remains of a car that had been on fire inside the car was what was left of a body one license plate on the car was intact so from that we traced the cars owner he paused ran his tongue over his teeth and shifted his weight so that the chair cracked and creaked before he added we think that the body in the car is the man you call mr c l jones judging from the automobile tracks leading from the highway into the field detective jarvis said it looked to the officer who wrote up the report that the driver had been speeding hit a tree and the car exploded however because of mr joness past record were investigating other possibilities what other possibilities could there be i thought a moment and shivered except for murder stay put detective jarvis told me ill be right back it didnt take long he soon returned carrying a folder he sat down again and opened the folder on the desk reading through it quickly suppose you tell me what you know about mr jones detective jarvis said is jones his real name just one of the many names he used you said he had a record what kind of a record theft burglary pickpocketing no armed robbery though couple of probated sentences three short prison terms early parole each time while jarvis took notes i told him everything i knew about mr jones which wasnt much just how he came to the health club a couple of times a day and met with mr kamara and how those two men had come asking about mr jones but i wouldnt tell them anything can you describe the men detective jarvis asked not very well one was a real nothing the other was a before picture in a shampoo commercial he sighed patiently and shook his head no good huh i asked okay ill try to remember the description i gave to tina both of them were about my height and kind of stocky jowly too one had black hair hes the one i called a greaseball both of them real minus types lets get away from your scale of masculine charm have you got any idea how old the men were he asked old i said he looked surprised sixty sixtyfive i didnt say ancient i meant maybe about forty you said they were wearing business suits what color dark maybe brown or blue or charcoal or whatever any identifying marks you mean like designer labels i mean on the men themselves tattoos moles birthmarks i thought hard then shook my head i would think that being greasy and incredibly ugly would be identifying marks detective jarvis closed his eyes for a moment then he said would you have recognized their photos if youd seen them in the books youve been looking through yes i said i think so then how about checking out the rest of the books how many more there two okay i said as long as i can get to work in time he stood shoving back his chair which seemed to be permanently dented im going to have to leave the building i have an appointment concerning another case if you see any pictures you recognize just tell the sergeant at the desk in the next room the plump guy with the gray hair he smiled at me youre probably getting hungry arent you ill send in a hamburger and milk shake for you chocolate okay great i said and then i got this scary thought is it jail food no he said its from the hamburger stand around the corner its cop food cop food that was almost as interesting it made the time go faster but it didnt help with the pictures finally i closed the last book looked at my watch and went to tell the sergeant his desk was a mess of papers and forms and even some photographs he nodded thanks for helping i wasnt much help i couldnt find any of the faces i was looking for never mind you gave us something to go on with the jones case i had to ask was la mar boudry able to identify any of the photos when he was in here yesterday the sergeant shook his head no he drew a blank too he picked up a stack of photographs and thumped their edges on the desk trying to get them aligned then he shoved them to the far right corner just next to me i automatically glanced down at the photo on top but youve found one of the men in the business suits no he looked puzzled i pointed to the man in the photograph he was wearing a hat but i would have recognized him anyway this man i said hes one of the two who came into the health club to ask about mr jones is that so he became very interested youre sure of that yes im sure very interesting very interesting indeed he reached for the phone and dialed why is it so interesting we suspect this perpetrator may have a tiein with a branch of the syndicate in miami he began talking to someone on the phone i looked at my watch i had to leave right this very minute and hope that traffic on the katy freeway was light so i could get to the ridley on time i hurried out of the room down the hall and managed to catch an open elevator fortunately i got to the hotel in time to change into my shorts and healthclub tshirt before three oclock i even had two minutes to spare so i quickly tidied up the womens dressing room when i returned to the office art mart had appeared he was sitting behind the desk his chin on his hands staring glumly into space guess what i asked its about time you got here he snapped and stood up im two minutes early ill give you a medal he pulled his car keys out of the desk and squeezed around me but guess what dont say guess what i hate it when people say guess what sorry i said so what is it i thought you didnt want me to he clamped his teeth together and almost growled i just said i didnt want to hear oh forget it have you got something im supposed to know or havent you i have i said i just came from the police station he looked startled were you able to id the thieves no i said but i saw idd somebody else mr jones you know the mr jones who comes every day to the club art leaned on the desk and stared at me what about mr jones at last i had an interested audience i showed mr joness picture to detective jarvis and detective jarvis told me they had found a burnedup car this morning and the car belonged to mr jones in fact there was a body in the car so they think that was probably mr jones art straightened up and whistled he looked kind of sick for a minute thats awful he said i nodded somebody ought to tell mr kamara about it i think that he and mr jones were friends whered you get that idea art asked well they were always talking together mr kamara isnt very friendly with anyone else mr kamara hasnt any friends art said i looked through the large glass window toward the inner pool as usual mrs bandini and mrs larabee were seated together pauly thank goodness was nowhere in sight just a few people were in the club at this time but i could see mr kamara in his favorite spot at the table behind the large potted palm tree theres mr kamara id better go and tell him i said youd better get to work art said the ladies dressing room needs straightening and naturally i cant go in there while guests are in the club deeleys still out sick thats right so get to work ill tell mr kamara i guess thats more proper after all youre the one in charge glad you noticed art said and left the office i would have known that deeley wasnt back without art marts mentioning it the desk hadnt been straightened it looked just the way i had left it even the note paper with the four circles on it lay next to the pad as i looked at those circles again an idea wiggled so deeply in my mind that i couldnt catch it there was something about those four circles in that crescent shape but what no matter how hard i tried the idea wouldnt come i couldnt just stand there trying to catch an idea i had work to do so i went straight to the dressing room then realized that i had tidied it when i changed clothes here a few minutes ago i strolled back through the office and stood in the doorway surveying the pool area art had gone mr kamara was nowhere in sight mrs bandini called to me and gestured wildly with both arms so i walked over to join her and mrs larabee what is going on she asked in a stage whisper loud enough to be heard in the hotel we are not ones to eavesdrop mrs larabee said but there was a commotion we couldnt miss going on behind the potted palm i glanced in the direction of the palm it was where mr kamara had been sitting what kind of commotion i asked mrs bandini lit up mr martin came and said something to mr kamara that part we missed then mr kamara dropped his coffee cup with a crash and shouted something in his own language which we are not familiar with and mr martin told him to calm down but it took him a while she stopped for breath and mrs larabee took up the story naturally we wanted to see if we could help so we got up and looked around the palm and mr kamaras face was kind of green i spoke right up and asked if i could get him a glass of water or something and he shouted at me we dont know what he shouted mrs bandini said but his lone of voice left nothing to our imaginations we have rarely been so insulted mrs larabee said she folded her hands primly in her lap and looked indignant mrs bandini didnt waste time with attitudes she leaned forward and said so he marched right out of here and mr martin left too and we thought maybe you could tell us what was going on i pulled up a chair and sat down the only other guests in the club at this time were outdoors catching some rays nobody needed my assistance at this moment i knew mr kamara would be upset when he heard the news what news they asked in unison the news about mr c l jones i thought id have to explain who mr jones was but they both knew mrs larabee nodded and mrs bandini said that weasely little man who chats with mr kamara every day yes i said i told art mart uh mr martin that mr kamara would be upset he didnt think so but i was right upset about what mrs larabee asked this morning the police found a car that had burned during the night it was off highway one license plate was intact so they traced the owner of the car it was mr joness car they also found what was left of a body inside the car they think it might be mr jones for about ten seconds mrs bandini closed her eyes and murmured a very short prayer mrs larabee tried to look pious then they began talking at once how did you find out how can they tell if its mr jones was it murder how come we didnt see it on tv news poor mr kamara if they were friends it must have been a terrible shock finally mrs bandini put a restraining hand on mrs larabees arm scooted forward so that our faces were almost touching and said mary elizabeth tell us the whole story so i did all about the police station and the mug shots and everything if he wanted a complete description of the men in the business suits your detective should have asked us mrs bandini said you saw the men you can remember them of course she said they came into the club right after i mentioned to you how very much you and my tall handsome grandson eric canelli would like each other and then you walked toward the door so we watched you and saw the men as a matter of fact the shorter one with the mole on the side of his face was wearing a pinstriped charcoal louis roth suit like the one my soninlaw jerry bought at a sale at sakowitz just last month i commented upon it at the time didnt i distinctly mrs larabee said and i remember remarking that your soninlaw looks better in blue because of his complexion which tends to look sallow in the winter you saw jerry when he was trying to get over the flu mrs bandini said he was sick and rose was sick and it was a terrible week other than that week he never looks sallow would you like to talk to detective jarvis i asked them i know hed appreciate detailed descriptions of those men mrs larabee suddenly gasped oh my i just thought of something what if those men did something bad to mr jones what will happen if they find out we described them to the police mrs bandini managed to look both stern and noble at the same time it will keep them from doing terrible things to other people if we help to catch them of course mrs larabee said it was just a thought someone had to think of it so i did ill call detective jarvis right now i said i got up and turned to walk to the office but there was mr kamara scurrying toward me miss miss young lady he said and came to a stop right under my nose mary elizabeth rafferty i said to him yes young lady you saved my life yesterday the way his eyes were drilling into mine made me embarrassed so i stammered thats okay it wasnt anything that sounded terrible so i quickly added i mean im glad i could pull you out in time and im sorry you got hurt but you dont have to thank me then i felt my neck and face turn a hot red because of course he hadnt thanked me while i was trying desperately to think of the right thing to say mr kamara gave a bow and pulled a small box from his pocket thrusting it at me please accept with my gratitude he said i took a step backward oh i cant oh yes you can mrs bandini said at least open the box and see whats in it mrs larabee said it looks like the kind of box they put jewelry in thank you mr kamara i said but as an employee of the hotel i should not accept a gift from you is there a rule mrs bandini asked me well no i said but it doesnt seem right is right mr kamara said after all you saved his life mrs larabee said youll hurt his feelings if you dont take his gift mr kamara your thanks are enough i said no he said stubbornly making little jabbing motions with the box in my direction you take i think you are hurting his feelings mrs bandini said you should accept it maybe you wont even like it but what could it hurt you to take it and say thankyou and let the poor man feel better you can see how upset he is that i could see and i was feeling sorrier for him by the minute so against my better judgment i reached out for the small box said thank you mr kamara and opened it inside suspended from a thin gold chain was a gleaming multicolored cloisonnй locket about an inch wide and two inches long oh i gasped its beautiful mr kamara smiled but it wasnt a smile of pleasure it was more a flash of triumph and it bothered me perhaps my expression showed my confusion because he immediately became more friendly and nodded to mrs bandini and mrs larabee too movie star picture inside he said with pride as though he had taken the shot himself thank you mr kamara i said he bowed once more then turned and left the club let us see mrs bandini had a hand out so i put the box in it a very nice gift she said ive seen these in the hotel gift shop and while under the circumstances it would be rude to tell you the price before taxes you can take my word for it that it didnt cost too much and not too little so i consider this to be a perfectly respectable gift put it on mrs larabee said lets see how it looks i took back the small box i cant wear jewelry while im working i said mrs bandini beamed at me it will look lovely when youre all dolled up in a pretty summer dress and going out with a nice tall goodlooking boy like my grandson eric eric wants to meet you she added ive told him so much about you in fact im going to bring him to the club this weekend so the two of you can become acquainted i smiled at her over my shoulder as i practically raced back to the office all i needed was a bigger meaner version of pauly at the club i unlocked the bottom desk drawer and tucked the little box into my plastic handbag then locked it up again the lull would soon be over tina would arrive with the new batch of photoid cards and soon afterward the conventioneers would come wanting to unwind after sitting in straightbacked chairs at meetings all day the file box was in front of me so i decided to go through the cards and see if any new faces had come in since yesterday there were just three a couple who looked happily bemused yes their room number showed that they were in the honeymoon suite and an elderly man whose mouth turned down like an upsidedown horseshoe and who peered out from under his bushy eyebrows like a fox from behind a hedge his wasnt a new face that was a face id remember and i was positive that id seen it before i was also positive that this card hadnt been in the file yesterday when had i seen it tuesday monday i needed to talk to someone so i called the security office tina answered and i told her about the card that had disappeared and returned if you saw this mans face would you know if he was one of those who ran into a pickpocket somewhere in houston maybe tina said whats his name ill check the id file up here samuel smith i read from the card suite got it tina said almost immediately well if he had any trouble with pickpockets he didnt report it then she said thats odd let me talk to lamar ill get right back to you whats odd lamars scribbled a little note at the bottom of smiths card what does it say i cant decipher it i think it says watch him i wonder what it means thats what im going to find out ill let you know when i bring in the afternoon id cards thanks i said as tina hung up i closed the file and picked up the note with the four circles drawn on it i intended to loss it into the wastepaper basket but i studied it again there was something about it that nagged at me something familiar fran appeared in the doorway hi he said hi i answered fran had the nicest smile the houston symphony orchestras going to be playing outdoors in miller theater on sunday i found out thats your day off and i switched with another guy so ill be off then too id like to take you to the symphony we could bring a blanket and some food and sit on the grass and i didnt hear another word he said all of a sudden that crescent of circles made sense it was like a symphony orchestra the string instruments here the wind instruments there the drums i jumped to my feet ran around the desk caught the toe of my tennis shoe on the desk leg and stumbled into frans arms oh fran youre wonderful you did it you did it fran staggered back but managed to stay on his feet he helped me back on mine looking very pleased with himself i knew that sooner or later id come up with something youd want to do on a date he said i still held tightly to his shoulders no listen fran listen its not the date its what you said about the symphony orchestra its those little circles we drew on the notepad dont you see no he said i dont i drew him closer remember you said that each of them stood for a separate crime they werent related he nodded okay i remember now but what about them theyre like the parts of an orchestra fran each part is separate but the conductor brings them together the different kinds of crimes that are taking place in the hotel could be tied together too if one person were conducting them fran gaped you might be right but the conductor would have to be someone in the hotel i lowered my voice and looked around lets tell lamar about this we cant do that fran said the conductor might very well be lamar oh not lamar i said why not hes so efficient he cares about his job it could be a front who else would know as much about what goes on in the hotel the manager mr parmegan okay well put him on our suspect list too i can try to keep up with what hes doing each day he follows a pretty constant routine another thought occurred to me why does the conductor have to be working at the hotel why cant he be one of the guests mr kamara keeps a regular routine too and he was the one who knew mr jones okay mr kamaras on the list but i think youre going off in the wrong direction fran looked at his watch uhoh ive been here long enough i have to get back he stopped at the doorway and turned you didnt answer about the symphony tickets should i get them im sorry fran i began but the eager look on his face stopped me after all listening to the houston symphony orchestra together wasnt exactly a real date im sorry i didnt answer you right away i finished yes id like to go with you for a few moments fran looked as pleased as a puppy when you scratch his tummy then he became serious i wont see you tonight he said my aunt and uncle are visiting and my mom made me promise id come home as fast as i could so i could get in on the tail end of the party theyre throwing then ill see you tomorrow i said you bet fran said and vanished from the doorway i sat at the desk and picked up the sheet of notepad paper in the center at the bottom where the conductor would stand i drew a small box and inside the box i wrote the letter k for kamara then from that box i drew lines radiating out to each of the circles inside circle one i wrote sofa inside circle two i wrote meat inside circle three i wrote stuff because naturally there wasnt room to write things like silver and paintings and things like that inside circle four i wrote pp for pickpockets now all i had to do was to figure out how mr kamara could manage to orchestrate all these crimes hed have to have help where would he get it sofa meat and stuff left me blank but on the line to circle four i wrote mr jones what if mr kamara came into the health club office each day when no one was looking stole some of the cards gave them to mr jones who followed the people and stole their wallets then the next day mr jones could bring back the cards and mr kamara could replace them there was something wrong with this somebody was almost always in the office or nearby it would be hard for mr kamara to count on being able to sneak in and out and this was a large hotel lots of types of people stayed at this hotel how would mr kamara know which ones had wallets worth stealing someone would have to know which guests had lots of money and which didnt someone who would see guests opening their wallets hashing their bills floyd parmlee in room service i began to get excited floyd could tell mr kamara mr kamara could tell mr jones i let out a long sigh again i had come to a dead stop how could mr kamara get the cards in and out of the file box in the healthclub office id have to think about that one awhile but before i could work on it two families of petite people came into the office i recognized the mothers and fathers from their cards there were halfadozen assorted children with the adults children rarely showed up on the photo ids because unless their parents were holding them they were too short to be in range of the hidden camera no one in the group seemed to understand english but they understood smiles i handed them towels and managed to separate them getting them headed for the appropriate dressing rooms the stack of towels on the table near my desk was getting low so i took more from the closet to add to the pile art mart had apparently stuffed the towels on the closet shelves without any regard for neatness so i straightened the pile mary elizabeth i where are you the loud hiss in the office startled me i jumped dropping some of the towels and stepped out of the closet mrs bandinis eyes were so wide she looked like a little grayhaired owl you have got to do something quick she said the jacuzzi is filled with naked people i followed her out of the office the two families who had just come in filled the jacuzzi they were chattering and smiling and bouncing the children from one to another they all looked at me do any of you speak english i asked they just stared maybe you should call security mrs bandini said still in a stage whisper ill try body language i said maybe that will do it so i pointed at mrs bandini then gave a little tug at the strap of her red bathing suit this is a bathing suit i said they looked at each other then back at me and laughed as though id made a very funny joke one of the women nodded and gestured at mrs bandini to join them in the jacuzzi so i went through the motion of removing clothes they watched intently then i shook my head and pointed at the jacuzzi waiting to see if they understood they laughed even harder i sighed i dont know how to make them understand i said to mrs bandini youre right ill have to call security but the door to the hotel opened and lamar came into the room caught it on camera he said with his sharply creased authority he stood near the edge of the pool pointed toward the dressing rooms and snapped out something in a language that the people in the jacuzzi understood one of the women stood up and said something to him lamar nodded as though shed been speaking in english towels mrs bandini gasped quick mary elizabeth get these people towels the jacuzzi people had brought the stack of towels id given them i began handing them out as they stepped up one by one out of the jacuzzi in a few minutes they had disappeared into the dressing rooms mrs bandini rushed over to repeat the entire scene to mrs larabee who hadnt missed a thing i turned to lamar im impressed you were able to talk to them lamars chin tilted modestly all i can say in their language is in this country we have laws against public nudity you must wear bathing suits in the pool and jacuzzi thats all you can say this happens every once in a while so it seemed a good thing to learn but you seemed to understand what that woman said to you yeah someone always says the same thing i memorized it and got it translated she said in your country you have some strange laws mr boudry i said has tina talked to you about mr smith which mr smith the hotel always has a lot of mr smiths obviously she hadnt yet mr samuel smith she said you had written something like watch him on his photoid card ahha lamar said his eyes became slits and his mouth pulled into a thin line i did he checked out at noon today because you watched him he brushed a tiny piece of lint from the front of his suit jacket quite possibly he suspected you knew something about him right i did look mr boudry i said this is driving me crazy what did he suspect that you knew that the man is syndicate he said out of miami how did you know that i keep in touch lamar said besides my network of information mr smiths picture was in last months issue of crime facts by any chance did mr smith report that his wallet was stolen lamars clipped laugh sounded more like a bark no im sure that mr smiths wallet was as safe as if it had been in a bank box no pickpocket would be stupid enough to risk what would happen to him if he stole the wallet of someone high up in a crime syndicate i suddenly remembered something and nearly jumped in the air mr boudry yesterday there were two men in the health club asking about mr jones when i was downtown at the police station i recognized a picture of one of them the sergeant told me he was suspected of a tiein with the miami syndicate immediately lamar snapped into a businesslike efficiency and began to question me i was glad i had reported the men to tina that pan seemed to satisfy lamar if you want a really good description i said ask mrs bandini and mrs larabee i steered lamar over to the two women who puffed up like a pair of pigeons and tried to outtalk each other as lamar took notes the list would soon come in with cards to file and cards to toss for some reason i didnt really understand i took mr samuel smiths card from the file instead of tossing it because hed checked out of the hotel i stuck it under some papers in the back of the bottom drawer of the desk and locked the drawer again groups of people had begun to come to the health club i checked out the faces in the pool and hurried through the exercise room and womens dressing room making sure everything was all right the women and children from the jacuzzi families had settled into the womens sauna room still without a stitch of clothing they laughed and waved at me i just waved right back and shut the door at the moment they were the least of my problems the evening was busier than the one before i wished that art mart had stuck around i could have used the help it wasnt until tenthirty that the crowd began thinning out once more i walked through the tables on the landing above the inner pool close to the door to the hotel i filled a tray with paper cups and napkins and cola cans and other rubbish as i straightened i happened to glance toward the door a man dressed in a dark business suit was turning away going back to the hotel was he one of the men who had questioned me about mr jones two tall broad baldies in sweatsuits filled the gap in the doorway and i couldnt see i wasnt sure but i called lamar anyway ill check on it he snapped the line went dead and i knew he was halfway down the stairs already there was nothing to worry about it took a few minutes to convince everyone that the health club really did close at eleven pm just as the sign on the door said when the last guests had finally gone it was eleventen there was still a lot of pickup to do i managed to collect the towels which had been draped on chairs tables and the tiles near the pool and dumped them into the overflowing wet towel bin in the womens dressing room i checked out the sauna half expecting to see the jacuzzi people still visiting in there but the room of course was empty one by one i tidied the shower stalls and the area around the big mirror i found four more pairs of sunglasses two cans of hair spray and a tiny bathingsuit bottom that seemed to match the top id found the day before finally i was satisfied by the condition of the womens dressing room so i went to the door of the mens dressing room and called anybody still here im coming in i was pretty sure that no one would be there at this hour i took a step inside then stopped had i just heard something i couldnt be sure for a few seconds i listened intently not breathing what was it nothing but my imagination with a whoosh i drew in a deep breath of air and entered the mens dressing room i would swear in any court of law that men are a hundred times messier than women at their worst it took me at least ten minutes just to tidy the room and mens sauna while i worked i kept muttering who are your maids at the office and who are your maids at home unfortunately it wasnt hard to guess the answers there wasnt anything i could do about it and right now the maid was me i worked hard and got things ready so that the veryearlymorning cleaning crew could step in and make everything shine i walked through the exercise room back to the office grabbed the door frame and gave a little yelp someone had turned off the outside and indoor pool lights beyond the office was a well of darkness whos there i whispered i cleared my throat and tried again my hands were clammy and my knees were having trouble holding me up is anybody out there no one answered there was only silence i edged toward the desk reached down and dialed the number of the security office it rang and rang finally a voice answered i didnt recognize it is lamar boudry there i asked nope he said who is this mary elizabeth rafferty in the health club is tina there nope he repeated whats your problem the lights are off in the pool area dont call us call maintenance i mean someone turned them off arent you supposed to close up anyway by this time i tried not to yell at him where is lamar bar he said couple of drunks got into a fight wheres tina making rounds look things are extra busy tonight you got any real problems call back but otherwise dont keep the line busy okay okay i mumbled and hung up i stared out the officewindow wall into the pool area but with the light on in the office it was like staring into a black cave if anyone was out there i couldnt see him so i did what i should have done in the first place and would have if i hadnt been so scared i flipped up every switch on the plate so that inside and outside the health club was brightly lit carefully i poked my head through the open office doorway and looked in every direction outside the glass wall the trees and shrubbery around the pool shuddered and trembled in a light breeze a tiny scrap of paper id missed skittered across the cement and disappeared under the bushes but inside the club nothing moved the plants and trees with their outstretched branches looked like a group of frozen giantchildren caught playing statue i took a few cautious steps from the office and paused glancing down into the swimming pool there staining the brilliant blue water like a dark spreading ink spot floated a body even though the body was facedown i knew who it was mr kamara as though my mind were a shark with an open mouth i gulped in everything at once mr kamara was dressed in swimming trunks his robe was neatly draped over the back of a chair near the pool and his thongs were side by side under the chair tucked there according to mr kamaras usual tidy habit but mr kamara was floating near the surface of the pool and somebody had to pull him out at first i had assumed he was dead how did i know maybe he wasnt and i could save him i pulled off my shoes and jumped into the water so frightened i flailed and thrashed like a novice swimmer his arms were out fingers spread and elbows bent his legs hung lower in the water so that he looked almost ready to stand if he could i swam up behind him and it look every bit of courage i had to reach out and touch him his chin was cold and i knew as i cupped it in my left hand pulling it up and out of the water that i was too late but i towed him to the shallow water and managed to drag him onto the steps he lay on his back with water dribbling from one corner of his mouth his eyes were dark blanks that stared into mine stumbling crying i ran to the telephone and screamed at the guard who answered werent you watching cant you see hes dead i dont remember what else i yelled and i have no idea what the man said but almost by the time i had slammed down the receiver the door to the hotel flew open and lamar ran through without a word to me he dashed straight to mr kamaras body and carefully examined it kneeling on the steps in the water he shook his head stood and looked at me get a towel for yourself he said and get a handful of kleenex blow your nose his voice was so authoritative that i immediately stopped crying and did what he said now come here lamar called i slowly left the office then stopped i couldnt go back to the body how did he drown lamar asked i dont know i didnt even know he was in the pool do you know how long he was in the water no can you guess i thought hard about ten minutes ago i heard a small noise what kind of a noise describe it i cant it was just a noise a splash like someone diving no i would have recognized a splashing noise did the noise come from the pool area i dont even know that mr boudry i couldnt place the sound id heard i was just going into the mens dressing room to put it in order i waited and listened but i didnt hear anything else so i thought it was my imagination how did you get wet i didnt know mr kamara was dead i jumped in to try to save him so you didnt find him on the steps like this no he was floating in the water i gave a huge shudder all the way down to my toes and clutched the towel tightly around me i took a step sideways and reached out for one of the poolside chairs dont touch that lamars words were like a slap but i want to sit down not there we want to preserve the scene what are you talking about i yelped he ignored my question saying tell me exactly what happened tonight as far as you know i told him quickly briefly trying to remember every detail that might be important as i trembled with the cold and with the fear of what had taken place then with the pool water still dripping from his trousers and squishing in his shoes lamar calmly walked to the office and picked up the telephone as he waited for someone to answer he looked over his shoulder at me and said a little more kindly now do you have some dry clothes to change into i nodded and he snapped then do it right now the police will be here shortly police but his attention had switched from me to whoever was on the other end of the line i put on the dress i had worn to the police station toweldried and brushed my hair and went back to the pool area to find lamar tina and two other guards observing a pair of whiteshirted paramedics who were bending over mr kamaras body as i came into the room everyone but the paramedics turned and stared at me i stopped and stared back i didnt know what to say tina gave her head a little shake like someone waking from a stupor and moved toward me she looked awful her throat muscles were jerking as though she were gulping a lot id heard about people turning green tinad really managed to do it oh liz i she said this must have been terrible for you i couldnt answer i just shivered she put her hands on my shoulders gave another big gulp and said lamar told us what you did you were very brave you called upon hidden inner resources you didnt even know that you had arent you proud of yourself no tina dropped her hands and stepped back well perhaps the full significance hasnt im not proud of myself i said i should have investigated when i heard the noise i convinced myself i hadnt heard anything maybe if id run right out here i could have saved him from drowning he may not have drowned lamar said the two paramedics stood up one moved toward a folding stretcher on wheels but lamar stepped into his way the police are coming he said leave the body where it is we havent got all night the paramedic said you have if we say you have lamar said even with his squishy shoes he was in total command the guy shrugged muttered okay and moved back from the steps to where his partner was standing there was silence for an instant the way it sometimes is at parties when everyone stops speaking at once but it didnt stay silent for long pete make the bar check lamar ordered nate back on the cameras no ones in the office and youre supposed to be on duty there tina he paused for just an instant and glanced in my direction tina youre off duty now you can go home or you can stick around for a while ill stay with liz tina said getting the message you dont have to i told her i want to she answered she took my hand and led me to one of the tables away from the pool fronds of a large potted palm provided an interlaced green barrier between mr kamaras body and us tina glanced at the palm a couple of times as though trying to convince herself that we couldnt see the steps of the pool she huddled back into the webbacked chair and said well wait here by the way wheres your short friend fran had to go home as soon as he got off duty his family was entertaining visiting relatives speaking of relatives have your parents come back from their trip yet not yet want me to call them i wanted it more than anything i could think of but i shook my head no dad cant interrupt an important business trip just because because of mr kamara if youre afraid of a guilt trip she began but thankfully the door from the hotel opened and two uniformed police officers came through they were halfway to the pool when the door opened again and there was detective jarvis with another shorter stockier man who walked the way a policeman walks with his arms slightly held out from his body it had to be detective jarviss partner he was detective jarvis introduced him to me detective robert morgan he nodded at me then walked over to the body and talked to the paramedics jarvis conferred with lamar examined mr kamaras body front and back and went through the pockets of his robe coming up empty handed then attention was focused on me i found myself repeating my story then repeating it again as i retold it the third time i realized that most of the shock had been squeezed from my body by my own words which came out as sour and dry as brittle brown bay leaves was mr kamara in the habit of going swimming after club hours detective jarvis asked hes never done it since ive worked here i said i can answer that lamar said no one is allowed in the pool after closing time and that includes mr kamara but his robe and thongs are exactly the way he always left them i said detective jarvis turned to the paramedics and motioned toward the body they immediately covered the body swung it over to the stretcher and raised it up on its wheels please take the side door out lamar said yeah yeah thats where the dispatcher told us you said to park the vehicle one of the men drawled dont worry we wont be going through your lobby they didnt seem upset at dealing with a dead body maybe that was so much a part of their job that they got used to it or maybe they had learned to cover all the deep twisting horror and hurt that surely must shiver inside them i must have spoken my thoughts aloud as i watched them wheel mr kamaras body out of the health club because detective jarvis who stood next to me murmured if the day ever comes when i dont feel something ill quit its an unhealthy instinct to try to cover ones normal emotions tina said i was glad to find out you had cried liz that was healthy detective morgan said a few words to detective jarvis then walked out with the paramedics jarvis turned to lamar thanks for the information and the descriptions of the men whom mary elizabeth saw he nodded toward me those were good clear helpful descriptions they werent my descriptions i told him a couple of women who were in the club gave mr boudry those descriptions they took in a lot of detail tell them i said good work theyll like that i answered i looked at lamar could i go home now in just a moment he said as soon as you give us mr kamaras locker number lamar turned to detective jarvis youll want to look in his locker wont you yes detective jarvis said any need for a warrant no lamar said because the lockers are the property of the health club which is the property of the hotel anyone using a locker is using it courtesy of the hotel detective jarvis nodded same setup for his room right might as well get with it they both looked at me theres a book in the top drawer with the locker assignments in it i said ill get mr kamaras number for you i took two steps toward the office then turned back to them why are you doing all this investigating just because he drowned were not sure that he drowned detective jarvis said well get the facts from the medical examiner tomorrow they looked at each other as though they both knew something the rest of us didnt know why arent you sure i asked because detective jarvis said mr boudry and i noticed a slight depression on the back of mr kamaras head maybe he slipped and bumped his head as he fell into the pool or maybe he stopped and la mar finished the sentence or maybe somebody else put that bruise there murder tinas voice was overloud and echoed through the room lamar shrugged and said if mary elizabeth will get kamaras locker number for us i got it in a hurry i also got the spare key for the lock and led the way to the end of the mens locker room it was the last locker on the top row i stood back while detective jarvis opened the locker but all the time i was doing this i was reliving what had happened i could see myself flooding the area with light discovering mr kamaras body and pulling it to the steps his blank eyes kept staring into mine i had never seen a dead person i felt sick to my stomach and wished i could wake up and find this had never happened there wasnt much in the locker a shortsleeved sport shirt one rubber thong and a halfempty bottle of expensive mens cologne it doesnt tell us much detective jarvis said it does in a way i said how do you mean somethings missing the wallet mr kamaras wallet and room key should be in the locker people from the hotel usually gel locks for their lockers and put their wallets and room keys in them people rarely leave wallets in their hotel rooms mr kamara never did good point tina said she tried to smile at me and didnt quite make it in spite of being older and working in security it was obvious that she felt as miserable as i did its a very good point detective jarvis said he made a notation in his notebook this whole thing is weird i said you didnt find his wallet or room key in his robe pockets did you and they arent here he wouldnt have left his room without both of them especially the key hed need the key to get back into his room so it really was murder tina whispered one corner of her mouth twisted down and she choked out excuse me im going to the ladies room she turned and ran should i go with her i asked jarvis shell be all right he said how about you you dont look any better than she did i backed up and sat on one of the wooden benches that stretched down the middle of the dressing room i took a couple of deep breaths it didnt help in spite of the air conditioning that circulated the air through the club the dressing room still stank of wet feet and deodorant soap and dirty wet towels and mr kamaras dark eyes were still staring into mine real murders not like a murder in a chevy chase movie i said no its not detective jarvis answered excuse me i said i think i bolted after tina a few minutes later as we splashed cold water on our faces tina said its a normal reaction for the mind and the body to cooperate in rejecting that which they do not want to accept oh come on tina i said mopping up my face with a clean towel why cant you just face it that we threw up for a moment i thought she was going to cry an efficient security guard should be in total control at all times only lamar i said hes one of a kind i took her shoulders and smiled at her hey youre a nice normal person and you reacted the way a nice normal person would remember what detective jarvis said that if he didnt feel something hed quit i guess tina said she pushed a strand of hair back from her face and stared at me in the mirror im not going to be a security guard forever im going to work hard and get my degree and im not going to be just any old average psychologist either im going to write books to help people and become rich and famous youll see me on tv ill watch for you she attempted to smile and the corners of her mouth quivered when i start my practice how would you like to be my assistant youd lose your patients i said youll need a serene assistant not someone who drops things and falls over coffee tables basically she said awkwardness comes from your mind not being willing to adjust quickly to rapid body growth which comes right down to a bottom line of insecurity you need a stronger selfimage have you thought about lets go tina i tugged at her hand if detective jarvis doesnt need us any longer i want to go home he and lamar were in the healthclub office jarvis gave tina and me a quick glance anything else you can think of to tell me anything else you know that mr kamara had or did no i said thanks for staying he said you can go home now i squeezed around him and sat at the desk i unlocked the bottom drawer and removed my purse locked it again and dropped the key into its place in the top middle desk drawer let us know what you find out i said we will jarvis said it was past midnight at this time no one was at the employee checkout station so tina and i quickly went through and to our cars she waved at me as she drove off even with the bright arc lights in the parking lot it was lonely and scary i fumbled with numb fingers trying to start old junk bucket and gave a yelp of relief when his motor finally took hold it wasnt until i was safely home inside the house my back against the locked door and the livingroom lights on that i could begin to let go i shivered wrapping my arms around myself and allowed myself to cry i fished inside my plastic purse for a tissue but my fingers bumped the small box that held the cloisonnй locket i took out the box opened it and examined the locket as it winked and glimmered in the lamplight it was strange too the way mr kamara had given me the locket with such a peculiar delight i wondered should i have told detective jarvis about this locket i promised myself to sleep late the next morning promises about sleeping late arent any good if you dont spread the word around to people who could help you keep them mom called mmmmph i breathed into the telephone trying to untangle my legs from the sheet and keep from falling out of bed at the same time what are you doing sweetheart mom asked sleeping i managed to grunt at this hour moms voice rose in surprise why its after tenthirty almost twenty to eleven are you feeling all right sleepy i said goodness mom said youre wasting the best part of the day morning people always say irritating things like that i told her and giggled because i sounded like tina and her pop psychology mom giggled too ill let you get back to sleep she said if you tell me one thing how are you is everything all right the dishwasher isnt acting up again is it do you need anything thats more than one thing and everythings fine i said mom sighed youre a young woman now liz i shouldnt worry about you your father says to me over and over nothings going to happen to liz shes fine im fine i said are you eating properly mom i was more awake now you promised you wouldnt ask me that well i just dont want you living on junk food i bought all those nice vegetables and that big bag of golden delicious apples you love apples i know you are enjoying the apples arent you constantly i said i slice them on my pizza mary elizabeth mom said i love you and i miss you take good care of yourself i will until you get home mom and then ill give up and let you do it i said she laughed your father sends his love too i love you both i said goodbye mom goodbye sweetheart she said and we hung up together for a moment i snuggled back into the blanket feeling cosy and warm from both the blanket and from moms voice but i was awake enough now to remember and the remembrance of last night was like a cold bucket of water dumped on my head i couldnt stay in bed another moment i washed my hair rubbed some mousse into it and set it on hot rollers then i put some green stuff on my nose and chin il looked kind of sickening but id bought it after reading that it banished zits forever i pulled on my old jeans and my favorite tshirt printed with nobodys perfect and went into the kitchen to make breakfast the open refrigerator was yawning at me when the doorbell rang i knew who that would be mrs zellendorf i had got in awfully late last night and i bet she knew all about it how can you be independent and at the same time have a nextdoor neighbor checking on you in my bare feet i padded down the hall to the front door and threw it wide open there stood fran he was holding a sack of doughnuts he blinked then smiled youre a walking advertisement for your tshirt he said i thought you were mrs zellendorf do we look alike no but if i were mrs zellendorf would you invite me in well sure but hi he said im mrs zellendorf i had to giggle come in fran go straight back to the kitchen just excuse me for a moment dont change on my account he said you look good to me even with that sickening guck on your face i washed my face put on a little bit of blusher and blue eye shadow and combed out my hair why i asked my reflection peering nose to nose in the mirror why do you care its just fran the mirror didnt say a word so i joined fran in the kitchen he had already poured two glasses of milk and put the sack of doughnuts on the table where do you keep the paper napkins he asked i got the napkins and plates sat across from him and fished out a jelly doughnut i had to get out of the house fran said his mouth full of doughnut my uncles six feet five and he intimidates me i cant imagine anyone intimidating you i took a big bite and the tart raspberry jelly exploded into my mouth uncle ralph does but he proves my theory i asked him how he did in school and he said okay just okay i asked if he worried about being only okay and he said it didnt bother him at all because he spent most of his time playing first string on the football team see what i mean no stress no worries and he gets to be six feet five then why dont you just stop worrying about school i asked it may be too late he said glumly he licked his fingers and added either your nose is bleeding or you missed with the jelly in your doughnut i wiped off my nose and pulled a second doughnut from the bag fran did too he took another bite and said i thought about you last night i hoped you wouldnt be afraid and i wished i could be with you i missed you so how did it go i dropped my doughnut and burst into tears in an instant fran was beside me his arms around me he kept murmuring little snuggly things into my neck you missed me too huh its okay im here now dont cry i pulled back grabbed my napkin which was gritty with granulated sugar wiped my eyes and blew my nose im not crying about you fran i said sit down and ill tell you what happened as i recounted the story fran leaned forward with interest there goes your theory about mr kamara being the one who orchestrated all the crimes not necessarily i said maybe thats why he was killed by whom im not sure and why there are a few things about this case i dont know yet i said like everything fran said dont rub it in why dont you just forget all about the problem and let your detective friend take care of it i thought a moment maybe its because of my job im supposed to be responsible for the wellbeing of the guests of the health club maybe i feel guilty because i didnt investigate that noise i heard last night maybe its because im scared and i want the police to catch the murderer as soon as they can i rubbed my nose with the back of one hand the sugar felt scratchy i have a good idea fran said lets go to the zoo and eat hot dogs and ride on the hermann park train and forget all about the ridley hotel until its time to go to work my immediate reaction was to say no but getting away from the problem for a little while made sense i pushed my chair back from the table okay lets go wash your face first fran said if you go out like that youll attract bees i did and pulled a clean healthclub tshirt and shorts from the drier stuffing them into a paper bag we can take my car and go from the zoo to the hotel and ill take you home when our shifts are over fran said so i got my plastic purse from where i had left it on the hall table i took the small box from it and laid it on the table following fran out the front door and to his car frans car made old junk bucket look good as he put his key in the ignition he patted what was left of the dashboard and said come on yellow belly dont let me down with a wheeze and rattle the car started nervously we headed for the hermann park zoo fran had been right going to the zoo was a good idea we had a wonderful time and made it back to the ridley not only on time but a little early my watch said twoforty pm as i entered the club from the hotel mrs bandini and mrs larabee sat bolt upright they were seated where they could watch the door and catch me when i came in they both waved and motioned to me but i pretended that i didnt understand what they wanted i just smiled and waved back and hurried into the office deeley johnson was behind the desk deeley was trim compact and perky with a big smile for everyone who came into the club her hair was no longer than an inch anywhere on her head and on her it looked great hey girl she said did you think i was never coming back im sorry you were sick i said no big deal im just sorry i missed all the excitement mr kamaras staring black eyes suddenly popped into my mind and i shuddered it wasnt exciting deeley it was horrible yeah she said i guess it was im glad youre back i told her sos art mart he told me he was going to sleep till noon today too bad he didnt get the chance why didnt he her eyes widened thats right you didnt hear about the breakin where what breakin let me tell you two of them in fact when the police went up to mr kamaras suite after you went home last night they found it had been gone over stuff was all over the floor and thrown out of the closet i mean it was a real mess somebody must have been looking for something down here too whoever it was did a job on the health club all the drawers in the desk were open they broke the lock on the bottom drawer and nothing was left on the closet shelves what did they take nobody knows she said art mart couldnt find anything missing i gasped as it occurred to me if they came back after i had locked up how did they get in good question she said the door between the hotel and the club was locked up tight deeley i said the wall she looked puzzled and i realized that she wouldnt know so i told her about the gap in the wall did lamar or art tell detective jarvis about the wall i asked probably she said where is art gone home for a while hes in a real grouchy mood i suppose he didnt like having to put back everything in the closet deeley stood and stretched then she laughed are you kidding do you really think that art mart would do all that work with me here we grinned at each other this has been a bad morning she said the pool company came and drained the pool and scrubbed it down and now theyre practically through filling it up again nobodys supposed to go in today because its going to lake till tomorrow to get the water heated properly but i saw a number of people here in the club some of them only want to sunbathe or use the exercise equipment oh and its okay if they want to use the jacuzzi she glanced out the window at mrs bandini and mrs larabee and lowered her voice some of them just want to talk watch out for those two the card file was near her elbow now was a good time to bring it up i told her about some of the cards missing then returning to the file have you ever noticed that i asked she thought a moment then shrugged i never paid that much attention an awful lot of people come and go through the hotel anyhow why would some of the cards be missing what would it mean i dont know yet i said probably every now and then a card gets accidentally misplaced maybe deeley pointedly glanced at the clock ill keep the desk till you get changed she said two minutes to three i hurried into the womens dressing room i locked my purse inside my locker since the desk lock was broken and soon returned to the office dressed in the healthclub uniform hope your days better than yesterday deeley said see you tomorrow she quickly left the club plopping into the desk chair i suddenly remembered mr smiths card i opened the bottom drawer and picked up the few papers that were lying scrambled on the bottom thumbing through them the card was gone i methodically went through every drawer in the desk there werent that many papers in it a few notes about things that probably should have been thrown away a long time ago outofdate fliers about health runs and things like that but no sign of mr smiths card obviously someone had taken it maybe art or deeley or whoever had cleaned the desk had tossed it i went through the wastepaper basket obviously it hadnt been emptied since the nightly cleanup crew had been here because it was full of deeleys candy and gum wrappers and art marts diet drink cans the card wasnt in the basket either why would someone want that card is that what the ransacker had been looking for surely not it could have been taken out of the file at any time then where was the card i glanced through the window to the pool to see mrs bandini and mrs larabee pointedly staring at me so i strolled over to join them sit down sit down mrs bandini said as she patted a chair that had been deliberately arranged between the two women i did tell us what happened last night mrs larabee said first i repeated what detective jarvis had said about their description of the two men in business suits they were so pleased with themselves that their cheeks turned pink next lime your soninlaw tells you youre nosy you can tell him its a talent that can come in handy mrs larabee said to mrs bandini his word was curious not nosy mrs bandini said a matter of semantics mrs larabee said she turned to me tell us everything that happened mary elizabeth we heard you were once more a heroine heroine no unshed tears swelled painfully behind my eyes i didnt want to cry again so as quickly as i could i told the women everything i could remember about what had happened the night before as i ended the story my appreciative audience burst into a duet of clucks and sighs and humhumming was it murder or not mrs bandini asked i guess no one will know until the medical examiner gives his report mrs larabee laid a plump hand on my arm when you find out tell us i shifted in the chair my legs were getting cramped this was a good time to end the conversation so i stood and stretched i will i said i beg your pardon can you help me the voice was behind us the three of us turned in one motion as though we were on a string a blond woman who was probably in her early forties looked at me inquisitively i saw your tshirt she said no one else was in the office could you help me of course i said and tripped over the chair leg in my rush to assist her she held out a hand to steady me she wasnt a beautiful woman but she was attractive her hair was tightly pulled back into a knot at her neck she had on a little too much makeup but i recognized her cream silk jacket and skirt from one of the fashion magazines expensive so was her gold jewelry her pale leather handbag hung on her arm the clasp ajar her sunglasses hooked over the side mrs bandini and mrs larabee were initially impressed i could tell from the quality of their silence as they waited to hear what she would say my name is mrs kasha vendra she said im mr asmir kamaras sister oh i said im terribly sorry about what happened to mr kamara yes she said her eyelids slowly lowered like smudged blue window shades before she once again raised her glance to meet mine a terrible accident mrs bandini struggled out of her chair im sylvia bandini she said and this is my friend olga larabee you have our condolences mrs vendra barely nodded in mrs bandinis direction she didnt even look at her will you please allow me to take the contents of my brothers locker she asked me ill have to gel permission i said thats ridiculous i tried to ease the situation and smiled it wont take long ill call the security chief right away no she look a deep breath by the time she had exhaled it she was once more under control im sorry she said this whole situation is very upsetting of course mrs bandini said she moved nearer you and your brother were probably very close friends as a brother and sister should be even though he must have been much older than you mrs vendra ignored mrs bandini i am his only relative she told me naturally i will inherit everything the money well theres a lot of it but it doesnt matter what matters are asmirs personal things the items of sentimental value do you understand of course i said so if i could just see what was in his locker come with me mrs bandini said to her well find a nice place to sit and chat while mary elizabeth calls security without giving mrs vendra a chance to answer mrs bandini practically barged into her grabbing her arm and causing her handbag to fall since it was already open the contents spilled across the tiles oh my how clumsy of me mrs bandini dropped to her knees and began scooping sunglasses and lipstick and wallet and keys back into mrs vendras handbag while mrs vendra fumed i had to help mrs bandini to her feet by tugging on the arm she waved in my direction she gave mrs vendra her handbag still babbling apologies later mrs vendra said to me as she snatched her bag from mrs bandini and tucked it under her arm i am totally unnerved this is all too much for me she turned and swept from the club call security mrs bandini said to me but shes left call them anyway right away tell them a blond hussy type woman was here posing as mr kamaras sister i cant do that how do you know she isnt his sister intuition for one thing she said and for another the name in her wallet it wasnt mrs kasha vendra i ran to the telephone in the healthclub office mrs bandini and mrs larabee scurrying after me i called the security office and told the guard who answered what mrs bandini had said lamar came into the club a short time later and told me they had found no sign of the woman in the hotel nate was monitoring the cameras in the office but he wasnt concerned about what was going on in the health club so he didnt pay attention to the woman can you describe her he asked as he pulled out a notebook and pen sure i said expensive lamar sighed meaning great clothes silk jacket and skirt and chunked up with lots of gold jewelry her face was kind of middle aged but her hair was younger i paused and he said hair was younger light blond i cant think of anything else mrs bandini subtly slid in front of me the woman was wearing a liz claiborne outfit creamcolored silk costly but not too cosily i have a liz claiborne blouse myself she was about five feet six but she was wearing threeinch heels beige lizard shoes and matching handbag i didnt catch the label on the handbag she was in her forties but i recognize a good facelift when i see it she wasnt a natural blonde by any means i know the shade its called golden ash and her hair was pulled back into a french knot not many women wear a french knot any longer so i think she did her hair that way just for this occasion mrs bandini ran out of breath so mrs larabee picked up the string of words and ran with it her jewelry wasnt all real gold the bracelet was it had inscriptions on it sort of like egyptian hieroglyphics and the chain could have been maybe yes maybe no mrs bandini said although i prefer no im telling this now mrs larabee said to her friend mrs bandini shrugged and let mrs larabee continue the earrings were definitely not mrs larabee said they were costume jewelry and a little too large for her face decidedly mrs bandini said lamars pen had been wildly dashing across his notepad now he looked up at the three of us anything else blue eyes mrs bandini said there is no way she could have been mr kamaras sister and there was no way she was mrs kasha vendra as she said she was when the name on her drivers license was lily payne lamar made a final notation then tucked his pad and pen back into his inside coat pocket i got a quick glimpse of his shoulder holster and gun thank you for an excellent job of description he said mrs larabee playfully poked mrs bandini in the ribs with her elbow they giggled the detective also thinks were pretty good at describing people she said maybe we should go to work for the houston police if this woman comes back lamar said to me i finished his sentence ill call you immediately as he turned to leave the office i said mr boudry have you been in touch with detective jarvis has he told you yet what the medical examiner said about mr kamara lamars shoulders squared professionally i was right he said death was caused by a strong blow to the head mr kamara didnt drown he was dead before he hit the water could he i didnt want to face it could he have slipped and fallen mr kamara was murdered lamar said he strode out of the office mrs bandini and mrs larabee wanted to talk but i didnt want to listen somehow i managed to herd them back to their chairs by the pool and returned to the office i had assumed that with the pool closed for the day everything at the club would be pretty quiet but people kept wandering in to ask questions and stare at the pool as though an outline of the body would be marking the surface of the water fortunately for me mrs bandini and mrs larabee were delighted to answer everyones questions they had lunch by the pool and held court even through their chicken almond salad on egg twist rolls eventually they had to go home and make dinner i made a sign and taped it to the door to the club so the usual evening crowd would know in advance that the pool was closed and that helped only an occasional guest wandered in to use the exercise equipment or jacuzzi the photoid cards were brought and filed and art mart showed up briefly around seventhirty your sign looks tacky he said i didnt have time to go to a printers besides its doing the job anything new around here like what how do i know like what thats what i asked you well mr boudry said it was definite that mr kamara was murdered he was hit on the head he didnt drown maybe he fell and hit his head thats what i suggested but mr boudry said no they dont know everything i told art about the woman who said she was mr kamaras sister he frowned the entire time i told him and muttered something under his breath nobody tells me anything he grumbled and im in charge of this club he moved closer to me and scowled right into my face i could smell the sweetsour pungency of his exotic and cheap shaving lotion it was all i could do to keep from holding my nose i said if you were here more youd see what was going on i dont get paid for overtime he snapped he walked toward the office door where are you going i asked him home he said this place is dead dont you want to slick around for a while but he had already disappeared in a minute i heard the big door to the hotel slam closed it was only nine fiftyfive when the last guest left the club was bright with light but echoed with a hollow emptiness occasionally there was a creak or snap or pop as though someone were in the club id jump to my feet and edge toward the sound but nothing would be there i strolled through the womens dressing room almost hoping there would be towels to pick up but aside from an open tube of sun tan lotion that soured the air the room was tidy the hands of the wall clock moved so slowly that i wished i could climb up and help them along finally it was ten fortyfive and i sighed with relief id take care of the mens dressing room now and be ready to leave the moment that fran showed up automatically i went to the door of the dressing room and called out anyone here im coming in there was no answer so i made my check the few men who had been in here had done what they could to make up for their missing brothers there was soap on the floor wrappers tossed on the bench dirty towels lying where they had been dropped and a spilled bottle of shampoo that spread out of one of the showers all over the tiled floor i took care of some of the mess the custodians could finish the job when they arrived last on my list was the sauna i opened the door wide and was met by a blast of steam in my face someone must have walked away and left this thing on but there was a timer that regulated the steam and that had to have been set less than forty minutes ago i turned on the light in the sauna wondering why it had been turned off a body rose up from the wooden benches i screamed it leapt upward shouting and threw a towel at me as fast as i could i slammed the sauna door and raced to the telephone to call security colliding with fran as i skidded around the doorway into the office together we fell across the desk he grunted a bit as i reached over him and dialed the number for the security office somebody get here fast i need help i yelled and dropped the receiver ill help if you let me get up fran said i rolled off him landing on the floor he managed to climb off the desk and pick me up watch out i said so scared i was stuttering theres a naked crazy person in the mens sauna take it easy fran said if he comes this way ill protect you he dashed into the exercise room grabbed a fivepound dumbbell and cautiously edged toward the door to the mens dressing room nobodys in here he called out the door leading to the hotel burst open i could hear heavy footsteps thunder across the tiles by the time i had moved out from behind the desk lamar and pete skidded into the office what is it lamar asked theres a crazy man in there i pointed toward the mens dressing room in a minute i heard fran yelp its not me i ran toward the dressing room where pete had fran in a hammerlock and lamar was holding the dumbbell no i shouted thats fran he works in room service the crazy man is in the sauna pete dropped fran as he and lamar loped to the sauna and tore open the door you could have been more explicit fran complained as he rubbed his neck and tucked his shirt back into his jeans im sorry i said this place has me unnerved put this towel around him i heard lamar say he and pete emerged from the sauna supporting a skinny woebegone sagging guy whose legs looked as though the bones had dissolved and run out of his toes a towel was tied around his hips what kind of hotel is this the man said his thin hair hung over his eyes why were you hiding in there lamar asked him i wasnt hiding the man said i was trying to sweat out a cold he gave a loud sniffle the club was closed how would i know that i fell asleep he gave a huge sniffle tilting back his head i need to blow my nose lamar and pete let go of his arms he snatched off the towel he was wearing and loudly blew his nose on it as i turned and raced out of the room fran joined me in the office there are hazards in your job he said let me take you away from all this as soon as the others leave i have to lock up theyll be out in a minute are you ready ill get my handbag i unlocked my locker and took out my plastic purse leaving my jeans and shirt hanging there the way things had been going it wouldnt hurt to have an extra outfit on hand i went back to the office through the health club just as lamar pete and the wretchedlooking guy came through the door on the mens side he was dressed now his room key dangling in one hand one of the clubs tissue boxes in the other the man squinted at fran then scowled youre room service i remember you i remember you too fran said three hot rum toddies bring me another one tomorrow fran said im off duty now this is a rotten hotel the man said well escort you to your room sir lamar said he and pete briskly walked on the man stumbling between them trying to keep up i turned off all the lights locked the office door and gripped frans hand as we sprinted toward the exit with great relief i stood in the hotels hallway and locked the door to the club we went through the employee checkout the elderly guard at the door routinely searching my already seethrough purse and out into the parking lot a car was parked next to the trash containers its passenger door wide open i grabbed frans arm to stop him and put a finger over his lips he nibbled it stop that i hissed be quiet whats the matter he whispered shhhh follow me staying as close to the building as i could to remain out of the glare of the arc lights and walking silently on the grass i edged toward the side of the trash bins and peeked around them there was the man i had seen at the bins before one of the assistant chefs he was rummaging through the garbage in the nearest container fran leaned around me his face pressed against my shoulder finally the assistant chef grabbed something and pulled it free he hopped down and brushed what looked like carrot and potato peelings off the package it was about two feet long and a foot thick and well wrapped in plastic which shone under the arc lights he tossed the package into his car i heard it thump against something else probably another package he slammed the car door and walked around the front of his car i pulled fran back into the shadows as the assistant chef started his car and turned on his headlights after he drove off i leaned against fran and started to laugh whats so funny he asked some people might get a big laugh out of a guy putting garbage in his car but personally i feel that fran i interrupted do you know what we saw a guy putting garbage in his car i just said so no i said we just saw the woodwind section drop out of the orchestra he put a hand on my forehead you dont have a fever do you feel delirious dont you remember we talked about each crime being orchestrated one of the crimes was stealing meat from the kitchens go on thats what we were watching thai guy is one of the assistant chefs and id bet what we saw was a wellwrapped standing rib roast dont you see he wraps the cuts of meat he wants in plastic and puts it in the garbage containers then he pulls them out of the garbage at night and makes off with them he doesnt have to worry about getting the meat out of the building under lamars scrutiny some innocent person who is emptying the garbage from the kitchens is carrying the roasts out for him and he or someone else is selling them below market cost to the manager of some secondrate restaurant who doesnt ask questions fran sounded impressed if thats true you solved part of the case lets go back and tell lamar its too late for him to catch up with the guy he can keep a watch on him and catch him next time why dont we tell lamar tomorrow fran said i thought i could take you home and we could play some records and have some soft drinks and no i said its late well tell lamar now fran grumbled but he walked back with me to the employee entrance luckily lamar was there saying goodnight to the guard who passed us as we opened the door i told lamar what we had seen lamars eyes became glittery slits again and his shoulders rose and squared themselves it was impressive excellent work he said when i finished the story you say you recognized this man do you know his name no i said then give me a description he pulled out his notepad and pen okay i said and scrunched up my forehead trying to think of the right words hes medium height average kind of face he was kind of grungy especially after hed gone through the garbage really a yucky type put down yucky i paused and lamar sighed thats it uh i think his hair is dark and so is his moustache at least they look dark in the parking lot however those lights are weird they make lipstick look purple lamar looked at fran can you add anything to that description his name fran said its marco soledat i see the guy in the kitchen every day lamar and i just stared at fran why didnt you say so right away i asked him i didnt want to interrupt you he said i was enjoying your description that was the worst job of description i ever heard thanks to both of you lamar said he glanced quickly from side to side and lowered his voice just keep this whole thing quiet catching soledat in the act will depend on your not saying another word about it even to each other right fran said he clicked his heels together right i echoed fran pivoted on one heel took my arm and pulled me out to the parking lot im hungry fran said i thought about what we had in the refrigerator would you like an apple he grinned did you happen to get it from a snake i gazed into space which of course was over frans head and sighed be practical i said fran looked a little hurt i didnt want to hurt him but before i could think of what to say that might help he said lets hope yellow belly starts and led me toward his car it was a short ride from the hotel fran chatted about stuff at school and before long the embarrassment between us had dissolved like fog under a houston sun i unlocked our front door and flipped on a couple of lights tossing my purse onto the hall table it skidded and hit the little jewelry box knocking it to the floor fran picked it up and handed it to me i shivered as my fingers touched it mr kamara gave this to me to thank me for saving his life i shivered again and wailed oh fran now dont get undone fran said lets see whats in here he took the box away from me and pulled out the cloisonnй locket very pretty whats inside a moviestar picture are you a groupie no i havent even looked inside mr kamara told me there was a picture of a movie star inside the locket fran popped the locket open dolly parton you dont want to carry around dolly partons picture do you i had to laugh of course not ill take it out for you then your locket will be ready for someone elses picture he looked at me so archly i quickly looked away didnt he ever give up whoops fran said as the rim in the frame suddenly gave way under the pressure of his fingernail the rim the small oval sheet of plastic and the picture suddenly popped out and fell to the floor along with a tiny wadded square of paper whats that i asked we both knelt on the floor fran picked up the pieces of the locket that had dropped and i unfolded the small square of thin paper frans chin was on my shoulder and his warm breath was in my ear as he tried to read the tiny handwriting on the paper i moved a little closer to him just to make it easier for him to read its a list of six names with dates and cities i said whats it doing in the locket fran asked he put an arm around my shoulders to steady me mr kamara must have put it there but why i remembered the strange look of triumph on mr kamaras face and added i think this list was something he wanted to get rid of so the next question fran said is why did he want to get rid of it i sat back against fran trying to think and the idea that burst into my mind terrified me fran i whispered mr kamara must have been hiding this from someone frans lips nuzzled my cheek then maybe wed better find that person i hope we dont i said i think that person is the one who murdered mr kamara the telephone rang startling fran and me so much that we both jumped up youd better get it he said it wont be for me it was my mother mary elizabeth sweetheart she said accusingly youre still up of course im up mom i just got home from work a few minutes ago i said then i added did you think you were going to wake me up i dont know when to call you she answered when i call you at a reasonable time youre asleep so i thought id call you at an unreasonable time and sure enough you havent even gone to bed yet have you this conversation didnt seem to be making sense your father and i went to a company party we just got back to our hotel room i thought id call and make sure that youre all right im fine i said are you remembering to bring in the newspaper and the mail mom i live here oh i know she said im sorry i asked your father keeps telling me that youre a mature young woman and hes right its silly of me to worry about you are you having fun mom i asked oh yes she said and meeting ail sorts of nice people which im sure youre doing too you bet i said well give my love to dad i love you mom i love you too sweetheart she said i put the receiver back in its cradle and said good night fran ill see you tomorrow ill bring breakfast he said no i told him tomorrow im going to sleep late lunch then he said ill pick up some hamburgers and fries we can eat them before we go to the hotel i cant stay and go home with you tomorrow night my aunt and uncle are taking us to the athens bar and grill my uncle wants to try some greek dancing fran made a face he doesnt dance very well in any language hamburgers will be great i told fran and his eyes brightened i looked again at the scrap of paper i still held maybe if we talk about all this and share ideas we can get a better idea of whats going on at the ridley do you want me to take that paper with me he asked no i said im not afraid i dont think that anyone but you knows i have it he hadnt moved so i walked to the front door and opened it my mind was on the list so i was taken unaware when fran reached up pulled my head down and kissed me goodnight it wasnt a quick kiss and it wasnt a long passionate kiss it was one of those justright kisses that are warm and soft and absolutely wonderful i couldnt help enjoying it finally fran pulled away see you tomorrow he said i shut the door and leaned against it clamping my lips tightly together they wouldnt stop overreacting why couldnt fran be taller somewhere i told myself firmly there is someone just for you who is tall and gorgeous dont be so unhappy because fran isnt i felt a lot better until i got the uncomfortable thought that somewhere just for fran there was a girl who was short and beautiful darn life was just too complicated before i went to bed i copied the information on that list and hid the copy under the mattress on my bed then i folded the paper just as it had been folded and put it back into the locket i didnt have a picture to substitute for dolly partons so i put her back too complete with plastic and gold rim snapping it all into place il was too late to call detective jarvis and tell him about the list id do it tomorrow that is later today it was already tomorrow i slept with the bathroom and kitchen lights on and conducted the entire overture to the nutcracker suite before i fell asleep sometime after the sun had come up the ring of the telephone shot through my dream i swam through the shattered pieces reached for the receiver and pulled it under the covers i didnt even open my eyes hello mom i mumbled its not your mom its tina mummmph i said i heard about your solving the problem of the stolen meat great work mummph lamars going to station nate out at the garbage bins tonight glad its not me mummph anyhow congratulations ill see you tomorrow i reached out and hung up the phone immediately drifting back into my dream which obligingly pulled itself together and went off in another direction time doesnt exist in dreams so i dont know how much of it passed before the telephone rang again once more i pulled the receiver under the covers and tried to mumble something this time it was mr parmegan he was brusque clipped and kept it short that was fine with me that meant i didnt have to say anything i was apprised by mr boudry about your work of detection last night he said im thanking you by telephone because with the number of appointments i have on my schedule for today i would not be able to thank you in person thank you i echoed youre welcome he said and hung up i did too i floated back into my warm dark comfortable place when the telephone rang again i automatically brought the receiver in with me without coming to full consciousness its me an umhmmm i said so what went on why does everyone ask me about soledat why dont they just talk to lamar i murmured there was a pause i didnt get all the details he said fill me in you know tonight i murmured and tried to turn over without losing the phone art said something else but i tuned him out goodnight i mumbled and gave a gigantic yawn wake up art mart said im talking to you remember im your boss i groaned and tried to make myself think what time is it eleven art said oh then ive got to get up anyway thanks for waking me up goodbye liz are you listening to me stop rambling on and answer my question i made myself sit up that helped opening my eyes helped too what was the question did anything happen in the club that i should know about nothing then how come some of the stuff that belongs on the desk was scattered behind it on the floor i told him about the drunk in the sauna when i finished he said thats it i thought you were going to tell me something important youve just been wasting my time i growled into the telephone but hed already hung up theres nothing like being angry to help you wake up i stomped into the bathroom and washed my face and brushed my teeth i remembered that fran was coming over so i put on my new yellow shorts and knit shirt i wasnt wearing them for fran after all he was just a casual friend i was wearing them for myself they were comfortable and cute and looked good with my red hair well what was wrong with wearing them to please myself as i brushed my hair i wondered what was the matter with lamar boudry he had practically sworn fran and me to secrecy then he ended up telling half the people in the hotel about marco soledat i wouldnt be surprised if he hadnt notified soledat himself i called detective jarvis from my bedside telephone but he wasnt in he had gone to beaumont and would be back later in the day i didnt leave a message and i didnt want to talk to anyone else id wait telling him about the list wasnt that urgent i had just walked into the kitchen when the doorbell rang it was exactly twelve oclock and there was fran with hamburgers fries and strawberry frosties great i told him im starving but its not fair for you to keep paying for our food you bought the ice cream and the doughnuts too you pick up the tab next time he said okay i popped a couple of fries in my mouth and licked the hot grease and salt from my fingers next time for a change ill get mexican food no wait a minute next time ill make fajitas im not much of a cook but i make great fajitas we smiled at each other over our hamburgers we were both so hungry that we didnt say much until we had almost finished our strawberry frosties im looking forward to the symphony tomorrow night i said speaking of symphonies fran reached across the table and with his napkin wiped off my strawberry moustache i think you were right in the first place about all the crimes being orchestrated i couldnt have been you saw the deal with the stolen meat a oneman operation fran was smugly pleased with himself think about it when did soledat pick up the meat he had hidden in the garbage after he went off duty nope fran said his shift ends about the same time mine does and im through about fifteen minutes before you but soledat didnt pick up his meat packages until after you and tina would have left both times you saw him you had stayed later than usual couldnt he have timed our schedule himself too complicated there are a lot of people involved soon after you leave the night cleaning crew comes on and so forth so you think someone gave him the schedule i think its highly possible but who who would know the schedules well i said mr parmegan would and lamar i stopped and stared at fran couldnt anyone get hold of a schedule they must be written and in someones office sure he answered as long as it was someone with some kind of authority well it cant be lamar i said firmly have you got any other good ideas do you have some paper and a ballpoint he asked i got up and fished some out of the drawer under the wall phone in the kitchen fran began writing and i slipped into the chair next to him and leaned over his shoulder so i could see what he was doing youve drawn four circles same old circles he said maybe they can help us work this out when we did this before i put a box where the conductor would stand and put a k for mr kamara in it this time lets put a question mark in the box fran said as he wrote i leaned closer peering at the sheet of paper your question mark looks like a p i didnt promise calligraphy he said youll have to take what you get now first circle in the orchestra meat well write soledat on the line from the box to the circle fran leered and twirled an invisible moustache hell soon learn to play another tune i groaned and sat back thats awful besides weve got that one figured out go on to the sofa it would be more comfortable than this kitchen chair fran be serious whose name do we write on this line fran said thats a tough one the room was quiet and filled with the warm cozy pungency of onion and mustard a fat black bee buzzed and batted against the window and i could imagine my thoughts buzzing and batting inside my head trying to form an idea who would need those sofas i finally asked theyd never fit in a house fran said a mansion maybe people who could afford a mansion wouldnt need to steal sofas for it how about another hotel no good fran said a lot of travelers would come in and say oh those are the sofas that were stolen from the ridley not if they were recovered people would remember the fabric and color a recovered sofa would look very different its like when thieves steal a car they usually paint it another color he sat up straight and looked at the wall clock weve got time let me make a few telephone calls where are your yellow pages look up the pages for upholstering companies fran made one call after another each time someone answered he made his voice deeper and asked the same thing when are my two tenfoot sofas going to be ready and after each answer he mumbled a quick sorry i must have dialed the wrong number until the fourteenth call after his question and the answer that followed he snarled who am i you know who i am there was a pause and he said no this is not your brotherinlaw fran hung up the phone and sat at the table again he plopped his elbows on the table and rested his head on his hands do you know how many small upholstery companies there are in houston if i had stolen the sofas i said id lake them to a different city to be reupholstered fran groaned this is harder than i thought it would be not for the police i said thats one more thing i can tell detective jarvis about one more thing oh yeah the list fran said hed be the one to tell about it fran gleefully rubbed his hands together are we on a roll or are we on a roll sit down liz next up is the circle with stolen items in it i sat across from fran none of the silver or paintings or things are taken through the doors of the hotel garbage again no theyd have to be taken to the kitchen to be put into the garbage and everyone in the kitchen would see them we both thought for a long time until fran said i think with this one were up against a blank wall i bounced in my chair the wall fran the gap in the wall i know theyre taken out through the wall then theyd have to be taken into the health club people would see the things carried in unless theyre smuggled in not many people could smuggle a painting under a bathing suit very funny listen fran said other things must come into the club room service for instance sure i said food people are always ordering food and drinks but no one brings in silver pitchers or paintings believe me id notice is anything else brought into the club the custodians come in to clean it thered be a constant check on the custodians that wouldnt work i leaned back and sighed also where would they hide the stuff the only place in the health club would be the closet or the desk and deeley or i would see anything that didnt belong in either of those places i think wed better move on to the last circle fran had written wallet inside the circle i think we know a lot more about this operation than we did he said we do think about it he squeaked his chair back from the table and tilted it some of the cards were missing then put back you suspected that while the cards were out of the file the people on those cards had their wallets stolen by a pickpocket you know of that one case that franklin kurtin quaiser thats kurt quentin fraiser whatever according to detective jarvis c l jones was a known pickpocket and every day he came to the club and talked to mr kamara who else did jones talk to nobody that i know of who else did mr kamara talk to nobody except room service when he ordered something to eat didnt floyd parmlee always bring his order i jumped up and walked back and forth so excited i couldnt stand it yes and i saw mr kamara give him money so floyd could fit into the scheme frans chair nearly went over backward he grabbed the table edge righted himself and got up listen liz how about this floyd would be in a position to know who some of the big spenders were or who might open a fat wallet suppose he passed on that information to mr kamara who passed it on with the photoid cards to mr jones then after mr jones stole the money the three of them split it weve got it i said i grabbed fran and hugged him he hugged me back and i suppose we could have enjoyed the hug for a while longer except that he said but how did they get the cards from the file in the healthclub office i pulled back i dont know the answer to that so what do we do next i glanced up at the clock lets go to the health club well have a little over half an hour before we have to be on our jobs maybe we could look around maybe well get an idea i ran into the bedroom and pulled on my pink club tshirt and shorts and rejoined fran hows that for fast i asked him fine he said except you put your shirt on backward so i had to go back into the bedroom and switch it around i began to put the box with the locket in it into my plastic purse then changed my mind id better wear it i said i could tuck it down under the neck of my tshirt the chain would show fran said i know what ill do i took the locket out of the box and stuffed it into the hip pocket of my shorts the tshirt hung over the pocket covering it nicely is anyone going to be upset at our nosing around fran asked deeley wont care i said and she didnt you want to show your friend around the club be my guest deeley said answering the excuse id given her ill just take a look through the mens side fran said and went off murmuring very nice very nice hows everything going i asked deeley okay someone came and fixed the lock on the desk you can put your purse in here again wheres art mart went off for more towels we ran out real fast this morning had a big crowd fran came back looking puzzled nothing he mumbled to me deeley looked surprised its not that bad in fact the guests think its pretty nice well its got a great closet fran said opening the extra door in the office and poking his head inside hey deeley called thats not for the guests thats just our supplies closet dont mind him i said to deeley hes just nosy open shelves everything out in the open fran said he closed the door deeley was watching him suspiciously so i said come on fran lets sit by the pool and think uh talk we walked toward a pair of chairs that were under the ficus tree next to the pool i cant figure it fran said he flopped into one of the chairs staring up at the tree i sat in the other chair suddenly fran stiffened and clutched the arms of his chair do you know that tree isnt real he asked i thought you knew that he sat up and looked at the bark then he poked out a finger and touched it but this part is real mrs bandini explained it to me real trunk fake leaves otherwise theyd be all over the pool fran got to his feet what about the roots he poked at the bark chunks around the base of the tree glued he said with his knuckles he wrapped on the large brass planter it answered with a deep ringing bong i told you the tree is fake i said suddenly fran gripped the trunk of the ficus with both hands and pulled up and sideways the tree and the base swung upward leaving a large cavity in the huge brass planter underneath there it is fran said as we leaned over and stared into the empty planter the hiding place deeley called to us from the office doorway what are you two doing with that tree fran carefully lowered the ficus and its base back onto an inside rim that held it in place this tree needs a dentist he said to deeley definitely has a cavity maybe even needs a root canal deeley frowned at him thats supposed to be a joke he has a strange sense of humor i said to deeley i tried to act calm and composed but inside i was jumping up and down with excitement deeley went back into the office and i said to fran now we can tell lamar what we know not yet he said we dont know enough were guessing that the stolen objects were hidden in the planter but we dont know how they were taken from here a silver platter could go through the pool but it wouldnt help a painting anyone inside the club could walk out through the doors in the glass wall they open from inside even when theyre locked they just dont open from the outside for people trying to get in so the thief could just walk out with the loot i nodded eagerly right around the pool and through the gap in the wall now can we talk to lamar one more thing fran said how was the stolen stuff brought in here i leaned back in my chair darned if i know the door from the hotel opened as mrs bandini and mrs larabee came in mrs bandini was carrying a box about a foot square in addition to her usual gym bag they were dressed in almost identical purple jogging suits and mrs bandini had a green plaid scarf tied jauntily around her hair as soon as they spotted me they waved and yoohooed and bobbled toward us as fast as they could go their smiles grew even broader as they came to a stop fran and i got to our feet i introduced him mrs bandini included fran in her smile i remember you room service she said thats right fran answered youre a very nice boy pauly likes you she said then she turned to me her eyes sparkling ive got two surprises for you mary elizabeth the first one you can enjoy right now with great ceremony she put the box on the table and removed the lid it was filled with homemade cookies golden and crispy and rich with the fragrances of butter and vanilla wow fran said try one right now mrs bandini said to me im glad your young friend is here hell enjoy some too i wished she hadnt said that fran winced but it didnt stop him from reaching for a cookie under the bright light of her smile i tried a cookie too it dissolved into soft sugary explosions on my tongue these are great i said fran didnt say anything he was busy reaching for more cookies the door banged open and one of the deep towel carts pushed through with art mart guiding it the cart rattled over the tiles coming to a stop by the office door art looked over at us checked the clock and frowned because it was only ten until three and there was nothing he could complain about mrs bandini waved him over come have a cookie she said mary elizabeth wont mind art strolled over looked at the cookies and took one you made these liz mrs bandini made them but theyre her cookies mrs bandini said because i gave them to her for a present theyre not as fancy as mr kamaras present but theyre given with my fondest wishes art glanced sideways at me the cookie suspended halfway to his mouth mr kamaras present mrs larabee who had been quiet for too long and now saw a perfect opportunity to jump in immediately said a lovely cloisonnй locket on a gold chain he gave it to her for saving his life i closed my eyes and stifled a groan when was that art asked mrs larabee and mrs bandini rushed to give him all the details youre not wearing the locket art said to me where is it it wouldnt look right to wear it at work with my uniform i said i glanced at the clock and speaking of uniforms id better get to work its almost three oclock i didnt want to show anyone the locket until id talked to detective jarvis especially a jerk like art mart fran said ill just take one more cookie for good luck and ill see you later liz but how about later he said got to report to work on time deeley stood in the office doorway plastic purse in hand her eyes on me so i thanked mrs bandini again for the cookies picked up the box and hurried to the office art was right behind me stack the towels on the shelves right now he said to me then call housekeeping for someone to pick up the cart ill just have a couple of cookies before i leave deeley said and reached into the box i was afraid your crazy friend was going to eat all of them fran isnt crazy i said wondering why i felt so defensive hes nice any guy who fools around with the artificial trees and says theyve got cavities seems crazy to me what are you talking about art asked that ficus tree next to the pool deeley said its come loose i guess and her friend was poking around inside art scowled at me he didnt break it did he he didnt hurt anything i said i put the top on my box of cookies before they all disappeared tucked it on the ledge behind me and locked my purse in the bottom drawer of the desk see you tomorrow i said to deeley bye she answered and left art left too i didnt ask if hed be back i was just glad the old grouch was gone i was getting nervous about that locket and list in my hip pocket i decided if i couldnt give them to detective jarvis id give them to lamar fran may have put lamar on our list of suspects but i didnt agree i dialed the security office and tina answered lamars out of the building she said then lowered her voice as she added marco soledat had lunch duty today but he didnt show up for work lamar went to soledats address and found he moved his things out the apartment was rented furnished so soledat didnt have any trouble leaving in a hurry he must have been tipped off i said looks like it its lamars fault i said he told too many people about it he wouldnt do that tina began but i interrupted her tina some people are coming into the club and ive got lo lake care of them will you ask lamar to come here as soon as he gets back sure she said but why just tell him its important thanks i hung up just as a group sauntered into the office with bathing suits over their arms i handed them towels from the cart then put the rest of the towels on the closet shelves the cart was deep and i was almost out of breath from all that bending and stretching by the time the last towel was tucked into place i stood there staring at the towel cart while something wiggled in the back of my mind what why should the towel cart make me feel so uncomfortable i couldnt answer my question so i pushed the cart out of the path of traffic from the hotel to the healthclub office things werent working out as well as i had hoped they would for one thing i was disappointed about marco soledat lamar should have known better than to talk about it so much per instructions i called housekeeping to pick up the cart then set off for my usual beat in the pool area mrs bandini grinned at me as i neared her i didnt tell you about my other surprise for you she said it comes tomorrow what is it i was beginning to be curious my grandson eric who is very tall and very handsome didnt i tell you i wanted to get the two of you together well eric is very interested in meeting you after hearing all about you and what a lovely girl you are he told me he would like to come to the club with me and meet you i instinctively backed up so quickly i almost fell into the pool meet eric canelli it was the last thing in the world i wanted to do tall and handsome grandmothers are notoriously biased i could imagine that eric canelli was even more horrible than his little brother hed had a few years more time to practice i smiled mumbled something and got back to work wishing that lamar would show up a few hours later when the telephone rang i grabbed for it eagerly mr boudry i asked it decidedly wasnt lamar boudry this voice was high pitched and screeched with excitement it took a few moments for me to figure out who was speaking and what she was saying mrs zellendorf thats what i told you you said somebody is in our house i gulped and tried to breathe again somebody was she said was oh no did he rob the house i was shaking and couldnt stop i clutched the receiver as though it were an anchor you arent paying attention listen i saw someone in your bedroom but i knew you werent there because i saw you leave for work so i called the constable service they came in two and a half minutes did they catch him no but they scared him away as far as we could figure out he didnt have a chance to take anything was he some kind of a nut did he trash the house did he what oh you mean make a big mess no except in your bedroom and how much he did and how much you might have done i have no way of telling i had two teenaged girls and i know how girls dont always clean up their rooms the way they should mrs zellendorf i interrupted my heart was beating loudly and i wanted to shout at her are the police there should i come home no she said the burglar cut a little pane of glass in the back door but ive got someone coming out in a few minutes to fix it and i called your parents and reached your mother and theyre taking an early flight home today but theyre supposed to come home monday would you stay if your house was invaded no i said and then it occurred to me how much she had done thank you mrs zellendorf you were wonderful just being a good neighbor she said modestly with so much crime in the world we all have to look out for each other i could hear pleasure override the excitement in her voice i put down the telephone with shaking fingers i was glad my parents were on their way home id be afraid lo go into the house alone i had to sit still for a few minutes until i knew my knees would work right and my legs would hold me up the thought of some strange person in my own bedroom frightened me everyone in the club seemed to be happily entertaining themselves and each other so i wasnt needed at the moment i put in another call to the security office tina answered again lamars not back yet she said whats the problem can i help you no just tell him to come here when he gels in i said and hung up the phone i wished i could talk some more with fran but i might not see him for hours i could feel the locket pressing against my hip the content of that locket was driving me crazy tina showed up in a few minutes a few photoid cards in her hand its light on weekends she said all the convention guys have gone home she sighed wouldnt it be neat if some really goodlooking guy joined the club and came in every day i knew i could trust tina i had to tell someone i had to get some advice tina i said ive got something to give to lamar cookies she asked i saw all of you on camera stuffing your faces want some i asked to be polite no thanks she said im watching my figure tina i stammered mr kamara gave me a locket i heard about that and inside it was a picture of dolly parton do you expect me to get excited about that wait a minute behind the picture fran and i found a foldedup scrap of paper and on the paper was a list of names and some other stuff about dates and places i tried to get hold of detective jarvis but hes out of town so i want to give that list to lamar want me to take it to him no i said i think id better give it to him myself where is the locket i just stared at her suddenly i was afraid of everything and everybody i couldnt answer anxiety attack she said calmly youre wondering now if you should have told me about the list youre worried about what the list is because youve dramatized it out of proportion you act as though its not important it probably isnt the guy who packed dolly partons pictures in row after row of lockets probably accidentally dropped it in yours and didnt notice maybe its a list of his old friends or something from an appointment book maybe tina took a few cookies just to be sociable she said and left the club i sat at the desk studied and bled the photoid cards on saturday there wasnt such a rush near dinnertime in fact most people had plans for the evening and cleared out early i hoped fran would drop by but he didnt as it got closer and closer to eleven oclock i became more edgy where was lamar two people stayed in the pool and i was so glad to see them that i grinned and waved each time they glanced at the office window i rushed through the inspection of the womens dressingroom area nearly colliding with the woman swimmer as she came in to change leaving so early i asked she looked at me oddly i thought youd have kicked us out by this time its already two minutes after eleven well so it is i chuckled and went back to the office to wait for them they came through the office almost together and said a quick goodnight i heard the door to the hotel corridor shut behind them i raced into the mens locker area mumbling under my breath that i had to pick up more towels than there had been swimmers and dashed back to the office i removed my purse from the desk and tossed the desk keys into the top middle drawer taking a deep breath i turned off all the lights in the club and tried to lock the office door my fingers shook as i kept trying to put the key in upside down i closed my eyes leaning my head against the door and made myself relax then calmly i inserted the key turned it and heard the familiar click of the lock sliding into place that wasnt all that i heard slowly i turned around summer moonlight drenched the outer pool brightening a wake of ripples that followed the dark shape that sped toward me under the glass wall i turned too quickly stumbled lost my balance and fell to my knees i clawed and scrambled my way up trying to run toward the door to the hotel there was a loud splash behind me and i could hear a body shove up onto the tiles i couldnt make it whats the matter liz are you still afraid of the dark i whirled to face art mart then leaned against the wall in relief its only you i said you scared me to death i didnt even know you were here why didnt you tell me you were in the pool before i turned out the lights i didnt want to bother you he said he moved closer to me bent over and shook the water from his hair dont you want a towel i asked i stepped toward the office door unlocked it and turned on the office light he came into the office with me took the towel on top of the stack by the door and rubbed his face hair and shoulders have you looked inside your locket he asked the one mr kamara gave you i tried to take a step away from him but the office was too small and art mart was between me and the door what are you talking about i managed to ask a list he said i know its got to be in there give me the locket and ill show you i cant its its at home no it isnt just the empty jewelry box on the table he moved a step closer to me give me the locket liz and save yourself a lot of trouble he snatched my purse from my hand it didnt take him long to see that the locket wasnt in my wallet i gave the list to lamar i told him thats not what i heard he said tina told you uhuh i overheard you talking to her he chuckled you werent very bright to do that i tried to distract him hoping i could edge toward the open door what kind of a list is it he snickered at a joke he thought only he could understand you might say its a kind of membership list yeah for a club you mean for a syndicate his eyes widened you know more than i suspected you did why do you want the list the bottom line is always money isnt it whos going to pay you for it the same guys who killed jones because he took it art shifted his weight to the balls of his feet as though he was ready to move toward me and i desperately asked another question maybe his ego would help me mr jones didnt know whose wallet he was taking did he one eyebrow lifted you know that too so do the police if i thought id frighten him i was wrong so i added those syndicate men will kill you too naw he said i did them a favor they thought theyd get the list when they killed jones they didnt know he had passed it on to kamara they killed mr kamara he didnt answer but his eyes told me how wrong i was i gasped you kamara made his first mistake in telling me he had the list his second was in refusing to give it to me i blurted out you conducted the orchestra didnt you what orchestra what are you talking about i figured out that floyd told mr kamara who the people with money were and he passed the word to mr jones now i know who gave them the photoid cards you did he was still listening so i began to move a half inch at a time toward the doorway talking rapidly and floyd maybe other people in the hotel used the clubs towel cart to hide valuables in you were the only one who brought the cart to the club in the mornings before the club opened you stashed the stolen things in the brass planter under that ficus tree then after the club was closed and dark someone i stopped remembering it was you i saw in the pool wasnt it you came into the club through the gap in the wall and the pool and look away the things that had been stolen i pointed at the tree and as he automatically turned to look i sidled another inch toward the doorway there are still things i dont know i said i dont know who fenced the things for you maybe it was mr kamara and i dont know who stole the sofas but the police will find them before they get reupholstered he gave a start howd you work that one out i moved one more inch he hadnt seemed to notice by this time i was practically babbling and i dont know why lamar told you about setting a trap for marco soledat but art grinned he didnt you did no i didnt you should be more careful what you say when youre sleepy i tried to dodge but he took a long step toward me and grabbed me tightly i wiggled and struggled until i heard art exclaim so there it is in one motion he ripped away the hip pocket of my shorts grabbed the locket and slammed me against the wall he kept his sharp elbow pressed against my ribs as he opened the locket tearing out the picture and unfolding the list he looked so pleased with himself that for an instant i had the wild hope that hed let me go but he gripped my shoulders turning me and pushing me so that i stumbled ahead of him he turned off the office light and shoved me to the edge of the swimming pool at my feet lapped the deep black water lets go swimming liz art said lets not a strong deep voice called from the darkness art whirled dragging me against him and hooked his right arm across my throat and chin shapes rose and flung themselves toward us stay away art yelled as he kept moving back along the edge of the pool with a rush all the lights in the club zapped away the dark and i blinked trying to adjust to the sudden brightness lamar stood there and detective jarvis who held a gun in his hand tina was behind them eyes as wide as though she were at a horror movie stay away art repeated its too late for you to make such a dramatic move mr martin detective jarvis said youre not going to get the list art yelled at them he tossed the crumpled paper into the pool i could imagine the ink running and fading as the paper soaked in the chlorinated water arts voice rose i squirmed and his arm was rough under my nose i could smell the damp sourness of his fear or maybe it was my own fear if you get near me ill break her neck he said no i mumbled and wanted to spit out the hair on his arm that brushed my tongue feeling more like a trapped animal than a human being i instinctively opened my mouth as wide as i could and bit down on his arm with all of my strength i dont know what happened next i was knocked aside so violently that i went flying into the pool so did art mart they told me later except my right foot clipped him under the chin and he slammed into the tile edge knocking himself cold i panicked and swam with all my strength to the other side of the pool it was something like being in the water with a killer shark all i wanted was out i struggled up the steps and there was tina who hugged me even though i dripped cold water all over her liz you were wonderful you were brave how did you do that with your foot do what she hugged me again there you go she said already your subconscious is repressing the terrifying memory and forcing it from your conscious mind i kicked him didnt i thats right over tinas shoulder i could see the door open two very familiar people came into the club my mothers here i said and my father oh dear tina said i wish i had my degree and training i dont know how to handle this one mary elizabeth my mother shouted from behind tina what is going on here i ran to hold them tightly ill tell you all about it i said and after we were finally home and i was wrapped snugly in my fathers big terrycloth robe and my mothers fuzzy sheepskin slippers i did having a day off didnt mean a thing i had to go downtown to give all sorts of information to detective jarvis and someone from the district attorneys office and all sorts of other people they were awfully glad i had copied the list from what i overheard those names were going to help them make a big drug bust sometime very soon i suspected that the woman who said she was mr kamaras sister might very well be included art mart wasnt so cocky now he was spilling names of accomplices in the hotel thefts so fast it was as if someone had tapped into a leak in his brain i was glad it was all over and glad that fran was there with me they left us alone for a few minutes and i leaned back in my chair how i spent my summer vacation i said fran smiled then youre supposed to write what you learned from it like crime doesnt pay i thought about my week plus at the health club thais not all i learned fran ive been discovering something kind of crazy most people want to be somebody else mrs bandini wants to look like the women who lead exercise classes on tv lamar wants to be glint eastwood tina wants to be an instantly rich psychologist and you want to be fa i stopped too late it didnt come out right and i didnt get a chance to try to make it better fran said everyone except you liz everyone except me what you mentioned all the people who wish they were someone else but youre different you wish other people would change to be the way you want them to be youve got some fantasy in your head and its all you can see so that you cant accept other people for who and what they are fran got up and walked out of the room i didnt call him back i felt as though he had punched me his words were more painful than art marts big ugly arm fran didnt understand i was trying to follow my fathers advice i didnt really want other people to change to suit me yes i did a sick pain poked around my stomach fran had really hurt me i didnt want to think about it any longer i felt horrible i knew what would comfort me i closed my eyes sat up straight in my chair and tried to imagine myself on the podium at jones hall with the houston symphony orchestra before me instruments tuned and ready each musician waiting for my command the musicians were like pieces in a puzzle neatly in place ready for me to take charge and tell them what to do is that why i wanted to be conductor of a symphony orchestra so i could make things happen the way i wanted them to happen to make people be the way i wanted them to be fran was a terrific person and i liked him but i hadnt been able to accept him the way he was fran was right i groaned and the musicians the instruments and jones hall dissolved with a poof detective jarvis came back into the room and said mary elizabeth were going to take you and francis back to the health club the attorney from the das office wants to view the scene and have you point out a couple of things fran and i didnt talk much in the car every time i thought about what he had said i wanted to cry and when we arrived at the health club there was no time to talk even if we had wanted to mrs bandini practically flew out of her chair and rushed to meet us mrs larabee was on her heels we heard we heard mrs bandini shouted although well be glad to hear it again straight from you mrs larabee said well need her for a few minutes detective jarvis told them its all right mrs bandini said graciously giving him permission as long as i have one minute in which to introduce her to my grandson eric canelli one minute detective jarvis said and he walked over to the office with the attorney fran just dropped into the nearest chair and stared at his shoes mrs bandini motioned and out of the pool climbed one of the most gorgeous guys ive ever seen on a scale of one to ten he was a thirtyfive his hair was black and thick and his eyes were as blue as the pool when its lit at night his smile was straight out of a dentists magazine i looked up up up he had to be six feet four mrs bandini hadnt been lying she hadnt even been exaggerating hi he said to me im glad to meet you they told us it was your day off so we didnt think youd come in its perfect that its your day off mrs bandini said ill make dinner reservations for all of us at vargos would you like that oh im sorry i said and tried to look at least a little bit sorry just to be polite ive got a date for tonight i stepped next to frans chair put a hand on his shoulder and gripped it tightly but mrs bandinis mouth opened and stayed open okay eric said ill see you around he walked back to the pool and dived into the water another good thing about eric canelli he wasnt slow to get a message detective jarvis motioned to us fran hopped up and took my hand we hurried to join jarvis in the healthclub office where he was explaining something to the attorney i didnt care what they were talking about i just cared that fran was holding my hand as snugly as i was holding his fran moved closer as we came to a halt and murmured you turned that guy down for me he may be tall and handsome i said but hes not you fran and youre the one i want to be with the telephone rang everyone else seemed to be busy so i automatically reached over and answered it liz tina exploded into the phone there is the most fantastic hunk out there in the pool hes unbelievable do you want to meet him i asked come down and ill introduce you i hung up as detective jarvis was saying if you dont mind well leave the two of you alone here for a few minutes were going to get mr boudry we want him to be in on this not at all fran said and after they left the office he whispered to me ways of being alone with you is something im planning to work on i liked that i was thinking exactly the same thing
