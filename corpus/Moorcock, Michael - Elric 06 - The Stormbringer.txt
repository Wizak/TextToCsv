this berkley book contains the complete text of the original edition storm brincer prologue there came a time when there was great movement upon the earth and above it when the destiny of men and gods was hammered out uponthe forge of fate when monstrous wars were brewed and mighty deeds were designed and there rose up in this time which was called the age of the young king doms heroes greatest of these heroes was a doomdriven ad venturer who bore a crooning rune blade that he loathed his name was brie of melnibone king of ruins lord of a scattered race that had once ruled the ancient world eiric sorcerer and swordsman slayer of kin despoiler of his home land whitefaced albino last of his line eiric who had come to kariaak by the weeping waste and had married a wife in whom he found some peace some surcease from the torment in him and eiric who had within him a greater destiny than he knew now dwelt in kariaak with zarozinia his wife and his sleep was troubled his dream dark one brooding night in the month of the anemone book one dead gods homecoming la which at long last erics fate begins to be revealed to hhn as the forces of law and chaos gather strength for the final battle which will decide the future of eirics world one above the rolling earth great clouds tumbled down and bolts of lightning charged groundwards to slash the midnight black split trees in twain and sear through roofs that cracked and broke the dark mass of forest trembled with the shock and out of it crept six hunched unhuman figures who paused to stare beyood the low hills towards the outline of a city it was a city of squat walls and slender spires of graceful towers and domes and it bad a name which the leader of the creatures knew kariaak by the weeping waste it was called not of natural origin the storm was ominous it groaned around the city of kariaak as the creatures skulked past the open gates and made their way through shadows towards the elegant palace where eiric slept the leader raised an axe of black iron in its clawed hand the group came to a stealthy halt and regarded the sprawling palace which lay on a hill urrounded by languorouslyscented gardens the earth shook as lightning lashed it and thunder prowled across the turbu lent sky chaos has aided us in this matter the leader grunted secalready the guards fall in magic slumber and our en trance is thus made simple the lords of chaos are good to their servants he spoke the truth some supernatural force had been at work and the warriors guarding eirics palace had dropped to tee ground their snores echoing the thunder the servants of chaos crept past the prone guards into the main courtyard and from there into the darkened palace unerringly they climbed twisting staircases moved softly along gloomy cor ridors to arrive at length outside the room where eiric and his wife lay in uneasy sleep as the leader laid a hand upon the door a voice cried out michael moorcock from within the room whats this what things of heu dis rupt my rest he sees list sharply whispered one of the creatures no the leader said he sleepsbut such a sorcerer as this eiric is not so easily lulled into a stupor we had best make speed and do our work for if be wakes it will be the harder he twisted the handle and eased the door open his axe half raised beyond the bed heaped with tumbled furs and silks lightning gashed the night again showing the white face of the albino close to that of his darkhaired wife even as they entered he rose stiffly in the bed and his crimson eyes opened staring out at them for a moment the eyes were glazed and then the albino forced himself awake shouting begone you creatures of my dreams the leader cursed and leaped forward but he had been in structed not to slay this man he raised the axe threateningly silenceyour guards cannot aid you eiric jumped from the bed and grasped the things wrist his face close to the fanged muzzle because of his albmoism he was physically weak and required magic to give him strength but so quickly did he move that he had wrested the axe from the creatures hand and smashed the shaft between its eyes snarling it fell back but its comrades jumped for ward there were five of them huge muscles moving beneath their furred skins eiric clove the skull of the first as others grappled with him his body was spattered with the things blood and brains and he gasped in disgust at the fetid stuff he managed to wrench his arm away and bring the axe up and down into the collarbone of another but then be felt his legs gripped and he fell confused but still battling then there came a great blow on bis head and pain blazed through him he made an effort to rise failed and fell back insensible thunder and lightning still disturbed the night when with throbbing head he awoke and got slowly to his feet using a bedpost as support he stared dazedly around him zarozinia was gone the only other figure in the room was the stiff corpse of the beast be had killed his blackhaired girlwife had been abducted shaking he went to the door and flung it open calling for his guards but none answered him his runesword stonnbnnger hung in the citys armoury stormb ringer and would take time to get his throat tight with pain and nwf he ran down the corridors and stairways dazed with anxiety trying to grasp the implications of his wifes disap pearance above he palace thunder still crashed eddying about in the noisy night the palace seemed deserted and he had the sodden feeling that he was completely alone mat he had been abandoned but as be ran out into the main courtyard and saw me insensible guards he realised at once that their lumber could not be natural realisation was coming even as he ran through the gardens through the gates and down to tihe city but mere was no sign of bis wifes abductors where bad they gone he raised his eyes to the shouting sky his white face stark and twisted with frustrated anger there was no sense to it why had they taken her he had enemies he knew but none who could summon such supernatural help who apart from himself could work this mighty sorcery that made the skies themselves shake and a city sleep to the house of lord voashoon chief senator of kariaak od father of zarozinia eiric ran panting like a wolf he banged with his fists upon the door yelling at the astonished servants within opcnl it is eiric hurryf the doors gaped back and he was through them lord voashoon came stumbling down the stair into the chamber his face heavy with sleep what is if eiric summon your warriors zarozinia has been abducted thoee who took her were demons and may be far from here by nowbut we must search in case they escaped by land lord voashoons face became instantly alert and he shouted terse orders to his servants between listening to el ites explanation of what had happened and i must have entrance into the armoury eiric con cluded t must have stonnbringeri but you renounced the blade for fear of its evil power over you lord voashoon reminded him quietly eiric replied impatiently ayebut i renounced the blade tar zarozinias sake too i must have stonnbringcr if i am to bring her back the logic is simple quickly give me the key in silence lord voashoon fetched the key and led eiric to michael moorcock the armoury where the weapons and armour of his ancestors was held unused for centuries through the dusty place strode eiric to a dark alcove that seemed to contain some thing which lived he heard a soft moaning come from the great black battle blade as he reached out a slimfingered white hand to take it it was heavy yet perfectly balanced a twohanded broad sword of prodigious size with its wide crosspiece and its blade smooth and broad stretching for over five feet from the hilt near the hilt mystic runes were engraved and even brie did not know what they fully signified again i must make use of you storrobringer he said as he buckled the sheath about his waist and i must conclude hat we are too closely linked now for less than death to sep arate us with that he was striding from the armoury and back to the courtyard where mounted guards were already sitting ner vous steeds awaiting his instructions standing before them he drew stonnbringer so that the swords strange black radiance flickered around him his white face as pallid as bleached bone staring out of it at the horsemen you go to chase demons this night search the country side scour forest and plain for those who have done this thing to our princess though its likely that her ibdnctors used supernatural means to make their escape we cannot be sure so searchand search well all through the raging night they searched but could find no trace of either the creatures or eirics wife and when dawn came a smear of blood in the morning sky his men re turned to karlaak where eiric awaited them now filled with the nigromantic vitality which his sword supplied lord eiricshall we retrace our trail and see if daylight yields a clue cried one he does not hear you another murmured as eiric gave no sign but then eiric turned his painracked head and he said bleakly search no more i have had time to mediate and must seek my wife with the aid of sorcery disperse you can do nothing further then he left them and went back towards his palace knowing that there was still ooc way of learning where zaro stormbringer xfala had been taken it was a method which he ullflced yet jt would have to be employed curtly upon returning eiric ordered everyone from his dumber barred the door and stared down at the dead thing to congealed blood was still on him but the axe with which be had stain it had been taken away by hs comrades eiric prepared the body stretching out its limbs on the floor he drew the shutters of the windows so that no tight fil tered into the room and lit a brazier in one corner it swayed on its chains as me oilsoaked rushes flared he went to a email chest by the window and took out a pouch from thia he removed a bunch of dried herbs and with a hasty gesture flung them on the brazier so that it gave off a sickly odour and die room began to fill with smoke then he stood over the corpse his body rigid and began to sing an incantation in the old language of his forefathers the sorcerer emperors of mdnibone the song seemed scarcely akin to human speech riling and falling from a deep groan to a highpitched shriek the brazier spread flaring red light over eirics face and grotesque shadows skipped about the room on the floor the dead corpse began to stir its ruined head moving from side to ride eiric drew his runesword and placed it before him his two hands on the hilt arise soulless one he com manded slowly with jerky movements the creature raised itself stiffly upright and pointed a clawed finger at eiric its glazed eyes staring as if beyond him an mis it whispered was preordained think not that you can escape your fate eiric of melnibone you have tam pered with my corpse and am a creature of chaos my masters win avenge me how your destiny is already laid down you win know soon enough tell me dead one why did you come to abduct my wife who sent you hither where has my wife been taken three questions lord eiric requiring three answers you know that the dead who have been raised by sorcery can an swer nothing directly ayethat i know so answer as you can then listen well for i may recite only once my reed and michaelmoorcock then must return to the netherregions where my being may peacefully rot to nothing listen beyond the ocean brews a baffle beyond the battle blood shall fau if elfins kinsman ventures with him to a place where manforsaken dwells the one who should not live then a bargain shall be entered bines wife shall be restored with this die dung fell to die floor and did not stir thereafter eiric went to die window and opened the shutters used as be was to enigmatic verseomens this one was difficult to uo ravel as daylight entered the room the rushes spluttered and die smoke faded beyond the ocean there were many oceans he resheathed his runesword and climbed on to the disor dered bed to lie down and comtemplate die reed at last af ter long minutes of this contemplation he remembered something he had heard from a traveller who bad come to kariaak from tarkesh a nation of me western continent beyond the pale sea the traveller had told him how diere was trouble brewing between me land of dharijor and me other nations of me west dharijor had contravened treaties she had signed with her neighbouring kingdoms and had signed a new one with me theocrat of pan tang pan tang was an unholy island dominated by its dark aristocracy of warriorwizards it was from here mat bines old enemy theleb kaarna had come its capital of hwamgaari was called the city of screaming statues and until recently its residents had had little contact with the folk of die outside world jagreen lern was me new theocrat and an ambitious man his alliance with dharijor could only mean mat be sought more power over the nations of the young kingdoms the traveller bad said dial strife was sure to break out at any moment since diere was ample evidence that dharijor and pan tang had entered a war al liance now as his memory improved eiric related mis informa tion with me news he had had recently that queen yiabana stormbringer of ibarkor a neighbouring kingdom to dharijor had recruit ed tfae aid of dyvim slorm and his imrryrian mercenaries and dyvim slorm was eirics only kinsman this meant that jharkor must be preparing for battle against dharijor the two facts were too closely linked with die prophecy to be ig nored even as he thought upon it be was gathering his clothes together and preparing for a journey there was nothing for ft but to go to jharkor and speed ily for diere he was sure to meet his kinsman aod diere also diere would soon be a battle if all die evidence were true yet the prospect of die journey which would take many days caused a cold ache to grow in his heart as be thought of me weeks to come in which be would not know how his wife fared no time for that he told himself as he laced up bis black quilted jacket action is all mats required of me nowand speedy action he held me sheathed runeblade before him staring beyond it into space swear by arioch diat tfiose who have done mis whedier diey be man or immortal shall suffer from their deed hear me arioch that is my oadi but his words found no answer and be sensed diat arioch bis patron demon had either not heard him or else heard bis ath and was unmoved then he was striding from me deathheavy chamber yell ing for bis horse two where the sighing desert gave way to the borders of ilmiora between the coasts of the eastern continent and the lands of tarkesh dharijor and shazar there lay the pale sea it was a cold sea a morose and chilling sea but ships pre ferred to cross from ilmiora to dharijor by means of it rather than chance the weirder dangers of the straits of chaos which were lashed by eternal storms and inhabited by malevolent seacreatures on the deck of an umioran schooner eiric of melnibone stood wrapped in his cloak shivering and staring gloomily at the cloudcovered sky the captain a stocky man with blue humorous eyes came struggling along the deck towards him he had a cup of hot wine in his hands he steadied himself by clinging to a piece of rigging and gave the cup to eiric thanks said the albino gratefully he sipped the wine how soon before we make the port of banarva captain the captain pulled the collar of his leather jerkin about his unshaven face were sailing slow but we should sight the tarkesh peninsula well before sunset banarva was in tarkesh one of its chief trading posts the captain leaned on the rail i wonder how long these waters wffl be free for ships now that wars broken out between the kingdoms of the west both dharijor and pan tang have been notorious in the past for their piratical activities theyll soon extend them un der the guise of war itl warrant eiric nodded vaguely his mind on other things than the prospect of piracy disembarking in me chilly evening at the port of banarva eiric soon saw ample evidence that war darkened the lands of the young kingdoms there were rumours rife talk of nothing but battles gained and warriors lost from the con stormbringer fined gossip he could get no dear impression of how the war went save that the decisive battle was yet to be fought loquacious banarvans told him that all over the western continent men were marching from myyrrhn he heard the winged men were flying from jharkor the white leopards queen yishanas personal guard ran towards dharijor while dyvim slonn and his mercenaries pressed northwards to meet them dharijor was the strongest nation of me west and pan tang was a formidable ally more for her peoples occult knowledge man for her numbers next in power to dharijor came jharkor who with her allies tarkesh myyrrhn and shazar was still not as strong as those who threatened the se curity of the young kingdoms for some years dharijor had sought an opportunity for conquest and the hasty alliance against her had been made in an effort to stop her before she had fully prepared for con quest whether this effort would succeed eiric did not know and those who spoketo him were equally uncertain the streets of banarva were packed with soldiers and sup ply trains of horses and oxen the harbour was filled with warships and it was difficult to find lodgings since most inns and many private houses had been requisitioned by the army and it was the same all over the western continent every where men strapped metal about them bestrode heavy charg ers sharpened their arms and rode beneath bright silken banners to slay and to despoil here without doubt eiric reflected he would find the battle of uie prophecy he tried to forget his tormented long ing for news of zarozinia and turned bis moody eyes towards the west stormbringer hung like an anchor at his side and ho fingered it constantly hating it even as it fed him his vitality he spent the night in banarva and by morning had hired a good horse and was riding through the sparse grassland towards jharkor across a wartorn world rode eiric his crimson eyes burn ing with a fierce anger at the sights of wanton destruction he witnessed although be had himself lived by his sword for many years and had committed acts of murder robbery and urbicide he disliked the senselessness of wars such as this of men who killed one another for only the vaguest of reasons it was not that he pitied the slain or hated the slayers he was too remote from ordinary men to care greatly about what michael moorcock they did yet in bis own tortured way he was an idea t who because be lacked peace and security himself resulted the sights of strife which this war brought to him his ances tors he knew had also been remote yet they had delighted in the conflicts of the men of the young kingdoms observing mem from a distance and judging themselves above nidi ac tivities above the morass of sentiment and emotion in which these new men struggled for ten thousand years me sor cereremperors of memibone had ruled this world a race without conscience or moral creed unneedful of reasons for their acts of conquest seeking no excuses for their natural malicious tendencies but hric the last in the direct line of emperors was not like them he was capable of cruelty and malevolent sorcery had little pity yet could love and hate more violently than ever his ancestors and these strong pas sions perhaps had been the cause of his breaking with his homeland and travelling me world to compare himself against these new men since be could find none in memibone who shared his feelings and it was because of these twin forces of love and hate that be had returned to have ven geance on his cousin yyrkoon who had put cymorfl elric betrothed into a magic slumber and usurped me kingship of melnibone the dragon isle last territory of the fallen bright empire with the aid of a fleet of reavers eiric had razed inuryr in his vengeancetaking destroyed the dreaming city and scattered forever the race who had founded h so that the last survivors were now mercenaries roaming the worid to seq their arms to whomever bid highest love and bate they had led him to kill yyrkoon who deserved death and inadver tenfly cymoril who did not love and hate they welled in him now as bitter smoke stung his throat and be passed a straggling group of townspeople who were fleeing without knowledge of their direction from me latest depredation of the roving dharijorian troops who had struck far into this part of tarkesh and had met little hindrance from the armies of king hilran of tarkesh whose main force was concen trated further north readying itself for the major battle now eiric rode close to me western marches near the jharkorian border here lived sturdy foresters and harvesters in better times but now the forests were blackened and burnt and the crops of the field were mined his journey which was speedy for he wasted time took him through one of the stark forests where remnants of trees stormbrinoer cast cold silhouettes against me grey seething sky he raised the hood of his cloak over his bead so that the heavy black fabric completely hid his face and rode on as rain rushed suddenly down and beat through the skeleton trees sweeping across the distant plains beyond so that all the world seemed grey and black with the hiss of the rain a constant and de pressing sound then as he passed a ruined hovel which was half cottage and half hole in the earth a cawing voice called out lord eiricr astonished that he should be recognised he turned his bleak face in the direction of the voice pushing his hood back as he did so a ragged figure appeared in the holes opening it beckoned him closer puzzled he walked his horse towards the figure and saw that it was an old man or per haps a woman he couldnt tell you know my name how thou art a legend throughout the young kingdoms who could not recognise that white face and heavy blade thou art carrying true perhaps but i have a notion there is more to this than chance recognition who are you and how do you know the high speech of memibone eiric deliberately used the coarse common speech thou shouldst know mat all who practise dark sorcery use the high tongue of those who are pastmasters in its arts wouldst thou guest with me a while eiric looked at the hovel and shook his head he was fas tidious at the best of times the wretch smiled and made a mock bow restoring to the common speech and saying so the mighty lord disdains to grace my poor home but does he not perhaps wonder why the fire which raged through this forest a while ago did not in fact harm me aye said eiric thoughtfully that is an interesting riddle the hag took a step towards him soldiers came not a month gonefrom pan tang they were devil riders with weir hunting tigers running with mem they despoiled the harvest and burnt even the forests that those who fled them might not eat game or berries here i lived in this forest all my life doing a little simple magic and prophecy for my needs but when i saw the walls of flame soon to engulf me i cried the name of demon i knewa thinf from chftm which latterly i had dared not subudoil it cune savc me cried i and what would ye do in return aid the demon anything i quoth then bear this message for my masters it said when the fcinslayer known as eiric of melnibooe shall pass this way tell him that there is one kinsman he shall not slay and be will be found in sequaloris if brie loves his wife he will play his role if be plays it well his wife shall be returned so i fixed the message in my mind and now give it thee as i swore thanks said eiric and what did you give in the first place for the power to summon such a demon why my soul of course but it was an old one and not of much worth hell could be no worse man this existence then why did you not let yourself burn your soul unbar tered i wish to live said me wretch smiling again oh life is good my own life perhaps is squalid yet the life around me that is what i love but let me not keep you my lord for you have weightier matters on your mind once more the wretch gave a mock bow as eiric rode off puzzled but encouraged his wife still lived and was safe but what bargain must he strike before be could get her back savagely he goaded his horse into a gallop heading for se qualoris in jbarkor behind him faintly through die beating rain he heard a cackling at once mocking aod miserable now his direction was not so vague and be rode at great speedbut cautiously avoiding the roving bands of invaders imtil at length the arid plains gave way to the lusher wheat lands of the sequa province of jharfcor another days ride and eiric entered the small walled city of sequaloris which had so far not suffered attack here he discovered prepara tions for war and learnt news that was of greater interest to him the inutyriao mercenaries led by dyvim storm eirics cousin and son of dyvim tvar eirics old friend were due to arrive next day in sequaloris there had been a certain enmity between eiric and the inuryrians since the albino had been the direct cause of their need to leave the ruins of the dreaming city and live as mer cenaries but those times were past long since and on two previous occasions he and the imrryrians had fought on the same side he wu their leader by right and the tics of tradi tion were strong in the elder race eiric prayed to arioch that dyvim slorm would have aome due to his wifes where abouts at noon of the next day the mercenary army rode swag gering into the city eiric met them dose to the city gate the hnrryrian warriors were obviously weary from a long ride and were loaded with booty since before yishana sent for mem they had been raiding in shazar dose to the marshes of the mist they were different from any other race these imrryrians with their tapering faces slanting eyes and high cheekbones they were pale and slim with long soft hair drifting to their shoulders the finery they wore was not stolen but definitely meinibonean in design shimmering cloths of gold blue and green metals of delicate workman ship and intricately patterned they carried lances with long sweeping heads and there were slender swords at their sides they sat arrogantly in their saddles convinced of their supe riority over other mortals and were as eiric not quite hu man in their unearthly beauty he rode up to meet dyvim slorm his own sombre clothes contrasting with theirs he wore a tallcollared jacket of quilt ed leather black and buckled in by a broad plain belt at which hung a poignard and stonnbringer his milkwhite hair was held from his eyes by a fillet of black bronze and his breeks and boots were also black all mis black set off sharp ly his white skin and crimson glowing eyes dyvim slorm bowed in his saddle showing only slight sur prise cousin eiric so the omen was true what omen dyvim slorm a falconsyour name bird if i remember it bad been customary for melniboneans to identify new born children with birds of their choice thus eirics was a falcon hunting bird of prey what did it tell you cousin eiric asked eagerly it gave a puzzling message while we had barely gone from the marshes of the mist it came and perched on my shoulder and spoke in human tongue it told me to come to sequaloris and there i would meet my king from sequaloris we were to journey together to join yishana s army and the battle whether won or lost would resolve the direction of michael moorcock our linked destinies thereafter do you make sense of that cousin some eiric frowned but comei haw a place reserved for you at the inn i will tell you all i know over wineif we can find decent wine in this forsaken hamlet i need help cousin as much help as i can obtain for zaro zinia has been abducted by supernatural agents and i have a feeling that this and the wars are but two elements in a greater play then quickly to the inn my curiosity is further piqued this matter increases in interest for me first falcons and omens now abductions and strife what else i wonder are we to meet with the imrryrians straggling after diem through the cobbled streets scarcely a hundred warriors but hardened by their outlawed lift eiric and dyvim slorm made their way to the inn and there in haste eiric outlined all he had learned before replying his cousin sipped bis wine and carefully placed the cup upon the board pursing his lips i have a feeling in my bones that we are puppets in some struggle be tween the gods for all our blood and flesh and wul we can see none of the bigger conflict save for a few scarcely related details that may be so said eiric impatiently but fm greatly angered at being involved and require my wifes release i have no notion why we together must make the bargain for her return neither can i guess what h is we have that those who captured her want but if the omens are sent by the same agents then we had best do as we are told for the meantime until we can see matters more clearty then per haps we can act upon our own volition thats wise dyviro slorm nodded and fm with you in it he smued slightly and added whether like it or not i fancy eiric said where lies the main army of dharijor and pan tang i heard it was gathering it has gatheredand marches closer the impending battle will decide who rules the western lands im committed to yishanas aide not only because she has employed us to aid her but because i felt that if the warped lords of pan tang dominate these nations then tyranny will come upon them and they will threaten the security of the whole world it i a sad thing when a mclnibonean has to consider such problems he smiled ironically aside from that i like uiem not these aorcerou upstartsthey seek to emulate the bright empire aye eiric said they are an island culture as ours was they are sorcerers and warriors as our ancestors were but their sorcery is less healthy than ever ours was our ancestors committed frightful deeds yet it was natural to them these newcomers more human than we have perverted their hu manity whereas we never possessed it in the same degree there will never be another bright empire nor can their power last more than ten thousand years this is a fresh age dyvim slorm in more man one way the time of subtle sor cery is on the wane men an finding new means of har nessing natural power our knowledge is ancient dyvim slorm agreed yet so old is it that it has little relation to present events i think our logic and learning are suited to the past i think you are right said eiric whose mingled emotions were suited neither to past present nor future aye it is fit ting that we should be wanderers for we have no place in this world they drank in silence moodily their minds on matters of philosophy yef for all this eirics thoughts were forever turning to zarozinia and the fear of what might have befallen her the very innocence of this girl her vulnerability and her youth had been to some degree at least his salvation his protective love for her had helped to keep him from brooding too deeply on his own doomfilled life and her company had eased bis melancholy the strange reed of the dead creature lingered in his memory undoubtedly the reed had referred to a battle and the falcon which dyvin slorm had seen had spo ken of one also the battle was sure to be the forthcoming one between yishanas forces and those of sarosto of dhari jor and jagreen lem of pan tang if he was to find zaro zinia then be must go with dyvim slonn and there take part in uk conflict though he might perish he reasoned that he had best do as the omens orderedotherwise he could lose even the slight chance of ever seeing zarozinia again he turned to his cousin michael moorcock make my way with you tomorrow and use my blade in the battle whatever else i have the feeling that yisbana will need every warrior against the theocrat and his allies dyvim slorm agreed not only our doom but the doom of nations will be at stake in this three teaterrible men drove their yellow chariots down a black mountain which vomited blue and scarlet fire and shook in a spasm of destruction in such a manner all over the globe the forces of nature were disrupted and rebellious though few realised it the earth was changing the ten knew why and they knew of eiric and how their knowledge linked with him the night was pale purple and the sun hung a bloody globe over the mountains for it was late summer in the valleys cottages were burning as smoking lava smacked against the straw roofs sepiriz in the leading chariot saw the villagers running a confused rabblelike ants whose hills had been scattered he turned to the bluearmoured man behind him and he smiled almost gaily see them run he said see them run brother oh the joy of itsuch forces there are at work tia good to have woken at this time his brother agreed abouting over the rumbling noise of the volcano then the smile left sepiriz and his eyes narrowed he lashed at his twin horses with a bullhide whip so that blood laced the flanks of the great black steeds and they galloped even faster down the steep mountain in the village one man saw the ten in the distance he orieked voicing his fear in a warning the fire has driven them out of the mountain hidees cape t the men from the volcano have awakenedthey are coming the ten have awakened according to the prophecyit is the end of the world then the mountain gushed a fresh spewing of hot rock and flaming lava and the man was struck down screamed as he burned and died he died needlessly for the ten had no interest in him or his fel lows michael moorcock sepiriz and his brothers rode straight through the village their chariot wheels rattling on the coarse street the hooves of their horses pounding behind them the mountain bellowed to nihrainr cried sepiriz speedily brethren for there is much work to do a blade must be brought from limbo and a pair of men must befcund to carry it to xanyaw joy filled him as he saw the earth shuddering about him and heard the gushing of fire and rock behind him his black body glistened reflecting the flames of the burning houses the horses leaned in their harness dragging the bucking chariot at wild speed their hooves blurred movement over the ground so that it often seemed they flew perhaps they did for the steeds of nihrain were known to be different from ordinary beasts now they flung themselves along a gorge now up a moun tain path making their speedy way towards the chasm of nihrain the ancient home of the ten who had not returned there for two thousand years again sepiriz laughed he and his brothers bore a terrible responsibility for though they had no loyalty to men or gods they were fates spokesmen and thus bore an awful knowledge within their immortal skulls for centuries they had slept in their mountain chamber dwelling dose to the dormant heart of die volcano since ex tremes of heat and cold bothered them little now the spew ing rock had awakened them and they knew that their time bad comethe time for which they had been waiting for mfl lenia this was why sepriz sang in joy at last he and his broth ers were to be allowed to perform their ultimate functioo and this involved two melniboneans the two surviving mem bers of the royal line of the bright empire sepiriz knew they livedthey had to be alive for without them fates scheme was impossible but there were thorn upon the earth sepiriz knew who were capable of cheating fate so powerful were they their miaions lay everywhere particularly among the new race of men but ghouls and demons were also their tools this made his chosen task the harder but nowto nihrain to the hewn city and there to draw the threads of destiny into a finer net there was still a little stormbringer time but it was running short and time the unknown was master of all the pavilions of queen yishaoa and her allies were grouped thickly about a series of small wooded hills the trees afforded cover from a distance and do campfires burned to give away their position also the sounds of the great army were as muted as possible outriders went to and fro report ing die enemys positions and keeping wary eyes open for spies but eiric and his imrryrians were unchallenged as they rode in for the albino and his men were easily recognisable and it was wellknown that the feared melnibonean merco caries had elected to aid yishana eiric said to dyvim slorm i bad best pay my respects to queen yisbana on account of our old bond but i do not want her to know of my wifes disappearanceotherwise she may try to hinder me we shall just say that i have come to aid her out of friendship dyvim slorm nodded and brie left his cousin to tend to making camp while he went at once to yishanas tent where the tall queen awaited him impatiently the look in her eyes was shielded as he entered she had a heavy sensuous face that was beginning to show signs of age ing her long hair was black and shone around her head her breasts were large and her hips broader than eiric remem bered she was sitting in a padded chair and the table before her was scattered with battlemaps and writing materials parchment ink and quills good morning wolf said she with a halfsmile that was at ooce sardonic and provocative my scoots reported that you were riding with your countrymen this is pleasant have you forsaken your new wife to return to subtler pleasures no he said he stripped off his heavy riding cloak and flung it on a bench good morning yishana you do not change fve half a suspicion that theleb kaama gave you a draught of the waters of eternal life before i killed him perhaps he did how goes your marriage weu be said as she moved closer and he felt the warmth of her body and now tm disappointed she smiled ironically and shrugged they bad been lovers on different occasions in michael moorcock spite of the fact that eiric had been partially responsible for her brothers death during the raid on imrryr darmit of jharkor s death had put her on tee throne and being an am bitious woman she had not taken the news with too much sadness eiric bad no wish to resume the relationship how ever he turned immediately to the matter of the forthcoming battle i see youre preparing for more man a skirmish he said what forces have you and what are your chances of win ning there are my own white leopards she told him five hundred picked warriors who run as swiftly as horses are as strong as mountain cats and as ferocious as bloodmad sharksthey are trained to kin and killing is all they know then there are my other troopsinfantry and cavalry some eighty lords in command the best cavalry are from shazar wild riders but clever fighters and welldisciplined tarkesh has sent fewer men since i understand king hilran needed to defend his southern borders against a heavy attack however there are almost a thousand and fifty footsoldiers and some two hundred mounted men from tarkesh in all we can put perhaps six thousand trained warriors on the field serfs slaves and the like are also fighting but they will of course serve only to meet me initial onslaught and will die in the early part of the battle eiric nodded these were standard military tactics and what of the enemy we have more numbersbut they have dcva riders and hunting tigers there are also some beasts they keep in cagesbut we cannot guess what they are since me cages are covered i heard mat me men of mynhn are flying hither the im port must be great for them to leave their eyries if we lose mis battle she said gravely chaos could eas ily engulf the earth and rule over ft every oracle from here to shazar says the same thing that jagreen lern is but the tool of less natural masters that he is aided by the lords of chaos we we not only fighting for our lands eiric we are fighting for me human race then let us hope we win he said eiric stood among the captains as they surveyed the mobi lising anny tall dyvim slonu was by his side his golden stormbringer shirt loose on his slim body and his manner confident arro gant also here were hardened soldiers of many smaller cam paigns short darkfaced men from tarkesh with thick ar mour and black oiled hair and beards the halfnaked winged men from myynhn had arrived with their brooding eyes hawklike faces their great wings folded on their backs quiet dignified seldom speaking the shazariao commanders were there also in jackets of grey brown and black in rust coloured bronze armour with them stood the captain of yishana s white leopards a longlegged thickbodied man with blond hair tied in a knot at the back of his bullnecked head silver armour bearing the emblazon of a leopard albino like eiric rampant and snarling the time of the battle was drawing close now in me grey dawn tee two armies advanced upon each other coming from opposite ends of a wide valley banked by low wooded hills the army of pan tang and dhariior moved a tide of dark metal up the shallow valley to meet them eiric still unar rooured watched as they approached his horse stamping tho turf dyvim slonn beside him pointed and said look mere are the plotterssarosto on the left and jagreen lern on the rightl the leaders headed their army banners of daik silk rus tling above their helms king sarosto and his thin ally aquiline jagreen lena m glowing scarlet armour that seemed to be red hot and may have been on his helm was the mer man crest of pan tang for the claimed kinship with the seapeople sarostos armour was dull murky yellow embla zoned with me star of dharijor upon which was the cleft sword which history said was home by sarostos ancestor atarn the citybuilder behind them instantly observable came the devil riders of pan tang on their sixlegged reptilian mounts bred by sor cery it was said swarthy and with introspective expressions on their sharp faces they carried long curved sabres naked at their belts prowling among them came over a hundred hunting tigers trained like dogs with tusklike teeth and claws that could rend a roan to the bone with a single sweep beyond the rolling army as it moved towards them eiric could just see the tops of me mysterious cagewagons what weird beasts did they contain he wondered michael moorcock then yishana shouted a command the archers arrows spread a rattling black cloud above them as eiric led the first wave of infantry down the hill to meet the van of the enemy army that he should be forced to risk his life embittered him but if he was ever to discover zarozmias whereabouts he had to play out his ordered part and pray that he lived the main force of cavalry followed the infantry flanking it with orders to encircle the enemy if possible brightly dad irorryrians and bronzearmoured shazarians were to one side bluearmoured tarkeshites with brilliant plumes of red purple and white long lances levelled and goldarmoured jharkorians longswords already unscabbarded galloped on the other side in the centre of eirics advance phalanx loped yishanas white leopards and the queen herself rode beneath her banner behind the first phalanx leading a battalion of knights down they rushed towards the enemy whose own arrows rose upwards and then swept down to clash against helmets or thud into flesh now the sound ot warshouts smashed through the still dawn as they streaked down the slopes and clashed eiric found himself confronting lean jagreen lern and the snarling theocrat met stonnbringers swing with a flamered buckler which successfully protected himproving the shield to be treated against sorceroua weapons jagreen lems features wrinkled into a malicious smile as he recognised eiric i was told youd be here whiteface i know you eiric and i know your doom too many men appear to know my destiny better than i said the albino but perhaps if i slay you theocrat i may force the secret from you before you die oh no that is not my masters plan at all well mayhap tis mine he struck again at jagreen lem but again the blade was turned screaming its anger he felt it move in his hand felt it throb with chagrin for normally the hellforged blade could slice through metal however finely tempered in jagreen lenas gauntleted right hand was a huge war axe which he now swung at the unprotected head of eirics horse this was odd since he was in a position to strike at ei ric himself the albino jerked his steeds head to one side stormbringer avoided the blow and drove again point firet at jagreen lcros midriff the runeblade shrieked as it failed to pierce the armour the waraxe swung again and eiric brought up his sword as protection but in astonishment was driven back in his saddle by the force of the blow barely able to control bis horse one foot slipping from the stirrup jagreen lern struck again and successfully split the skull of elric s horse which crumpled to its knees blood and brains gushing great eyes rolling as it died flung from the beast eiric rose painfully and readied himself for jagreen lerns next blow but to his surprise the sorcererking turned away and moved into the thick of the battle sadly your life is not mine to take whiteface that is the prerogative of other powers if you live and we are the vic torsi will seek you out perhaps unable in his dazed condition to make sense of this eiric looked desperately around for another horse and saw a dhar ijorian mount its head and foreparts well protected by dented black armour running loose and away from the fight swiftly he leapt for its harness and caught a dangling rein steadied the beast got a foot into a stirrup and swung himself up in the saddle which was uncomfortable for an unar moured man standing in the stirrups eiric rode it back into the battle he hewed his way through the enemy knights slaying now a devil rider now a hunting tiger that lashed at him with bared fangs now a gorgeously armoured dharijorian com mander now two footsoldiers who struck at him with hal berds his horse reared like a monster and desperately he forced it closer to the standard of yishana until be could see one of the heralds yishanas army was fighting bravely but its discipline was lost it must regroup if it was to be most effective recall the cavalryf eiric yelled recall the cflvafryf the young herald looked up he was badly pressed by two devil riders his attention diverted he was skewered on a devil riders blade and shrieked as the two men butchered him cursing eiric rode closer and struck one of the attackers in the side of the head the man toppled and fell into the churned mud of the field the other rider turned only to michael moorcock meet howling stormbringera point and he died yelling the runeblade dranic his soul the herald still mounted was dead in the saddle his body a mass of cuts eiric leaned forward tearing toe bloody horn from around the corpses neck placing it to his lips he sounded thecavalry recall and caught a glimpse of horse men turning now he saw the standard itself begin to fan and realised that the standardbearer was slain he rose in the saddle and grasped the pole which bore the bright flag of jharkor and with this in one band the horn at his ups at tempted to rally his forces slowly the remnants of the battered army gathered around him then eiric taking control of the battle did the only thing he couldtook the sole course of action which might save the day he sounded a long wailing note on the bom in response to this he heard the beating of heavy wings as the men of myyrrhn rose into the air observing this the enemy released the traps of the mysteri ous cages eiric groaned with despair a weird hooting preceded the sight of giant owls thought extinct even in myyrrhn the land of their origin circling sky ward the enemy had prepared against a threat from the air and by some means had produced the ageold enemies of the men of myyrrhn only slightly daunted by this unexpected sight the men of myyrrhn armed with long spears attacked the great birds the embattled warriors on the ground were showered with blood and feathers corpses of men and birds began to flop downwards crushing infantry and cavalry beneath them through this confusion eiric and the white leopards of yishana cut their way into the enemy to join up with dyvim slorm and his imrryrians the remnants of the tarkeshite cavalryand about a hundred shazarians who had survived looking upward eiric saw that most of the great owls were destroyed but only a handful of the men of myyrrhn had sur vived the fight in the air these having done what they could against the owls were themselves circling about preparing to leave the battle obviously they realised the hopelessness of it au stormbringer eiric cried to dyvim slorm as their forces joined the battles lostsarosto and jagreen lern rule here now dyvim slorm hefted hl longsword in his hand and gave eiric a look of assent if were to live to keep our destiny wed best make speed away from here he cried there was little more they could do zarozinias life is more important to me than anything else eiric yelled lets look to our own predicament but the weight of the enemy forces was like a vice crush ing eiric and his men blood covered eirics face from a blow he had received on the forehead it clogged his eyes so that he had to keep raising his left hand to his face to get rid of the stuff his right arm ached as he lifted stormbringer again and again hacking and stabbing about him desperate now for al though the dreadful blade had a life almost an intelligence of its own even it could not supply the vitality which eiric needed to remain entirely fresh in a way he was glad for be hated the runesword hough he had to depend on the force which flowed from it to him stormbringer more than slew elric s attackersit drank heir souls and some of that life force was passed on to he melniboneao monarch now the ranks or the enemy fell back and seemed to open through this selfmade breech animals came running ani mals with gleaming eyes and red fangfilled jaws animals with claws the hunting tigers of pan tang horses screamed as the tigers leapt and rended them tear ing down mount and man and slashing at the throats of their victims the tigers raised bloody snouts and stared around for a new prey terrified many of eirics small force fell back shouting most of the tarkeshite knights broke and fled the field precipitating the flight of the jharkorians whose mad dened horses bore them away and were soon followed by the few remaining shazarians still mounted soon only eiric his imrryrians and about forty white leopards stood against the might of dharijor and pan tang eiric raised his horn and sounded the retreat wheeled his black steed about and raced up the valley imrryrians behind him but me white leopards fought on to the last yishana had said that they knew nothing but how to kill evidently they also knew how to die michael moorcock eiric and dyvim slorm led the imrryrians up the valley halfthankful that the white leopards covered their retreat the melnibonean had seen nothing of yishana since he had clashed with jagreen lera he wondered what had become of her as they turned a bend in the valley brie understood the foil battleplan of jagreen lern and his allyfor a strong fresh force of footsoldiers and cavalry had assembled at the other end of the valley for the purpose of cutting off any re treat made by bis army scarcely thinking eiric urged his horse up the slopes of the hills his men following ducking beneath the low branches of the birch trees as the dharijoriana rushed towards them spreading out to cut off their escape eiric fumed his horse about and saw that the white leop ards were still fighting around the standard of jharkor and he headed back in that direction keeping to the hills over the crest of the hills he rode dyvim slorm and a handful of imrryrians with him and then they were galloping for open countryside while the knights of dharijor and pan tang gave chase they had obviously recognised eiric and wished either to kill or to capture him ahead eiric could see that the tarkeshites shazarians and jharkorians who had earlier fled had taken the same route out as he had but they no longer rode together were scatter ing away eiric and dyvim slorm fled westwards across unknown country while the other imrryrians to take attention off their leaders rode to the north east towards tarkesh and perhaps a few days of safety the battle was won the minions of evil were the victors and an age of terror had settled on the lands of the young kingdoms in the west some days later eiric dyvim slorm two hnrryrians a tarkeshite commander called yedapadjuizev badly wound ed in the side and a shazarian footsoldier orion who had taken a horse away from the battle were temporarily safe from pursuit and were trudging their horses wearily towards a range of slimpeaked mountains which loomed black against the red evening sky they had not spoken for some hours yednpadjuizev was stormbringer obviously dyine and they could do nothing for him he knew this also and expected nothing merely rode with them for company he was very tall for a tarkeshite his scarlet plime still bobbing on his dented bluemetal helmet his breastplate scarred and smeared with his own blood and others his beard was black and shiny with oil his nose a juttin crag on the rock of his soldiers face his eyes halfgazed he was bearing the pain well though they were impatient to reich the comnarative safety of the mountain range the others matched their pace to his half in respect and half in fascina tion that a man could cling to life for so long night came and a great yellow moon hung in the sky over the mountains the sky was completely clear of cloud and stars shone brightly the warriors wished that the night had been dark stormcovered for they could have then soneht more security in the shadows as it was the night was liemed and they could only hope that they reached the mountains soonbefore the hunting tigers of pan tang discovered their tracks and they died under the rending claws of those dread ful beasts eiric was in a grim and thoughtful mood for a while the dhariiorian and pin tane conauerors would be busy consoli dating their newwon empire perhaps there would be quar rels between them when this was done perhaps not but soon anyway they would be very powerful and threatening the security of other nations on the southern and eastern continents but all this however much it overshadowed the fate of the whole world meant little to eiric for he still could not clearly see his way to zarozinia he remembered the dead creatures prophecy part of which had now come about but still it meant little he felt as if he were being driven constantly westwards as if he must go further and further into the sparselysettled lands beyond jharkor was it here his destiny lay was it here that zarozinias captors were beyond the ocean brews a battle beyond the battle blood shall fall well had the blood fallen or was it yet to fall what waa the twin that eirics kinsman dyvim slorm bore who was the one who should not live perhaps the secret lay in the mountains ahead of them beneath the moon they rode and at last came to a gorge michael moorcock halfway along it they located a cave and lay down inside to rest in the morning brie was awakened by a sound outside the cave instantly he drew stonnbringer and crept to the mouth of the cave what he saw caused him to sheathe the blade and call in a soft voice to the battered man who was riding up the gorge towards the cave here herald we are friends the man was one of yishanas heralds his surcoat was in ribbons bis armour crumpled on his body he was swordlesa and without a helmet a young man with bis face made gaunt by weariness and despair he looked up and relief came when he recognised eiric my lord eiricthey said you were slain on the field im glad they did since that makes pursuit less likely come inside the others were awake nowall but one yednpadjuizev had died sleeping in the night orozn yawned and jerked a thumb at the corpse if we do not find food soon be tempted to eat our dead friend the man looked at brie for response to this jest but seeing the albinos expression be was abashed and retreated to the depths of the cave grumbling and kicking at loose stones eiric leant against the wall of the cave near the opening what news have you he asked dark news my lord from shazar to tarkesh black misery prevails and iron and fire beat across nations like an unholy storm we are fully conquered only small bands of men carry on a hopeless struggle against the enemy some of our folk are already talking of turning bandit and preying on each other so desperate have times become eiric nodded such is what happens when foreign allies are beaten on friendly soil what of queen yishana she fared ill my lord clad in metal she battled against a score of men before expiringher body torn asunder by the force of their attack sarosto took her bead for a keepsake and added it to other trophies including the hands of kamari his halfbrother who opposed him over the pan tang alliance the eyes of peoik of nargesser who raised an army against him in that province theocrat jagreen lero ordered that all other prisoners be tortured to death and hanged in chains stormbringer through the lands as warning against insurrection they are an unholy pair my lordt eirics mouth grew tight when he heard this already h was becoming clear to him that his only route was westwards for the conquerors would soon search him out if he went back he turned to dyvim slonn the imrryrians shirt was in raffs and his left arm covered in dried blood our destiny appears to lie in the west he said quietly then let us make speed said his cousin for i am impa tient to get it over and at least learn whether we live or per ish in this enterprise we gained nothing by our encounter with the enemy but wasted time i pained something eiric said remembering his fight with jagreen lern i gained the knowledge that jagreen lern is connected in some way with the kidnapping of my wifeand if he had aught to do with it ill claim my ven geance no matter what now said dyvim slonn let us make haste to the west four they drove deeper into the mountains that day avoiding the few hunting parties sent out by the conquerors but the two imrryriaas recognising that their leaders were on a special journey left to go in another direction the herald was gone southward to spread his gloomy news so that only eiric dyvim slorm and orozn were left they did not welcome orozns company but bore with it for the meanwhile then after a day orozn disappeared and eiric and dyvim slorm ranged deeper into the black crags riding through tow ering oppressive canyons or along narrow paths snow lay on the mountains bright white against sharp black filling gorges making paths slippery and dangerous then one evening they came to a place where the mountains opened out into a wide valley and they rode with difficulty down the foothills of the mountains their tracks making great black scars in the snow and their horses steaming their breath billowing white in the cold air they observed a rider coming across the valley floor towards them one rider they did not fear so they waited for him to approach to their surprise it was orozn clad in fresh garments of wolfskin and deer hide he greeted them in a friendly manner i have come seeking you both you must have taken a more difficult route than mine from where have you come eiric asked his face was drawn his cheekbones emphasised by the sunken skin he looked more like a wolf than ever with his red eyes gleaming zarozinias fate weighed heavily on his mind there is a settlement nearby come i will take you to it they followed orozn for some way and it was getting near nightfall the setting sun staining the mountains scarlet when they reached the opposite side of the valley dotted with a few birch trees and further up a cluster of firs stormbringer orozn led them into this grove they came screaming out of the dark a dozen swarthy men possessed by hatredand something else weapons were raised in mailed hands by their armour these men were from pan tang orozn must have been captured and persuaded to lead eiric and his cousin into ambush eiric turned his horse rearing orozn you betrayed us but orozn was ridinghe looked back once his pale face tortured with guilt then his eyes darted away from eiric and dyvim slorm and he frowned rode down the mosswet hill back into the howling darkness of the night eiric lifted stormbringer from his belt gripped the hut blocked a blow from a brassstudded mace slid his sword down the handle and sheared off his attackers fingers he and dyvim slorm were soon surrounded yet he fought on stormbringer shrilling a wild lawless song of death but eiric and dyvim slorm were still weak from the rigours of their past adventures not even stormbringers evil strength was sufficient fully to revitalise eirics deficient veins and he was filled with fearsot of the attackers but of the fact that he was doomed to die or be captured and he had the feeling that these warriors had no knowledge of their masters pan in the matter of the prophecy did not realise that perhaps he was not meant to die at that moment in fact he decided as he battled a great mistake was about to be perpetrated ariochi he cried in his fear to the demongod of melni bone arioch aid me blood and souls for thine aidi but that intractable entity sent no aid dyvim slorms long blade caught a man just below bis gor get and pierced him through the throat the other pan tang horsemen threw themselves at him but were driven back by his sweeping sword dyvim slorm shouted why do we wor ship such a god when whim decides him so often perhaps he thinks our time has come eiric yelled back as his runeblade drank another foes lifeforce tiring fast they fought on until a new sound broke above the clash of armsthe sound of chariots and low moaning cries then they were sweeping into the mђle black men with handsome features and thin proud mouths their magnificent michael moorcock bodies halfnaked as their cloaks of white fox fur streamed behing them and their javelins were flung with terrible a curacy at the bewildered men of pan tang eiric sheathed his sword and remained ready to fight or flee this is the onethe whitefaced one cried a black charioteer as he saw eiric the chariots rolled to a halt tall horses stamping and snorting eiric rode up to the leader i am grateful he said half falling from his saddle in weariness he turned the droop of his shoulders into a bow you appear to know meyou are the third ive met while on this quest who recognises me without my being able to re turn the compliment the leader tugged the fox cape about his naked chest and smiled with his thin lips im named sepiriz and you will know me soon enough as for you we have known of you for thousands of years eiric are you notlast king of melni bone that is true and you sepiriz addressed dyvhn slorm are eirics cousin together you represent the last of the pure line of melnibone aye dyvim slorm agreed curiosity in his eyes then we have been waiting for you to pass this way there was a prophecy you are the captors of zarozinia eiric reached for his sword sepiriz shook his head no but we can tell you where she is calm yourself though i realise the agony of mind you must be suffering i will be better able to explain all i know back in our own domain first tell us who you are eiric demanded sepiriz smiled slightly you know us i thinkor at least you know of us there was a certain friendship between your ancestors and our folk in the early years of the bright em pire he paused a moment before continuing have you ever heard legends in irorryr perhaps of the ten from the mountain the ten who sleep in the mountain of fire many times eiric drew in his breath now i recognise you by description but it is said that you sleep for centuries in the mountain of fire why are you roaming abroad in this manner we were driven by an eruption from our volcano home which had been dormant for two thousand years such move stormbringer menta of nature have been taking place an over the earth of late our time we knew had come to awaken again we were servants of fateand our mission is strongly bound up with your destiny we bear a message for you from zaro zinias captorand another from a different source would you return now with us to the chasm of nihrain xnd learn alt we can tell you eiric pondered for a moment then he lifted his white face and said i am in haste to claim vengeance sepiriz but if what you can tell me will lead me closer to claiming it come then come the black giant jerked the reins of his horse and turned the chariot about it was a journey of a day and a night to the chasm of nihrain a huge gaping fissure high in the mountains a place avoided by all it had supernatural significance for those who dwelt near the mountains the lordly nihrain conversed little on the journey and at last they were above the chasm driving their chariots down the steep path which wound into its dark depths about half a mile down no light penetrated but they saw ahead of them flickering torches that illuminated part of the carved outline of an unearthly mural or betrayed a gaping opening in the solid rock then as they guided their horses down further they saw in detail the aweinspiring city of nihrain which outsiders had not glimpsed for many centuries the last of the nihrain now lived here ten immortal men of a race older even than that of memibone which had a history of twenty thousand years huge columns rose above mem hewn ages before from the living rock giant statues and wide balconies manytiered windows a hundred feet high and sweeping steps cut into the face of the chasm the ten drove their yellow chariots through a mighty gate and into the caverns of nihrain carved to their entire extent with strange symbols and uranger murals here slaves wakened from a sleep of cen turies to tend their masters ran forward even these did not fully bear resemblance to the men that eiric knew sepiriz gave the reins to a slave as eiric and dyvim slorm dismounted staring about them in awe he said nowto my own chambers and there itl in michael moorcock form you of what you wish to knowand what you must do led by sepiriz the kinsmen stalked impatiently through galleries and into a large chamber full of dark sculpture a number of fires burned behind this hall in big grates sepiriz folded his great body into a chair and bade them sit in two similar chairs carved from solid blocks of ebony when they were all seated before one of the fires sepiriz took a long breath staring around the hall perhaps remembering its ear lier history somewhat angered by this show of casualness eiric said impatiently forgive me sepirizbut you promised to pass on your message to us yes sepiriz said but so much do i have to tell you that i must pause one moment to collect my thoughts he settled himself in the chair before continuing we know where your wife is he said at last and know also that she is safe she will not be harmed since she is to be bargained for something which you possess then tell me the whole story eiric demanded bleakly we were friendly with your ancestors eiric and we were friendly with those they superseded the ones who forged that blade you bear eiric was interested in spite of his anxiety for years he had attempted to rid himself of the runesword but had never succeeded all his efforts had failed and he still needed to carry it although drugs now gave him most of his strength would you be rid of your sword eiric sepiriz said ayeits well known then listen to this tale we know for whom and for what the bladeand its twinwere forged they were made for a special purpose and for special men only melniboneans may carry them and of those only the blood of the royal line there is no hint of any special purpose for the swords in melnibonean history or legend eiric said leaning forward some secrets are best kept fully guarded sepiriz said calmly those blades were forged to destroy a group of very powerful beings among them are the dead gods the dead godsbut by their very name you must know that they perished long ages ago they perished as you say in human terms they are dead but they chose to die chose to rid themselves of stormb ringer material shape and hurled their lifestuff into the blackness of eternity for in those days they were full of fear eiric had do real conception of what sepiriz described but he accepted what the nihrainian said and listened on one of them has returned sepiriz said whyr to get at any cost two things which endanger him and his fellow godswherever they may be they can still be harmed by these things they are they have the earthly appearance of two swords rune carved and sorcerousmoumblade and stormbringer thisr eiric touched his blade why should the gods fear this and the other went to limbo with my cousin yyrkoon whom i killed many years ago it is lost that is not true we recovered itthat was part of fates purpose for us we have it here in nihrain the blades were forged for your ancestors who drove the dead gods away by means of them they were made by other uohuman smiths who were also enemies of the dead gods these smiths were compelled to combat evil with evil although they themselves were not pledged to chaos but to law they forged the swords for several reasonsridding the world of the dead gods was but one the other reasons those you shall learn in times to comefor our relation ship will not be ended until the whole destiny has been worked out we are obliged not to reveal the other reasons until the proper time you have a dangerous destiny eiric and i do not envy it but what is the message you have eiric said impa tiently due to the disturbance created by jagreen lern one of the dead gods has been enabled to return to earth as i told you he has gathered acolytes about him they kidnapped your wife eiric felt a mood of deep despair creep over him must he defy such power as this why he whispered darnizhaan is aware that zarozinia is important to you he wishes to barter her for the two swords we in this mat ter are merely messengers we must give up the sword we keep at the request of you or dyvim slorm for they right michael moorcock folly belong to any of the royal line damizhaans terms are simple he will dispatch zarozinia to limbo unles you give him the blades which threaten bis existence her death it would not be death as we know it would be unpleasant and eternal and if i agreed to do that what would happen all the dead gods would return only the power of the swords keeps them from doing so now and what would happen if the dead gods came back even without the dead gods chaos threatens to conquer the planet but with them it would be utterly invincible its effect immediate evil would sweep the worid chaos would plunge this earth into a stinking inferno of terror and destruc tion you have already had a taste of what is happening and damizhaan has only been back for a short time you mean the defeat of yishanas armies and the con quest by sarosto and jagreeo lero exactly jagreen lem has a pact with chaosall the lords of chaos not merely the dead godsfor chaos fears fates plan for earths future and would attempt to tamper with it by gaining domination of our planet the lords of chaos are strong enough without the help of the dead gods damizhaan must be destroyed i have an impossible choice sepiriz if i give up stonnbringer i can probably survive on herbs and the like but if i do give it up for zarozinia then chaos will be un leashed to its full extent and i will have a monstrous crime upon my conscience the choice is yours alone to make eiric deliberated but could think of no way of solving the problem bring the other made he said at last sepiriz rejoined them a while later with a scabbarded sword that seemed little different from stormbriager so eiricis the prophecy explained he asked still keeping hold of moumblade ayehere is the twin of that i bear but the last part where are we to go i wib tell you in a moment though the dead gods and the powers of chaos are aware that we possess the sister blade they do not know whom we really serve pate as i told you is our master and fate has wrought a fabric for yrormbkin ger this earth which would be hard to alter but it could be al tered and we are entrusted to see that fate is not cheated you are about to undergo a test how you fare in it what your decision is will decide what we must tell you upon your return to nihrain you wish me to return here yes give me moumblade eiric said quickly sepiriz handed him the sword and eiric stood there with one twin blade in each hand as if weighing something be tween them both blades seemed to moan in recognition aod their pow ers swam through his body so that he seemed to be built of steelhard fire i remember now that i hold them both that their powers are greater than i realise there is one quality they possess when paired a quality we may be able to use against this dead god he frowned but more of that in a moment he stared sharply at sepiriz now tell me where is dam izhaan the vale of xanyaw in myyrrhn eiric handed moumblade to dyvim slorm who accepted it gingerly what will your choice be sepiriz asked who knows eiric said with bitter gaiety perhaps there is a way to beat this dead god but i tell you this sepirizgiven the opportunity i shall make that god rue his homecoming for he has done the one thing that can move me to real anger and the anger of eiric of melnibone and his sword stonnbringer can destroy the world sepiriz rose from his chair his eyebrows lifting and gods eiric can it destroy gods five eiric rode like a giant scarecrow gaunt and rigid on the mas sive back of the nihramian steed his grim face was set fast in a mask that hid emotion and his crimson eyes burned like coals in their sunken socket the wind whipped his hair this way and that but he sat straight staring ahead one longfin gered hand gripping stonnbringers hilt occasionally dyvim slonn who bore moumblade both proudly and warily heard the blade moan to its sister and felt it shudder at his side only later did he begin to ask himself what the blade might make him what it would give him and demand of him after that he kept his hand away from it as much as possible close to the borders of myyrrhn a pack of dharijorian hirelingsnative jharkorians in the livery of their con querorscame upon them unsavoury louts they were who should have known better than to ride across eirics path they steered their horses towards the pair grinning the black plumes of their helmets nodded armour straps creaked and metal clanked the leader a squinteyed bully with an axe at his belt pulled his mount short in front of eiric at a direction from its master the albinos horse came to a stop his expression unchanged eiric drew stonnbringer in an economic catlike gesture dyvim slonn copied him eye ing the silently laughing men he was surprised at how easily the blade sprang from its scabbard then with no challenges eiric began to fight he fought like an automaton quickly efficiently ex pressionlessly cleaving the leaders shoulder plate in a stroke that cut through the man from shoulder to stomach in one raking movement which peeled back armour and flesh rup turing the body so that a great scarlet gash appeared in the black metal and the leader wept as he slowly died sprawling stormbringer for a moment over his horse before slumping from the mount one leg high caught in a stirrup strap stonnbringer let out a great metallic purr of pleasure and eiric directed arm and blade about him emofionlessly slaving the horsemen as if they were unarmed and chained so little chance did they have dyvim slonn unused to the semisentient moumblade tried to wield her like an ordinary sword but she moved in his hand making cleverer strokes than he a peculiar sense of power at once sensual and cool poured into him and he heard his voice veiling exultantly realised what his ancestors must have been like in war the fight was quickly done with and leaving the soul drained corpses on the ground behind them they were soon in the land of myyrrhn both blades had now been com monly blooded eiric was now better able to think and act coherently but he could spare nothing for dyvim slonn while intratempor ally asking nothing of his cousin who rode at his side frus trated in that he was not called upon for his help eiric let his mind drift about in time encompassing past present and future and forming it into a wholea pattern he was suspicious of pattern disliking shape for he did not trust it to him life was chaotic chancedominated unpre dictable it was a trick an illusion of the mind to be able to see a pattern to it he knew a few things judged nothing he knew he bore a sword which physically and pyschologi cally he needed to bear it was an unalterable admission of a weakness in him a lack of confidence in either himself or the philosophy of cause and effect he believed himself a realist through the bleak night they rode buffeted by a vicious wind and as they came closer to the vale of xanyaw the whole sky the earth the air became filled with heavy throbbing music melodious sensual great chords of sound on and on it rose and fell and following it came me whitefaced ones each had a black cowl and a sword which split at the end into three curved barbs each grinned a fixed grin the music followed them as they came running like mad things at the two men who reined in their horses restraining the urge to turn and flee eiric had seen horrors in his life had seen michael moorcock much that would make others insane but for some reason these shocked him more deeply than any they were men or dinary men by the look of thembut men possessed by an unholy spirit prepared to defend themselves eiric and dyvim slonn drew their blades and waited for the encounter but none came the music and the men rushed past them and away beyond them in the direction from which they had come overhead suddenly they heard the beat of wings a shriek from out of the sky and a ghastly wail fleeing two women rushed by and eiric was disturbed to sec that the women were from the winged race of myyrrhn but were wingless these unlike a woman eiric remembered had had their wings deliberately hacked off they paid no attention to the two riders but disappeared running into the night their eyes blank and their faces insane what is happening eiric cried dyvim slorm resheath ing bis mneblade his other hand striving to control the prancing horse i know not what does happen in a place where the dead gods rule has come back all was rushing noise and confusion the night was full of movement and terror come eiric slapped bis sword against his mounts rump and sent the beast into a jerking gallop forcing himself and the steed forward into the terrible night then mighty laughter greeted them as they rode between hills into the vale of xanyaw the valley was pitchblack and alive with menace the very hills seeming sentient they slowed theif pace as they lost their sense of direction and ei ric had to call to his unseen cousin to make sure he was still close the echoing laughter sounded again roaring from out of the dark so that the earth shook it was as if the whole planet laughed in ironic mirth at their efforts to control their fears and push on through the valley eiric wondered if he had been betrayed and this was a trap set by the dead gods what proof had he that zarozina was here why had he trusted sepiriz something slithered against his leg as it passed him and he put his hand on the hilt of his sword ready to draw it but then shooting upwards into the dark sky there arose seemingly from the very earth a huge figure which barred their way hands on hips wreathed in golden light a face of stormbringer an ape somehow blended with another shape to give it dig nity and wild grandeur its body alive and dancing with colour and light its lips grinning with delight and knowledgedamizhaan the dead godt finer darnizhaan cried eiric fiercely craning his head to stare up at the dead gods face he felt no fear now i have come for my wife around the dead gods heels appeared acolytes with wide lips and pale triangular faces conical caps on their heads and madness in their eyes they giggled and shrilled and shivered in the light of damizhaan s grotesque and beautiful body they gibbered at the two riders and mocked them but they did not move away from the dead gods heels eiric sneered degenerate and pitiful minions he said if not so pitiful as you eiric of melnibon laughed the dead god have you come to bargain or to give your f wifes soul into my custody so that she may spend eternity s dying eiric did not let his hate show on his face i would destroy you it is instinctive for me to do so but the dead god smiled almost with pity you roust be destroyed eiric you are an anachronism your time is gone speak for yourself darnizhaan i could destroy you but you will not though passionately hating the being eric also felt a disturbing sense of comradeship for the dead god both of them represented an age that was gone neither were really part of the new earth then i wfll destroy her the dead god said that i could do with impunity zarozinia where is she once again damizhaans mighty laughter shook the vale of xanyaw h what have the old folk come to there was a time when no man of melnibon particularly of the royal line would admit to caring for another mortal soul especially if they belonged to the beastrace the new race of the age you call that of the young kingdoms what are you mating with animals king of melnibon where is your blood your cruel and brilliant blood where the glorious malice where ac evil eiricr michael moorcock peculiar emotions stirred in eiric as he remembered hfs an cestors the sorcerer emperors of the dragon isle he realised that the dead god was deliberately awakening these emo tions and with an effort be refused to let them dominate him that is past he shouted a new time has come upon the earth our time wifl soon be goneand yours is over no eiric mark my words whatever happens the dawn is over and will soon be swept away like dead leaves before the wind of morning the earths history has not even begun you your ancestors these men of the new races even you are nothing but a prelude to history you will all be forgotten if the real history of the world begins but we can avert thatwe can survive conquer the earth and hold it against the lords of law against fate herself against the cosmic balancewe can continue to live but you must give me the awords i fail to understand you eiric said his lips thin and his teeth tight in his skull i am here to bargain or do battle for my wife you do not understand the dead god guffawed be causc we are all of us gods and men but shadows pl ying puppet parts before the true play begins you would best not fight merather side with me for i know the truth we share a common destiny we do not any of us exist the old folk are doomed you myself and my brothers unless you give me the swords we must not fight one another share our frightful knowledgethe knowledge that turned us in sane there is nothing eiricno past present or future we do not exist any of usf eiric shook his head quickly i do not understand you still i would not understand you if i could i desire only the return of my wifenot baffling conundrums damizhaan laughed again no you shall not have the woman unless we are given control of the swords you do not realise their properties they were not only designed to destroy us or exile ustheir destiny is to destroy the world as we know it if you retain them eiric you will be responsible for wiping out your own memory for those who come after you id welcome that eiric said dyvim siorm remained silent not altogether in sympathy stormbringer with eiric the dead gods argument seemed to contain truth damizhaan shook his body so that the golden light danced and its area widened momentarily keep the swords and all of us will be as we had never existed he said impatiently so be it elric s tone was stubborn do you think i wish the memory to live onthe memory of evil ruin and destruction the memory of a man with deficient blood in his veinsa man called friendslayer womanslayer and many other such names damizhaan spoke urgently almost in terror eiric you have been duped somewhere you have been given a con science you must join with us only if the lords of chaos can establish their reign will we survive if they fail we shall be obliterated goodr limbo eiric limbo do you understand what that means do not care where is my wife eiric blocked the truth from his mind blocked out the ter ror in the meaning of the dead gods words he could not afford to listen or fully to comprehend he must save zaro zinia i have brought the swords said he and wish my wife to be returned to me very well the dead god smiled hugely in his relief at least if we keep the blades in their true shape beyond the earth we may be able to retain control of the world in your hands they could destroy not only us but you your world all that you represent beasts would rule the earth for millions of years before the age of intelligence began again and it would be a duller age than this we do not wish it to occur but if you had kept the swords it would have come about al most inevitably oh be silent eiric cried for a god you talk too much take the swordsand give me back my wife at the dead gods command some of the acolytes scam pered away eiric saw their gleaming bodies disappear into the darkness he waited nervously until they returned carry ing the struggling body of zarozinia they set her on the ground and eiric saw that her face bore the blank look of hock zaroziniaf michael moorcock the giri s eyea roamed about before they saw eiric she be gan to move towards him but the acolytes held her bade gig gling darnizhaan stretched forward two gigantic glowing hands the swords first biric and dyvim slorm put them into his hands the dead god straightened up clutching his prizes and roaring his mirth zarozjnia was now released and she ran forward to grasp her husbands hand weeping and trembling eiric leant down and stroked her hair too disturbed to say anything then he turned to dyvim slorffl shouting let us see if our plan will work cousin eiric stared up at stormbringer writhing in daraizhaan grasp stormbringer kerana soliem oglara dyvim slorm also called to moumblade in the ancient tongue of melnibone the mystic sorcerous tongue which had been used for runecasting and demonraising all through melnibones twenty thousand years of history together they commanded the blades as if they were ac tually wielding them in their hands so that merely by shouting orders eiric and dyviro slorm began their work this was the remembered quality of born blades when paired in a common fight the blades twisted in darnizhaans glow ing hands he started backwards his shape faltering some times manlike sometimes beastlike sometimes totally alien but he was evidently horrified this god now the swords wrenched themselves from the clutching hands and turned on him he fought against them fending them off as they wove about io the air whining malevolently triumphantly attacking him with vicious power at eirics command stormbringer slashed at the supernatural being and dyvim slorms moumblade followed its example be cause the ruaeblades were also supernatural darnizhaan was harmed dreadfully whenever they struck his form eiric he raved eiricyou do not know what you are doing stop them stop them you should have listened more carefully to what i told you stop them but eiric in his hate and malice urged on the blades made them plunge into the dead gods being time after time so that his shape sometimes faltered faded the colours of its bright beauty dulling the acolytes fled upwards into the vale convinced that their lord was doomed their lord also was so convinced he made one lunge towards the mounted men stormbringer and then the fabric of his being began to shred before the blades attack wisps of his bodystuff seemed to break away and drift into the air to be swallowed by the black night viciously and ferociously eiric goaded the blades while dyvim slorms voice blended with his in a cruel joy to see die bright being destroyed foolsr he screamed in destroying me you destroy yourselvesf but eiric did not listen and at last there was nothing left of the dead god and the swords crept back to lie contentedly in their masters hands quickly with a sudden shudder eiric scabbarded storm bringer he dismounted and helped his girlwife on to the back of his great stallion and then swung up into the saddle again it was very quiet in the vale of xanyaw six three people bent in their saddles with weariness reached the chasm of nihrain days later they rode down the twist ing paths into the black depths of the mountain city and were there welcomed by sepiriz whose face was grave though his words were encouraging so you were successful eiric he said with a small smile eiric paused while he dismounted and aided zarozinia down he turned to sepriz i am not altogether satisfied with this adventure he said grimly though i did what i had to in order to save my wife i would speak with you privately sepiriz the black nihrainian nodded gravely when we have eaten he said we will talk alone they walked wearily through the galleries noting that there was considerably more activity in the city now but there was no sign of sepirizs nine brothers he explained their absence as he led eiric and his companions towards his own chamber as servants of fate they have been called to another plane where they can observe something of the several different possible futures of the earth and thus keep me informed of what i must do here they entered the chamber and found food ready and when they had satisfied their hunger dyvim slonn and zaro zinia left the other two the fire from the great hearth blazed eiric and sepiriz sat together unspeakiog hunched in their chairs at last without preamble eiric told sepiriz the story of what had happened what he remembered of the dead gods words how they had disturbed himeven struck him as being true when he had finished sepiriz nodded it is so he said darnizhaan spoke the truth or at least he spoke most of the truth as he understood it stormbringer you mean we win all soon cease to exist that it will be as if we had never breathed or thought or fought that is likely but why it seems unjust nvho told you that the worid was just eiric smiled his own suspicions confirmed aye as i ex pected there is no justice but there fa sepiriz said justice of a kindjustice which must be carved from the chaos of existence man was not born to a world of justice but he can create such a world td agree to that eiric said but what are all our striv inga for if we are doomed to die and the results of our ac tions with us that is not absolutely the case something wffl continue those who come after us will inherit something from us what is that an earth free of the major forces of chaos you mean a world free of sorcery i presume not entirely free of sorcery but chaos and sorcery wffl not dominate the world of the future as it does this world then that is worth striving for sepiriz eiric said almost with relief but what part do the runeblades play in the scheme of things they have two functions one to rid this world of the great dominating sources of evil but they are evil themselvesi just so it takes a strong evil to battle a strong evfl the days mat will come will be when the forces of good can over come those of evil they are not yet strong enough that as i told you is what we must strive for and what is the other purpose of the blades that is their final purposeyour destiny i can ten you now i must ten you now or let you live out your destiny un knowing then teu me eiric said impatiently their ultimate purpose is to destroy this world eiric stood up ah no sepiriz that i cannot believe shah i have such a crime on my conscience it is not a crime it is in the nature of wings the era of the bright empire even that of the young kingdoms is drawing to a close chaos formed mis earth and for aeons chaos ruled men were created to put an end to that rule michael moorcock but my ancestors worshipped the powers of chaoc my patron demon arioch is a duke of hell one of the prime lords of chaos just so you and your ancestors were not true men at all but an intermediary type created for a purpose you un derstand chaos as no true men ever could understand it you can control the forces of chaos as no true men ever could and as a manifestation of the champion eternal you can weaken die forces of chaosfor you know the qualities of chaos weaken them is what you have done though wor shipping the lords of chance your race were the first to bring some kind of order to the earth the people of the young kingdoms have inherited this from youand have consolidated it but as yet chaos is still that much stronger the runeblades stormbringer and mournblade this more or derly age the wisdom your race and mine have gained all will go towards creating the basis for the true beginnings of mankinds history that history wbl not begin for many thou sands of years the type may take on a lowlier form become more beastlike before it reevolves but when it does it will reevolve into a world bereft of the stronger forces of chaos it will have a fighting chance we are all doomed but they need not be so that is what damizhaan meant when be said we were just puppets acting out our parts before me true play began eiric sighed deeply the weight of his mighty responsi bnity was heavy on his soul he did not welcome it but he accepted it sepiriz said gently it is your purpose eiric of melni bon hitherto your life has appeared comparatively mean ingless all through it you have been searching for some purpose for living is that not true aye eiric agreed with a slight smile fve been restless for many a year since my birth restless the more between the time when zarozinia was abducted and now it is fitting that you should have been sepiriz said for there is sl purpose for youfates purpose it is this destiny that you have sensed all your mortal days you the last of the royal line of melnibone must complete your destiny in the times which are to follow closely upon these the world is darkeningnature revolts and rebels against the abuses to which the lords of chaos put it oceans seethe and forests sway hot lava spills from a thousand mountains winds shriek stormbringer their angry torment and the skies are full of awful movement upon the face of the earth warriors are embattled in a struggle which will decide the fate of the world linked as the struggle is with greater conflicts among gods women and little children die on a million funeral pyres upon this con tinent alone and soon the conflict will spread to me next continent and the next soon all the men of the earth will have chosen sides and chaos might easily win it would win but for one thing you and your sword stormbringer stormbringer it has brought enough storms for me per haps this time it can calm one and what if law should win and if law should winthen that too will mean the de cline and death of this worldwe shall all be forgotten but if chaos should winthen doom will cloud the very air ag ony will sound in the wind and foul misery will dominate a plunging unsettled worid of sorcery and evil hatred but you eiric with your sword and our aid could stop this it must be done then let it be done eiric said quietly and if it must be donethen let it be done well sepiriz said annies will soon be marshalled to drive against pan tangs might these must be our first defence thereafter we shall call upon you to fulfil the rest of your destiny ni play my part willingly eiric replied for whatever else i have a mind to pay the theocrat back for his insults and the inconvenience be has caused me though perhaps be didnt instigate zarozinias abduction he aided those who did and he shall die slowly for that go then speedily for each moment wasted allows the theocrat to consolidate further his newwon empire farewell said eiric now more than ever anxious to leave nihrain and return to familiar lands i know well meet again sepiriz but i pray it be in calmer times than these now the three of them rode eastwards towards the coast of tarkesh where they hoped to find a secret ship to take them across the pale sea to luniora and thence to karlaak by the weeping waste they rode their magical nihrain horses careless of danger through a warwasted worid striferuined and miserable under the heel of the theocrat michael moorcock eiric and zarozima exchanged many glances but they did not speak much for they were both moved by a knowledge of something which they could not speak of which they dared not admit she knew they would not have much time together even when they returned to kariaak die saw that he grieved and she grieved also unable to understand the change that had come upon her husband only aware that the black sword at his side would never now hang in he armoury again she felt she had failed him though this was not the case as they topped a hut and saw smoke drifting black and thick across the plains of toraunz once beautiful now ru ined dyvim slorm shouted from behind eiric and his bride one thing cousinwhatever happens we must have ven geance on the theocrat and bis ally eiric pursed his ups aye he said and glanced again at zarozima whose eyes were downcast now the western lands from taikesh to myyrrfm were sundered by the servitors of chaos was this truly to be the final conflict that would decide whether law or chaos would dominate the future the forces of law were weak and scat tered could this possibly be the final paroxysm on earth of the great lords of eva now between armies one part of the worlds fate was being decided the lands groaned in the torment of bloody conflict what other forces must eiric fight before he accomplished his final destiny and destroyed the worid he knew what else before the horn of fate was blownto herald in the night sepiriz no doubt would tell him when the time came but meanwhile more material scores had to be settled the lands to the east must be made ready for war the sealords of the purple ports must be approached for aid the kings of the south marshalled for attack on the western continent b would take time to do all this part of eirics mind welcomed the time it would take part of him was reluctant to continue his heavy destiny for it would mean the end of the age of the young king doms the death of the memory of the age of the bright em pire which his ancestors had dominated for ten thousand years the sea was at last in sight rolling its troubled way stormbmnger towards the horizon to meet a seething sky he heard the cry of gulls and smelled the tang of the salt air in his nostrils with a wild shout be clapped his steeds flanks and raced down towards the sea book two black swords brothers in which moumblade returns to help decide an issue between eiric and the lords of chaos one one day there came a gathering of kings captains and war lords to the peaceful city of karlaak in ilmiora by the weep ing waste they did not come in great pomp or with grandiose ges tures they came grimfaced and hurriedly to answer the summons of biric who dwelt again in karlaak with his latelyrescued wife zarozinia and they gathered in a great chamber which bad once been used by the old rulers of kar laak for the planning of wars to this same purpose eiric now put it illuminated by flaring torches a great coloured map of the world was spread behind the dais on which eiric stood it showed the three major continents of the east west and south that of the west comprising jharkor dharijor sha zar tarkesb myyrrhn and the isle of pan tang was shaded black for all these lands were now the conquered empire of the pan tangdharijor alliance which threatened the security of the assembled nobles some of the men who stood armoured before eiric were exiles from the conquered landsbut there were few few also were eirics imnyrian kinsmen who had fought at the battle of sequa and had been defeated with the massed army that had sought to resist the combined might of me evil al liance at the head of the eldritch imrryrians stood dyvim sionn eirics cousin at his belt encased in a sturdy scab bard was the runesword mournblade twin to the one eiric wore here also was montan lord of lormyr standing with fellow rulers from the southlandsjerned of filkhor hozd of argimiliar and koltbak of pikarayd adorned in painted iron velvet silk and wool the sealords from the isle of the purple towns were less gaudily dad with helms and breastplates of plain bronze michael moorcock terkins bracks and boots of unstained leather and great broadswords at their hips their faces were all but hidden by their long shaggy hair and thick curling beards all these kings and sealords alike were inclined to stare at brie suspiciously since years before he had led their royal predecessors on the raid of imrryrthough it had left many thrones clear for those who now sat on them in another group stood the nobles of that part of the eastern continent lying to the west of the sighing desert and the weeping waste beyond these two barren stretches of land were the kingdoms of eshniir changshai and okara but there was no contact between eirics part of the world and theirssave for the small redheaded man beside him his friend moonglum of elwhcr an eastern adventurer the regent of vilmir uncle of the tcnmontbold icing headed this last group made up of senators from me city states comprising umiora the reddomed archer rackhir representing me city of tanelorn and various merchant princes from towns coming under the indirect rule of vumir as protectorates a mighty gathering representing the massed power of the world but would even this be sufficient eiric wondered to wipe out me growing menace from me westlanda his white albinos face was stern his red eyes troubled he addressed the men be had caused to come here as you know my lords me threat of pan taag and dfaarijor is not likely to remain confined to me western con tinent for much longer though barely two months have passed since their victory was achieved they are already mar ahalliag a great fleet aimed at crushing the power of mow kings dependent largely on their ships for livelihood and de fence he glanced at me sealords of the purple towns and be kings of the southern continent we of the east it seems are not regarded as so much of a danger to their immediate plans and if we did not unite now they would have a greater chance of success by con quering first me southern seapower and wen the scattered cities of the east we must form an alliance which can match their strength how do you know mis is their plan eiric stormbringer the voice was that of hozel of argimiliar a proudfaced man inclined it was said to fits of insanity the inbred off spring of a dozen incestuous unions spies refugeesand supernatural sources they have all reported it even without these reports we could be sure that mis is indeed their plan growled kargan sharpeyes spokesman for the sealords he looked directly at hozel with something akin to contempt and jagreen lem of pan tang might also eek allies amongst the southerners there are some who would rather capitulate to a foreign conqueror than lose their oft lives and easilyearned treasure hozel smiled coldly at kargan there are some too whose animal suspicions might cause them to make no move against the theocrat until it was too late eiric said hastily aware of ageold bitternesses between me hardy sealords and their softer neighbours but worst of all they would be best aided by internal feuds in our ranks brothers hozeltake it for granted that i speak truly and mat my information is exact montan lord of lormyr his face beard and hair all haded grey said haughtily you of the north and bast are weak we of the south are strong why should we lend you our ships to defend your coasts i do not agree with your logic eiric it will not be me first time it has led good men astrayto their deaths i thought we bad agreed to bury old disputesrm eiric said dose to anger for the guilt of what he had done was still in him aye nodded kargan a man who cant forget the past is a man who cannot plan for the future i say eirics logic is good you traders were always too reckless with your ships and too gufllible when you heard a smoothtongue thats why you now envy our riches young jemed of filkhor smiled in his thin beard his eyes on the floor kargan fumed too honest perhaps is the word yon should have used southerner belatedly our forefathers learned how the fat southlands were cheating them their forefathers raided your coasts remember maybe we should have continued their practice instead we settled traded to michael moorcock and your bellies swelled from the profits of our sweat oodst fd not trust the word of a southern eiric leaned forward to interrupt but was interrupted him self by hozel who said impatiently the fact is this the thcocrat is more likely to concentrate his first attacks on the eart for these reasons the eastlands are weak the east lands are poorly defended the eastlanda are closer to hia shores and therefore more accessible why should he risk his recentlyunited strength on the stronger southlands or risk a more hazardous seacrossing because eiric said levelly his ships will be magicaided and distance will not count because the south is richer and will supply him with metals food ships and menf spat kargan sol you think we already plan treachery hozel glanced first at eiric and then at kargan then why summon us here in the first place i did not say that eiric said hastily kargan spoke hia own thoughts not mine calm yourselveswe must be unitedor perish before superior armies and supernatural might oh no hozel turned to the other southern monardn what say you my peers shall we lend them our ships and warriora to protect their shores as well as ours not when they are so ungratefully spurned jerned mur mured let jagreen lern expend his energies upon them when he looks toward the south he will be weakened and we shall be ready for him you are fools eiric cried urgently stand with us or well all perish the lords of chaos are behind the theocral if he succeeds in his ambitions it will mean more than con quest by a human schemerit will mean that we shab all be subjected to the horror of total anarchy on the earth and above it the human race is threatened hozel stared hard at eiric and smiled then let the hu man race protect itself and not fight under an uohuman leader tis wellknown that the men of melnibone are not true men at all bc that as it may eiric lowered his head and lifted a thin white hand to point at hozel the king shivered and held his ground with obvious effort but i know more than that hozel of argimfliar i know that the men of me young stormbringer kingdoms are only the gods first mouldingsshadowthings who precede the race of real men even as we preceded you and i know morel i know that if we do not vanquish both jagreea lern and his supernatural allies then men will be swept from me boiling fqce of a maddened planet their des tiny unfulfilled hozel swallowed and spoke his voice trembling ive seen your muttering kind in the market places eiric men who prophecy all kinds of dooms that never take placemadeyed men such as you but we do not let them live in argimiliar we fay them slowly finger by finger inch by inch until they admit their omens are fallacious perhaps well have that opportunity yet he swung about and halfran from the hall for a mo ment the other southern monarchs stood staring irresolutely after him eiric said urgently heed him not my lords i swear on my life that my words are true jemed said softly half to himself that could mean little there are rumours youre immortal moonglum came close to his friend and whispered they are unconvinced eiric tis plain theyre not our men eiric nodded to the southern nobles he said know mis though you foolishly reject my offer of an alliance the day wih come when you will regret your decision i have been io atted in my own palace my friends have been insulted and i curse you for the upstart fools you are but when the time comes for you to learn the error of this decision i swear that we shall aid you if it is in our power now go disconcerted the southerners straggled from we hall in hence eiric turned to kargaa sharpcyes what have you de cided sealord we stand with you kargan said simply my brother smiorgan baldhead always spoke well of you and i remem ber his words rather than the rumours which followed hia death under your leadership moreover he smiled broadly it is in our nature to believe that whatever a southern weak ling decides must therefore be wrong you have the purple towns as alliesand our ships though fewer than the com bined fleets of the south are smoothsailing fighting ships and wellequipped for war i must warn you that we stand little chance without southern aid eiric said gravely tm doubtful if theyd have been more than an encum brance with their guile and squabblings kargan replied besideshave you no sorcery to help us in this i plan to seek some tomorrow eiric told him moon glum and myself will be leaving my cousin dyvim slorm in charge here while we go to sorcerers isle beyond melaibone there among the hermit practitioners of the white arts i might find means of contacting the lords of law i as you know am halfsworn to chaos though i fight it and am finding increasingly that my own demongod is somewhat loathe to aid me these days at present the white lords are weak beaten back just as we are on earth by the increasing power of the dark ones it is hard to contact them the her mits can likely help me kargan nodded twould be a relief to us of the purple towns to know that we were not too strongly leagued with dark spirits i must admit eiric frowned i agree of course but our position is so weak that we must accept any helpbe it black or white i presume that there is dispute among the masters of chaos as to how far they should gothat is why some of my own help still comes from chaoa this blade that hangs at my side and the twin which dyvim slorm bears are both evil yet they were forged by creatures of chaos to bring an end on earth at least to the masters rule here just as my bloodloyalties are divided so are the swords loyalties we haw no aupcp natural allies we can wholly rely upon i feel for you kargan said gruffly and ft was obvious that he did no man could envy eirics position or eirici destiny orgon kargans cousininlaw said bluntly well to bed now has your kinsman your full confidence eiric glanced at dyvim slorm and smiled my full confi dencehe knows as much as i about this business he shall speak for me since be knows my basic plans very well wetl confer with him tomorrow and if we do not see you before you leave do well for us on sorcerers isle the sealords left now for the first time the regent of vilmir spoke his stormbringer voice was clear and cool we too have confidence in you and your kinsman eiric already we know you both for clever warriors and cunning planners vflinir has good cause to know it from your exploits in bakshaan and elsewhere throughout our territories we i feel have the good sense to bury old scores he turned to the merchant princes for con firmation and they nodded their agreement good eiric said he addressed the gauntfaced archer rackhir his friend whose legend almost equalled his own you come as a spokesman of tanelorn rackhir this will not be the first time we have fought the lords of chaos tnie rackhir nodded most recently we averted a threat with certain aid from the grey lordsbut chaos had caused the gateways to the grey lords to be closed to mor tals we can offer you only our warriors loyalty we shall be grateful for that eiric paced the dais there was no need to ask the senators of karlaak and the other cit ies of nmiora for they had agreed to support him come what may long before toe other rulers were called the same was true of the bleakfaced band who made up the refugees from the west headed by virisek the winged youth from myyrrhn last of his line since all the other mem bers of ac ruling family had been slain by jagreen lems minions just beyond the waus of karlaak was a sea of tents and pavilions over which the banners of many nations waved sluggishly in the hot moist wind at this moment eiric knew the proud lords of the south were uprooting their stan dards and packing their tents not looking at me warbattered warriors of shazar jharkor and tarkesh who stared at them in puzzlement sight of those duneyed veterans should have decided the southern nobles to ally themselves with the east but evidently ft bad not eiric sighed and turned his back on me others to contem plate the great map of the worid with its shaded dark areas now only a quarter is black he said softly to moon glum but the dark tide spreads farther and faster and soon we may an be engulfed well dam the flowor try towhen ft comes moon fhim said with attempted jauntiness but meanwhile your wife would spend some time with you before we leave lets both to bed and trust our dreams are ughtl two two nights later they stood on the quayside in the city of jadmar while a cold wind sliced its way inland there she is eiric said pointing down at the small boat rocking and bumping in the water below a small craft moonglum said dubiously she scarcely looks seaworthy shetl stay afloat longer than a larger vessel in a heavy storm eiric clambered down the iron steps also he added as moonglum put a cautious foot on the rung above him shell be less noticeable and wont draw the attention of any enemy vessels which might be scouting in these waters he jumped and the boat rocked crarily he leaned over grasped a rung and steadied the boat so that moonglum could dimb aboard the cocky little eastlaoder pushed a hand through his shock of red hair and stared up at the troubled sky bad weather for this time of year he noted ifs hard to understand all the way from karlaak we ve had every sort of weather freak snowstorms thunderstorms hail and winds as hot as a furnace blast those rumours were disturb ing tooa rain of blood in bakshaan balls of fiery metal falling in the west of vilmir unprecedented earthquakes in jadmar a few hours before we arrived it seems nature has gone insane not far from the truth eiric said grimly untying the mooring line lift the sail will you and tack into the wind what do you mean moonglum began to loosen the sail it billowed into his face and his voice was muffled jagreen lerns hordes havent reached this part of the worid yet tbey haven needed to i told you the forces of nature were being disrupted by chaos we have only experienced the backwash of what is going on in the west if you think these weather conditions are peculiar you would be horrified stormbringer by me effect which chaos has on those parts of the worid where its rule is almost totall i wonder if you havent taken on too much in this fight moonglum adjusted the sail and it filled to send the little boat scudding between the two long harbour walls towards the open sea as they passed the beacons guttering in ac cold wind ei ric gripped the tiller tighter taking a southeasterly course past the vilmirian peninsula overhead the stars were some tunes obscured by the tattered shreds of clouds streaming be fore the cold unnatural blast of the wind spray splashed in his face stinging it in a thousand places but he ignored it he bad not answered moonglum for he also had doubts about his ability to save the world from chaos moonglum had learned to judge his friends moods for some years before they had travelled the worid together and had learned to respect one another lately since eiric had nearpermanent residence in his wifes city of karlaak moonglum had continued to travel and had been in com mand of a small mercenary army patrolling the southern marches of pdcarayd driving back the barbarians inhabiting the hinterland of that country he had immediately relin quished this command when eirics news reached him and now as the tiny ship bore them towards a hazy and peril fraught destiny savoured the familiar mixture of excitement and perturbation which he had felt a dozen times before when their escapades had led them into conflict with the un known supernatural forces so closely linked with elric s des tiny he had come to accept as a fact that bis destiny was bound to eirics and felt in the deepest places of his being that when the time came they would both die together in some mighty adventure was this death imminent he wondered as he concentrated on the sail and shivered in the blasting wind not yet per haps but he felt fatalistically that it was not far away for the time was looming when the only deeds of men would be dark desperate and great and even these might not serve to form a bastion against the inrush of the creatures of chaos eirichimself contemplated nothing kept his mind clear and relaxed as much as he could his quest for the aid of the white lords was one which could well prove fruitless but be michael moorcock chose not to dwell oo this until he knew for certain whether their help could be invoked or not dawn came swimming over the horizon showing a heaving waste of grey water with no land in sight the wind had dropped and the air was warmer banks of purple cloud bear ing veins of saffron and scarlet poured into the sky line the smoke of some monstrous pyre soon they were sweating beneath a moody sun and the wind had dropped so that me sail hardly moved and yet at the same time the sea began to heave as if lashed by a storm the sea was moving like a living entity thrashing in night marefilled sleep moonglum glanced at brie from where he lay sprawled in the prow of me boat eiric returned me gaze shaking his head and releasing his halfconscious grip of the tiller it was useless to attempt steering the boat in conditions like these the boat was being swept about by me wild waves yet no water seemed to enter it no spray wet them every thing had become unreal dreamlike and for a white eiric felt that even if he had wished to speak he would not have been able to do so then in me distance at first they heard a tow droning which grew to a whining shriek and suddenly the boat was sent halfflying over the rolling waves and driven down into a trench above them the blue and silver water seemed for a moment to be a wab of metaland men it came crashing down towards them his mood broken eiric clung to the tiller and yelled hang on to the boat moooglum hang on or youre lost tepid water groaned down and they were flattened beneath it as if swatted by a gigantic palm the boat dropped deeper and deeper until it seemed they would be crushed on the bot tom by me surging mow then they were flung upwards again and down and as he glimpsed the boiling surface eiric saw three mountains pushing themselves upwards gouting flame and lava the boat wallowed halffull of water tend they set to frantically baling it out as the boat was swiried back and forth being driven nearer and nearer to the new formed volcanoes eiric dropped his baling pan and flung his weight against me tiller forcing the boat away from the mountains of fire it responded sluggishly but began to drift in me opposite direc tion stormbringer eiric saw moonghnn patefaced attempting to shake out me sodden sail he glanced upwards to try and get some kind of bearing but me sun seemed to have swollen and broken so that he saw a million fragments of flame this is the work of chaos moonglum he shouted and only a taste i fancy of what it can becomel they must know of our plan and seek to stop usi moon glum swept sweat from his eyes with the back of his hand perhapsbut i mink not now he looked up again and me sun seemed almost normal he took a bearing and found they were many miles off their original course he had planned to sail to the south of melnibone isle of the dragon and avoid the dragon sea lying to me north for it was wellknown that me last great seamonsters still roamed this stretch but now it was obvious that they were in fact north of mehubone and being driven further north affl the timetowards pan tangt there was no chance of heading for mebubon itselfhe wondered if the isle of me dragon had even survived me monstrous upheavals he would have to make straight for sorcerers isle if he could the ocean was calmer now but me water had almost reached boiling point so that every drop mat fen on his skin eemed to scald him bubbles formed on the surface and it was as if they sailed in a gigantic witchs cauldron dead fish and halfreptilian forms drifted about as thick as seaweed threatening to clog me boats passage but me wind though strong had begun to blow in one direction and moongtuin grinned in relief as it filled the sail slowly through me deaththick waters they managed to steer a northwesterly course towards sorcerers isle as douda of steam formed on me ocean and obscured their view hours later they had left me heated waters behind and were sailing beneath clear skies ob a calm sea they allowed themselves to doze in less man a day they would reach sor cerers isle but now they were overcome by me reaction to their experience and wondered dazedly how they bad lived through the awful storm eiric jerked his eyes open with a shock he was certain he had not slept long yet the sky was dark and a cold drizzle was falling as the drops touched his head and face they michael moorcock oozed down it like viscous jelly some of it entered his mouth and be lustily spat out the bittertasting stuff moonglum he called through the gloom wfaafs the hour do you know the eaatlanders deepheavy voice answered dazedly i know not fd swear it is not night already eiric gave the tiller a tentative pushand the boat did not respond he looked over the side and it seemed they were sailing through the sky itself a dully luminous gas seemed to swirl about the hull but he could see no water he shuddered had they left the confines of the garth were they sailing through some frightful supernatural sea he cursed himself for sleeping feeling helplessmore helpless than when be had fought the storm the heavy gelatinous rain beat down strongly and he pulled the hood of his cloak over his white hair from his belt pouch he took bint and tinder and the tiny light was hist sufficient to show him moonglum s halfmad eyes the little easuanders face was taut with fear eiric had never seen such fear on his friends face and knew that with a little less selfcontrol his own face would assume a similar expression our time has ended moonglum trembled i fear that were dead at last eiric dont prattle such emptiness moonglum i have heard of no afterlife such as this but secretly eiric wondered if moonglums words were true the ship seemed to be moving rapidly through the gaseous sea being driven or drawn to some unknown destination yet eiric could swear that the masters of chaos had no knowledge of his boat faster and faster the little craft moved and then with re lief they heard the familiar splash of water about its keel and it was surging through the saltsea again for a short while longer the viscous rain continued to fall and then even that was past moonglum sighed as the blackness slowly gave way to light and they saw again a normal ocean about them what was h then he ventured finally another manifestation of ruptured nature eirfc said with attempted calmness some warp in the barrier between the realm of men and the realm of chaos perhaps dont question our luck in surviving it we are again offcomso stormbringer and he pointed to the horizon a natural storm seems to be brewing yonder a natural storm i can accept no matter how dangerous the eastlander murmured and made swift preparations furi ing the sail as the wind increased and the sea churned in a way eiric welcomed the storm when it finally struck them at least it obeyed natural laws and could be fought by natural means and experience of similar storms in the past the rain refreshed their faces the wind swept through their hair and they fought the storm with fierce enjoyment me plucky boat riding the waves but in spite of this they were being driven further and further northeasttowards the conquered coasts of shazar almost in the opposite direction to their goal the healthy storm raged on until at thoughts of destiny and supernatural danger were driven from their minds and their muscles ached and nicy gasped with the shock of cold waves on their drenched bodies the boat reeled and rocked their hands were sore from me tightness of their grip on wood and rope but it was as if fate had singled them out to live or perhaps for a death mat would be less dean for they continued to ride tile heaving waters then with a shock eiric saw rocks rearing and moonglum shouted in recognition the serpents teethf the serpents teeth lay close to shazar and were one o the most feared hazards of the shorehugging traders of the west eiric and moonglum had seen mem before from a dis tance but now me storm was driving them nearer and nearer and though they struggled to keep the boat away they seemed bound to be smashed to their deaths on the jagged rocks a wave surged under the boat lifted them and bore them down eiric dung to the side of the boat and thought he heard moonglums wild shout above the noise of the storm before they were flung towards the serpents teeth fareweor and then were was we terrifying sound of smashing tim bers die feel of sharp rock lacerating his rolling body and he was beneath the waves fighting his way to the surface to gasp michael moorcock in a hingful of air before another wave tossed him and grazed his arm against the rocks desperately encumbered by the lifegiving ranesword at his belt he attempted to swim for the looming cliffs of sha zar conscious that even if he lived he had arrived on enemy soil and his chances of reaching the white inrds were now almost nonexistent three eiric lay exhausted on the cold shingle listening to the musi cal sound that the tide made as it drew back over the stones another sound joined that of the surf and he recognised it as the crunch of boots someone was coming towards him in shazar it was most likely to be an enemy he rolled over and began scrambling to his feet drawing the last reserves from his womout body his right hand had halfdrawn storm bringer from its scabbard before he realised dial it was moon glum bent with weakness standing grinning before him thank me gods you livel moonglum lowered himself to the shingle and leaned back with his arms supporting him re garding the now calm sea and the towering serpents teeth in the distance aye we live eiric said squatting down moodily but for bow long m this ruined land i cannot guess somewhere perhaps we can find a shipbut it will mean seeking a town or city and were a marked pair easily recognised by our physical appearance moonglum shook his head and laughed lightly youre till the gloomy one friend be thankful for your life say i small mercies are all but useless in this conflict eiric said rest now moonglum while i watch then you can take my place there was no time to lose when we began this ven ture and now weve lost days moonglum gave no argument but allowed himself immedi ately to sleep and when he awoke much refreshed though aching horribly eiric slept until the moon was high and shin ing brightly in a dear sky they trudged through the night the sparse grass of the coast region giving way to wet blackened ground it was as if a holocaust had raged over the countryside followed by a rainstorm which had left behind it a marsh of ashes remem bering the grassy plains of mis part of shazar eiric was hor michael moorcock rifled unable to ten whether men or the creatures of chao had caused such wanton ruin noon was approaching with a hint of weird disturbances in uie brightclowded sky when they saw a long line of people approaching them they flattened themselves behind a small rise and peered cautiously over it as the party drew nearer these were no enemy soldiers but gaunt women and starvling children men who staggered in rags and a few bat tered riders obviously the remnants of some defeated band of partisans who had held out against pan tang i think we u find friends of sorts here eiric muttered thankfully and perhaps some information which will help us they arose and walked towards the wretched herd the riders quickly grouped around the civilians and drew their weapons but before any challenges could be given someone cried from the enclosed ranks eiric of melnibon l eirichave you returned with news of rescue eiric didnt recognise he voice but he knew his face was legend with its dead white akin and glowing red eyes toa seeking rescue myself friends he said with poorly assumed cheerfulness we were shipwrecked on your coasts whue on a journey which we hoped would help us lift the yoke of jagreen lem from off the westlands but unless we find another ship our chances are scant which way did you sail eiric said me unseen spokes man we sailed to sorcerers isle in the southwest mere to in voke the aid if we could of the white lords moonglum replied then you were going in the wrong direction eiric straightened his back and tried to peer into the throng who are you to ted us that there was a disturbance in the crowd and a bent middfo aged man leaning on a staff with long curling moustachios adorning his fairskinned face broke from the ranks and stood mere the ridera drew back their horses so that eiric could see him properly i am named ohada the seer once famous to dioperda as a predictor of events but dioperda was razed in the sack of stormbringer sbazar and i was lucky enough to escape with these few people who are all from dioperda one of the last cities to fall before pan tang s sorcerous might i have a message of great import for you eiric it is for your ears only and i re ceived it from one you knowone who may help you and indirectly us you have piqued my curiosity and raised my hopes ei ric beckoned with his band come seer tell me your news and lets all trust it is as good as you hint moonglum took a step back as the seer approached both he and the dioperdans watched with curiosity as ohada whis pered to eiric eiric himself had to strain to catch the words i bear a message from a being called sepiriz he says mat what you have failed to do he has done but there is some thing which you must do that he cannot he says to go to the carved city and there he will enlighten you further sepiriz how did he contact you i am clairvoyant he came to me in a dream your words could be treacherous designed to lead me into jagreen lems hands sepiriz added one thing to mehe told me that we should meet on this very spot could jagreen lem know that unlikelybut by the same reckoning could anyone know that then eiric remembered that sepiriz and his brothers who bad helped him earlier were the servitors of fate and fate had already played an important part in this he nodded r thanks seer then he shouted to the riders we need a pair of horsesthe best you havel our horses are valuable to us grumbled a knight in torn nnour they are all we have my companion and i need to move swiftly if we are to save your land come risk a pair of horses against the possi bility of vengeance on your conquerors the knight dismounted and so did the man beside him they led their steeds up to eiric and moonglum use them wel eiric eiric took the reins and swung himself into the saddle i will said he what are your plans now well fight on as best we can would ft not be wiser to hide in ac mountains or the marshes of the mist if you had witnessed the depravity and terror of jagreen leras filthy rule you would not make men an enquiry the knight said hollowly though we cannot hope to win against a man whose servants can command the very earth to heave like the ocean pull down floods of salt water from the sky and send green clouds scudding down to destroy helpless chil dren in nameless ways we shall take what vengeance we cani this part of the continent is calm compared to what is going on elsewhere dreadful geological changes are taking place everywhere you would not recognise a hill or forest ten miles north and those that you passed one day might well have changed or disappeared on the next we have witnessed something of the like on our sea jour ney eiric nodded i wish you a long life of revenge friend i myself have scores to settle with jagreen lern and his ac complice his accomplice you mean king sarosto of dharijort a thin smile crossed the knights haggard face youll take no vengeance on sarostohe was assassinated soon after our forces were vanquished at the battle of sequa though noth ing was proved it is common knowledge that be was killed at me orders of me theocrat who now rule the entire con tinent the knight signed and who can stand for long against such captains as jagreen lem commands who are these captains why he has summoned an me dukes of hen to ban whether they will accept his mastery much longer i do not know it is our belief that jagreen lem win be the next to dieand hell unchecked will rule in his placel i hope not eiric said softly for i wont be cheated of my vengeance the knight shrugged with the dukes of hell as his allies jagreen urn will soon rule me world let us hope i can find a means of disposing of mat dark aristocracy and keeping my vow to slay jagreen lern eiric said and with a wave of thanks to the seer and the two knights turned his horse towards the mountains of jharkor moonglum in his wake they got little rest on their perilous ride to me mountain stormbringer home of sepfriz for as the knight had told mem the ground itself seemed alive and anarchy ruled everywhere afterwards eiric remembered little save a feeling of utter horror and me noise of unholy screechings in his ear dark colours gold reds blue black and me flaring orange that was everywhere me sign of chaos on earth but on me way he managed to inform moonglum of his previous encounter with sepiriz and told him something of what me lord of nihrain had mentioned of his destiny how the last of me royal line of old melnibooe eiric and dyvim slorm bore blades of chaosmake which were destined to destroy me rule of chaos on me planet and prepare me world for its death and rebirth as an era where law would dominate moonglum had not replied had instead resolved to stand vim eiric when the final day came whether they won or lost the war against chaos in the mountain regions dose to nihrain they saw evidence mat me rule of chaos was not so complete as in other parts nearby this proved mat sepiriz and his nine black brothers last of me nihrain were exerting at least some control against me forces threatening to engulf them through steep gorges of towering black rock along treach erous mountain paths down slopes that rattled with loose tones and seemed likely to start an avalanche they pressed deeper and deeper into the heart of me ancient mountains these were me oldest mountains in me world and they held one of me earths most ancient secretethe domain of me immortal nihrain who had ruled for centuries even before me coming of me melnibooeaxn whose bright empire had lasted ten thousand years and men at last they came to the hewn city of nihrain its towering palaces temples and fortresses cut into the living black granite hidden in the depths of a gorge that might have been bottomless virtually cut off from all but me faint est filterings of sunlight it had brooded here since earliest times down me narrow paths they guided their reluctant steeds unt they had reached a huge gateway which was carved with the figures of titans and halfmen looming above them mat moonglum gasped and immediately fell silent michael moorcock overawed by the genius which could accomplish the twin feats of gigantic engineering and powerful art in the caverns of nihrain also carved to represent scenes from the legends of the nihrain sepiriz awaited them a wel coming smile on his thinlipped ebony face greetings sepiriz eiric dismounted and allowed slaves to lead his horse away moonglum did likewise a trifle war fly i was informed correctly sepiriz clasped elric s shoul ders in his hands i am glad for i learned you were bound to sorcerers isle to seek the white lords help truc is their help then unobtainable not yet we ourselves are trying to contact them with me aid of the hermit magicians of me islands but so far chaos has blocked our attempts but there is work for you and your sword nearer to home come to my chamber and refresh yourselves we have some wine which will revitalise you and when you have drunk your fill tell you what task fate has decided for you now eiric put down his cup and breathed in deeply feeling relaxed and invigorated he pointed at me winejar and said a man might easily become addicted to such a brewl im addicted already moonglum grinned pouring faim nelf another cup sepiriz shook his head it has a strange quality our nihrain wine it tastes pleasant and refreshes the weary yet once his strength is regained me man who drinks it then is nauseated that is why we stfll have some in our cellars but our stocks are lowthe vines from which it was made have long since passed from the earth a magic potion moonglum said replacing his cup on the table if you like to so designate it eiric and i are of an earlier age when magic was normal and chaos ruled if more quietly than now you men of the young kingdoms are perhaps right to loathe it as you do for we hope to ready me world for law soon and then perhaps tbcy u find similar brews by more painstaking methods methods they can understand bet ter i doubt it moonglum laughed eiric sighed if we are not ludder man we have been stormbringer we u see chaos unleashed on me globe and law forever van quished he said gloomily and no luck for us if law is triumphant eh sepiriz poured himself a cup of the wine showing that be also must be weary with his own efforts what do you mean moonglum asked curiously sepiriz told him that he and eiric though fighting chaos were actually fitted to a world where chaos to a great extent was dominant in the worid they hoped for where law ruled there would be no place for their like moonglum looked sharply at eiric understanding that much more of his friends unenviable predicament you said there was work for me and my sword sepiriz jbuic leaned forward whats its nature you have no doubt already learned that jagreen lem has summoned the dukes of hell to captain his men and keep bis conquered lands under control yes you understand the import of this jagreen lem has succeeded in making a sizeable breach in the lawconstructed barrier which has hitherto kept me creatures of chaos from wholly ruling the planet he is forever widening this breach as his power increases this explains how he could summon such a mighty assembly of hells nobility where in the past i it was hard to bring one to our plain arioch is among them ariochi arioch was euics patron the principle god wor shipped by his ancestors then i am now a total outcast un protected either by law or by chaosf your only dose supernatural ally is your sword sepiriz said grimly and perhaps its brothers what brothers there is only me sistersword moumblade which dyvim slorm has do you remember that i told you how the twin swords were actually only an earthly manifestation of their supernat ural selves sepiriz said calmly yes well i can ten you now that stonnbrmgers real being is related to other supernatural force on another plane i know how to summon them but these relations are also creatures of chaos and therefore as far as youre concerned somewhat hard to control they could well get out of hand in some michael moorcock wayperhaps even tura against you stormbringer as you have discovered in the past is bound to you by ties even stronger than those which bind it to its brothers but its broth era outnumber it and stormbringer might not be able to pro tect you against them why have i never known this you have known it in a way do you remember times when you have called for help and help has come yes you mean that this help has been supplied by stormbringers brethren i do already they are used to coming to your help they are not what you and i would call intelligent though sen tient and are therefore not so strongly bound to chaos as its reasoning servants they can be controlled to a degree by anyone who has power such as you have over one of their brothers if you need their help you will need to remember a rune which i shall tell you later and what is my task to destroy me dukes of heu but thats impossible they are one of me mightiest groups ifl the entire domain of chaos true but you control one of the mightiest weapons that is your task already mere are hints that the demon dukes have taken some of jagreen lems power from him the fool he stfll refuses to realise mat he is a puppet of chaos and thinks he can rule over such supernatural might as the dukes represent but it is a certainty mat with these friends jagreen lem can defeat the southlands with a minimum of expenditure in arms and men without them he could do hbut it would take more time and effort and therefore give us a slight advantage to prepare against him white he subdues the southlands eiric did not bother to ask sepiriz how he knew of the southerners decision to fight jagreen lern alone sepiriz ob viously had many powers as was proved by his ability to coo tact brie through the seer i have sworn to help the southlands in spite of their re fusal to side with us against me theocraf he said calmly and youll keep your oathby destroying the dukes if you can destroying arioch and balaa and maluk eiric stormbringer whispered the names fearful that even here he might invoke them arioch has always been an intractable demon moon glum pointed out manys the time in the past he has refused to aid you eiric because sepiriz said be already had some knowledge that you and he were to fight in the future though the wine bad refreshed his body eiric began to ache in different ways the strain on his soul was almost at breaking point to fight the demongod his ancestors had worshipped for millenia the old blood was still strong in him the old loyalties stm present sepiriz rose and gripped ejrica shoulder staring with black eyes into the dazed and smouldering red you have pledged yourself to this mission remember eiric drew himself upright nodded vaguely aye and even had i been given this knowledge before i made the pledge i would still have made it but what do not place too much faith in my ability to fulfil this part sepiriz the black nihrain said nothing later he left eiric brooding and returned with a white tab let on which old nines were engraved he handed it to the albino who received it wordlessly memoriae the spell sepiriz said soflty and then destroy fee tablet but remember only use it in an extreme emergency for as i warned you stormbringers brethren may refuse to aid you eiric made an effort and controlled his emotion for a long time long after moonglum had gone to rest he studied the rune learning not only how to verbalise it but also me twists of logic which he would have to understand and the state of mind into which he must put himself if h were to be effeo five when both he and sepiriz were satisfied eiric allowed a lave to take him to his sleeping chamber but slumber came hard to him and he spent the night in restless torment until a slave came to wake him the next morning and found him fully dressed and ready to ride for pan tang where the dukes of hell were assembled four through the stricken lands of the west rode biric and moon ghim astride sturdy nihrain steeds that seemed to need no rest and contained no fear the nihrain horses were a special gift for they had certain additional powers to their unnatural strength and endurance sepiriz had told them how in fact the steeds did not have full existence on the earthly plane and that their hooves did not touch the ground in the strict sense but touched the stuff of their other plane this gave them the ability to appear to gallop on airor water scenes of terror were everywhere to be found at one time they saw in the distance a frightful sight a wild and hellish mob destroying a village built around a castle the castle it self was in flames and on the horizon a mountain gouted smoke and fire though the looters had human shape they were degenerate creatures spilling blood and drinking it with equal abandon and directing them without joining their orgy eiric and moonglum saw what seemed to be a corpse astride me living skeleton of a horse bedecked in bright trappmgs a naming sword in its band and a golden helm on its head they skirted the scene and rode fast away from it through mists that looked and smelt like blood over rivers dammed with death past rustling forests that seemed to follow them beneath skies often filled with ghastly winged shapes bearing even ghastlier burdens at other times they met groups of warriors many of them m the armour and trappings of the conquered nations but depraved and obviously sold to cfaao these they fought or avoided depending on me circum stance and when at last they reached die cliffs of jharkor and saw the sea which would take them to the isle of pan tang they knew they had ridden through a land which had become literally a hell on earth stormbringer scarcely stopping eiric and moonglum rode their horses over the water towards the evilheavy island of pan tang where jagreen lem and his terrible allies prepared to sail with their giant fleet and smash the seapower of me south be fore conquering the southlands themselves eirici moonglum called above the whining wind ahould we not proceed with more caution caution what need of that when me dukes of heu must surely know their turncoat servant comes to fight theml moonglum pursed his long lips disturbed for eiric was m a wild maddened mood he got little comfort also from the knowledge that sepiriz had charmed his shortaword and his sabre both with one of the few white spells be had at his command now the bleak cliffs of pan tang were in sight apray lashed and ominous the sea moaning about them as if in some special torment which chaos could inflict on nature it self and also around the island a peculiar darkness hovered shifting and changing they entered the darkness as the nihrain steeds pounded up the steep rocky beach of pan tang a place that had al ways been ruled by its black priesthood a grim theocracy that had sought to emulate the legendary sorcererkings of the bright empire of mclnibone but eiric last of those kings and landless now with few subjects knew that me dark arts had been natural and lawful to his ancestors whereas these humanbeings had perverted themselves to worship an unholy hierarchy they barely understood sepiriz had given them their route and they galloped across the turbulent land towards the capitalhwamgaarl city of screaming statues pan tang was an island of green shiny obsidian rock that gave off bizarre reflections rock that seemed alive soon they could see the looming walls of hwamgaarl m the distance as they drew nearer an army of blackcowied swordsmen chanting a particularly horrible litany seemed to rise from the ground ahead eiric had no time to spare for these recogniseable as a de tachment of jagreen leros warriorpriests up steedl be cried and the nihrain horse leapt sky wards passing over the disconcerted priests with a fantastic michael moorcock bound moonglum did likewise his laughter mocking them u he and his friend thundered on towards hwamgaaril their way was dear for ome distance since jagrcca lern had evidently expected the detachment to hold the pair at least for some time but when the city of screaming statues was barcty a mile away die ground began to grumble and gaping cracks split its surface this did not overiy disturb them for the nihrain horses had no use for earthly tenam in any case the sky above seemed to heave and shake itaelf the darknftss became flushed with streaks of i ebony and from the fissures m the ground monstrous shapes fpraag up vultureheaded lions fifteen feet high prowled in hungry anticipation towards them their feathered maaes rustling as they approached to moonglums frightened astonishment eiric laughed and the eastlander knew his friend had gone mad but eiric was ft nnur with this ghoulish pack since his own ancestors had formed it for their own purposes a dozen centuries before evidently jagreea lcrn had discovered the pack nuking on the bordera between chaos and earth and had utilised it without being aware of how it had been created old words formed on eirics pale lips and he spoke affec tionately to the towering birdbeasts they ceased their progress toward him and glanced uncer tainly around them their loyalties evidently divided feathered tails lashed daw worked in and out of pads scraping great gashes ia the rock and taking advantage of this eiric and moonglum walked their horses through mem and emerged just as a droning but angry voice rapped from the heavens ordering in the high tongue of mehubone destroy themt one lionvulture bounded uncertainly towards them an other followed it and another till the whole pack raced to catch them faster eiric whispered to the nihrain horse but the steed could hardly keep the distance separating them there was nothing for it but to turn deep in the recesses of his memory he recalled there was a certain spell he had teamed as a child au the old spells of memibone had been passed on to him by his father with the warning that in these stormbringer times many of them were virtually useless but there had been onethe spell for calling the vultureheaded uons and another spell now he remembered it the spell for sending them back to the domain of chaos would it work he adjusted his mind sought the words he needed as the beasts plunged on towards him creatures matik of melnibone made thee from stuff of unformed madness if thou wouldst live as thou art now get hence or afatiks brew again shall bet the creatures paused and desperately eiric repeated ac spell afraid that he had made a small mistake either within his mind or in the words moonglum who bad drawn his horse up beside eiric did not dare speak his fears for he knew the albino sorcerer must not be hindered while spellmaking he watched in trepida tion as the leading beast gave voice to a cawing roar but eiric heard the sound with relief for it meant the beasts had understood his threat and were still bound to obey the spell slowly halfreluctantly they crawled down into the fissures and vanished sweating eiric said triumphantly luck is with us so farl jagrccd lern either underestimated my powers or else this is all he could summon with his own more proof perhaps that chaos uses him and not the other way about tempt not such luck by speaking of it moonglum said warniagly from what youd told me these are puny things compared with that which we must soon face eiric shot an angry look at his friend and nodded briefly he did not like to think of his coming task now they neared the huge walls of hwamgaarl at inter vals along the walls which slanted outwards at an angle to encumber potential besiegers they saw the screaming stat uesonce men and women whom tagreen lern and his fore fathers had turned to rock but allowed them to retain then life and ability to speak they spoke little but screamed much their ghastly shouts rolling over the disgusting city like the tormented voices of the damnedand damned they were michael moorcock these sobbing waves of sound were horrifying even to el rics ears familiar with such sounds as they were then another noise blended with them as die mighty port cullis of hwamgaarts main gate squealed upwards and from it poured a host of wellaimed men evidently jagreen lems powers of sorcery have been ex hausted for the meantime and the dukes of hell disdain to join him in a fight against a pair of mere mortals eiric said reaching with his right band for the hilt of his black rune sword hanging at his left hip moonglum was beyond speech wordlessly he drew both his own charmed blades knowing he must fight and vanquish his own fear before be could encounter the men who ran at him with a wild howl that drowned out the screams from the statues stormbringer climbed from the scabbard and stood in erics hand waiting in anticipation for the new souls it might drink for the lifestuff which it could pass on to eiric and fill him with dark and stolen vitality eiric halfcringed at the feel of his blade in his damp hand but be shouted to the advancing soldiers see jackals see the sword forged by chaw to vanquish chaoal come let it drink your souls and spill your blood we are ready for you he did not wait but with moongluro behind him spurred the nihrain horse into the ranks hewing about him with something of the old delight now so symbioticauy linked with the hellblade was he that a hungry joy of killing swept through him the joy of soulstealing which drew a surging unholy vitality into his deficient veins though there were over a hundred warriors blocking hia path to the stillopen gate he smashed a bloody path through them and moonglum seized by something akin to his friends mood was equally successful in dispatching all who came against him familiar with horror as they were the soldiers soon be came loath to approach the screaming runesword as it shone with a peculiarly brilliant lighta black light that pierced the blackness itself laughing in his halfinsane triumph eiric felt the callous joy that his ancestors must have felt long ago when they con quered the world and made it kneel to the bright empire stormbringer chaos was indeed fighting chaosbut chaos of an older cleaner sort come to destroy me perverted upstarts who thought themselves as mighty as the dragon lords of melni bonet a bloody trench had formed in the enemys ranks and through this the pair plunged until the gateway gaped like a monsters maw before them without pausing eiric rode laughing through h and people scuttled to hiding as he entered in bizarre triumph the city of screaming statues where now gasped moonglum all fear driven from him to the theocrafs templepalace of courae there arioch and his fellow duke no doubt await us through the echoing streets of me city they rode proud and terrible as if with an army at their backs dark buildings towered above them but not a face dared peep from a win dow pan tang had planned to rule the woridand it might yetbut for the moment its denizens were fully demoralised by me sight of two men taking their huge city by storm they pulled their horses to a halt as they reached the wide plaza and saw the huge bronze sepulchre swinging on its chains in the centre beyond it rose jagreen lem s palace all columns and towers ominously quiet even the statues had ceased to scream and the horses hooves made no sound as eiric and moonghun approached the sepulchre the bloodreddened runesword was still in el rics hand and with it he took a mighty sweep at the chains supporting the sepulchrethe holiest vessel of this unholy place the supernatural blade bit into toe metal and severed the links the crash as the sepulchre dropped and smashed was mag nified a thousand times by me silence the noise echoed throughout hwamgaarl and every inhabitant left alive knew what it aignified thus i challenge tbee jagreen lornf eiric shouted aware that these words would also be heard by everyone i have come to pay uk debt i promisedl come puppetl be paused even his triumph not sufficient to fully quench his nervousness at what be must say now cornel bring hells dukes with youw michael moorcock moonglum swallowed his eyes rolling as he studied eirica twisted face the albino continued bring arioch and balao and maluk bring the proud princes of chaos with you for i have come to send them back to their own realm forever the silence again enfolded his highchadenge and he heard its echoes die away in the far places of die city then from somewhere inside die palace he heard a move ment his heart pounded against his ribcage threatening to break through the bones and hang throbbing on his chest as proof of his mortality he heard a sound like die clopping of monstrous hooves and ahead of it the measured steps that must be those of a man his eyes fixed themselves on die great golden doors of d palace halfhidden in uk shadows that die columns threw the doors began to open sflently then a figure dwarfed by die size of die doors stepped forth and stood mere regarding eiric with a horrible anger smouldering hi its eyes on its body scarlet armour glowed as if redhot on its left arm was a shield of die same stuff and in its hand a steel fword jagreen lern said in a voice that trembled with rage so king eiric you have kept part of your word after an and i plan to keep die rest of it eiric said widi sudden calm step forward dieocrat meet you fairly in single combat jagreen lem gave a sneering hollow laugh tairiy widi that blade in your hand once i met it and did not perish but now it bums with die blood and souls of a score of my best warriorpriests i would not be so foolish nolet diose you have challenged meet you he stepped to one side the doors gaped wider and if eiric expected giant figures to emerge he was disappointed the dukes had assumed die forms of men but there was a power about diem mat filled die air as diey moved to stand disdainful of jagreen lern upon die topmost step of die palace eiric glimpsed their beautiful smiling faces and shuddered stormbringer again for diere was a kind of love on dieir faces a kind of pridea kind of confidence so that for a moment he was filled widi die wish to jump from his horse and fling himself dieir feet to plead forgiveness for what he had become well eiric said arioch the leader sofdy would you repeat and return to us the voice was silvery in its beauty and eiric halfmade to dismount but then be clapped bis hands to his ears die runesword hanging by its wristthrong and cried no no i must do what i must your time like mine is overt do not speak dius eiric balan said persuasively bis words passing eirics hands and whispering in his skutl chaos has never been dus powerful on earthnot even in earliest days we shall make you greatwe shall make you a lord of chaos equal to ourselves we give you immortality eiric if you behave so foolishly as you behave now you will bring yourself only death and none shall remember you i know diat i would not wish to be remembered in a world ruled by law maluk laughed sofdy that will never come to pass we block every move diat law makes to try to bring help to earth and this is why you must be destroyed eiric cried we are immortalwe can never be slain arioch said and diere was a tinge of impatience in his voice then i shall send you back to chaos in such a way that you shall never have power on the earth again eiric swung his runeblade into his hand and it trembled diere moaning quietly as if unsure of itself ust as he was see balan walked partway down the steps seeeven your trusted sword knows diat we speak truth you speak a sort of tnidi moooglum said in a quaver ing tone astonished at his own bravery but i remember something of a greater trutha law that should bind both chaos and lawthe law of die balance the supreme spirit holds diat balance over the earth and it should be that chaos and law war to keep diat balance straight sometimes the balance tips one way sometimes anotherand dius are die ages of die earth created but an incqual balance of this magnitude is wrong in your struggling you of chaos may have forgotten this we have forgotten h for good reason mortal the bal michael moorcock ance has tipped to nidi an extent in our favour that it is no longer adjustable we triumph i eiric used this pause to collect himself sensing his renewed strength stormbringer responded with a confident purr the dukes also sensed it and glanced at one another ariocba beautiful face seemed to fiare with anger and his pseudobody glided down the steps towards ejric his fellow dukes following eirics steed backed away a few paces a blot of living fire seemed to appear in arioch s hand and it shot towards me albino he felt cold pain in his chest and he staggered in me saddle your body is unimportant eiric but think of a similar blow to your soul arioch screamed the facade of patience dropping from him eiric flung back his head and laughed arioch had be trayed himself if he had remained calm he would have bad a greater advantage but now he showed himself perturbed whatever he had said to the contrary ariochyou aided me in the past you wffl regret that theres still time to undo my folly upstart mortal an other bolt came streaking towards him but eiric passed stormbringer before it and observed in relief that it deflect ed the unholy weapon but against such might they were surely doomed unless they could invoke some supernatural aid but eiric dared not risk summoning his nmeswords brothers not yet he must think of some other means as be retreated towards the searing bolts moonglum be hind him whispering almost impotent charms he thought of ac vulturelions he had sent back to chaos perhaps he could recall themfor a different purpose the spell was fresh in his mind requiring a slightly changed mental state and scarcely changed wording calmly working mechanically to deflect the bolts of the dukes whose features had changed hideously to retain their previous beauty but take on an increasingly malevolent ap pearance he uttered the spell creatures matik of mejnibone made thee from stuff of unformed madness stormbringer thou wouldst live then aid me now come hither or matiks brew again shall be from out of the rolling darks of the plaza the beaked beasts appeared prowling eiric yelled at the dukes mortal weapons cannot harm you but these are beasts of your own planesample their ferocity he ordered the vulturelions upon the dukes obviously put out by this arioch and his fellows backed towards the steps again calling their own commands to the giant animals but the things advanced gathering speed eiric saw arioch shout rave and then his body seemed to split asunder and rise in a new less recognisable shape as the beasts attacked ah was suddenly ragged colour sound and disordered matter behind the embattled demons eiric saw jagreen lem run ning back into his palace hoping that the creatures he had summoned would hold the dukes eiric rode his horse around the boiling mass and galloped up the steps through the doors the two men rode catching a glimpse of the terrified theocrat running before them your allies were not so strong as you believed jagreen lem eiric yelled as he bore down upon his enemy why you foolish latecomer did you think your knowledge matched that of a melnibonean jagreen lem began to climb a winding staircase labouring up me steps too afraid even to look back eiric laughed again and pulled his horse to a stop watching me running man dukes dukes sobbed jagreen lem as he climbed do not desert me now moonglum whispered surely those creatures will not de feat the aristocracy of hell eiric shook his head i do not expect them to but if i fin ish jagreen lem at least it could put an end to his conquests and demonsummoning he spurred the nihrain steed up the steps after the theocrat who heard him coming and flung himself into a room eiric heard a bar fall and bolts squeal when he reached the door it fell in at a blow of his sword and he was in a small chamber jagreen lem had disap peared michael moorcock dismounting etric went to a small door in me farthest corner of the room and again demolished it a narrow stair led upwards obviously into a tower now he could take his vengeance he thought as he reached yet another door at the top of the stair anddrew back bis sword to smite it the blow fell but the door held curse the thing it is protected by charms he swore he was just about to aim another blow when he heard moonglums urgent calling from below eirici eirictheyve defeated the creatures they are re turning to the palace he would have to leave jagreen lern for the meantime he sprang down the steps into the chamber and out on to the stair in the hall he saw the flowing shapes of the unholy trinity halfway up the stair moonglum was quaking stormbringer said eiric it is time to summon your brothers the sword twisted in bis hand as if in assent eiric began to chant the mindtorturing throattorturing rune that sepiriz had taught him stormbringer moaned a counterpoint chorus to the dirge as the battleworn dukes assumed different shapes and began to rise menacingly towards eiric then in the air all about him he saw shapes appear shadowy shapes half on his own plane half on the plane of chaos he saw them stir and suddenly it seemed as if the air was filled with a million swords each a twin to stonnbringeri acting on instinct eiric released his grip on his blade and flung it towards the rest it hung in the air before them and they seemed to acknowledge it lead them stonnbrmgert lead them against the dukesor your master perishes and youll not drink another human soul again the sea of swords rustled and a dreadful moaning emanated from them the dukes flung themselves upwards towards the albino and he recoiled before ihe evil hatred that poured from the twisting shapes glancing down he saw moonglum slumped in his saddle and did not know if be had perished or fainted then the swords rushed upon the reaching dukes and el rics head swam with the sight of a million blades plunging into the stuff of their beings the unholy noise of the battle filled his ears the dreadful stormbringer sight of he toiling conflict clouded his vision without stormbringers vitality he felt weak and limp he felt his knees shake and crumple and he could do nothing to aid the black swords brothers as they clashed with the dukes of hell he collapsed aware that if he witnessed such horror much longer he would become totally insane thankfully be felt his mind go blank and then at last he was unconscious unable to know which would win five his body itched his arms and bade ached his wrists pound ed with agony eiric opened his eyes immediately opposite him spreadeagled in chains against the wall he saw moonglum dull flame nickered in the centre of the place and he felt pain cm his naked knee looked down and saw jagreen lern the theocrat spat at him so eiric said hohowly i failed you triumph after ad jagreen lem did not look triumphant rage still burned in his eyes oh how shall i punish you he said punish me then elric s heartbeat increased your final spell succeeded the theocrat said dully turn ing away to contemplate the brazier both your allies and mine vanished and all my attempts to contact the dukes have proved fruitless you achieved your threator your minions didyou sent them back to chaos foreveri my swordwhat of that the tbeocrat smiled bitterly thats my only pleasure your sword vanished with its brothers you are weak and helpless now ebic you are mine to maim and torture until the end of my life eiric was dumbfounded by the news part of him rejoiced that the dukes had been beaten part of him lamented the loss of his sword as jagreen lem had emphasised without the blade he was less than half a man for his albinoism weakened him already bis eyesight was dimmer and he felt no response in his limbs jagreen lem looked up at him enjoy the comparatively painless days left you eiric but i leave you to anticipate what i have in store for you i must away and instruct my men in the final preparations for the warfleet soon to sail against the south i wont waste time otormbringer with crude torture now for all the while i shall be scheming the most exquisite tortures conceivable you shall take long years to die i swear he left the cell and as the door slammed he heard jagreen lem instructing the guard keep the brazier at full blast let them sweat like damned souls in bell feed them enough to keep them alive once ev ery three days they will soon be crying for water give them only sufficient to sustain their lives they deserve far worse than this and theyll get their desserts when my mind has had time to work on the problem a day later the real agony began their bodies gave out the last of their sweat their tongues were swollen m their heads and all the time as they groaned in their torment they were aware that this terrible torture would be nothing com pared to what they might expect eirics weakened body would not respond to his desperate struggling and at length his mind dulled the agony became constant and familiar and time was nonexistent finally through a painthick daze be recognised a voice the hatefilled voice of jagreen lem others were in the chamber he felt their bands seize him and his body was suddenly light as he was borne moaning from the cell though he heard disjointed phrases he could make no sense of jagreen lerns words he was taken to a dark place that rolled about hurting his scorched chest later be heard moonglums voice and strained to hear the words eirici whats happening were aboard a ship at sea fd awearr but eiric mumbled disinterestedly gradually his deficient body was weakening faster than would a normal mans he thought of zarozinia whom he would never see again he knew he would not live to know whether law or chaos fi nally won or even if die southlands would stand against the theocrat and tbeae problems were fading in his mind again then the food started to come and die water and it revived turn somewhat at some stage he opened his eyes and stared upwards into the thinly smiling face of jagreen lem michael moorcock thank the gods said die theocrat i feared wed lost you youre a delicate case to be sure my friend you must stay alive longer than this to begin my entertainment i have arranged for you to sail on my own flagship we are now crossing the dragon sea our fleet wellprotected by charms against the monsters roaming these parts he forwned thanks to you we havent the same call for the charms which would have borne us safely through me chaostorn waters they are almost normal for the moment but that will soon be changed ehics old spirit returned for a moment and he glared at his enemy too weak to voice the loathing he felt jagreen lern laughed sofly and stirred erics gaunt white head with the toe of his boot i think i can brew a drug which will give you a little more vitality the food was foultasting and had to be forced between erics mumbling lips but after a while he was able to sit up and observe the huddled body of moonglum evidently me little man had totally succumbed to his torture to bis sur prise eiric discovered he was unfettered and he crawled the agonising distance between himself and the eastlander shak ing moonglums shoulder he groaned but did not respond a shaft of dim light appeared and biric looked up to see mat the hatchcover bad been prised aside and jagreen lem stared down at him i see the brew had its effect come eiric smell the invig orating sea and fed the warm sun on your body we are not many infles from the coasts of argimiliar and our scoutships report quite a sizeable fleet sailing hence eiric cursed by arioch i hope they send you all to the bottom i jagreen lern pursed his lips mockingly by whom ari och do you not remember what ensued in my own palace arioch cannot be invoked not by younot by me your stinking spells saw to that he turned to an invisible lieutenant bind him and bring him on deck you know what to do with him two warriors dropped into me hold and grasped the still weak eiric tying his arms and legs and manhandling hiffl on to the deck he gasped as the suns glare struck his eyes prop him up so be may see all jagreen lero ordered the warriors obeyed and eiric was lifted to a sending stormbringer position seeing jagreen lcms huge black flagship with its silken deck canopies flapping in a steady westerly breeze its three banks of straining oarsmen and its tall ebony mast bear ing a sail of dark red beyond the ships rails eiric saw a massive fleet surging in the flagships wake as well as the vessels of pan tang and dharijor there were many from jharkor shazar and tarkesh but on every scariet sail the merman blazon of pan tang was painted depression filled eiric for he knew that the southlands however strong could not match a fleet like this we have been at sea for only three days said jagreen lem but thanks to a witchwind were almost at our des tination a scout ship has recently reported that the lor myrian navy hearing rumours of our superior seapower is sailing to join with us a wise move of king montanfor the moment at any rate ill make use of him for the time being and when his usefulness is over hi have him killed for the treacherous turncoat he is why do you tell me all this eiric whispered his teeth gritted against the pain that came with any slight movement of his face or body because i want you to witness for yourself tee defeat of the south i want you to know that what you sought to avert wfll come to pass after we have subdued the south and sucked her of her treasures we m vanquish the isle of tee purple towns and press forward to sack vilmir and flmion that wffl be an easy matter dont you agree when eiric did not reply jagreen lem gestured impa tiently to his men tie him to me mast so that he may get a good view of the battle hi put a protective charm around his body for i do not want him to be killed by a stray arrow and cheat me of my full vengeance eiric was borne up and roped to the mast but he was scarcely aware of it for his head lolled on his right shoulder only semiconscious the massive fleet plunged onwards certain of victory by miaufternoon eiric was aroused from his stupor by the shout of the helmsman sad to the southeast lormyrian fleet approaches michael moorcock with impotent anger eiric saw the fifty twomasted ships their sails bright against the sombre scarlet of jagreen lems vessels come into line with the others lormyr though a smaller power than argimiliar had a larger navy eiric judged that king mootans treachery had cost the south more than a quarter of its strength now he knew there was absolutely no hope for the south and that jagreen lems certainty of victory was wellfounded night fell and the huge fleet lay at anchor a guard came to feed eiric a mushy porridge containing another dose of the revitalising drug as he revived his anger increased and jagreen lern paused by the mast on two occasions taunting him savagely soon after dawn we shall meet the southern fleet jagreen lem smiled and by noon what is left of it will float as bloody driftwood behind us as we press on to establish our reign over those nations who so foolishly relied on their sea power as defence eiric remembered how he had warned the icings of the southlands that this was likely to happen if they stood alone against the theocrat but he wished that he had been wrong with the defeat of the south the conquest of the east seemed bound to follow and when jagreen lera ruled the world chaos would dominate and the earth revert to the sniff from which it had been formed millions of years before au through that moonless night he brooded pulling his thoughts together summoning all his strength for a plan that was as yet only a shadow in the back of his mind six the rattle of anchors woke him shaking in the light of the watery sun he saw the southern fleet on the horizon riding gracefully in hollow pomp towards the ships of jagreen lem either he thought the southern kings were very brave or else they did not understand the strength of their enemies beneath him on jagreen lems foredeck a great catapult rested and slaves had already filled its cup with a large hall of flaming pitch normally eiric knew such catapults were an encumbrance since when they reached that size they were difficult to rewind and gave lighter warmachines the advan tage yet obviously jagreen lems engineers were not fools eiric noted extra mechanisms on the big catapult and realised they were equipped to rewind rapidly the wind had dropped and five hundred pairs of muscles alone strove to row jagreen lems galley along on the deck in disciplined order his warriors took their posts beside the great boarding platforms that would drop down on to op ponent ships and grapple them at the same time as they formed a bridge between the vessels eiric was forced to admit that jagreen lern had used fore right he had not relied wholly on supernatural aid his ships were the best equipped he had ever seen the southern fleet eiric decided was doomed to fight jagreen lem was not braveryit was insanity but jagreen lern had made one mistake he had in his gnawing desire for vengeance ensured that ekics vitality was restored for a few hours and this vitality extended to his mind as well as his body stormbringer had vanished with the sword he was among men all but invincible without it he was helpless these were facts therefore he must somehow regain the blade but how it had returned to the plane of chaos with its brothers michael moorcock presumably drawn back there by the overwhelming force of me rest he must contact it he dare not summon me entire horde of blades with spell that would be tempting providence too far he heard the sudden thwack and roar as the giant catapult discharged its first shot the flameshrouded pitch went arching over the ocean and landed short boiling me sea around it as it guttered and sank swiftly the warengine was rewound and he marvelled at the speed as another ball of flaring pitch was forked into its cup jagreen lcm looked up at him and laughed my pleasure will be shortmere are not enough of them to put up a decent fight watch them perish eiric brie said nothing pretended to be dazed and frightened the next fireball struck one of the leading ships directly and eiric saw tiny figures scampering about striving desper ately to quench the spreading pitch but within a minute the whole ship was ablaze a gouting mass of flame as me figures now jumped overboard unable to save their vessel now the air around him sounded to the rushing heat of the fireballs and within range now the southerners retaliated with their lighter machines until it seemed the sky was filled with a thousand comets and the heat almost equalled that which ei ric had experienced in the torture chamber mack smoke began to drift as the brass beaks of the ships rams ground through timbers impaling ships like skewered fish the hoarse yells of fighting men began to sound and ei ric heard the dash of iron as the first few opposing warriors met but now be only vaguely beard me sounds for he was con cenfrating at last he was ready and aware that his voice would prob ably not be heard by human ears above the noise of war called in a desperate and agonising voice stormbringer his straining mind echoed the shout and he seemed to look beyond the turbulent battle beyond the ocean beyond the very earth to a place of shadows and terror something moved there many things moved there stormbringeri he heard a curse from beneath him and saw jagreen lem pointing up at him stormbmnger gag the whitefaced sorcerer jagreen lcrns eyes met el rics and the theocrat sucked in his tips deliberating a bare moment before adding and if that doesnt put an end to his babblingslay him the lieutenant began to climb the mast towards eiric stormbringerl your master perishesi he struggled in the biting ropes but could hardly move stormbringer all his life he had hated the sword he relied so much upon now he called for it as a lover calls for his betrothed the warrior grasped his foot and shook it silence you beard my master with insane eyes eiric looked down at the warrior who shuddered and drew his sword hanging to the mast with one hand and readying himself to make a stab at eirics vitals stormbringeri eiric sobbed the name he must kve without him chaos would surely nde the world the man hinged at elric s bodyyet the blade did not reach the albino then eiric remembered with sudden hu mour that jagreen lcrn had placed a protective spell about him the thcocrats own magic had saved his enernyl stormbringerr now the warrior gasped and the sword dropped from hia fingers he seemed to grapple with something invisible at his throat and eiric saw me mans fingers sliced off and blood sport from the stumps then slowly a shape materialised and with bounding relief the albino saw that it was a wordbis own runesword impaling the warrior and sucking out his soult the warrior dropped but stormbringer hung tn the air and men turned to slash the ropes restraining eirics hands and men nestled firmly with horrid affection in ita masters right fist at once the stolen lifestuff of the warrior began to pour through eirics being and the pain of his body vanished quickly be grasped a piece of me sails rigging and cut away the rest of bis bonds until he was swinging by one hand on tile rope now jagreen lem well sec who takes vengeance fi nally he wrenched up he hatchcover and stared down at the pitiful figure of his friend evidently he had been left to starve to death a rat scuttled away as the light shone down michael moorcock eiric jumped into the hold and saw with horror that part of moonglums right arm had been gnawed already he heaved the body on to his shoulder aware that the heart still beat though faintly and clambered back on to the deck how to ensure his friends safety and still take vengeance on jagreen lem was a problem but eiric moved towards the boarding platform which he guessed the theocrat to have crossed as he did so three warriors leapt towards him one of them cried the albino the reaver has escaped f eiric struck him down with a blow that required only a flick of his wrist the black sword did the rest the others re treated remembering how eiric had entered hwamgaari new energy flowed through him for every corpse he killed his strength increaseda stolen strength but accessary if he was to survive and win the day for law he ran untroubled by his burden over the boarding plat form and on to the deck of the southern ship up ahead he saw the standard of argimiliar and a little group of men around it headed by king hozel himself his face gaunt as he stared at the knowledge of his own death a deserved death thought eiric grimly but nonetheless when hozel died it would mean another victory for chaos then he heard a shout of a different quality thought for a moment he had been observed but one of hozels men was pointing to the north sod mouthing something eiric looked in the direction and saw with mixed emo tions the brave sails of the purple towns they were brightly painted and gay some even embroidered for the only rich decoration die sealords allowed themselves was upon their sails but they had arrived belatedly even if they had sailed with the other southern vessels it would have been unlikely mat they could have turned the day against pan tang at that moment staring around him jagreen lem saw ei ric and bellowed at his men who moved forward warily and reluctantly approaching me albino in a wide semicircle eiric cursed the brave sealords who had added a further factor to his indecision menacingly he swung the moaning runeblade about him u he advanced to meet the halfterrified pan tang wrriora stormbringer they dropped back boom of them groaning as the blade touched them the way wm now dear to jagreen lenl but me ships of the purple towns were drawing closer al most within catapult range eiric looked directly into jagreen lcrns frightened face and snarled i doubt if my blade haa me strength to pierce your burning armour with one blow aad one blow is an i have time for i leave yon now theocrat but remember mat even if you conquer all the world including me unknown lands of me east have my sword drink your black soul at length with that he dropped moonglums unconscious body over board acd dived after it into the choppy sea resuming his hold on his friends body he began to swim with superhuman strokes towards the leading vessel of the sealords kargans ship now behind him jagreen lem and his men saw their own flagship blazing eiric had done his work well that too would serve to divert attention from kargans fleet trusting to me sealords famed seamanship he swam directly in the path of the leading galleon shouting kargan s name the ship veered slightly and he saw bearded faces at the rail saw ropes flicker towards him and grasped one letting them haul him upwards with his burden until he was pulled over the side kargan stared at him with shocked eyes eliici we thought you deadand now i see you have been or worse eiric spat saltwater from his mouth and said urgently turn your fleet kargani turn it back the way it has come there is no hope of saving the soutblanderathey are doomed we must preserve our forces for a later struggle hesitating momentarily kargan gave the order which was swiftly relayed to the rest of his sixty strong fleet as me ships turned away eiric noted that hardly a south ern ship remained afloat for more than a mile the water burned and the spluttering of the flaming sinking ships was blended with the screams of the maimed and drowning michael moorcock with the southern aeapower crushed so decisively kar gan said watching the physician who was tending to mooo glura the lands will not last long before pan tangs marching hordes like us the south relied too much on its ships it has taught me that we must strengthen our land de fences if we are to have any chance at all from now on well use your island as our main headquar ters eiric said well fortify the whole place and from there keep in close touch with what is happening in the south how is my friend physician the physician looked up these are no battlemade wounds hes been hurt sorely but hell live he should recover to perfect fitness given a month or so of rest he h have it eiric promised he gripped the nmesword at his belt and wondered what other tasks lay in store for mem before the last great battle between law and chaos was joined chaos would soon rule more than half me worid in spite of the powerful blow he had dealt it in forever sentencing the dukes of hell to their own plane the more power that jagreen lem gathered the more the threat from chaos would increase he sighed and looked northwards two days later they returned to the isle of the purple towns the fleet remaining in the largest harbour of utkel since it was thought wise to have it at hand and not disperse ft all that following night eiric talked with the sealords or dered messengers to vilmir and iimiora and towards morn ing there came a polite knock on the door of the room kargan got up to open it and stared in astonishment at the tall blackfaced man who stood there sepiriz eiric cried how did you come here on horseback smiled the giant and you know me power of the nihrain steeds i had come to warn you we have at last managed to contact the white lords but they can do little as yet somehow a path to their plane must be made through the barricades which chaos has constructed against them jagreen lems ships have vomited their con tents on the southern shores and his warriors swarm inland there is nothing we can do now to stop his conquests there stormbringer once consolidated his earthly power increased he win be able to summon more and more allies from chaos then where does my next task lie eiric asked softly i am not sure yet but that is not what i came for your blades sojourn with its brothers has strengthened it you may have noticed how swiftly it pours power into your body now eiric nodded that power is evillygained and is evil in itself the blades strength will continue to increase and yours will also but as chaosbegotten power fills your being you will have to fight yet more strongly to control the force within you eiric sighed and grasped sepinzs arm thanks for the warning friend but when i beat the dukes of hell to whom i formerly pledged allegiance i did not expect to escape with a mere scratch or a fleshwound know this sepiriz he turned to the watching sealords and know this all of you he drew the groaning runeblade from its scabbard and held it aloft so that it shone and flared in its awful power this blade was forged by chaos to conquer chaos and mat is my destiny too though the world transmutes to boiling gas i shall live now i swear by the balance of the cosmos that law shall triumph and new age come to the earth taken aback by this grim vow the sealords glanced at one another and sepiriz smiled let us hope so eiric he said let us hope so book three sad giants shield thirteen times thirteen the steps to the sad giants lair and the chaos shield lies there seven time seven are the elder trees twelve times twelve warriors he sees but the chaos shield lies there and the hero fair will the sad giant dare and a red sword wield for the sad giants shield on a mournful victory day the chronicle of the black sword one across the world the shadow of anarchy had fallen neither god nor man nor that which ruled both could clearly read the future and see the fate of earth as the forces of chaos increased their strength through the machinations of their hu man minions from westland mountain over me agitated ocean to southland plain chaos now held its monstrous sway tor mented miserable unable to hope any longer for liberation from the corroding warping influence of chaos the remnants of races fled over the two continents already fallen to the hu man minions of disorder led by their warped theocrat jagreen lem of pan tang aqufline highshouldered and greedy for power in his glowing scarlet armour controlling human vultures and supernatural creatures alike as he widened his black boundaries upon the face of the earth all was disruption and roaring anguish save for the thinly populated already threatened eastern continent and the isle of the purple towns which now readied itself to withstand jagreen lems initial on slaught the onrushing tide of chaos must soon sweep the world unless some great force could be summoned to halt it bleakly bitterly the few who still resisted jagreen lern under the command of eiric of melnibone talked of strategy and tactics in the full knowledge that more than these were needed to beat back jagreen lems unholy horde desperately eiric attempted to utilise me ancient sorcery of his emperor forefathers to contact the white lords of law but he was unused to seeking such aid and as well the forces of chaos were now so strong that those of law could no longer gain easy access to the earth as they had contrived to do in earlier times as they prepared for the coming fight eiric and his allies micfml moorcock watt about the preparation with heavy routs and a sense of die futility of such action and in the back of eirics mind was the constant knowledge that even if he won against chaos the very act of winning would destroy the worid be knew and leave it ripe for the forces of law to ruleand there would be no place in such a worid foi the wild albino sorcerer beyond the earthly plane in their bordering realms the lords of chaos and of law watched the struggle and even they did not realise eirics entire destiny chaos triumphed chaos blocked the efforts of law on each occasion they tried to pass through the domain of chaos now the only road to earth and the lords of law shared elites frustration and if chaos and law were observing the earth and her struggle who watched these for chaos and law were but the twin weights in a balance and the hand that held the bal ance though it rarely deigned to interfere in their struggle still less in tile affairs of men had reached the rare state of a decision to alter the status quo which weight would drop which rise could men decide could the lords decide or could only the cosmic hand remould the pattern of the earth reforming her stuff changing her spiritual constituents and placing her on a different path a fresh course of destiny perhaps all would play some part before the outcome was decided the great zodiac influencing the universe and its ages had completed its twelve cycles and the cycles would soon begin again the wheel would spin and when it stopped its spin ning which symbol would dominate how changed would it be great movements on the earth and beyond it great des tinies were being shaped great deeds were being planned and marvellously could it just be possible that in spite of the lords of the higher worlds in spite of the cosmic hasd in spite of the myriad supernatural denizens that swarmed the universe that man might decide the issue evenone man one man one sword one destiny eiric of melniboof sat hunched in his saddle watching the warriors bustle to and fro around him in the city square of bakshaan here years before be had conducted a siege stormbringer against the citys leading merchant tricked others and left rich but such scores that they held against him were now for gotten pushed from their minds by me threat of war and the knowledge that if eirics command could not save them nothing could the waus of the city were being widened and heightened warriors being trained in the use of unfamiliar warengines from being a lazy merchant city bakshaan had become a functional place ready for battle when it came for a month eiric had been riding the length and breadth of the eastern kingdoms of ilmiora and vihnir overseeing preparations building the strength of the two nations into an efficient war machine now be studied parchments handed him by his lieutenants and recalling all the old tactical skill of bis ancestors gave them his decisions the sun set and heavy black clouds hung against a sharp metallic blue sky stretching over the horizon eiric loosened his cloak strings and allowed the folds of the garment to en close him for a chill had come then as he silently regarded the sky to the west be frowned as he noticed something like a flashing golden star appear moving swiftly towards him ever wary for signs of the coming of chaos be turned in his saddle shouting every man to his position ware the golden globe the thing approached rapidly until soon it was hanging aver die city all men looking up at it in astonishment their hands on their weapons as black night fell the clouds admit ting no moonlight the globe began to fall towards the spires of bakshaan a strange luminescence pulsing from it eiric tugged stormbringer from its scabbard and black fire nick ered along die blade as it gave out a low moaning sound the globe touched die cobbles of die citysquarebroke into a million fragments that glowed for a moment before vanish ing eiric laughed in relief resheathing stormbringer as be saw who now stood in die place of die golden globe sepiriz my friend you choose strange means of transport to carry you from die gorge of nihrain the tall blackfaced seer smiled his white pointed teem fame i have so few carriages of dial type dial i must only use diem when pressed i come with news for you much news michael moorcock i hope it is good for we have enough bad to last us for ever it is mixed where can we converse in private my headquarters are in yonder mansion eiric pointed at a richly decorated house on the far side of the squaie inside eiric poured yellow wine for his guest kelos the merchant whose house this was had not accepted the requi sitioning altogether willingly and partly because of this eiric maliciously made free with all keloss best sepiriz took the goblet and sipped the strong wine have you succeeded in contacting the white lords yet sepiriz eiric asked we have thank the gods are they willing to give their aid to us they have always been so willingbut they have not yet made a sufficient breach in the protection that chaos has set up around the planet however me fact that i have at last managed to contact them is a better sign than any weve had these past months sothe news is good eiric said cheerfully not altogether jagreen lems fleet has set sail again and they bead towards the eastern continent with thousands of shipsand supernatural allies too it was only what i expected sepiriz my works done here anyway ni ride for me isle of the purple towns at once for i must lead the fleet against jagreen lern your chances of winning will be all but nonexistent el ric sepiriz wanied him gravely have you heard of the shysofheur ive heard of themdo they not sail the depths of the ea taking on board dead mariners as crews they dotheyre things of chaos and far larger man even the largest mortal warship youd never withstand teem even if you did not have the theocrafs fleet to fight as well tm aware me fight wfll be hard sepirizbut what else can we do i have a weapon against chaoa in my blade here not enough mat bodkinyou still have no protection against chaos that is what i have to tell you abouta per sonal armament for yourself to help you in your struggle though youll have to win it from its present possessor wbo possesses it stormbrnger a giant who broods in eternal misery in a great castle on me edge of the world beyond me sighing desert his name is mordaga who was once a god but is now made mortal for ins he committed against his fellow gods long ages ago mortal yet he has lived so long aye mordaga is mortalthough his lifespan is consider ably longer than an ordinary mans he is obsessed with the knowledge mat he must one day die this is what saddens him and the weapon not a weapon exactlybut a shield a shield with a pur poseone that mordaga had made for himself when he raised a rebellion in the domain of the gods and sought to make himself greatest of the gods and even wrest the eternal balance from the one who holds it for this he was ban ished to earth and informed that he would one day die slain by a mortal blade the shield as you might guess i proof against the workings of chaos how does it do this eiric asked curiously the chaotic forces if powerful enough can disrupt any defence made of lawful matter no construction based on the principles of order can withstand for long the ravages of beer chaos as we know stormbnngcr has shown you mat the only weapon effec tiv against chaos is something of chaosmanufacture the same can be said for the chaos shield this itself is chaotic in nature and therefore there is nothing organised in it on which me random forces can act and destroy it meets chaos with chaos and so the hostile powers are subverted i see if i had only had such a shield of late things might have gone better for us all i could not tell you of it as i have mentioned i am merely the servant of fate and cannot act unless it is sanc tioned by my masters perhaps as i have guessed they are willing to see chaos sweep the world before it is defeatedif it is ever defeatedso that it can completely change the nature of our planet before the new cycle begins change it willbut whether it will be ruled in the future primarily by law or chaosthat is in your bands eirici im becoming used to me burden my friend how would i recognise this shield by the eightarrowed sign of chaos which radiates from michael moorcock its boss it is a heavy round shield made as a buckler for a giant but with the vitality you receive from that runesword there you will have the strength to carry it have no fear but first you must have the courage to win it from its current holder mordaga is aware of the prophecy told him by his fellow gods before they cast him forth are you too aware of it i am in our language it forms a simple rhyme mordagas pride mordagas doom mordagas fate shall be to die as men when slain by men four men of destiny four men who are the other three those you will know of when the time comes for you to seek the chaos shield which will you do go to the purple townsor will you go to find the shield i wish that i had the time to embark on a quest of that kind but i have not must go to rally my men shield or no you wiu be defeated we shall see sepuiz very well eiric since so little of your destiny is in your own bands we should allow you to take just one decision at times sepiriz smiled sympathetically fate is kind eiric commented ironically he rose from his seal begin the journey straightway for theres no time to lose two with his milkwhite hair streaming behind him and his red eyes blazing with purpose eiric lashed his stallion through the cold darkness of the night through a disturbed land which awaited jagreen lems attack in trepidation for it could mean not only their deaths but the drawing of their souls into the servitude of chaos already the standards of a dozen western and southern monarchs fluttered with jagreea lems as the kings of the conquered lands chose his command rather than deathand placed their peoples under bis dominance so that they became marching blankfaced creatures with enslaved souls their wives and children dead tormented or feeding the blood washed altars of pan tang where the priests send up invoca tions to the chaos lords and everwilling to further their power on earth the lords answered with support and not only the entities themselves but the stuff of their own weird cosmos was entering the earth so that where their power was me land heaved like the sea or the sea flowed like lava mountains changed shape and trees sprouted ghastly blossoms never seen od earth before wherever jagreen lern conquered the warping influence of chaos was manifest the very spirits of nature were tor tured into becoming what they should not beair fire water and earth all became unstable for jagreen lem and bis al lies were tampering not only with the lives and souls of men but the very constituents of the planet itself and there were none of sufficient power to punish them for these crimes none with this knowledge within him eirics progress was swift and wild as he strove to reach the isle of the purple towns before his pitifully inadequate fleet sailed to do battle with chaos michael moorcock two days later he arrived in the port of uhaio at the tip of the smallest of the three vilmirian peninsulas and took ship at once to the isle of the purple towns where he disem barked and rode into the interior towards the ancient fortress mahakilagreu which had withstood every siege ever made against it and was regarded as die most impregnable con struction in the whole of the lands still free from chaos its name was in an older language than any known to those who lived in me current age of the young kingdoms only eiric knew what the name signified the fortress had been there long before me present races came to dominance even before elites ancestors had begun their conquerings mahaku agrame fort of evening where long ago a lonely race had come to die as he arrived in the courtyard moonglum the easflander came rushing from the entrance of a tower eirict we have been awaiting your arrival for time grows acarce before we must embark against the enemy we nave bent out shipborne spies to estimate me size and power of jagreen lems fleet only four returned and all were uselessly insane the fifth has just come back but butwhatr see for yourself he has beenaltered eiric alteredl alteredl let me see him take me to him eiric nodded curdy to the other captains who had come out to greet him he passed them and followed behind moonglum through the stone corridors of the fortress lit badly by splut tering rushes leading eiric to an antechamber moonglum stopped out side running his fingers through his thick red hair he is therein would you care to interview him alone fd rather not set eyes on him again very wen eiric opened the door wondering how this spy would be changed sitting at me plain wooden table was me remains of a man it looked up as moonglum had warned himit had been altered eiric felt pity for the man but he was not nauseated or horrified like moonghim for in his sorceryworking he had seen far worse creatures it was as if the whole of one side of me spy s body had become at one stage viscous had flowed and men coiled in a random shape side of head shoulder arm torso leg all were replaced by streamers of flesh like stormbrjnger rats tails lumps of matter like swollen boils weirdly mottled the spy spread his good band and some of the streamer eemed to jerk and wave in unison eiric spoke quietly what magic wrought mis drastic changer a kind of chuckle came from the lopsided face i entered the realm of chaos lord and chaos did this tt changed me as you see the boundaries are being extended i did not know it i was inside before i realised what had hap pened the area of chaos is being widened he leant for ward his shaking voice almost screaming with it sail the massed fleets of jagreen lemgreat waves of warships aquadrons of invasion craft thousands of transports shun mounting great war engines fireshipsships of all kinds bearing a multitude of standardsme kings of the south left live have sworn loyally to jagreen lem and he has used all their resources and his own to marshal this seahorde as he ails he extends the area of chaos so whereas his sailing is dower than normal when he reaches us herechaos win be with him i saw such ships mat could be of no earthly con trivingthe size of castleseach one seeming to be a daz ding combination of all coloursi so be has managed to bring more supernatural allies to his standard eiric roused those are the ships of hdl scpiriz mentioned ayeand even if we beat the natural craft the messen ger said hysterically we could not beat born the ships of chaos and me stuff of chaos which boils around mem and did to me what you observe it boils it warps it changes con stantly that is q i know save that jagreen lem and hn hu man allies are unharmed by it as i was harmed when mis change began to take place in my body i fled to me dragon uto of melnibone which seems to have withstood me process and is the only safe land in an the waters of the worid my bodyhealedswiftly and i chanced another sailing to bring me here you were courageous eiric said houowly you wfll be wen rewarded i promise i want only one reward my lord what is that death i can no longer live with the horror of my body bdrroring the horror in my brains i will see to it eiric promised he remained brooding michael moorcock for a few seconds before nodding farewell to the spy and leaving the room moooglum met him outside it looks blade for us eiric he said softly eiric sighed ayeperhaps i should have gone to seek the chaos shield first whats thatr eiric explained all sepiriz had told him we could do with such a defence moonglum agreed but there it isthe priority is tomorrow s sailing your cap tains await you in the conference chamber i will see them in a short while eiric promised first i wish to go to my own room to collect my thoughts tell them hi oin them when thats done when he reached his room eiric locked the door behind him still thinking of the spys information he knew that without supernatural aid no ordinary fleet no matter bow large or how courageously manned could possibly withstand jagreen lem and the fact was that he had only a compara tively small beet no supernatural entities for allies no means of combatting the disrupting chaotic forces if only he had the chaos shield beside him now but it was useless to re gret a decision of the kind hed made if he sought the shield now he couldnt fight the battle in any case for weeks he had consulted the gnmoires that in the form of scrolls tablets books and sheets of precious metals en graved with ancient symbols littered his room the elemen tals bad helped him in the past but so disrupted were they by chaos that they were weak for the most part he unstrapped his hellsword and filing it on me bed of tumbled silks and furs wryly he thought back to earlier times when be had given in to despair and how those in cidents which bad engendered the mood seemed merely gay escapades in comparison to the task which now weighed on his mind though weary he chose not to draw stormbringer a stolen energy into himself for the feeling that was so dose to ecstacy was leavened by the guiltthe guilt which had possessed him since a child when he had first realised that the expression on his remote fathers face had not been one of love but of disappointment that he should have spawned a deficient weaklinga pale albino good for nothing without the aid of drugs or sorcery stormbringer eiric sighed and went to the window to stare oat over the low hills and beyond them to the sea he spoke aloud per haps subconsciously hoping that the release of the words would relieve some of the tension within him i do not care for this responsibility he said when i fought the dead god be spoke of both gods and men as shadowthings playing puppetparts before the true history of earth began and men found their fate in their own hands then sepiriz teus me i must turn against chaos and help destroy the whole nature of die world i know or history might never begin again and fates great purpose would be thwarted therefore j am the one who must be split and tem pered to fulfill my destinyi must know no peace of mind must fight men and gods and the stuff of chaos without sur cease must bring about the death of this age so that m some far dawnage men who know little of sorcery or the lords of ihe higher worlds may move about a world where the major forces of chaos can no longer enter where justice may actu ally exist as a reality and not as a mere concept in the minds of philosophers he rubbed his red eyes with his fingers so fate makes eiric a martyr that law might rule the world it gives him a sword of ugly evil that destroys friends and enemies alike and sucks their soulstuff out to feed him the strength he needs it binds me to evil and to chaos in or der that i may destroy evil and chaosbut it does not make me some senseless dolt easily convinced and a willing sacri fice no it makes me eiric of memibone and floods me with a mighty misery my lord speaks aloud to himselfand his thoughts are gloomy speak them to me instead so that i might help you bear them eiric recognising the oft voice but astonished nonetheless el lie turned quickly towards the source and saw his wife zaro kinia standing there her arms outstretched and a look of deep sympathy upon her young face he took a step towards her before stopping and saying an froy when did you come here why i told you to remain m your fathers palace at kariaak until this business is done ifeverr h ever she repeated dropping her arms to her sides with a little shrug though scarcely more than a girl with her michael moorcock full red lips and long blade hair die bore herself aft ft princess must and seemed more than her age ask not that question he said cynically it is not one we ask ourselves here but answer mine how did you come here and why he knew what her reply would be but be spoke only to emphasise his anger which in turn was a result of his horror that she should have come so dose to danger danger which he had already rescued her from once i came with my cousin opluk s two thousand she said fitting her head defiantly when be joined the defenders of uhaio i came to be near my husband at a time when he may need my comforting the gods know ive had little oppor tunity to discover if be doesf eiric paced the room in agitation as i love you zaro zinia believe that i would be in kariaak now with you had i any excuse at all but i have notyou know my role my destiny my doom you bring sorrow with your presence not help if this business has a satisfactory end then well meet again m joynot in misery as we now must he crossed to her and took her in his arms oh zaro rinia we should never have met never have married we can only hurt one another at this time our happiness was so brief f you would be hurt by me then hurt you shall be she said softly but if you would be comforted then i am hero to comfort my lord he relented with a sigh these are loving words my dearbut they are not spoken in loving times i have put love aside for the nonce try to do likewise and thus well both dispense with added complication without anger she drew slowly away from him and with a slight smile that had something of irony in it pointed to the bed where stormbringer lay i see your other mistress stffl shares your bed she said and now you need never try to dismiss her again for that black lord of nihrain has given you an excuse to forever keep her by your side destinyis that the word destiny ah the deeds men have done in destinys name and what is destiny brie can you answer i he shook his bead since you ask the question in malice m not make the attempt to answer it she cried suddenly oh eirici i faave travelled for many stormbringer days to see you thinking you would welcome me and now we speak m anger fearf he said urgently it is fear not anger i fear for you as i fear for the fate of the world see me to my ship in the morning and then make speed back to kariaak i bee yon if you wish it she walked back into the small chamber which joined the main one three we talk only of defeatf roared kargan of the purple towns beating upon the table with his fist his beard seemed to bristle with rage dawn had found all but a few of ac captain retiring through weariness kargan moonglum etrics cousin dyvim slonn and moonfaced dralab of tarkesh remained in the chamber pondering tactics eiric answered him calmly we talk of defeat kargan because we must be prepared for that eventuality it seems likely does it not we must if defeat seems imminent flee our enemies conserving our force for another attack on jagreen lera we shall not have the forces to fight another major batue so we must use our better knowledge of cur rents winds and terrain to fight him from ambush on sea or land thus we can perhaps demoralise his warriors and take considerably more of them man they can of us ayei see the logic kargan rumbled unwillingly evi dently disturbed by this talk for if me major battle was lost then lost also would be the isle of the purple towns bastion against chaos for the minly nations of vumir and dnu ora moonglum shifted his position granting slightly and if they drive us back men back we must go beading rather than breaking and returning from other directions to attack and confuse them ifs in my mind that well have to move more rapidly than we q be able to since wed be tired and with few provisions he grinned faintly ah forgive me for my pessimism illplaced i fear no brie said we must face all this or be caught una wares you are right and to allow for ordered retreat i have already sent detachments to die sighing desert and the weeping waste to bury large quantities of food aod such stormbringer dungs as extra arrows lances and so forth if we are forced back as far as the barrens well likely fare better than fagreen lern assuming that it takes him time to extend the area of chaos and that his allies from the higher worlds are not overwhelmingly powerful you spoke of realism said dyvim slonn pursing his curving lips and raising a slanting eyebrow aybut some things cannot be faced or consideredfor if we are totally engulfed by chaos at me outset then well nave no need of plans so we plan for the other eventuality you see kargan let out his breath and rose from the table theres no more to discuss he said tu to bed we must be ready to sail with the noon tide tomorrow they all gave signs of assent and chairs scraped as they pushed them back and left the chamber bereft of human occupants the chamber was silent save for the sputtering of the lamps and the rustle of the maps and papers as they were stirred by a warm wind it was late in the morning when eiric arose and found zarozinia already up and dressed in a skirt and bodice of dothofgold with a long blacktrimmed cloak of silver flow ing from her shoulders and spreading to the floor he washed shaved and ate the dish of herbflavoured fruit she handed him why have you arrayed yourself in such finery he asked to bid you goodbye from the harbour she said tf you spoke truth last night then youd best be dressed in furneral red he smiled and then relenting clasped her to him he gripped her tightly desperately before standing back from her and taking her chin in his hand raised her face to tare down into it in ihese tragic times he said theres tittle room for loveplay and kind words love must be deep and strong manifesting itself in our actions seek no courtly words from me zarozinia but remember earlier nights when the only turbulence was our pulsebeats blending he was clad himself in melnibonean war regalia with a breastplate of shiny black metal a highcollared jerkin of black velvet black feather breeks covered to the knee by his boots also of black leather over his back was pushed a cloak of deep red and on one thin white finger was the ring of kings the single rare actorious stone set in silver michael moorcock his long white hair hung loose down to hia ihoulders kept from his eyes by a bronze circlet in which were set other pre cious charm stones of peryx mio and golden otredos stoimbringer was sheathed at his left hip and an ebony handled poignard dangled at his right upon the table among the open books a tapering black helm engraved with old runes lay its crown gradually rising into a spike iitandmg al mort two feet from the base at this base dominating the eyeslits was a tiny replica of a spreadwinged dragon with a gaping snout a reminder that as wen as being emperors of the bright empire eirics ancestors were dragon masters over all that remained of the dragon kind brie himaelf was chief masterthough now only his cousin dyvim siorm knew the dragon speech and spells the rest having perished in various ways since the sack of imrryr years before when eiric turned renegade had led the attack upon the dreaming city now he picked up the helm and fitted it over his head so that it covered the top half of his face only bis red eyes gleaming from its shadows he refrained from pulling the side wings about his lower face but for the meantime left uiem sweeping back from the bottom of the helmet noting her silence he said with a heart already heavy come my love lets to the harbour to astound these under civilised allies of ours with our elegance have no fear mat i shall live to survive this days battlefor pate has not fin ished with me yet and protects me as a mother would her sobso that i might witness further misery until such a day when ifs over for all time together they left the fort of evening riding on magical nihrain horses down to the harbour where me other sealords and captains were already assembled beneath me bright sun all were dressed in their finest martial glory though none could match eiric old racial memories were awakened in many when they saw him and they were troubled fearing him without knowing why for their ancestors had had great cause to fear the bright emperors in the days when melni bone ruled the worid and a man accoutred as eiric com manded a mffiion eldritch warriors now a bare handful of imrryiana greeted him as he rode along me quayside noting me ships riding at anchor with their coloured banners and heraldic devices lifting proudly in the breeze dyvim slonn was equipped in a closefitting dragon helm stormbringer its protecting pieces fashioned to represent the entire bead of a dragon scaled in red and green and silver his armour was lacquered yellow though the rest of his dress was black like elric s at his side was stonnbringers sistersword moum blade as eiric rode up to the group dyvim slonn turnedhia heavily armoured head towards the open sea there was little inkling of encroaching chaos on the calm water or in the dear sky at least well have good weather on our way to meet jagreen lern dyvim siorm said a small mercy eiric smiled faintly is there any more news of their numbers before the spy who returned yesterday died he said there were at least four thousand warships ten thousand transportsand perhaps twenty of the chaos ships theyll be me ones to watch since weve no idea what powers they have eiric nodded their own fleet comprised some five thou sand warships many equipped with catapults and other heavy warengines the transports though they turned me odds in numbers to a far superior figure would be slow unwieldy and of not much use in a pitched seabattle also if the battle were won they could be dealt with later for hey would obviously follow in the rear of jagreen lcrns war ned so for all jagreen lerns numerical strength there would be a good chance of winning a seafight under ordinary con ditions the disturbing factor was the presence of the super natural ships the spys description had been vague eiric aeeded more objective informationinformation he would be unlikely to receive now until the fleets joined in battle in his shirt was tucked me beasthide manuscript of an ex traordinarily strong invocation used in summoning the sea king he had already attempted to use h without success but hoped that on open sea his chances would be better par ticularly since me sea king would be angered at the disrup tion jagreen lern and his occult allies were causing in the balance of nature once before long ago the sea king had aided him and had eiric recalled predicted that eiric would ammonium again michael moorcock kargan in the thick but light seaarmonr of his people which gave him the appearance of ft hairyfaced armadillo pointed as several small boats detached tbemselve from ac fleet and sailed towards die quay here come the boats to take us to our ships my lordal the gathered captains stirred all of them with serious ex pressions seeming each and every one to be pondering some personal problem staring into the depths of their own heartsperhaps trying to reach me fear which lay there try ing to reach it and tear it out and fling it from them they all had more than the usual trepidation experienced when facing a fightfor like brie they could not guess what the chaos ships were capable of they were a desperate company understanding that some thing less palatable than death might await them beyond the horizon eric squeezed zarozinias arm goodbye tareweu briomay whatever benevolent gods acre are left on the earth protect you save your prayers for my companions he said quietly for they wffl be less able than i to face what lies out there moonghnn called to him and zarozmia give her a kiss eric and come to the boal tell her well be back with vic tory tidings eiric would never have admitted such familiarity not even with his kinsman dyvnn slonn from anyone but moonglum but he took it in good part saying softly to her there you see little moonglum is confidentand he s usually we one with warnings of ominous portent she said nothing but kissed him lightly on roe mouth grasped his hand for a moment and then watched him as he strode down the quay and clambered into the boat which moonglum and rargan were steadying for him the oars splashed and bore the captains towards me flag ship timbertearer eiric standing in the bow staring ahead looking back only once when the boat drew alongside the ship and he began to climb the rope ladder up to the deck his black helm bobbing bracing himself on the deck brie watched me backs of the warriorrowers as they bent to the oars supplementing stormb ringer the light wind which filled the great purple sail making it curve out in a graceful billow the isle of the purple towns was now out of sight and green glinting water was all that was visible around the fleet which stretched behind the flagship its furthest ships tiny shapes in the distance already the fleet was reforming into the five squadrons which would comprise its final battleorder each squadron was under the command of an experienced sealord from the purple towns for most of the other captains were landsmen who though quick to learn had little experience of sea tac tics moonglum came stumbling along the swaying deck to stand beside his friend how did you sleep last night he asked eiric weu enough save for a few nightmares ah then you shared something with us all sleep was hard won for everyone and when it came it was troubled visions of monsters and demons crowded my dreams eiric nodded slightly but paying little attention to moon glum the elements of chaos in their own beings were evi dently awakening in response to the approach of the chaos horde itself he hoped they would be strong enough to with stand the actuality as they had survived their dreams disturbance to forardf it was the lookouts cry baffled and perturbed eiric cupped his hands around his mouth and tilted his head back what sort of disturbance its like nothing ive ever seen my lordi cant describe it eiric turned to moonglum relay the order through the fleetslow the pace to one drumbeat in four squadron com manders stand by to receive final battle orders he strode towards the mast and began to climb up it towards the look outs post he climbed until he was high above the deck the tookout swung out of his cradle since there was room only for one ts it the enemy my lord he said as eiric clambered into his place eiric stared hard towards the horizon making out a kind of dazzling blackness that from time to time sent up sprawling gouts of stuff into the air where it hung for some moments before sinking back into the main mass michael moorcock smokey hard to define it crept gradually nearer crawling over the sea towards them itg the enemy said eiric quietly he remained for some while m the lookouts cradle study ing the chaosstuff as it filing itself about in the distance like some amorphous monster in its deathagonies but these were not deathagoniesnot for chaos at any rate from this vantage point eiric also had a dear view of the fleet as it formed itself into its respective squadrons making up a black wedge nearly a mile across at its longest point and nearly two moes deep his own ship was a short distance in front of the rest well in sight of the squadron commanders brie shouted down to kargan whom he saw passing the mast stand by to move ahead kargan the sealord nodded without pausing in his stride he was folly aware of the battleplan as they all were for they had discussed it long enough the leading squadron under the command of eiric was comprised of their heaviest warships which would smash into the centre of the enemy fleet and seek to break its order aiming particularly at the ship of jagreen lero if jagreen lem could be slain or captured their victory would be more likely now the dark stuff was closer and eiric could just make out me sails of the first vessels spread out one behind the other then as they came even closer he was aware mat to each side of this leading formation were great glinting shapes that dwarfed even the huge battlecraft of jagreen lern the chaos ships eiric recognised them now from his own knowledge of occult lore these were the ships said normally to saq the deeps of the oceans taking on drowned sailors as crews captained by creatures that had never been human it was a fleet from the deepest gloomiest parts of the vast underwater domain which had since the beginninp of time been disputed territorydis puted between waterelementals under their king straasha and the lords of chaos who claimed the seadepths as their main territory on earth by right legends said that at one time chaos had ruled the sea and law the land this perhaps ex plained the fear of the sea that many human beings had and me pull the sea had for others but the fact was that although the elementals had stormbringer succeeded in winning the shallower portions of the sea the chaos lords had retained the deeper parts by means of this their fleet of the dead the ships themselves were not of earthly manufacture neither were their captains originally from earth but their crews had once been human and were now indestructible in any ordinary sense as they approached eiric was soon in no doubt that they were indeed those ships the sign of chaos flashed on their sails eight amber ar rows radiating from a central hubsignifying the boast of chaos that it contained all possibilities whereas law was supposed in time to destroy possibility and result in eternal stagnation the sign of law was a single arrow pointing up wards symbolising direction and control eiric knew that in reality chaos was the real harbinger of stagnation for though it changed constantly it never progressed but in his heart he felt a yearning for this state for he had many loyalties to the lords of chaos in the past and his own folk of meloibone had worked since their incep tion to further the aims of chaos but now chaos must make war on chaos eiric must turn against those he had once been loyal to using weapons forged by chaotic forces to defeat those selfsame forces in this time of change he clambered from the cradle and began to ship down the mast leaping the last few feet to land on the deck as dyvim siorm came up quickly be told his kinsman what he had seen dyvim slorm was astounded but the fleet of the dead never comes to the surfacesave for his eyes widened eiric shrugged thats the legendthe fleet of the dead will rise from the depths when the final struggle comes when chaos shall be divided against itself when law shall be weak and mankind shall choose sides in the battle that will result in a new earth dominated either by total chaos or by al mosttotal law when sepiriz told us this was the case i felt a response since then in studying my manuscripts i have been fully reminded is this then the final battler it might be he said it is certain to be one of the last when it will be decided for all time whether law or chaos shall rule here michael moorcock if were defeated then chaos will undoubtedly rule perhapsbut remember that the struggle need not be de cided by battles alone so sepiriz said but if were defeated this day well have little chance to discover the truth of that dyvim slorm gripped mouroblades hilt someone must wield these bladesthese destiny swordswhen the time conies for the deciding duel our allies dimmish elite aye but i ve a hope that we can summon a few others straasha king of the water elementals has ever fought against the death fleetand he is brother to graoll and misha the wind lords perhaps through straasha i can summon his unearthly kin in this way we will be better matched at least i know only a fragment of the spell for summoning the water king dyvim slorm said i know the whole rune i had best make haste to meditate upon it for our fleets will clash in two hours or less and then ni have no time for the summoning of spirits but will have to keep tight hold on my own less some chaos creature re leases it eiric moved towards the prow of the ship and leaning over stared into the ocean depths turning his mind inward and contemplating the strange and ancient knowledge which lay there he became almost hypnotised as he lost contact with his own personality and began to identify with the swiri ing ocean below involuntarily old words began to form in his throat and his ups began to move in the rune which his ancestors had known when they and all the elementals of the earth bad been allies and sworn to aid one another long ago in the dawn of the bright empire more than ten thousand years be fore waters of the sea thou gave us birth and were our milk and mother both in days when skies were overcast you who were first shall be the last searulers fathers of our blood thine aid is sought thine aid is sought stormbringer your salt is blood our blood your sail your blood the blood of man straasha eternal king eternal sea thine aid is sought by me for enemies of thine and mine seek to defeat our destiny and drain away our sea the spoken rune was merely a vocalisation of the actual invocation which was produced mentally and went plunging into the depths through the dark green corridors of the sea until it finally found straasha in his domain of curving coralcoloured womblike constructions which were only par tially in the natural sea and partially in the plane where the demeatals spent a large part of their immortal existence straasha knew of the ships of hell rising to the surface nd had been pleased that his domain was now cleared of them but elites summons awakened his memory and he remembered the folk of mehuboo upon whom all the ele mentals had once looked with a sense of comradeship he remembered the ancient invocation and felt bound to answer ft though he knew his people were badly weakened by the ef fect chaos had had in other parts of the world not only hu mans had suffered the elemental spirits of nature had been orely pressed as well but he stirred so that water and the stuff of his other plane were both disturbed he summoned some of his followers and began to glide upwards into the domain of the air semiconscious now eiric knew that his invocation had bet with success sprawled in the prow he waited at last the waters heaved and broke and a great green fig ure with turquoise beard and hair pale green skin that eemed made of the sea itself and a voice that was like a rushing tide once more straasha answers thy summons mortal our destinies are bound together how may i aid thee and in ffding thee aid myself in the throattorturing speech of the elemental eiric an twered telling the sea king of the forthcoming battle and what it implied so at long last it has come to pass i fear i cannot aid you wwch for my folk are already suffering terribly from the de michael moorcock preaations of our mutual enemy we shall attempt to did you if we can thafs all i promise the sea king sank back into the waters and eiric watched him depart with a feeling of acute disappointment it was with a brooding mind that he left the prow and went to the main cabin to tell his captains the news they received it with mixed feelings for only dyvim slonn was used to dealing with superoaturals moonglum had always been dubious of eirics powers to control his wild ele mental friends while kargan growled that straasha may have been an ally of eirics folk but had been more of an enemy to his the four of them however could plan with slightly more optimism and face the coming ordeal with better confi dence four the fleet of jagreen lera bore towards them and in its wake the boiling stuff of chaos hovered eiric gave the command and die rowers hauled at their curs sending timbertearer rushing towards the enemy so far his elemental allies had not appeared but he could not af ford to wait for them as timbertearer rode the foaming waves eiric hauled bi sword from its scabbard brought the side wings of his helmet round to cover his face and cried the ageold ululating war shout of melnibone a shout full of joyous evil stormbringera eerie voice joined with his giving vent to a thrumming song anticipating the blood and the souls it would soon feast upon jagreen lem s flagship now lay behind three rows of men owar and behind that the ships of death timbertearers iron ram ripped into the first enemy ship and the rowers leaned on their oars backing away and turn ing to pierce another ship below the water line showers of arrows sprayed from the holed ship and clattered on deck and armour several rowers went down eiric and his three companions directed their men from the main deck and suddenly they saw the streaking balls of green fire come curving out of the sky prepare to quench fireal kargan yelled and the group of men already primed for this leapt for the tubs containing a special brewwhich eiric bad told them how to make earlier this was spread on decks and splashed on canvas and when the fireballs landed they were swiftly put out by the stuff dont engage unless forced to eiric called to the eamen keep aiming for the flagship if we take that our ad vantage will be goodf where are your allies eiric kargan asked sardonically shuddering a little as he saw the chaoa stuff in the distance michael moorcock suddenly move and erupt tendrils of black matter into the sky theyll come never fear eiric answered but he was un sure now they were in the thick of the enemy fleet the ships of their squadron followed behind the warengines of their own fleet sent up a constant barrage of fire and heavy stones only a handful of bines craft broke through the enemys first rank and reached the open sea sailing towards jagreen lem s flagship as they were observed the enemy ships sailed to protect the flagship and the scintillating ships of death moving with fantastic speed for their size surrounded the theocrata vessel shouting over the waters kargan ordered their diminished squadron into a new formation moonglum shook his head in astonishment how can things of that size support themselves on the water he said to eiric eiric said its unlikely that they actually do as then ship manoeuvred into its new position he stared at die huge craft twenty of them dwarfing everything else on the sea they seemed covered with a kind of scintillating wetness which flashed all the colours of the spectrum so that their outlines were hard to see and the shadowy figures moving about on their gigantic decks could not easily be observed whisps of dark stuff began to drift across the scene close to the water and dyvim slonn from the lower deck pointed and shouted see chaos comes where is straasha and his folk eiric shook his head perturbed he had expected aid by now we cannot wait we must attackl kargans voice was pitched higher than usual a mood of bitter recklessness came upon eiric then he smiled come then lets do sol speedily the squadron coursed towards tike disturbing ships of death moonglum muttered we are going to our doom eiric no man would willingly get close to those ships only the dead are drawn to them and they do not go with joyf but eiric ignored bis friend a strange silence seemed to come upon the waters so that stormbrinoer the sound of the splashing oars was sharp the death fleet waited for them impassively as if they did not need to prepare for battle he tightened his grip on stormbringer the blade seemed to respond to the pounding of his pulsebeat moving in his hand with each thud of his heart as if linked to it by veins and arteries now they were so close to me chaos ships that they could make out better the figures crowding the great decks horri bly eiric thought he recognised some of the gaunt faces of toe dead and involuntarily he called to the seafolks king stnashat the waters heaved foamed and seemed to be attempting to rise but then subsided again straasha beardbut he was finding it difficult to fight against the forces of chaos straashar it was no good the waters hardly moved a mood of wild despair came over eiric he screamed to kargan we cannot wait for aid swing the ship round the chaos fleet and well attempt to reach jagreen leros flagship from the rearf under kargan s expert direction the ship swung to avoid hie ships of hell in a wide semicircle spray cascaded against eirics face flooding the decks he could hardly see through it as they cleared the chaos ships which had now en gaged other craft and were altering the nature of their tim bers so that they fell apart and the unfortunate crews were drowned or warped into alien shapes to his ears came the miserable cries of the defeated and the triumphantly surging thunder of the chaos fleets music as it pushed forward to destroy the eastern ships timbertearer was rocking badly and was hard to control but at last they were around the hell fleet and bearing down oa jagreen urns vessel from the rear eiric having but recently been a prisoner upon it recog msed it at once now they nearly struck the theocrats vessel with their ram but were swept offcourse and had to ma noeuvre again arrows rose from the enemys decks and thudded and rattled on their own they retaliated as riding a huge wave they slid alongside the flagship and flung out grappling irons a few held dragging them towards the theo ents vessel as the men of pan tang strove to cut the grap michael moorcock pling ropes more ropes followed and then a boarding platform fell from its harness and landed squarely on jagreen lenas deck another followed it eiric ran for he nearest platform kargan behind him and they led a body of warriors over it searching for jagreen lera stormbrmger took a dozen lives and a dozen souls before eiric had gained the maindeck there a respleodant com mander stood surrounded by a group of officers but it was not jagreen lern eiric clambered up die gangway slicing through a war riors waist as the man sought to block his path he yelled at the group wheres your cursed leader wheres jagreen lernp the commanders face was pale for he had seen in the past what eiric and his hellblade could do hes not here eiric i swear what am i to be thwarted again i know you are lyingi eiric advanced on the group who backed away their swords ready our theocrat does not need to protect himself by means of lies doomfostered one sneered a young officer braver man the rest perhaps not cried eiric with a wdd laugh as he rushed towards him swinging stormbrmger in a shrieking arc but at least til have your life before i put the truth of your words to die test my sword and i need revitalisingand your soul should make an appetiser before i take jagreen lernsl the man put up his blade to block stormbringers swing the runesword cut through the metal with a triumphant cry swung back again and plunged itself into the officers side he gasped but remained standing with his hands clenched nol he groaned oh not my soull no his eyes widened tears streamed from them and madness came into them for a second before stormbrmger satiated itself and ei ric drew it out replenished he had no sympathy for the man your soul would have gone to the depths of hell in any case be said lightly but now ive put it to some use at least two other officers scrambled over the rail seeking to es cape their comrades fate ctormbringer eiric hacked at the hand of one so that he fen screaming to the deck his hand still grasping me rail the other he skewered in the bowels and as stormbrmger sucked out bis oul he hung there pleading incoherently in an effort to avert the inevitable so much vitality flowed into eiric now that as he rushed at the remaining group around the commander be seemed al most to fly over the deck and rip into them slicing away umbs as if they were stalks of sowers until he encountered the commander himself the commander said softly weakly i surrender do not takemysoul where is jagreen lera the commander pointed into the distance where the chaos fleet could be seen creating havoc amongst the eastern ships a therei he sails with lord pyaray of chaos whose fleet that is you cannot reach him there for any man not protected or not already deadwould turn to flowing liquid flesh once he neared the fleet that cursed hellspawn still cheats me eiric spat heres payment for your information c without mercy for one of those who had wasted and ea t slaved two continents eiric struck his blade through the or nate armour and delicately with all me old malevolence of bis sorcerer ancestors tickled the mans heart before finishing him he looked around for kargan but could not see him then he saw that the chaos fleet had turned backl at first he thought it was because straasha had at last brought aid but then he saw that the remnants of his fleet were fleeing jagreen lera was victorious their plans their formations their couragenone of these had been capable of withstand ing the horrible warpings of chaos and now the dreadful fleet was bearing down on me two flagships locked together by their grapples there was no chance of cutting one of them free before the fleet arrived eiric yelled to dyvhn slorm and moonglum whom he saw naming towards him from the other end of the deck over we side over the side for your livesand swim as far as you can away from here the chaos fleet comesi they looked at him startled teen realised me truth of his words other men of both sides were already leaping into the michael moorcock moody water eiric aheatbed his sword and dived the left was cold for allthe warm blood in it and he gasped as he swam in the direction of moonglum s red head which he could see ahead and dose to it dyvim slorms honey coloured hair he turned once and saw the very timbers of the two ships begin to melt to twist and curl in strange patterns as the ships of hell arrived he felt very relieved he had not been aboard he reached his two friends a shortterm measure this said moonglum spitting water from his mouth what now eiric shall we strike for the purple towns moonglums capacity for facetiousness had not it seemed been limited by witnessing the defeat of their fleet and the advance of chaos the isle was too far away then to their left they saw the water froth and form itself into what was to eiric a familiar shape straashal i could not aid thee i could not aid thee though i tried my ancient enemy was too strong for me forgive me in re compense let me take you and your friends back with me to my own land and save you at least from chaos but we cannot breathe beneath the seal you wis not need to verywell trusting to the elementals words they allowed themselves to be dragged beneath the waters and down into the cool green depths of the sea deeper and deeper until no sunlight filtered mere and all was wet darkness and they lived though at normal times the pressure would have crushed them they seemed to travel for miles through the mysterious un derwater grottoes until at last they came to a place of coral coloured rounded constructions that seemed to drift slowly in a sluggish current brie knew it by a description in one of his grimoires the domain of straasha die sea king the elemental bore them to the largest construction and one section of it seemed to fade away to admit teem they moved now through twisting corridors of a delicate pink tex ture slightly shadowed no longer in water they were now on the plane of the elemental folk in a huge circular cave they came to rest stormbringer with a peculiar rushing sound the sea king walked to a large throne of milky jade and sat upon it his green head on his green fist eiric once again i regret i was unable after all to aid you all i can do now is have some of my folk carry you back to your own land when you have rested here for a while we are all it seems helpless against this new strength which chaos has of late eiric nodded nothing can stand against its warping influ enceunless it is the chaos shield straasha straightened his back the chaos shield ah yes it belongs to an exiled god does it not but his castle is virtu ally impregnable why is that it lies upon the topmost crag of a tall and lonely moun tain reached by one hundred and thirtynine steps lining these steps are fortynine ancient elder trees and of these you would have to be specially wary also he has a guard of one hundred and fortyfour warriors of the warriors i would certainly be wary but why the elders each elder contains the soul of one of mordagas follow ers who was punished thus they are malevolent treesever ready to take the life of anyone that comes into their domain a hard task to get that shield for myself eiric mused but get it i must for without it fates purpose would be for ever thwartedand with it i might have vengeance on the one who commands the chaos fleetand jagreen lern who sails with him slay pyaray lord of the fleet of hell and lacking his direction the fleet itself would perish his lifeforce is con tained in a blue crystal set in the top of his head and striking at that with a special weapon is the only means of killing him thanks for that information eiric said gratefully for when the time comes i shall need it what do you plan to do eiric dyvim slonn asked put all else aside for the moment and see the sad giants shield i mustfor if i do not have it every battle fought will be a repetition of the one we have just lost i will come with you eiric moonglum promised i also said dyvim storm michael moorcock we shall require a fourth if we are to carry out the prophecy eiric said i wonder what became of kargan moonglum looked at the round did you not notice notice wfaat on board jagreen lcrns flagship when you were hewing about you in an effort to reach the main deck did you not know then what you had doneor rather what your cursed word did eiric felt suddenly exhausted no did did it b him aye gods he wheeled and paced the chamber slapping his fist in his palm still this hellmade blade exacts its tribute for the service it gives me still it drinks the souls of friends tis a wonder you two arc still with me i agree its extraordinary moonglum said feelingly i grieve for kargan he was a good friend eiric moonglum said urgently you know that kar gans death was not your responsibility it was fated aye but why must i always be the executioner of fate i hesitate to list the names of the good friends and useful allies whose souls my sword has stolen i hate it enough that it must suck souls out to give me my vitalitybut that it should be most partial to my friends that is what i cannot bear ive half a mind to venture into the heart of chaos and mere sacrifice us both i the guilt is indirectly mine for if i was not so weak i must bear such a blade many of those who have befriended me might be alive now yet the blades major purpose seems a noble one moon glum said in a baffled voife oh i fail to understand an thisparadox paradox upon paradox are the gods mad or are they so subtle we cannot fathom the workings of their minds its hard enough at times like these to remember any greater purpose dyvim slorm agreed we are pressed so sorely that we havent a moment for thought but must fight the next battle and the next forgetting often why it is we fight is the purpose indeed greater and not lesser eiric smiled bitterly if we are the toys of the godsare not per haps the gods themselves mere children these questions are of no present importance said straasha from his throne stormbringer and at least moonglum told eiric future generations wfll thank stormbringer if so fulfills her destiny if sepiriz is right eiric said future generations wifl know nothing of any of usblades or men perhaps not consciouslybut in the depths of their souls they will remember us our deeds will be spoken of as belong ing to heroes with other names that is all that the worid forgets me is all i ask eiric sighed as if growing impatient with this fruitless discussion the sea king rose from his throne and said come will make certain that you are transported to land if you have no ob jection to travelling back in the same manner as you came berer none said eiric five they staggered wearily on to the beach of the isle of the purple towns and eiric turned back to address the sea king who remained in the shallows again i thank you for saving us lord of the sea he said respectfully and thanks also for telling me more of the sad giants shield by this action you have perhaps given us the opportunity to make certain that chaos will be swept away from the oceanand the land also aahh the sea king nodded yet even if you are successful and the seats unspoiled it wul mean the passing of us both wul it not true then let it be so for i at least am weary of my long exis tence but comenow i must return to my folk and hope to withstand chaos for a little longer farewell and the sea king sank into the waves again and vanished when they eventually reached the fortress of bvening heralds ran out to assist them how went the battle where is the fleet one asked moonglum have the survivors not yet returned survivors then we were defeated eiric said hollowly is my wife stffl here no she left soon after the fleet sailed riding for kar laak good at least we shall have time to erect new defences against chaos before they reach that far now we must have food and wine we must devise a fresh plan of battle battle my lord with what shall we fight we shall see eiric said we shall see later they watched as the battered remnants of the fleet stormbringer began to sail into the harbour moonglum counted despair ingly too few he said this is a black day from behind them in the courtyard a trumpet sounded an arrival from the mainland dyvim storm said they strode together down to the courtyard in time to see a scarletclad archer dismounting from his horse his near fleshless face might have been carved from bone he stooped with weariness eiric was surprised rackhirl you command the dmioran coast why are you here we were driven back the theocrat launched not one fleet but two the other came in from the pale sea and took us by surprise our defences were crushed chaos swept in and we were forced to see the enemy has established itself less than a hundred miles from bakshaan and marches across countryif march is the word rather it ftows presumably it expects to meet up with the army the theocrat intends to land here aaahh we are surely defeated moongluffl s voice was little more than a sigh we must have that shield eiric dyvim slorm said eiric frowned his heart sinking any further steps we take against chaos will be doomed unless we have its protec tion you rackhir will be the fourth man in the prophecy what prophecy ill explain later are you fit enough to ride back with us now give me two hours to sleep and then i wffl be good two hours make your preparations my friends for we go to claim the sad giants shield i it was not until three days later that they met the first sur vivors many of them with bodies twisted by chaos strag gling along a white road that lead towards jadmar a city still free of them they learned that half dmiora parts of vflmir and the tiny independent kingdom of org had all fallen chaos was closing in its shadow spreading more and more swiftly as its conquests increased it was with relief that eiric and bis companions finally reached kariaak to find it so far not under attack but re ports placed the armies of chaos less than two hundred miles away and marching in that direction michael moorcock zarozinia greeted eiric with trou bletingcd joy there were rumours you were deadkilled to the sea battle eiric clasped her to him i cannot stay long be said i have a mission beyond the sighing desert know you know how scpiriz was here he left a gift m our stables for yon four nflirain horses a useful gift they wai carry us far more swiftly than any other beasts but wffl that be swift enough i hesitate to leave you here with chaos encroaching at such a rate you must leave me eiric if all seems lost here we shall flee into the weeping waste even fagreen lern can have scant interest in the barrens promise me that you will i promise feeling a little more relieved eiric took her by the hand i spent the most restful period of my life in this palace he said let me spend this last night with you and perhaps we shall find a little of the old peace we once badbefore i ride on to the sad giants lair so they made love but when they slept their dreams were so full of dark portent that each wakened the other with their groans so that they lay side by side clinging to one another until the dawn when eiric rose kissed her lightly clasped her hand and then went to the stables where he found bis friends waitingaround a fourth figure it was sepiriz sepiriz wanks for your gift they will probably make the difference between our being too late or not eiric said sin cerely but why are you here now because i can perform another small service before your main journey begins said the black seer ah of you save moonglum have weapons endowed with some special power eiric and dyvim slonn have their runeblades rackhir the arrows of law which the sorcerer lamsar gave him at he time of the siege of tanelornbut moongtum s weapon has nothing save the skill of its bearer i think i prefer it thus retorted moonglum ive seen what a charmed blade can take from a man i can give you nothing so strongnor so evilaa stormbringer sepiriz said but i have a charm for your stormbrinqer aword a slight one that my contact with me white lords has enabled me to use give me your sword moonglum i a trifle unwillingly moonglum unsheathed his curved steel made and banded it to the nihrain who took a small engrav fag tool from his robe and whispering a rune scratched several symbols on the sword near its hilt then he gave it back to the eastlaoder there now the sword has the blessing of law and you wul find it more able to withstand laws enemies eiric said impatiently we must ride now sepiriz for tfane grows desperately short ride men but be wary for patrolling bands of jagreen lems warriors i do not think they will be anywhere along your route when you journey therebut watch for them coming back they mounted die magical nihrain steeds which bad jt helped eiric more man once and rode away from karlaak by the weeping waste rode away perhaps for ever in a short while they had entered me weeping waste for flus was the quickest route to the sighing desert f rackhir alone knew this country well and he guided them the nihrain steeds treading the ground of their own ltrange plane seemed literally to fly for it could be observed hhat their hooves did not touch the damp grasses of the t weeping waste they moved at incredible speed and rack llliir until he became used to the pace gripped his reins tightly f in this place of eternal rainfall the land ahead was difficult to see and the drizzle spread down their faces and into their eyes as they peered through it trying to make out the high mountain range which ran along the edge of the weeping waste separating it from the sighing desert then at last after a journey of a day they could observe ly the high crags with their tops lost in cloud and soon thanks to me marvellous speed of the nihrain stallions they were riding through the deep gorges and the rain ceased until on ihe evening of the second day the breeze became warm and finally harsh and hot as they left the mountains and felt the femoua rays of the sun blazing down on them knowing they had come to the edge of the sighing desert this wind coughed constantly over the barren sand and rocks its contin uous sighing giving the desert its name they protected their faces particularly their eyes with michael moorcock their hoods as best they could for the stinging sand was ever present resting only for a few hours at a time rackhir directing them they allowed the horses to cany them at ten times the speed of ordinary steeds further and further into the depths of the vast desert they spoke little for it was difficult to be heard over the sighing wind and each man became sunk into himself dwell ing on personal thoughts brie had long since fallen into what was virtually a mindless trance letting the horse carry him over the desert he had fought against his own churning thoughts and emo tions finding it hard as he often did to retain any objective impression of his predicament his past had been too trou bled his background too morbid for him to do much now to see clearly always he had been a slave to his melancholic emotions his physical failings and to the very blood flowing in his veins he saw life not as a consistent pattern but as a series of random events he had fought all his life to assemble his thoughts and if necessary accept the chaotic nature of mings learn to live with if but except in moments of ex treme personal crisis had rarely managed to think coherently for any length of time he was perhaps because of his out lawed life his albinoism his very reliance on his runesword for strength obsessed with the knowledge of his own doom what was thought he asked himself what was emotion what was control and was it worth achieving better maybe to live by instinct than to theorise and be wrong better to re main the puppet of the gods letting them move you this way and that at their pleasure than to seek control of your own fate dash with the will of the lords of the higher worlds and perish for your pains so he considered as he rode into the searing lash of the wind already striving against natural hazard and what was the difference between an earthly hazard and me hazard of uncontrolled thought and emotion both held something of the same qualities but his race though they had ruled me world for ten thou sand years had lived under the dominance of a different star they had been neither true men nor true members of the an cient races who had come before men they were an interme stormbringer diary type and eiric was halfoonsciously aware of this aware that be was the last of an inbred line who had without effort uaed chiosgiven sorcery as others used their earthly dollsfor convenience his race had been of chaos having no need of elfcontrol or the aelfrestrictions of the new laces who had emerged with the age of me young king doms and even these acrording to the seer sepiriz were not the true men who would one day walk an earth where order and progress might become the rule and chaos rarely exert influenceif brie triumphed destroying the world he knew this thought added to his gloom for he had no destiny but death no purpose save what fate willed why fight against if why bother to sharpen his wits or put his mind in order when thc was little more than a sacrifice on the altar of destiny he breathed deeply of the hot dry air and expelled it from lus stinging lungs spitting out me clogging sand which bad laaanaged to enter his mouth and nostrils dyvim sionn shared something of eirics mood though his feelings were not so strong he had a more ordered life man had eiric though they were of the same blood whereas eiric bad questioned me custom of his folk even renounced king ifaip that he might explore the new lands of me young king doms and compare their way of life with his own dyvim slorm had never indulged in such questioning he had suf fered bitterness when through eirics renegade activities the dreaming city of imrryr last stronghold of me old race of ikfelnibone bad been razed shock too of a kind when he md what remained of the imrryrians had been forced out lato me world also to make their living as mercenaries of mose they considered upstart kings of lowly and contemptible peoples dyvim slorm who had never questioned did not question now though be was disturbed moonglum was less selfabsorbed since the time many years before when he and eiric bad met and fought against me dharzi together he had felt a peculiar sympathy even empathy with his friend when eiric sank into such moods as we one be was in now moonglum felt tormented only be cause he could not help him many times he had sought me means of pulling eiric out of his gloomy depression but f these days be had learned that it was impossible by nature t cheerful and optimistic even he felt dominated by me doom which was on them michael moorcock rackhir too who was of a calmer and more philosophical frame of mind than his fellows did not feel capable of fully grasping the implications of their mission he had thought to spend the rest of bis days in contemplation and meditation in the peaceful city of tanelorn which exerted a strange calm ing influence on all who lived there but this call to aid in the fight against chaos had been impossible to ignore and he had unwillingly strapped on his quiver of arrows of law and taken up his bow again to ride from tanelom with a small party of those who wished to accompany him and offer their services to eiric peering through the sandfilled air he saw something loom ing aheada single mountain rising from the wastes of the desert as if placed there by means other than natural he called pointing eirici there that must be mordagas castlef eiric roused himself and let his eyes follow rackhirs pointing hand aye he sighed we are there let us pause now and rest recuperating our strength before we ride the fi nal distance they reined in their steeds and dismounted easing their aching limbs and stretching their legs to allow the blood to flow freely again they raised their tent against the windblown sand and ate their meal in a mood of companionship created by the knowledge that after they reached the mountain they might never we one another alive again six the steps wound up around me mountain high above they could see the gleam of masonry and just where the steps curved and disappeared for the first time they saw an elder tree it looked like an ordinary tree but it became a symbol for themthere was their initial antagonist how would it fight what influence would it exert on them eiric placed a booted foot on the first step it was high built for the feet of a giant he began to climb the other three following behind him now as he reached the tenth step he unsheathed storm bringer felt it quiver and send energy into him the climb ing instantly became easier as he came close to the elder he heard it rustle saw that mere was an agitation in its branches yes it was certainly sentient he was only a few steps from the tree when he heard dyvim siorm shout gods the leaveslook at the leavesi the green leaves their veins seeming to throb in the sun light were beginning to detach themselves from me branches and drift purposefully towards the group one settled on eirics bare hand he attempted to brush it off but it clung others began to settle on different parts of his body they were coming in a green wave now and he felt a peculiar stinging sensation in his hand with a curse be peeled it off and to his horror saw that tiny pinpricks of blood were left where it had been his body twitched in nausea and be ripped the rest from his face slashing at others with his crooning runesword as they were touched by the blade so they shrivelled but they were swiftly replaced he knew instinctively that they were sucking not only blood from his veins but the soulforce from his being be was weakening slightly already michael moorcock behind him his companions were experiencing the same with yells of terror these leaves were being directed and he knew where the direction came fromthe tree itself he clambered up the re maining steps fighting off the leaves which swarmed like lo custs around him with grim intention he began hacking at the trunk which gave out an angry groaning and the branches sought to reach him he slashed them away and then plunged stonnbringer deep into the tree sods of earth spattered up wards as the roots threshed the tree screamed and began to heel over towards him as if in death it sought to kill him also he wrenched at stonnbringer which sucked greedily at the halfsentient trees lifestuff failed to tug the sword out and leapt aside as the tree crashed down over the steps barely missing him one branch slashed his face and drew blood he gasped and staggered feeling the life draining from him as he stumbled towards the fallen tree he saw that the wood was suddenly dead and the remaining leaves had shrivelled quickly he gasped as the three came up shift this thing my swords beneath and without it im dead swiftly they set to work and rolled the peculiarly light tree over so that eiric could weakly grasp the hilt of stonnbringer still imbedded therein as he did so he almost screamed experiencing a sensation of tremendous force energy filled him pulsed through him so that he felt like a god himself he laughed as if possessed by a demon and the others looked at him in astonishment come my friends follow me i can deal with a million such trees now he leapt up the steps as another shoal of leaves came towards him ignoring their bites he went straight for the elder itself and as if part of the sword aimed for its centre again this tree screamed dyvim slorm he shouted drunk on its lifeforce do an i dolet your sword drink a few such souls and were invin cible such power is scarcely palatable rackhir said brushing dead leaves from his body as eiric withdrew his sword again and ran towards the next the elders grew thicker here and stormbringer they bent their branches to reach him looming over him the branches like fingers seeking to pluck him apart dyvim slorm a trifle less spontaneously imitated eirica method of despatching the treecreatures and soon he too be came filled with the stolen sous of the demons imprisoned within the elders and his wfld shout joined eirics as like fiendish woodsmen they attacked again and again each vic tory lending mem more strength so that moonglum and rackhir looked at one another with wonder and a trace of fear to see such a terrible change come over their friends but there was no denying that their methods were effective against the elders soon they looked back at a waste of fallen blackened trees spreading down the mountainside all the old unholy fervour of the dead kings of melnibone was in the faces of the two kinsmen as they sang old battle songs their twin blades joining in the harmony to send up a disturbing melody of doom and malevolence his lips parted to reveal his white teeth his red eyes maz ing with dreadful fire his milkwhite hair streaming in the burning wind eiric flung up his sword to the sky and turned to confront his companions now friends see how the ancient ones of melnibone con quered man and demon to rule the world for ten thousand years moonglum thought that he merited the nickname of wolf gained in the west long since all the chaosforce that was now within him had gained complete control over everything else he realised that eiric was no longer split in his loyalties there was no conflict in him now his ancestors mood domi nated him and he appeared as they must have ages since when all other races of mankind fled before them fearing their magnificence their malice and their evil dyvim slorm seemed equally as possessed and moonglum sent up a heart felt prayer to whatever kindly gods remained in the universe that eiric was his ally and not his enemy they were close to the top now eiric and his cousin springing ahead with superhuman bounds the steps termi nated at the mouth of a gloomy tunnel and into the darkness rushed the pair laughing and calling to one another less speedily moonglum and rackhir followed the red archer nocking an arrow to his bow etric peered into the gloom his head swimming with the michael moorcock power that seemed to burst from every pore of his body he heard the clatter of armoured feet coming towards him and as they approached he realised that these warriors were but human though nearly a hundred and fifty they did not daunt him as the first group rushed at him he blocked blows easily and struck them down each soul taken making only a fractions difference to the vitality already in him shoulder to shoulder stood the kinsmen butchering the sol diers like so many children it was dreadful to the eyes of moonglum and rackhir as they came up to witness the flood of blood which soon made the tunnel slippery the stench of death in the close confines became too much as eiric and dyvim siorm moved past the first of the fallen and carried the attack to the rest rackhir groaned though they be enemies and the ser vants of those we fight i cannot bear to witness such slaugh ter we are not needed here friend moonglum these are demons waging war not men aye sighed moonglum as they broke out into sunlight again and saw the castle ahead the remaining warriors reas sembling as eiric and dyvim slorm advanced menacingly with malevolent joy towards them the air rang with the sounds of shouting and steel dash ing rackhir aimed an arrow at one of the warriors and launched it to take the man in the left eye til see that a few of them get a cleaner death be muttered nocking an other arrow to me string as eiric and his kinsman disappeared into the enemy ranks others sensing perhaps that rackhir and moonglum were less of a danger rushed at the two moonglum found himself engaging three warriors and dis covered that his sword seemed extraordinarily light and gave off a sweet clear tone as it met the warriors weapons turn ing them aside speedily the sword supplied him with no en ergy but it did not blunt as h might have and the heavier swords could not force it down so easily rackhir had expended au his arrows in what had virtually been an act of mercy he engaged me enemy with his sword and killed two taking moonglums third opponent from be hind with an upward thrust into the mans side and through to bis heart then they went with little stomach into me main fray and stormbringer f skw that already the turf was littered with a great many corpses rackhir cried to eiric stop eiriclet us finish these you have no need to take their souls we can kill them with more natural methods but eiric laughed and carried on his work as eiric finished another warrior and there were no others in the immediate area rackhir seized him by the arm eiric stormbringer turned in eirics hand howling its satiated glee and clove down at rackhir seeing his fate rackhir sobbed and sought to avoid the mow but it landed in his shoulder blade and sheared down to his breastbone eiric he cried not my soul too and so died the hero rackhir the red archer famous in me eastlands cloven by a treacherous blade by the friend whose life he had saved long ago when they bad first met near the city of ameeron then came realisation eiric tried to tug the sword away but it was too late again he had involuntarily slain one close to him while in the power of his runesword oh rackhir he cried kneeling beside the body and tak ing it in bis arms the stolen energy still pulsed in him but his great grief no longer gave it the same control over him tears streamed down eirics tortured face and a great t racking groan came from him once more he muttered once more will it never k cease s beyond him his two remaining companions stood on op m posite sides of the field of the slain dyvim slorm had done with slaying but only because there were none left to kill he was gasping staring around him half in bewilderment moon glum stared at eiric with horrified eyes which yet held a fleam of sympathy for his friend for he knew well eirics doom and knew mat the life of one close to eiric was the price stormbringer demanded for supplying the albino with his vitality rackhir no gentler hero was there no man more desir ous of peace and order than you eiric raised himself to his feet and turned to look at the huge castle of granite and milestone which stood in enigmatic silence as if awaiting bis michael moorcock next action on the battlements of the topmost turret he could make out a figure which could only be a giant i wear by your stolen soul rackhir that what you wished to come to pass shall come to pass though i a thing of chaos achieve il law wffl triumph and chaoa win be driven back anned with awotd and shield of chaos forging i shall do battle with every fiend of hell if needs be chaos was the indirect cause of your death and chaos will be punished for it but first we must take ac shield dyvim slorm not realising quite what had happened shouted in exultation to bu unmnan eiriclefs viait the sad giant nowf but moonglum coming up to gaze down on me ruined body of rackhir murmured aye chaos is me cause eiric ill join in your vengeance with a will so long as he shud dered tm spared from me attentions of your hellblade together three abreast tfaey marched through we open portal of mordagas castle and were hnmfdintdy in a rich and barbaricauy furnished hall mordaga eiric cried we have come to fulfill a propbccyi we await you they waited impatiently until at last a bulky figure came through a great arch at the end of the vast hall mordaga was as tad aft two men but his back was slightly stooped he had long curling black hair and was dad in deep blue smock belted at the waist upon his great feet were simple leather sandals his black eyes were fun of a sor row such as moonglum had only wen before in eirics eyes upon the sad giants arm was a round shield which bora upon it me eight amber arrows of chaos it was of a silvery green colour and very beautiful he had no other weapons i know me prophecy he said m a voice that was like a lonely roaring wind but still i must seek to avert it will you take the shield and leave me in peace human i do not want death eiric felt a kind of empathy for sad mordaga and he knew something of what me fallen god must feel at mis moment the prophecy says death be said softly take the shield mordaga lifted ft off his mighty arm and held it towards eiric take the shield and change fate this once eiric nodded i will stormbringer with a tremendous sigh the giant deposited me chaos shield upon the floor for thousands of years i have lived in the shadow of that prophecy he said straightening his back now though i die in old age i shan die in peace and though i once did not think so i shad welcome such a death after all mis time i mink you may not die thus with your shields protection gone eiric waroed him for chaos comes and will engulf you as it wql engulf everything unless i can stop it but at least it seems youll be in a more philosophic frame of mind to meet it fareweb and i thank you said the giant turning and he plodded back towards the entrance through which he had come as mordaga disappeared moonglum dashed forward on fleet feet and followed him through the entrance before either h eiric or dyvim slorm could cry out or stop him then they beard a single shriek that seemed to echo away j into eternity a crash which shook the hall and then the foot fall returning lit moonglum reappeared in the entrance a bloody sword in his hand unable to understand this uncharacteristic action eiric was silent merely staring at me eastlander as he approached down the hall it was murder said moonglum simply i admit it i ij took him in the back before he was aware of it it was a h good quick death and he died whilst happy moreover it was a better death than any his minions tried to mete to us it was murder but it was necessary murder in my eyes whyr said eiric still mystified h grimly moonglum continued he had to perish as fate decreed we are servants of fate now eiric and to divert it in any small way is to hamper its aims but more than that it was me beginning of my own vengeance taking if mordaga had not surrounded himself with such a host rackhir would not have died eiric shook his head blame me for that moonglum the giant should not have perished for my own swords crime someone had to perish said moonglum steadfastly and michael moorcock since the prophecy contained mordagas death he was the one who else here could i kill eiric eiric turned away i wish it were i he sighed he looked down at the great round shield with its shifting amber arrows and its mysterious silvergreen colour he picked it up easily enough and placed it on his arm it virtually covered his body from chin to ankles come lets make haste and leave this place of death and misery the lands of umiora and vumir await our aidif they have not already wholly fallen to chaosi ђ it was in the mountains separating the sighing desert from the weeping waste that they first learned of the fate of the last of the young kingdoms they came upon a party of six tired warriors led by lord voashooo zarorinias father what has happened eiric asked anxiously where is zarozinia our continent has fallen to chaos eiric as for zarozinia i know not if shes lost liead or captured did you not seek for her eiric said accusingly the old man shrugged my son i have looked upon so much horror these past days mat i am now bereft of emo tion i care for nothing but a quick release from all this the day of mankind is over on the earth go no further than here for even the weeping waste is beginning to change be fore the crawling tide of chaos it is hopeless hopelessi no we still liveperhaps zarozinia stin lives did you hear nothing of her fate only a rumour that jagreen lern had taken her aboard the leading chaos ship she is on the seas perhaps nothose cursed craft sail land as well as sea if it can be told apart these days it was they who attacked kariaak with a vast horde of mounted men and infantry following be hind confusion prevailsyouti find nothing but your death back there my son we shall see i have some protection against chaos at long last plus my sword and my nihrain steed he turned in the saddle to address his companions well friends will you stay here with lord voashoon or accompany me into the heart of chaos well come with you moonglum said quietly speaking for them both weve followed you until now and our fates are linked with yours in any case we can do nought else michael moorcock good farewell lord voashoon if you would do a ser vice ride over the weeping waste to eahmir and the un known kingdoms where moonglums homeland lies tell them what to expect though theyre probably beyond rescue now i wbl try said voashoon wearily and hope to arrive there before chaos then eiric and his companions were off riding towards the massed hordes of chaosthree men against the unleashed forces of darkness three foolhardy men who had pursued their course so faithfully that it was inconceivable for them to flee now the last acts must be played out whether howling night or calm day followed the first signs of chaos were soon apparent as they saw the place where lush grassland once had been it was now a yellow morass of molten rode that though cool rolled about with a purposeful air the nihrain horses since they did not actually gallop on the plane of earth at all crossed it with comparative ease and here the chaos shield was first shown to work for as they passed the yellow liquid rock changed and became grass again for a short time they met once a shambling thing that still had limbs of sorts and a mourn that could speak from this poor creature they learned that kariaak was no more that it had been churned into broiling nothingness and where ft had been the forces of chaos both human and supernatural had set up their camp their work done the thing also spoke of some thing that was of particular interest to eiric rumour was that the dragon isle of melnibon was the only place where chaos had been unable to exert its influence if when our business is doae we can reach melnibone eiric said to his friends as they rode on we might be able to abide until such a time that the white lords can help us also there are dragons slumbering in the cavesand these would be useful against jagreen lem if we could waken them what use is it to fight mem now dyvim slorm said de featedly jagreen lem has won eiric we have not fulfilled our destiny our role is over and chaos rules does it but we have yet to fight it and test its strength against ours let us decide then what the outcome has been stormbringer t slorm looked dubious but he said nothing oeo at last they came to the camp of chaos i portal nightmare could encompass such a terrible tbe towering ships of hell dominated the place as aved it from a distance utterly horrified by the kitmg names of all colours seemed to flicker every r the camp fiends of all kinds mingled with the evilly beautiful dukes of hell conferred with the kings who had allied themselves to jagreen lem now regretted it every so often the ground i erupted and any human beings unfortunate pte be in the area were either engulfed and totally ibm or else had their bodies warped in indescribable te noise was dreadful blending of human voices and chaos sounds devils wailing laughter and quite of tortured scream of a human soul who had perhaps kn choice of loyalty and now suffered madness the w disgusting of corruption of blood and of evil bipb of hell moved slowly about through the horde tferetcbed for miles dotted with great pavilions of flheir silk banners fluttering hollow pride compared to fat of chaos many of the human beings could te told from the chaos creatures their forms were tad under the influence of chaos stuttered to his friends as they sat in their saddles it is obvious that the warping influence of chaos a stronger among the human ranks this will con even jagreen lern and the human leaders will lose lance of humanity and become just a fraction of stuff of chaos this will mean the end of the mankind will pass away forever taken into the i ook upon the last of mankind my friends save for soon it will be indistinguishable from anything else f unstable earth is beneath the heel of the lords of soon will beand they are gradually absorbing it realm into their own plane they will first re then steal the earth altogether it will become just p of clay for them to mould into whatever gro s take their fancy seek to stop that moonglum said hopelessly eiric michael moorcock we must continue to strive until we are conquered i remember that straasha the sea king said if lord pyaray commander of the ships of hell is slain the ships themselves will no longer be able to exist i have a mind to put that to the test also i have not forgotten that my wife may be prisoner aboard his ship or that jagreen lem is there i have three good reasons for venturing there no bind it would be more than suicide i do not ask you to accompany me if you go we shall come but i like it not noif one man cannot succeed neither can three i shall go alone wait here for me if i do not return then try to get to melnibone but biric mbongium cried and then watched as his chaos shield pulsing eiric spurred his nihrain steed towards the camp protected against the influence of chaos eiric was sighted by a detachment of warriors as he neared the ship which was his destination they recognised him and rode towards him shouting he laughed in their faces halfmaddened by the sights smells and sounds around him just the fodder my blade needs before we banquet on yonder ship he cried as he slashed off the first mans head as if it were a buttercup secure behind his great round shield he hewed about him with a will since stonnbrmger had slain roe gods imprisoned in the elder trees the vitality which the sword passed into him was almost without limit yet every soul that biric stole from jagreen lerns warriors was another fraction of ven geance reaped against men he was invincible he split one heavily armoured warrior from bead to crutch sheared through the saddle and smashed the horses backbone apart then the remaining warriore dropped back suddenly and eiric felt his body tingle with peculiar sensations knew he was in the area of influence exerted by me chaos ship and knew also that he was being protected against it by his shield he was now partially out of his own earthly plane and exist ed between his worid and the world of chaos he dismounted from his nihrain steed and ordered it to wait for him there were ropes trailing from the huge sides of the ship and eiric saw with horror that other figures were climbing up them and he recognised several as men he had known in karlaak stormbmnger even now the chaos ship was still recruiting its crew from the ranks of the dead he joined the ghastly ranks and swarmed with them up the tides of me great gleaming ship grateful at least for the cover they gave him he reached the ships rail and hauled himself over h spit ting bile from his throat as he entered a peculiar region of darkness and came to the first of a series of decks that rose like steps to the topmost one where he could see me occu pantsa manlike figure and something like a huge bloodred octopus the first was probably jagreen lern the second was obviously pyaray for this eiric knew was the guise he took when he manifested himself on earth contrasting with me ships seen from the distance once aboard eiric became conscious of the dark shadowy nature of me light filled with moving threads a network of dark reds blues yellows greens and purples which as be moved through te gave and reformed itself behind him he was constantly being blundered against by the moving cadavers and he made a point of not looking at their faces too closely for be had already recognised several of the sear raiders whom he had abandoned years before during the es cape from imrryr slowly he was gaining the top deck noting that so far both jagreen lern and lord pyarary seemed unaware of his presence presumably they considered themselves entirely free from any kind of attack now they had conquered all me known worid he grinned maliciously to himself as he conrin ned climbing gripping the shield tightly knowing that if once he lost hold of it his body would become transformed either into some shambling alien shape or else flow away altogether to become absorbed into the chaos stuff by now eiric had forgotten everything but his main object which was to kill lord pyaray he must gain the topmost deck and deal first with the lord of chaos then he would kill jagreen lem and if she were really there rescue zaro zania and bear her to safety up the dark decks through the nets of strange colours ei ric went his milk white hair flowing behind him in contrast to the moody darkness around him as he came to the last deck but one he felt a gentle touch on his shoulder and looking in that direction saw with heart michael moorcock lurching horror that one of pyarays bloodred tentacles had found him he stumbled back pulling up his shield the tentacle tip touched the shield and rebounded sud denly the entire tentacle shrivelling from above where the chaos lord s main bulk was there came a terrible screaming and roaring whats this fvhafs this whafs this eiric shouted in impudent triumph at seeing his shield work with such effect tis eiric of melnibone great lord come to destroy thee another tentacle dropped towards him seeking to curl around the shield and seize him then another followed it and another eiric hacked at one severed its sensitive tip saw another touch the shield recoil and shrivel and then avoided the third in order to run round the deck and ascend as swiftly as he could the ladder leading to the deck above here be saw jagreen lem his eyes wide the theocrat was clad in his familiar scarlet armour on his arm was his buck ler and in the same hand an axe while his right hand held a broadsword he glanced down at these weapons obviously aware of their inadequacy against eirics you later theocrat eiric promised grimly youre a fool eiric youre doomed now whatever you do it was probably true but he did not care aside upstart eiric said as his shield up he moved warily towards the manyteotacled lord of chaos you are the killer of many cousins of mine eiric the creature said in a low voice and youve banished several dukes of chaos to their own domain so that they cannot reach earth again for that you must pay but i at least do not underestimate you as in likelihood they did a tentacle reared above him and tried to come down from over the shields rim and seize his throat he took a step backwards and blocked the attempt with the shield then a whole web of tentacles began to come from all sides each one curling around the shield knowing its touch to be death he skipped aside avoiding them with difficulty slicing about him with stormbringer as he fought he remembered straashas last message strike for the crystal atop his head there is his life ami his soul stormbringer j eiric saw the blue radiating crystal which he had originally taken to be one of lord pyarays several eyes he moved in towards the roots of the tentacles leaving his back badly unprotected but there was nothing else for it as he did so a huge maw gaped in the things head and tenta cles began to draw him towards it he extended his shield towards the maw and had the satisfaction of seeing yellow jellylike stuff spurt from it as the lord of chaos screamed in he got his foot on one tentacle stump and clambered up che slippery hide of the chaos lord every time his shield touched him creating some sort of wound so that lord pyaray began to thresh about dreadfully then he stood v above the glowing soulcrystal for an instant he paused then plunged stormbringer pointfirst into the crystal there came a mighty throbbing from the heart of the en titys body it gave vent to a monstrous shriek sad then eiric yelled as stormbringer took the soul of a lord of hell and channelled this surging vitality through to him it was too much he was hurled backwards he lost his footing on the slippery back stumbled off the deck itself and fell to another nearly a hundred feet below he landed with bonecracking force but thanks to the stolen vitality was completely unharmed he got up ready to clam ber towards jagreen lem the theocrat s anxious face peered down at him and he yelted youll find a present for you in yonder cabin eiric tom between pursuing the theocrat and investigating the cabin eiric turned and opened die door from inside came a dreadful sobbing zaroriniat he cried he ducked into the dark place and here he saw her her lovely body was dreadfully changed so that it now resembled the body of a white worm only her head the same beautiful head was left horrified he almost dropped his shield did jagreen lem do this he and his ally the head nodded sickened eiric could hardly bear to look at her another great score that must be paid he muttered and then the wormbody had threshed and impaled itself on his sword there the head cried take my soul into michael moorcock you eiric for i am useless to myself and you nowl cany my soul with yours and we shall be forever together he tried to withdraw the thirsty runemade but it was im possible and unlike any other sensation he had ever re ceived from it this was almost gentle warm and pleasant his wifes soul flowed into his and be wept as it did so oh zarozinia he sobbed h my lovef so she died her soul blending with his as years before the soul of his first love cymoril had been taken he did not look at the dreadful wormbody did not glance at her face but walked slowly from the cabin but now it appeared that the deck was disintegrating flow ing apart jagreen lena had evidently made good his escape and eiric in his present mood did not feel ready to pursue him sword and shield both aiding him in their ways he leapt from the ship to the pulsating ground and ran for the nihrain steed then the tears still flowing down his white face he rode leaving the ships of hell breaking apart behind him at least these would threaten the worid no more and a blow bad been struck against chaos now only the horde itself remained to be dealt withand the dealing would not be so easy he rejoined his friends in silence said nothing to them and led the way over the shaking earth towards melnibone island of his ancestors where the last stand against chaos would be made the last battle fought and his destiny completed and in his mind as he rode he seemed to hear zarozimaa youthful voice whispering comforting words as still sobbing he galloped away from the camp of chaos book four doomed lords passing for the mind of man alone is free to explore the lofty i vastness of the cosmic infinite to transcend ordinary con s iciousness to roam the secret corridors of the brain where past and future melt into one and universe and individ ual are tinted the one mirrored in the other and each con i tains the other i the chronicle of the black sword one the dreaming city no longer dreamed in splendour the tat tend towers of imrryr were blackened husks tumbled rags of masonry standing sharp and dark against a sullen sky once exrics vengeance had brought fire to the city and the fire had brought ruin streaks of cloud like sooty smoke whispered across the pulsing mm so that the shouting redstained waters beyond imrryr were soiled by shadow and they seemed to become quieter as if bushed by the black scan that rode across their ominous turbulence upon a confusion of fallen masonry a man stood watch ing the waves a tall man broadshouldered slender at hip a man with slanting brows pointed lobeless ears high cheekbones and crimson moody eyes in a dead white ascetic face he was dressed in black quilted doublet and heavy cloak both highcollared emphasising the pallor of his albino kin the wind erratic and warm played with his cloak fin gered it and passed mindlessly on to howl through the broken towers eiric heard the howling and his memory was filled by tho sweet the malicious and melancholy melodies of old melni bone he remembered too the other music his ancestors had created when they had elegantly tortured their slaves choos ing them for the pitch of their screams and forming them into die instruments of unholy symphonies lost in this nostalgia for a while he found something dose to forgetful ness and he wished that he had never doubted ae code of melnibone wished that he had accepted it without question and thus left his mind unaundered bitterly be smiled a figure appeared below him and climbed the tumbled tones to stand by his side he was a small redhaired man with a wide mouth and eyes that bad once been bright and amused michael moorcock you look to the bast eiric moonglum murmured yoa look back towards something irremediable eiric put his longfingered hand on his friend s shoulder where else is there to look moonglum when me worid lies beneath the heel of chaos what would you have me do look forward to days of hope and laughter to an old age lived in peace with chadren playing around my feet he laughed softly it was not a laugh that moonglum liked to hear sepiriz spoke of help from the white lords it must come soon we must wait patiently moonglum turned to squint into the glowering and motionless sun and then his face set in an introspective look cast bis eyes down to the rubble on which he stood eiric was silent for a moment watching the waves then be shrugged why complain it does me no good i cannot act on my own volition whatever fate is before me cannot be changed i pray that the men who follow us win make use of their ability to control their own destinies i have no such ability he touched his jaw bone with his fingers and then looked at the hand noting nails knuckles muscles and veins standing out on the pale skin he ran this hand through the silky strands of his white hair drew a long breath and let it out in a sigh logic the worid cries for logic i have none yet here i am formed as a man with mind heart and vitals yet formed by a chance coming together of certain elements the worid needs logic yet all the logic in the worid is worm as much as one lucky guess men take pains to weave a web of careful thoughtsyet others thoughtlessly weave a random pattern and achieve the same result so much for the thoughts of the sage ah moonglum winked with attempted levity thus speaks the wild adventurer the cynic but we are not all wud and cynical eiric other men tread other pathsand reach other conclusions than yours i tread one that s prcordained come lets to the dragon caves and see what dyvim slorm has done to rouse our rep tilian friends they stumbled together down the ruins and walked the shattered canyons that had once been the lovely streets of imrryr out of the city and along a grassy track mat wound through the gorse disturbing a flock of large ravens that fled into the air cawing ad save one the king who balanced stormbringer l himself on a bush his cloak of ruffled feathers drawn up in dignity bis black eyes regarding them with wary contempt down through sharp rocks to the gaping entrance of the dragon caves down me steep steps into torchht darkness with its damp warmth and smell of scaly reptilian bodies into the first cave where the great recumbent forms of the sleeping dragons lay their folded leathery wings rising into the shadows their green and black scales glowing faintly their clawed feet folded and their slender snouts curied back even in sleep to display the long ivory teeth that seemed like so many white stalactites their dilating red nostrils groaned in torpid slumber the smell of their hides and their breath was unmistakable rousing in moonglum some memory inher ited from his ancestors some shadowy impression of a time when these dragons and their masters swept across a world they ruled their inflammable venom dripping from their fangs and heedlessly setting fire to the countryside across which they flew eiric used to it hardly noticed the smell but passed on through the first cave and the second until he found dyvim slorm striding about with a torch in one hand and a scroll in the other swearing to himself he looked up as be heard their booted feet approach he spread out his arms and shouted his voice echoing through the caverns nothing not a stir not an eyelid flickering there is no way of rousing them theyll not wake until they have slept their necessary number of years oh that we had not used them on the last two occasions for we have greater need of them today neither you nor i had the knowledge we have now re gret is useless since it can achieve nothing eiric stared around him at the huge shadowy forms here slightly apart from the rest lay the leaderdragon one he recognised and felt affection for flamefang the eldest who was five thou sand years old and still young for a dragon but flamefang like the rest slept on he went up to the beast and stroked its metallike scales ran his hand down the ivory smoothness of its great front fangs felt its warm breath on his body and smiled beside him on his hip be heard stormbrmger murmur he patted the blade heres one soul you cannot have the dragons are indestructible they will survive even though all the world collapses into nothing dyvim slorm said from another part of tile cavern i michael moorcock cant think of further action to take for the meantime brie lets go back to the tower of daiputna and refresh our selves eiric nodded assent and together the three men returned through the caverns and ascended the steps into die sunlight so dyvim slorm remarked still no nightfall the sun has remained in that position for thirteen days ever since we left the camp of chaos and made our perilous way to melni bone how much power must chaos wield if it can top the sun in its course chaos might not have done this for all we know moon glum pointed out though its likely of course that if did time has stopped time waits but waits for what more confusion further disorder or he influence of me great bal ance which will restore order and take vengeance against those forces who have gone against its will or does time wait for usthree mortal men adriftcut off from what is happening to all other men waiting on time as it waits on us perhaps the sun waits on us brie agreed tor is ft not our destiny to prepare the worid for its fresh course it makes me feel a uttle more man a mere pawn if thats the case what if we do nothing will the sun remain where it is forever they paused in their progress for a moment and stood staring up at me pulsating red disc which flooded the streets with scarlet light at the black clouds which fled across the sky before it where were the clouds going where did they come from they seemed instilled with purpose it was pos sible that they were not even clouds at all but spirits of chaos bent on dark errands eiric grunted to himself aware of the uselessness of such speculation he led the way back to the tower of d a rputaa where years before he had sought his love his cousin cymorfl and later lost her to the ravening thirst of the blade by his side the tower had survived the flames though the colours that had once adorned it were blackened by fire here he left his friends and went to his own room to fling himself fully clad upon the soft melnibonean bed and almost immediately fall asleep two eiric slept and eiric dreamed and though he was aware of the unreality of his visions ilis attempts to rouse himself to wakefuloess were entirely futile soon he ceased trying and merely let his dream form itself and draw him into its bright landscapes he saw imrryr as it fwd been many centuries ago imrryr the same city he had known before he led the raid on it and caused its destruction the same yet with a different brighter appearance as if it were newlybuilt as well the colours of the surrounding countryside were richer the sun darker orange the sky deep blue and sultry since then he realised the very tints of the world had faded with the planets ageing people and beasts moved in the shining streets tall eldritch melniboneans men and women walking with grace like proud tigers hardfaced slaves with hopeless stoic eyes longlegged horses of a type now extinct small mastodons drawing gaudy cars clearly on the breeze came the mys terious scents of the place the muted sounds of activityall hushed for the melniboneans hated noise as much as they loved harmony heavy silk banners flapped from the scintil lating towers of milestone jade ivory crystal and polished red granite and eiric moved in his sleep and ached to be there amongst his own ancestors the golden folk who had dominated the old world monstrous galleys passed through the watermaze which led to imrryrs inner harbour bringing the best of the worlds booty tax gathered from all parts of the bright empire and across the azure sky lazy dragons flapped their way towards the caves where thousands of the beasts were stabled unlike the present where scarcely a hundred remained in the tallest towerthe tower of baunezbett the tower of kingshis ancestors had studied sorcerous lore conducted their mali michael moorcock cious experiments indulged their sensuous appetitesnot dec adently as men of the young kingdoms might behave but according to their native instincts eiric knew that he looked upon the ghost of a nowdead city and he seemed to pass beyond the towers gleaming walls and see his emperorancestors indulging in drugsharp ened conversation lazily sadistic sporting with demon women torturing investigating the peculiar metabolism and psychology of the enslaved races delving into mystic lore ab sorbing a knowledge which few men of the later period could experience without falling insane but it was clear that his must either be ft dream or vision of a nether world which the dead of all ages inhabited for here were emperors of many different generations erie knew them from their portraits blackringletted rondar iv twelfth emperor sharpeyed imperious eiric i eightieth em peror horror burdened kahan vn threehundredftnd twentyninth emperor a dozen or more of me mightiest and wisest of his fourhundredaadtwcntyseven ancestors includ ing terhali the green empress who had ruled the bright empire from me year after its foundation until her longevity and greentinged skin and hair had marked her out she bad been a powerful sorceress even by memibonean standards she was also reputed the daughter of a union be tween emperor luntric x and a demon eiric who saw all these as if from a darkened corner of the great main chamber observed the shimmering door of black crystal open and a newcomer enter he started and again attempted to wake himself without success the man was his father sadric the eightysixth a tall man with heavy lidded eyes and a misery in him he passed through the throng as if it did not exist he walked directly towards eiric and stopped two paces from him he stood looking at him the eyes peering upwards from beneath the heavy lids and prominent brow he was a gauntfaced man who had been disappointed in his albino son he had a sharp long nose sweeping cheekbones and a slight stoop because of his un usual height he fingered the thin red velvet of his robe with his delicate beringed hands then he spoke in a clear whis per which eiric remembered it bad always been his habit to employ my son are you too dead i thought i d been here but a fleeting moment and yet i see you changed in years and with stormbringer a burden on you that time and fate have placed there how did you die in reckless combat on some upstarts foreign blade or in this very tower in your ivory bed and what of imrryr now does she fare well or ill dreaming in her de cline of past splendour the line continues as it musti will not ask you if that part of your trust was kept a son of course born of cymoril whom you loved for which your cousin yyrkoon hated you father the old man raised a hand that was almost transparent with age there is another question i must ask of you one that has troubled all who spend their immortality in this shade of a city some of us have noticed that the city itself fades at times and its colours dim quivering as if about to vanish companions of ours have passed even beyond death and perhaps i shudder to contemplate it into nonexistence even here in the timeless region of death unprecedented changes manifest themselves and those of us whove dared ask the question and also give its answer fear that some tu multuous event has taken place in the world of the living some event which so great is it that even here we are at fected and our souls extinction threatened a legend says that until the dreaming city dies we ghosts may inhabit its earlier glory is that the news you bear to us is this your message for i note on clearer observation that your body lives still and mis is merely your astral body released for a while to wander the realms of the dead father but already the vision was fading already he was withdrawing back down the bellowing corridors of the cosmos through planes of existence unknown to living men away away father he called and his own voice echoed but there was none there to make reply and in some sense at least he was glad for how could he answer the poor spirit and reveal to him the truth of his guesses admit the crimes he himself was guilty of against his ancestral city against the very blood of his forefathers all was mist and groaning sorrow as his echoes boomed into his ears seeming to take on their own in dependence and warp the word into weirder words faa aatheerrr aaaaavaaa aaaaahaaaa raaa daravaaraa still though he strove with all his being be could not rouse himself from slumber but felt his spirit drawn through michael moorcock other regions of smoky indeterminacy through patterns of colour beyond bis earthly spectrum beyond his minds conception a huge face began to take form in the mist sepiriz eiric recognised the face of his mentor but die black nihrainian disembodied did not appear to hear him sepirizare you dead the face faded then reappeared almost at once upon die rest of the mans tall frame eiric i have discovered you at last robed in your astral body i see thank fate for i thought i bad failed to sum mon you now we must make haste a breach has been made in the defences of chaos and we go to confer with the lords of law where are we nowhere as yet we travel to the higher worlds come hurry ni be your guide down down through pits of softest wool mat engulfed and comforted through canyons that were cut between blaz ing mountains of light which utterly dwarfed them through caverns of infinite blackness wherein their bodies shone and eiric knew that the dark nothingness went away in all direc tions for ever and then they seemed to stand upon a horizonkss plateau perfectly flat with occasional green and blue geometric con structions rising from ft the iridescent air was alive with shimmering patterns of energy weaving intricate shapes that seemed very formal and there too were things in human formthings which had assumed such shape for the benefit of the men who now encountered them the white lords of the higher worlds enemies of chaos were marvellously beautiful with bodies of such symmetry that they could not be earthly ony law could create such perfection and eiric thought such perfection defeated progress that the twin forces complemented one another was now plainer than ever before and for either to gain complete ascendancy over the other meant entropy or stagnation for the cosmos even though law might dominate the earth chaos must be present and vice versa the lords of law were accoutred for war they had made this apparent in their choice of earthlike garb fine metals and silksor their like on this planegleamed on their per fect bodies slender weapons were at their sides and their stormbringer overpoweringly beautiful faces seemed to glow with purpose the tallest stepped forward so sepiriz you have brought the one whose destiny it is to aid us greetings eiric of melnibone though spawn of chaos you be we have cause to welcome you do you recognise me the one whom your earthly mythology calls donblas the justice maker immobile eiric said i remember you lord donblas you are misnamed i fear for justice is nowhere present in the world you speak of your realm as if it were all realms donblas smiled without rancour though it appeared that he was unused to such impudence from a mortal eiric remained insouciant his ancestors had been opposed to donblas and all his brethren and it was still hard to consider the white lord an ally i see now how you have managed to defy our opponents lord donblas continued with approval and i grant you that justice cannot be found on earth at this time but i am named the justice maker and have still the will to make it when conditions change on your plane eiric did not look directly at donblas for the sight of his beauty was disturbing then lets to work my lord and change the world as soon we may lets bring the novelty of justice to our sobbing realm haste mortal is impossible herel it was another white lord speaking his pale yellow surcoat rippling over the clear steel of breastplate and greaves the single arrow of law em blazoned on it id thought the breach to earth made eiric frowned td thought this martial sight a sign that you prepared war against chaos war is preparedbut not possible until the summons comes from your realm from usi has not earth screamed for your aid have we not worked sorceries and incantations to bring you to us what further summons do you need the ordained one said lord donblas firmly the ordained one godsl is further work required of me then one last great task eiric said sepiriz softly as i have told you chaos blocks the attempts of the white lords to gain access to our world the horn of fate must be blown thrice before this business is fully terminated the first blast michael moorcock will wake the dragons of inarryr the second will allow the white lords entrance to the earthly plane the third be paused yes the tnird eiric was impatient the third will herald the death of our woridi where lies this mighty hom in one of several realms said scpinz a device of this kind cannot be made on our plane therefore it has had to be constructed on a plane where logic rules over sorceryyou must journey there to locate the horn of fate and how can i accomplish such a journey once again lord donblas spoke icvclly we will give you the means equip yourself with sword and shield of chaos for they will be of some use to you though not so powerful as in your world go you then to the highest point on the ruined tower of ballnezbett in imrryr and step off into space you will not fallunless what little power we retain on earth fails us comforting words my lord donblas very weu i shall do as you decree to satisfy my own curiosity if nauofht else donblas shrugged this is only one of many worldsal most as much a shadow as your ownbut you may not ap prove of it you will notice its sharpness its clearness of outlinethat will indicate hat time has exerted no real in fluence upon it that its structure has not been mellowed by many events however let me wish you safe passage mortal for i like youand i have cause to thank you too though you be of chaos you have within you several of the qualities we of law admire go nowreturn to your mortal body and prepare yourself for the venture ahead of you eiric bowed again and glanced at sepiriz the black nihrainian stepped back three paces and disappeared into the gleaming air eiric followed him once again their astral bodies ranged the myriad planes of the supernatural universe experiencing sensations unfamiliar to the physical mind before quite without warning eiric felt suddenly heavy and opened his eyes to discover that he was in his own bed in the tower of darputna through the faint light filtering between chinks in the heavy curtain thrown over the windowslit he saw the round chaos shield its eightarrowed symbol pulsing slowly as if in concert with the sun and beside it his unholy runeblade stormbringer lying stormbringer against die wall as if already prepared for their journey into the mightbe worid of a possible future then eiric slept again more naturally and was tormented also by more natural nightmares so that at last he screamed in his sleep and woke himself to find moonglum standing by die bed there was an expression of sad concern upon his narrow face what is it eiric what ails your slumber he shuddered nothing leave me moonglum and join you when i rise there must be reason for such shouting some prophetic dream perhaps aye prophetic sure enough i thought i saw a vision of my thin blood split by a hand that was my own what import has this dream what moment answer that my friend and if you cant then leave me to my morbid bed until these thoughts are gone come rouse yourself eiric find forgctfulnesa in action the candle of the fourteenth day burns low and dyvim slorm awaits your good advice the albino pulled himself upright and swung his trembling legs over the bed he felt enfeebled bereft of energy moon glum helped him rise throw off this troubled mood and help us in our quandary he said with a hollow levity that made his fears more plain aye eiric straightened himself hand me my sword i need its stolen strength unwillingly moonglum went to the wall where stood the evil weapon took the runeblade by its scabbard and lifted it with difficulty for it was an overheavy sword he shuddered as it seemed to titter faintly at him and he presented it hilt first to his friend gratefully eiric seized if was about to pull it from the sheath when he paused best leave the room be fore i free the blade moonglum understood at once and left not anxious to trust his life to the whim of the hellswordor his friend when he was gone hric unsheathed the great sword and at once felt a faint tingle as its supernatural vitality began to stream into his nerves yet it was scarcely adequate and he knew that if the blade did not feed soon upon the lifestuff of another it would seek the souls of his two remaining friends he replaced it thoughtfully in the scabbard buckled it around his waist and strode to join moonglum in the high ceilmged corridor michael moorcock in silence they proceeded down the twisting marble steps of the tower until they reached the centre level where the main chamber was here dyvim slorm was seated a bottle of old melnibonean wine on the table before him a large sil ver bowl in his bands his sword mournblade was on the table beside the bottle they had found the store of wine in the secret cellars of the place missed by the seareavers whom eiric had led upon bnrryr when he and his cousin had fought on opposite sides the bowl was full of the congealed mixture of herbs honey and barley which their ancestors had used to sustain themselves in times of need dyvim slorm was brooding over it but looked up when they came close and sat themselves on chairs opposite him he smiled hopelessly i fear eiric that i have done all i can to rouse our sleep ing friends no more is possibleand they still slumber eiric remembered the details of his vision and halfafraid that it had been merely a figment of his own imaginings sup plying the fantasy of hope where in reality do hope was said forget the dragons for a while at least last night i left my body so i thought and journeyed to places beyond the earth eventually to the white lords plane where they told me how i might rouse the dragons by blowing upon a horn intend to follow their directions and seek that horn dyvim slorm replaced his bowl upon the table well accompany you of course no needand anyway impossibleill have to go alone wait for me until i return and if i do notwell you must do what you decide spending your remaining years imprisoned on this isle or going to battle with chaos i have the idea that time has stopped in truth and if we stay here we shall live on forever and shall be forced to face the resulting boredom moonglum put in if you dont re turn i for one will ride into the conquered realms to take a few of our enemies with me to limbo as you will eiric said but wait for me until all your patience is ended for i know not how long iii be he stood up and they seemed a trifle startled as if they had not until then understood the import of his words fare you well then my friend said moonglum how well i fare depends on what i meet where i go ei ric smiled but thanks moonglum fare you well good cousin do not fret perhaps well wake the dragons yett stormbringer aye dyvim slorm said with a sudden resurgence of vi tality we shall we shall and their fiery venom will spread across the filth mat chaos brings burning it dean that day must come or im no prophet at all infected by this unejtpected enthusiasm eiric felt an in crease of confidence saluted his friends smiled and walked upright from the chamber ascending the marble stairs to take the chaos shield from its place and go down to the gateway of the tower and pass through it walking the jagged streets towards die magicsundered ruin that had once been the scene of his dreadful vengeance and unwitting murderthe tower of ballnezbett three now as eiric stood before the broken entrance of the tower his mind was beset with bursting thoughts which fled about his skull made overtures to his convictions and threatened to send him hopelessly back to rejoin his companions but he fought them forced them down forgot them clung to his remembrance of the white lords assurance and passed into the shadowed shell which still had the smell of burnt wood and fabric about its blackened interior this tower which had formed a funeral pyre for the mur dered corpse of his first love cymoril and his warped cousin her brother yyrkoon had been gutted of innards only the stone stairway remained and that he noted peering into the gloom through which rays of sunlight slanted bad collapsed before it reached the roof he dare not think for thought might rob him of action instead he placed a foot upon the first stair and began to climb as be did so a faint sound entered his ears or it may have been that it came from within bis mind however it reached his consciousness it sounded like a faraway orches tra tuning itself as he climbed higher the sound mounted rhythmic yet discordant until by the time he reached the fi nal step still left intact it thundered through his skull pound ed through his body producing a sensation of dull pain he paused and stared downward to the towers floor far below fears beset him he wondered whether lord donblas had intended him to climb to the highest point he could eas ily reach or the actual point which was still some twenty feet above him he decided it was best to take the white lord literally and swinging the great chaos shield upon his back reached above him and got bis fingers into a crack in the wall which now sloped gently inwards he heaved himself up his legs dangling and his feet seeking a bold he had al ways been troubled by heights and disliked the sensation that stormbringer came to him as be glanced down to the nibbleladen floor eighty feet below but he continued to climb and the climbing was made easier by me fissures in the towers wall though he expected to fall he did not and at last reached me unsafe roof easing himself through a bole and on to the sloping ex terior bit by bit he climbed until he was on the highest part of the tower then fearing hesitation till he stepped out wards over the festering streets of imrryr far below the discordant music topped a roaring note replaced ft swirling waves of red and black rushed towards him and men he had burst through them to find he was standing on firm turf beneath a small pale sun me smell of grass in his nos trils he noted mat whereas me ancient world seen in his dream had seemed more colourful than his own mis world in turn contained even less colour though it seemed to be cleaner in its outlines in sharper focus and the breeze mat blew against his face wascolder he began to walk over me grass towards a thick forest of low solid foliage which lay ahead he reached me perimeter of me forest but did not en ter circumnavigating it until he came to a stream mat went off into the distance away from the forest he noticed with curiosity mat me bright clear water ap peared not to move it was frozen though not by any natural process that he recognised it bad all the attributes of a sum mer streamyet it did not flow feeling mat this phenome non contrasted strangely with me rest of the scenery he swung me round chaos shield on to his arm drew his throb bing sword and began to follow the stream the grass gave way to gorse and rocks with me occasional dump of waving ferns of a variety he didnt recognise ahead he thought he heard the tinkle of water but here the stream was still frozen as he passed a rock taller man the rest he heard a voice above him eiric he looked up there on the rock stood a young dwarf with a long brown beard that reached below his waist he clutched a spear his only weapon and he was dad m russet breeks and jerkin with a green cap on his head and no shoes on his broad naked feel he bad eyes like quartz that were at once hard harsh and humorous thats my name eiric said quizzically yet how is it you know me michael moorcock i am not of this world myselfat least not exactly i have no existence in time as you know it but move here and there in the shadow worlds that the gods make it is my nature to do so in return for allowing me to exist the gods sometimes use me as a messenger my name is jermays the crooked as unfinished as these worlds themselves he clam bered down the rode and stood looking up at eiric whats your purpose here asked the albino methought you sought the horn of fate true know you where it lies aye smiled the young dwarf sardonically ifs buried with the stillliving corpse of a hero of this realma warrior they call roland possibly yet another incarnation of the champion eternal an outlandish name no more than yours to other ears roland save that his life was not so doom beset is your counterpart in his own realm he met his death in a valley not far from here trapped and betrayed by a fellow warrior the horn was with him then and he blew it once before he died some say that the echoes still resound through the valley and will resound forever though roland perished many years ago the horns full purpose is unknown hereand was unknown even to ro land it is called olifant and with his magic sword duran dana was buried with him in the monstrous grave mound that you see yonder the dwarf pointed into the distance and biric saw mat be indicated something be had earlier taken to be a large hillock and what must i do to gain this hom he asked the dwarf grinned with a hint of malice in his voice ou must match that bodkin there gainst rolands durandana his was consecrated by the forces of light whereas yours was forged by the forces of darkness it should be an inter esting conflict you say hes deadthen how can he fight me he wears the horn by a thong about his neck if you at tempt to remove it he will defend his ownership waking from the deathless sleep that seems to be the lot of most heroes in this world eiric smiled it seems to me they must be short of heroes if they have to preserve them in that manner perhaps the dwarf answered carelessly for there are a dozen or more who lie sleeping somewhere in this land alone ctormb ringer they are nipposcd to awaken only when a desperate need arises yet ive known unpleasant things to happen and still they have alept it could be they await the end of their world which die gods may destroy if it proves unsuitable in which case they will fight to prevent such a happening it is merely a poorly conceived theory of my own and of little weight perhaps the legends arise from some dim knowledge of the fate of the champion eeteroal the dwarf bobbed a cynical bow and hefting his spear sahited eiric farewell eiric of melnibone when you wish to return i will be here to lead youand return you must whether alive or dead for as you are probably aware your very presence your physical appearance itself contradicts this environment only one thing fits here whats aatr your sword my wordi strange i should haw thought that would be the last thing he shook a growing idea out of his mind he did not have time to speculate ive no liking to be here he commented as the dwarf clambered over the rocks he glanced in the direction of toe great burial mound and began to advance towards ft beside him he saw that the stream was moving naturally and he had the impression that though law influenced this world it was to some extent still forced to deal with the disrupting influence of chaos the grave barrow be could now see was fenced about with giant slabs of unadorned stone beyond the stones were olive trees that had dull jewels hanging from tncir branches and beyond them through tee leafy apertures eiric saw a tall curved entrance blocked by gates of brass embossed with gold though strong stormbringer he said to his sword i wonder if youll be strong enough to war in this world as well as giving my body vitality lets test you he advanced to the gate and drawing back his arm de livered a mighty blow upon it with the runesword the metal rang and a dent appeared again he struck this time holding the sword with both hands but then a voice cried from his right what demon would disturb dead rolands rest who speaks the language of melnibone eiric retorted boldly i speak the language of demons for i perceive that is michael moorcock what you are i know of oo mulnebooney and am wenversed in the ancient mysteries a proud boast for a woman said eiric who had not yet seen the speaker she emerged then from around the bar row and stood staring at him from out of her glowing green eyes she had a long beautiful face and was almost as pale as himself though her hair was jet black whats your name he asked and are you a native of this world i am named vivian an enchantress but earthly enough your master knows the name of vivian who once loved ro land though he was too upright to indulge her for she is immortal and a witch she laughed goodhumouredly therefore i am familiar with demons of your like and do not fear you aroint thee aroint theeor shall i call bishop turpin to exorcise thee some of your words said eiric courteously are unfa miliar and the speech of my folk much garbled are you some guardian of this heros tomb selfmade guardian aye now gol she pointed towards the stone slabs that is not possible the corpse within has something of value to roe the horn of fate we call it but you know it by another name olifanti but thats a blessed instrument no demon would dare touch it even i i am no demon fm sufficiently human i swear now stand aside this cursed door resists my efforts too well aye she said thoughtfully you could be a man though an unlikely one but the white face and hair the red eyes the tongue you speak sorcerer i be but no demon pleasestand aside she looked carefully into his face and her look dis turbed him he took her by her shoulder she felt real enough yet somehow she had little real presence it was as if she were far away rather than close to him they stared at one another both curious both troubled he whispered what knowledge could you have of my language is this world a dream of mine or of the gods it seems scarcely tangible why she heard him say you so of us what of your ghostly self you seem an apparition from the dead past from the past ahaand you are of the future as yet unformed perhaps that brings us to a conclusion stormbringer she did not pursue the topic but said suddenly stranger you will never break this door down if you can touch oli fant that speaks of you as mortal despite your appearance you must need the horn for an important task eiric smiled ayefor if i do not take it back from whence it came you will never exist she frowned hints hints i feel close to a discovery yet cannot grasp why and thats unusual for vivian here she took a big key from her gown aod offered it to himthis is the key to open rolands tomb it is the only one i had to kill to get it but oftimes i venture into the gloom of his grave to stare down at bis face and pine that i might revive him and keep him living forever on my island home take the born rouse himand when he has slain you he will come to me and my warmth my offer of everlasting life rafter than lie in that cold place again gobe slain by ro land he took the key thanks lady vivian if it were possible to convince one who in truth did not yet exist i wouldlell you that rolands daying of me would be worse for you than if i am success ful he put the large key in the lock and it turned easily the doors swung open and he saw that a long lowroofed cor ridor twisted before him unhesitatingly he advanced down it towards a flickering light that he could see through the cold and misty gloom yet as he walked it was as if he glided in a dream less real than that he bad experienced the previous night now he entered the funeral chamber illuminated by tall candles surrounding the bier of a man who lay upon it dressed in armour of a crude and unfamiliar design a huge broadsword almost as large as stonnbringer gripped to his chest and upon the hilt attached to his neck by a silver chainthe horn of fate olifant the mans face seen in the candlelight was strange old and yet with a youthful appearance the brow smooth and the features unlined eiric took stonnbringer in his left hand and reached out to grasp me horn he made no attempt at caution but wrenched it off rolands neck a great roar came from the heros throat immediately he had raised himself to a sitting position the sword shifting into his two hands his legs swinging off the bier his eyes widened michael moorcock as he saw eiric with the horn in bis bands and he jumped at the albino the sword duraodana whistling downwards towards eirics head he raised the shield and blocked the blow slipped the horn into his jerkin and backing away re turned stormbringer to his right hand roland was now shouting something in a language completely unfamiliar to eiric he did not bother trying to understand since tee angry tones were sufficient to ted him the knight was not suggesting a peaceful negotiation he continued defending himself with out once carrying the offensive to roland backing inch by inch down the long tunnel towards the barrows mouth ev ery time duraodana struck the chaos shield both sword and shield gave out wild notes of great intensity implacably the hero continued to press eiric backwards his broadsword whirling and striking the shield sometimes me blade with fantastic etreogth then they had broken into daylight and roland seemed momentarily blinded eirie glimpsed vivian watching them eageriy for it appeared roland was winning however m daylight and with no chance of avoiding the angered knight eiric retaliated with all me energy he had been saving until mis moment shield high sword swinging he now took the attack surprising roland who was evidently unused to this behavior on the part of an opponent stormbfinger mailed as it bit into rolands poorlyforged ar mour of iron riveted with big unsightly nails painted on the front with a dull red cross mat was a scarcely adequate insig nia for so famous a hero but there was no mistaking duran danas powers for though seemingly as crudely forged as the armour it did not lose its edge and threatened to bite through the chaos shield with every stroke eirics left arm was numb from me blows and his right arm ached lord donblas bad not lied to him when he had said that the strength of his weapons would be diminished on this world roland paused shouting something but eiric did not heed him seized his opportunity and rushed in to crush his shield against rolands body the knight reeled and staggered his word giving off a keening note eiric struck at a gap be tween rolands helmet and gorget the head sprang off the shoulders and rolled grotesquely away but no blood pumped from the jugular the eyes of the head remained open star ing at eiric vivian screamed and shouted something in the same lan stormbringer guage which roland had used eiric stepped back his face grim oh his legend his legend f she cried the only hope the people have is that roland will some day ride once more to their aid now you have slain him fiend possessed i may be he said quietly as she sobbed by the headless corpse but i was ordained by the gods to do this work ni take my leave of your drab world now have you no sorrow for the crime youve done none madam for this is only one of many such acts which fm told serve some greater purpose that i some times doubt the truth of this consolation need not concern you know you mis though i have been told that it is the fate of such as your roland and myself never to diealways to be reborn farewell and he walked away from mere passed through the olive grove and the tall stones the horn of fate cold against his heart he followed the river towards the high rock where he saw a small figure poised and when be reached it looked up at me young dwarf jennays the crooked took the horn from his jerkin and displayed h jennays chuckled so roland is dead and you eiric have left a fragment of a legend in this world if it survives well shall i escort you back to your own place aye and hurry jermays skipped down me rocks and stood beside the tall albino hmm he mused that horn could prove trou mesome to us best replace it in your jerkin and keep it cov cred by your shield eiric obeyed the dwarf and followed him down to the banks of the strangely frozen river it looked as if it should have been moving but it evidently was not jennays leapt into it and incredibly began to sink quickly follow eiric stepped in after him and for a moment stood on me frozen water before he also began to sink though the stream was shallow they continued to sink un til all similarity to water was gone and they were passing down into rich darkness that became warm and heavy scented jennays pulled at his sleeve this way and they shot off at right angles darting from side to side up and down through a maze that apparently only jermays could ace against his chest the hom seemed to heave and he michael moorcock pressed his shield to it then he blinked u he found himself in the light again staring at the great red sun throbbing in the dark blue sky his feet were on something olid he looked and uw that it was the tower of ballnezbctl for a while longer the horn heaved as if alive like a trapped bird but after some moments it became quiescent eiric lowered himself to the roof and began to edge down it until he came to the gap through which he had passed ear lier then suddenly he looked up as he heard a noise in the sky there his feet planted on air stood grinning jermays the crooked tu be passing on for i like not this worid at all he chuckled it has been a pleasure to have had a part in this goodbye sir champion remember me the unfinished one to the lords of the higher world and perhaps you could hint to them that the sooner they improve their memories or else their creative powers the sooner i shall be happy eiric said peihaps youd best be content with your lot jermays there are disadvantages to stability too jermays shrugged and vanished slowly all but spent eiric descended the fractured wafl and with great relief reached the first stair to stumble down the rest and run back to the tower of darputna with the news of his success four the three thoughtful men left the city and went down to the dragon caves on a new silver chain the horn of fate was slung around eirica neck he was dressed in black leather with his head unprotected save for a golden circlet mat kept his hair from his eyes stonnbringer scabbarded at his side the chaos shield on his back he led his companions into the grottoes to come eventually to the slumbering bulk of flame fang the dragon leader his lungs seemed to have insuffi cient capacity ashe drew air into them and grasped me horn then he glanced at his friends who regarded him expec tantly straddled his legs slightly and blew with all his strength into the hom the note sounded deep and sonorous and as it reverber ated through the caverns he felt all his vitality draining from him weaker and weaker he became until he sank to hia knees the hom still at his lips the note failing his vision dimming his limbs shaking and then he sprawled face down on the rock the hom clattering beside him moonglum dashed towards him and gasped as he saw the bulk of the leading dragon stir and one huge unblinking eye as cold as the northern wastes stare at him dyvim storm yelled jubilantly flamefangi brother flam fang you wake all about him he saw the other dragons stirring also shak ing their wings and straightening their slender necks ruffling their homy crests moonglum felt smaller than usual as the dragons wakened he began to feel nervous of me huge beasts wondering how they would respond to the presence of one who was not a dragon master then he remembered the enervated albino and knelt beside eiric touching his leatherncovered shoulder eiric dyou live eiric groaned and tried to turn over onto his back moon michael moorcock glum helped him sit upright tm weak moonglumao weak i cant rise die born took all my energy draw your swordit will supply what you need eiric shook his head ill take your advice though i doubt whether youre right this time that hero i slew must have been soulless or else his soul was wellprotected for i gained nothing from him his hand fumbled towards his hip and grasped stormbringers hilt with a tremendous effort he drew it from the scabbard and felt a faint flowing leave it and enter aim but not enough to allow him any great exertion he got up and staggered towards flamefang the monster recognised him and nutted its wings by way of welcome its hard solemn eyes seeming to warm slightly as he moved round to pat its neck he staggered and fell to one knee rising with ef fort in earlier times there had been slaves to saddle me dragons but now they would have to saddle their beasts themselves they went to the saddlestore and chose the saddles they deeded for each saddle was designed for an individual beast biric could scarcely bear the weight of flamefang s elabo rately carved saddle of wood steel jewels and precious metals he was forced to drag it across die cavern floor not wishing to embarrass him with their glances the other two ig nored bis impotent struggling and busied themselves with their own saddles the dragons must have understood that moonglum was a friend for they did not demur when he cautiously approached to dress his dragon with its high wooden saddle with silver stirrups and sheathed lancelike goad from which was draped the pennant of a noble family of melnibone now all dead when they had finished saddling their own beasts they went to help eiric who was halffalling with weariness his back leaning against flamefangs scaly body while they tied the girths dyvim slorm said will you have strength enough to lead us eiric sighed ayeenough i think for that but i know have none for the ensuing battle there must be some means of gaining vitality what of the herbs you once used those i had have lost their properties and there are no fresh ones to be found now that chaos has warped plant rock and ocean with its dreadful stamp stormbringer leaving moonglum to finish flamefangs saddling dyvim slorm went away to return with a cup of liquid which he hoped would help revivify eiric eiric drank it gave the cup back to dyvim slorm and reached up to grasp the saddle pommel hauling himself into the high saddle bring straps he ordered straps dyvim slorm frowned aye if im not secured in my saddle fll likely fan to the ground before weve flown a mile so be sat in the tall saddle and gripped the goad which bore his blue green and silver pennant gripped it in hs gauntleted hand and waited until they came with the straps and bound him firmly into place he gave a slight smile and shook the dragons halter forward flamefang lead the way for your brothers and sisters with folded wings and lowered head the dragon began to walk its slithering way to the exit behind it on two dragons almost as large sat dyvim slorm and moonghun their faces grimly concerned watchful for eiricg safety as flamefang moved with rolling gait through the series of caverns its fel low beasts fell in behind it until all of them had reached the great mouth of the last cave which overlooked the threshing sea the sun was still in its position overhead scarlet and swollen seeming to swell in rhythm with the movement of the sea voicing a shout that was halfhiss halfyell eiric lapped at flamefangs neck with his goad up flamefaogt up for melnibone and vengeancef as if sensing the strangeness of the world flamefang paused on me brink of the ledge shaking his head and snort ing to himself then as he launched into the air his wings began to beat their fantastic spread flapping with slow grace but bearing the beast along with marvellous speed up up beneath die swollen sun up into me hot turbulent air up towards the east where ac camps of hell were wait ing and in flamefangs wake came its two brotherdragons bearing moonglum and dyvim slorm who had a horn of his own the one used to direct the dragons ninetyfive other dragons males and females darkened the deep blue sky all green red and gold scales clashing and flashing wings beating and in concert sounding like the throbbing of a mil lion drums as they flew over the unclean waters with gaping jaws and cold cold eyes though beneath him now eiric saw with blurring eyes michael moorcock many colours of immense richness they were ah darfc and changing constantly shifting from one extreme of a dark spectrum to the other it was not water down mere bowit was a fluid comprised of materials born natural and supernat ural real and abstract pain longing misery and laughter could be seen as tangible fragments of me tossing tide pas sions and frustrations lay in it also as wcd as stuff made of living flesh mat bubbled on occasions to the surface in his weakened condition me sight of me fluid sickened eiric and he turned his red eyes upwards and towards the east as the dragons moved swiftly on their course soon they were flying across what bad once been the main land of me eastern continent me major vilmirian peninsula but now it was bereft of its earlier qualities and huge columns of dark mist rose into the air so that they wen forced to guide their reptilian steeds among them lava streamed bubbling on the faraway ground disgusting shapes flitted over land and air monstrous beasts and me oc casional group of weird riders on skeletal horses who looked up when they heard the beat of the dragon wings and rode in frantic fear towards their camps the worid seemed a dead corpse given life in corruption by virtue of the vermin which fed upon it of mankind nothing was left save for the three mounted on the dragons eiric knew that jagreen lera and his human allies had longsince forsaken their humanity and could no longer claim kinship with the species their hordes had swept from the worid the leaders alone might retain their human shape the dark lords don it but their souls were warped just as the bodies of their followers had become warped into hellshapes due to the transmuting influence of chao ah the dark pow ers of chaos lay upon the world yet deeper and deeper into its heart went the dragon flight with eiric swaying in his saddle and only stopped from falling by the straps that bound his body from the lands below there seemed to rise an aching shriek as tortured nature was defied and its com ponents forced into alien forms onward they sped towards what had once been kariaak by the weeping waste and which was now the camp of chaos then from above they heard a cawing yell and saw black shapes dropping down on them eiric had not even strength to cry out but weakly tapped flamefangs neck and stormbringer i made the beast veer away from the danger moonglum and dyvim slorm followed his example and dyvim slorm sound ed his born ordering the dragons not to engage the attackers but some of the dragons in me rear were too late and were forced to turn aod battle with the black phantoms ehic looked behind him and for a few seconds saw them outlined against the sky rending things with the jaws of whales locked in combat with me dragons that shot their flaming venom at them and tore at mem with teeth and claws wings flapping as they strove to hold their height but then another wave of dark green mist spread across his field of vision and he did not see the fate that befell the dozen dragons now eiric signalled plamefang to fly low over a small army of riders fleeing through the tormented land the eight arrowed standard of chaos flapping from the leaders encrust ed lance down they went and loosed weir venom having the satisfaction of seeing the beasts and riders scream bum and perish their ashes absorbed into the shifting ground here and there now they saw a gigantic castle newly raised by sorcerer perhaps as a reward to some traitor king who had aided jagreen lem perhaps as the keeps of the captains of chaos who now that chaos ruled were establish ing themselves on earth they swept down on them released their venom and left them burning with unnatural fires the gouting smoke blending with me shredding mist and at last eiric saw the camp of chaosa city but recently made in the same manner as the castles the flaring sign of chaos hanging amber in the sky overhead yet he felt no elation only despair that he was so weak be would not have the strength to meet his enemy jagreen lem in combat what could he do how could strength be foundfor even if he took no part in the fighting he must have sufficient vitality to blow the horn a second time and summon the white lords to earth the city seemed peculiarly silent as if it waited or prepared for something it had an ominous atmosphere and eiric be fore flamefang crossed the perimeter made his dragon steed turn and circle dyvim slorm and moonglum and the rest of the dragon flight followed his example and dyvim slorm called across the air to him what now eiric i had not expected a city to be here so soon michael moorcock neither had l but look he pointed with a trembling band he could hardly lift theres jagreen lerns merman standard and there now he pointed to the left and right the standards of a score of the dukes of hell yet i see no other human standards moonglum shouted those castles we destroyed i suspect that jagreen lern had already divided up these sundered lands and given them to his hirelings how can we tell how much time has really passedtime in which an this could have been brought about t uc brie nodded looking up at the still sun he lurched forward in his saddle halfswooning pulled himself upright breathing heavily the chaos shield seemed like a huge weight on his arm but be held it warily before him then be acted on impulse and goaded flamefang into speed so that me dragon rushed towards me city diving down towards me castle of jagreen lem nothing sought to stop him and he landed me beast among me turrets of the castle silence was dominant he looked around puzzled but could see nothing save the towering buildings of dark stone that seemed to ooze beneath flame fangs feet the straps stopped him from dismounting but he saw enough to be sure the city was deserted where was me horde of hed where was jagreen lern dyvim storm and moonglum came to join him while the rest of the dragons circled above qaws scratched on rock wings slashed the air and they settled turning their mighty heads this way and that ruffling their scales restlessly for once aroused from their dumber me dragons preferred the airtotbeland dyvim slorm stayed but long enough to mutter ni scout the city and then was flying away again low amongst the castles until they heard him cry out and saw him swoop out of sight there came a yeu but they could not see what caused it a pause and then dyvim slorms dragon was flap ping up again and they saw he had a writhing prisoner slung over the front of his saddle he landed the thing he had captured bore resemblance to a human being but was mis shapen and ugly vim a jutting underiip low forehead and no chin huge square uneven teeth bristled in its mouth and its bare arms were covered in waving hairs where are your masters dyvim slorm demanded the stormbringer thing seemed to possess no fear but chuckled they predicted your coming and since the city limits movement have assembled their armies on a plateau they have made five miles to the northeast it turned its dilated eyes to eiric jagreen lern sent greetings and said he anticipated your foolish downfall eiric shrugged dyvim slorm drew his own runeblade and hacked the creature down it cackled as it died for its sanity had fled with its fear he shivered as the things soulstuff blended with his own and passed extra energy to him then he cursed and looked at eiric with pain in his eyes i acted in hastei should have given him to you eiric said nothing to mis but whispered in his failing voice lets to their battlefield hurry up to join their flight they went again into me rushing populated air and towards me northeast it was with astonishment that they sighted jagreen lerns horde for they could not understand how it could have man aged to regroup itself so swiftly every fiend and warrior on earth seemed to have come to fight under the theocrats standard it dung like a vile disease to me undulating plain and around it clouds grew darker even though lightning obviously of supernatural origin blossomed and shouted crisscrossing the plain into this noisy agitation swept me dragonflight and they recognised the force commanded by jagreen lern himself for his banner flew above it other divisions were commanded by dukes of hellmalohin zhortra xiombarg and others also eiric noted the three mightiest lords of chaos dwarfing me rest charoros the reaper with his great head and his curving scythe mabelode me faceless with his face always in shadow no matter which way you looked at h and siortar me old slim and beautiful reputed me oldest of the gods this was a force which a thousand powerful sorcerers would find it bard to defend against and me thought of attacking mem seemed folly eiric did not bother to consider this for he had embarked on his plan and was committed to carrying it through even though in his present condition be was bound to destroy himself if he continued they had the advantage of attacking from the air but this would only be of value while me dragons venom lasted michael moorcock when it gave out they must go in closer at that moment el ric would need much energyand he had none down swept the dragons shooting their incendiary venom into the ranks of chaos normally no army could stand against such an attack but protected by sorcery chaos was able to turn much of the fiery venom aside the venom seemed to spread against an invisible shield and dissipate some of it struck its target however and hundreds of warriors were engulfed in flame and died blazing again and again the dragons rose and dived upon their en emies brie swaying almost unconscious in his saddle his awareness of what was going on diminishing with every at tack his dimming vision was further encumbered by the stink ing smoke mat had begun to rise off the battlefield from the horde huge lances were rising with seeming slowness lances of chaos like streaks of amber lightning striking at me drag ons so that the beasts hit bellowed and burtlod dead to the ground closer and closer eirics steed bore him until be was flying over the division commanded by jagreen urn himself he caught a misty glimpse of the theocrat sitting a repulsive hairless horse and waving his sword convulsed with mocking mirth he faintly beard his enemys voice drift up to him farewell briethis is our last encounter for today you go to limbo brie turned flamefaag about and whispered into his ear that one brotherthat one with a roar plamefang loosed his venom at me laughing tbeocral it seemed to eiric that jagreen lern must surely be burned to ashes but just as the venom seemed to touch him it was buried back and only a few drops struck some of the theocrats retainers igniting their flesh and clothing stiu jagreen lern laughed and now he released an amber spear which had appeared in his hand straight towards eiric it went and with difficulty the albino put up his chaos shield to deflect it so great was the force of the bolt striking his shield that he was buried backwards in his saddle and one of the straps se curing him snapped so that he fen to the left and was only saved by the other strap that had held now he crouched be hind the shields protection as it was battered with supernatu ral weapons flamefang too was encompassed by the shields stormfimnger great power but how long would even me chaos shield resist mch an attack it seemed mat he was forced to use me shield for an infi nite time before flamefangs wings cracked me air like ships and he was rushing high above me horde he was dying minute by minute me vitality was leaving him as if he were an old man ready for death i cannot die be mut tered i must not die is mere no escape from this dilemma flamefang seemed to hear him the dragon descended towards me ground again and dropped until its scaly belly was scraping the lances of me horde then flamefang had landed on the unstable ground and waited with folded wings as a group of warriors goaded their beasts towards him eiric gasped what have you done flamefang is nothing dependable you have delivered me into me hands of the en emy with great effort he drew bis sword as the first lance struck his shield and me rider passed grinning sensing eirics weakness others came on both sides weakly he slashed at one and stormbringer suddenly took control to make his aim true the riders arm was pierced and he was locked to the blade as h fed greedily upon his lifestuff immediately ei ric felt some slight return of strength and realised that be tween them dragon and sword were helping him gain the energy be needed but the blade kept the most part to itself there was a reason for this as eiric found out at once for the sword continued to direct bis arm several more riders were slain in this manner and eiric grinned as he felt the vi tality flowing back into his body his vision cleared his reac tions became normal his spirits rose now he carried the attack to the rest of me division flamefang moving over the ground with a speed belying his bulk the warriors scattered and fled back to rejoin the main force but eiric no longer cared he had me souls of a dozen of them and it was enough now up flamefang rise and let us seek out more powerful enemies obediently flamefang spread his wings they began to flap and bear him off me ground until be was gliding low over the horde in the midst of lord xiombargs division eiric landed again dismounted from flamefang and possessed of his su michael moorcock pernatural energy rushed into the ranks of fiendish warriors hewing about him invulnerable to all but the strongest attack of chaos vitality mounted and a kind of battlemadness with it further and further into the ranks he sliced his way until he saw lord xiombarg in his earthly guise of a slender darkhaired woman eiric knew that the womans shape was no indication of xiombargs mighty strength but without fear he leapt forwards the duke of hell and stood before him looking up at where he sat on his lionheaded bull bodied mount xiombargs girls voice came sweetly to eirics ears mor tal you have defied many dukes of hell and banished others back to the higher worlds they call you godslayer now so ive heard can you slay me you know that no mortal can slay one of the lords of the higher worlds whether they be of law or chaos xiom bargbut he can if equipped with sufficient power destroy their earthly semblance and send them back to their own plane never to return can you do this to me let us see eiric flung himself towards the dark lord xiombarg was armed with a longshafted battleaxe that gave off a nightblue radiance as his steed reared he swung the axe down at eirics unprotected head the albino flung up bis shield and the axe struck h a kind of metallic shout came from the weapons and huge sparks flew away eiric moved in close and hacked at one of xiombargs feminine legs a light moved down from his hips and protected the leg so that stormbringer was brought to a stop jarring eirics arm again the axe struck the shield with the same effect as before again eiric tried to pierce xiombargs unholy de fence and all the while he heard the dark lords laughter sweetly modulated yet as horrible as a hags your mockery of human shape and human beauty begins to fail my lord cried eiric standing back for a moment to gather his strength already the giris face was writhing and changing as dis concerted by eirics power the duke of hell spurred bis beast down on the albino eiric dodged aside and struck again this time storm bringer throbbed in his hand as it pierced xiombargs de fence and the dark lord moaned retaliating with another ctormbringer axeblow which eiric barely succeeded in blocking he turned his beast the axe rushing about his head as be whirled it and flung it at eiric with the intention of striking him in the head eiric ducked and put up bis shield the axe clipping it and foiling to the shifting ground he ran after xiombarg who was once again turning his steed from nowhere he had pro duced another weapon a huge doublehanded broadsword the breadth of its blade triple that of even stonnbringers it seemed incongruous in the small delicate hands of the girlshape and its size eiric guessed told something of its power he backed away warily noting absently that one of the dark lords legs was missing and replaced by an insect like mandible if be could only destroy the rest of xiombargs disguise he would have succeeded in banishing him now xiombargs laughter was no longer sweet but had an unhinged note the lionhead roared in unison with its mas ters voice as it rushed towards eiric the monstrous sword went up and crashed upon the chaos shield eiric fell on his back feeling the ground itch and crawl beneath him but me shield was still in one piece he caught sight of the bull hooves pounding down on him drew himself beneath the shield leaving only his swordarm free as the beast thun dered above seeking to crush him with its hooves he thrust upwards into its belly the sword was initially halted and then seemed to pierce through whatever obstructed it and draw out the lifeforce the vitality of the unholy beast passed from sword to man and eiric was taken aback by its strange insensate quality for the soulstuff of an animal was different from that of an intelligent protagonist he rolled from under me beasts bulk and sprang to his feet as the lionbull collapsed hurling xiombargs stillearthly shape to the ground instantly the dark lord was up standing with a peculiarly unbalanced stance with one leg human and the other alien it limped swiftly towards eiric bringing me huge sword round in a sideways movement that would slice eiric in two but ei ric full of the energy gained from xiombargs steed leapt back from the blow and struck at the sword with storm bringer the two blades met but neither gave stormbringer shrieked in anger for it was unused to resistance of this kind eiric got the rim of his shield under the blade and forced it up for an instant xiombargs guard was open and eiric micfwel moorcock used that instant with effect driving stonnbringer into the dark lords breast with all his strength xiombarg whimpered and at once his earthly shape began to dissolve as elric s sword sucked his energy into itself eiric knew that this energy was only that fraction constituting xiombargs lifeforce on this plane that the maysr part of the dark lords soid was still in the higher worlds for not even the most powerful of these godlmgs could summon the power to transport all of himself to the earth if eiric had taken ev ery scrap of xiombargs soul his own body could not have retained it but would have burst however so much more powerful than any human soul was the force sowing into him from the wound he had made that he was once again the vessel for a mighty energy xiombarg changed he became little more than a flickering coil of coloured light which began to drift away and finally vanish as xjombarg was swept raging back to his own plane eiric looked upwards he was horrified to see that only a few of the dragons survived one was fluttering down now and it had a rider on its back from that distance he could not see which of his friends it was he began to run towards the place where it fell he heard the crash as it came to ground heard a weird vailing a bubbling cry and then nothing he battled his way through the milling warriors of chaos and none could withstand him until he came at last to the fallen dragon there was a broken body lying on the ground beside it but of the ruoeblade there was no sign it had van ished it was the body of dyvim slonn last of his kinsmen there was no time for mourning eiric and moonglum and the bare score of remaining dragons could not possibly win against jagrecn lems strength which had been hardly touched by the attack standing over the body of bis cousin be placed the horn of fate to his lips took a huge breath and blew the clear melancholy note of the horn rang out over the battlefield and seemed to carry in all directions through all the dimensions of the cosmos through all the myriad planes and existences through all eternity to the ends of the universe and the ends of time itself stormbringer the note took long moments to fade and when it had at last died away there was an absolute hush over the world the muling millions were still there was an air of expectancy and then the white lords came five it was as if some enormous sun thousands of times larger than earths had sent a ray of light pulsing through the cos mos defying the flimsy barriers of time and space to strike upon that great black battlefield and along it appearing on the pathway that the horns weird power had created for them strode the majestic lords of law their earthly forms so beautiful that they challenged elites sanity for his mind could scarcely absorb the sight they disdained to ride like the lords of chaos on bizarre beasts but moved without steeds a magnificent assembly with their mirrorclear armour and rippling surcoats bearing the single arrow of law leading them came donblas die justice maker a smile upon his perfect ups he carried a slender sword in his right hand a sword that was straight and sharp and like a beam of light itself eiric moved swiftly then rushed to where flamefang awaited him and urged the great reptile into the moaning air flamefang moved with less ease than earlier but eiric did not know whether it was because the beast was tired or whether the influence of law was weighing on toe dragon which was after all a creation of chaos but at last be flew beside moonglum and looking around saw that the remaining dragons had turned and were flying back to the west only their own steeds remained perhaps the last of the dragons had sensed their part played and were returning to the dragon caves to sleep again eiric and moongkun exchanged glances but said nothing for the sight below was too awe inspiring to speak of a light white and damling spread from the midst of the lords of law the beam upon which they had come faded and they began to move towards the cpot where chardros the reaper mabelode the faceless and slortar the old and the stormbringer lesser lords of chaos had assembled themselves ready for the great fight as the white lords passed through the other denizens of hell and the polluted men who were their comrades these creatures backed away screaming falling where the radiance touched them the dross was being cleaned away without ef fortbut the real strength in the shape of the dukes of hell and jagreen lem was still to be encountered though at this stage the lords of law were scarcely taller than the human beings they seemed to dwarf them and even eiric high above felt as if h were a tiny figure scarcely larger than a fly it was not their size so much as the implica tion of vastness which they seemed to carry with them flamefangs wings beat wearily as he circled over the scene ah around him the dark colours were now full of clouds of lighter softer shades the lords of law reached the spot where their ancient en emies were assembled and eiric heard lord donblass voice carry up to him you of chaos have defied the edict of the cosmic bal ance and sought complete dominance of this planet destiny denies you thisfor the earths life is over and it must be resurrected in a new form where your influence will be weak a sweet mocking voice came from the ranks of chaos it was the voice of slortar the old you presume too much brother the fate of the earth has not yet been finally de cided our meeting will result in that decisionnothing else if we win chaos shall rule if you succeed in banishing us then paltry law bereft of possibility will gain ascendancy but we shall winthough fate herself complainsi then let this thing be settled replied lord donblas and eiric saw the shining lords of law advance towards their dark opponents the very sky shook as they clashed the air cried out and the earth appeared to tilt those lesser beings left alive scat tered away from the conflict and a sound like a million throbbing harpstrings each of a subtly variated pitch began to emanate from the warring gods eiric saw jagreen lern leave the ranks of the dukes of hell and ride in his flaming scarlet armour away from them he realised perhaps that his impertinence would be swiftly rewarded by death michael soorcock brie sent plamefang soaring down and he drew storm bringer yelling the theocrats name and shouting challenges jagreen lero looked up but be did not laugh tbia time he increased hb speed until as eric had already noted he saw towards what he was riding ahead the earth had turned to black and purple gas that danced frenetically as if seeking to free itself from the rest of the atmosphere jagreen lcm halted bis hairless horse and drew his wbmxc from his belt he raised his flamered buckler which like eirics was treated against sorceraus weapons the dragon hurtled groundwards making erie gasp with the speed of its descent it flapped to earth a few yards from where jagreen lem sat his horrible horse waiting philosoph ically for eiric to attack perhaps be sensed that their fight would mirror the larger fight going on around mem that the outcome of me one would be reflected in the outcome of the other whatever it was he did not indulge in his usual brag gadocio but waited in silence careless whether jagreen lem had the advantage or not eiric dismounted and spoke to fiamefang in a purring mur mur back flamefang now back with your brothers what ever cornea to pass if i win or lose your part is over as fiamefang stirred and turned his huge head to look into ei rics face another dragon descended and landed a short dis tance away moonglum too dismounted beginning to advance through the black and purple mist eiric shouted to him i want no help in this moongiumf til give you none but it will be my pleasure to see you take his life and soul i eiric looked at jagreen lem whose face was still impas sive flamefang s wings beat and he swept up into me sky and was soon gone the other dragon following he would not re turn eiric stalked towards the theocrat his shield high aod his sword ready then with astonishment he saw jagreen lern dismount from his own grotesque mount and slap its hairiess rump to send it galloping away he stood waiting slightly crouched in a position which emphasised his highshouldered stance his long dark face was taut and his eyes fixed on ei ric as the albino came closer an unstable smile of antici pation quivered on the theocrats ups and his eyes flickered stormbringer eiric paused just before he came within swordreach of his enemy jagreen lern are you ready to pay for the crimes youve committed against me and the world pay crimes you surprise me eiric for i see you have fully absorbed the carping attitude of your new allies in my conquests i have found it necessary to eliminate a few of your friends who sought to stop me but that was to be ex pected i did what i had to and what i intendedif i have fafled now i have no regret for regret is a fools emotion and useless in any capacity what happened to your wife was no direct fault of mine will you have triumph if you slay me eiric shook his head my perspectives have indeed changed jagreen lem yet we of melnibone were ever a vengeful broodand vengeance is what i claimi ah now i understand you jagreen lem changed his stance and he raised his axe to the defensive position i am ready eiric leapt at him stormbringer shrieking through the air to crash against the scariet buckler and crash again three blows he delivered before jagreen lerns axe sought to wriggle through his defence and he halted it by a sideways movement of the chaos shield the axe succeeded only in grazing his arm near the shoulder eirics shield clanged against jagreen leras and eiric attempted to exert his weight and push the theocrat backwards meanwhile stabbing around ae rims of the locked shields and trying to penetrate jagreen lem s guard for some moments they remained in this position while the music of the battle sounded around them and the ground seemed to fall from under them columns of blossoming colours erupting like magical plants on all sides then jagreen lem jumped back slashing at eiric the albino rushed forward ducked and struck at the theocrats leg near the kneeand missed from above the axe dashed down and be flung himself to one side to avoid it carried offbalance by the force of the blow jagreen lern staggered and eiric leapt up and kicked at the small of the theocrafs back the man fell sprawling losing bis grip on both axe and shield as be tried to do many things at once and failed to do anything ehic put his heel on the theocrats neck and held him there stonnbringer hovering greedily over his prone enemy jagreen lem heaved his body round so that he looked up michael moorcock at eiric he was suddenly pale and his eyes were fixed on the black hcllblade when he spoke hoarsely to eiric finish me now theres no place for my soul in all eternitynot any more i must go to limboso finish met brie was about to allow stonnbringer to plunge itself into the defeated theocrat when he stayed the weapon holding it back from its prey with difficulty the nmesword murmured in frustration and tugged in his hand no he said slowly i want doming of yours jagreen lem i would not pollute my being by feeding off your soul moooglumi his friend ran up moonglum hand me your blade silently the little easflaoder obeyed eiric sheathed the resisting stonnbringer saying to ft therehats the first time ive stopped you from feeding what will you do now i wonder then he took moonglums blade and slashed it across jagreen lcras cheek opening it up in a long deep cut which began slowly to fill with blood the theocrat screamed no eirictffl me with an absent smile eiric slashed the other cheek his bloody face contorted jagreen lern shouted for death but eiric continued to smile his vague halfaware smile and said softly you sought to imitate the emperors of melnibooe did you not you mocked eiric of that line you torturedhim and you abducted his wife you moulded her body into a hellshape as you moulded the rest of the world you slew el rics friends and challenged him in your impertinence but you are nothingyou are more of a pawn than eiric ever was now little roan know how the folk of melnibone toyed with such upstarts in the days when they ruled the woridf jagreen lern took an hour to die and only then because moooglum begged eiric to finish him swiftly eiric handed moonglums tainted sword back to him after wiping it on a shred of fabric that had been part of the theo crats robe he looked down at the mutilated body and stirred it with his foot then he looked away to where the lords of the higher worlds were embattled he was badly weakened from the fight and also from the energy he had been forced to exert to return the resisting stonnbringer to its sheath but this was forgotten as he stared in wonder at the gigantic battle both the lords of law and those of chaos had become stormbringer huge and misty as their earthly mass diminished and they continued to fight in human shape they were like halfreal giants fighting everwhere nowon the land and above it far away on the rim of the horizon he saw donblas the jus tice maker engaged with chardros the reaper their outlines flickering and spreading the slim sword daring and the great scythe sweeping unable to participate unsure which side was winning ei ric and moonglum watched as the intensity of the battle in creased and with it the slow dissolution of the gods earthly manifestation the fight was no longer merely on the earth but seemed to be raging throughout all the planes of the cos mos and as if in unison with this transformation the earth appeared to be losing its form until eiric and moonglum drifted in the mingled swiri of air fire earth and water the earth dissolvedyet still the lords of the higher worlds battled over it the stuff of the earth alone remained but unformed its components were still in existence but their new shape was undecided the fight continued the victors would have the privilege of reforming the earth six at last though eiric did not know how the turbulent dart gave way to light and there came a noisea cosmic roar of hate and frustrationand he knew that the lords of chaos had been defeated and banished the lords of law victori ous fates plan had been achieved though it still required the last note of the hom to bring it to its required conclusion and eiric realised be did not have the strength left to blow the hom the third time about the two friends the worid was taking on a distinct shape again they found they were standing on a rocky plain and in the distance were the slender peaks of newformed mountains purple against a mellow sky then the earth began to move faster and faster it whirled day giving way to night with incredible rapidity and then it began to slow until the sun was again all but motionless in the sky moving with something like its customary speed the change had taken place law ruled here now yet the lords of law had departed without thanks and though law ruled it could not progress until the horn was blown for the last time so it is over moonglum murmured all goneelwher my birthplace karlaak by the weeping waste bakshaan even the dreaming city and the isle of melnibone they no longer exist they cannot be retrieved and this is the new worid formed by law it looks much the same as the old eiric too was filled with a sense of loss knowing that all the places that were familiar to him even the very continents were gone and replaced by different ones it was like the loss of childhood and perhaps that was what it wasthe passing of the earths childhood he shrugged away the thought and smiled tm supposed to blow the hom for the final time if me earths new life is to begin yet i havent the strength pcrhapi fate la to be thwarted after all moonglum looked at him strangely i hope not friend eiric sighed we are the last two left moongtum you and l it n fittmg that even the mighty events that have taken place have not burned our friendship have not separated w you are the only friead whose company has not worn on me the only one i have trusted moonghnn grinned a shadow of his old cocky grin and where weve shared adventures ive usually profited if you have not the partnership has been complementary i shall never know why i chose to share your destiny perhaps ft was no doing of mine but fates for there n one final act of friendship i can perform eiric was about to question moonglum when a quiet voice came from behind him i bear two messages one of thanks from me lords of lawand another from a more powerful entity sepirizf eiric turned to face his mentor wen are yon satisfied with my work ayegreatly sepirizs face was sad and he stared at ei ric with a look of profound sympathy you have succeeded in everything but the last act which is to blow the horn of fate for the thud time because of you me world shall know progression and its new people shall have me opportunity to advance by degrees to a new state of being but what is the meaning of it all eiric said that have never fully understood who can who can know wfay me cosmic balance exists why fate exists and the lords of the higher worlds why mere must always be a champion to fight such battles there seems to be an infinity of space and time and possibilities there may be an infinite number of beings one above me other who see the final purpose though in infinity there can be no final purpose perhaps all is cyclic and this same event win occur again and again until the universe is run down and fades away as me worid we knew has faded meaning eiric do not seek that for madness lies in such a course no meaning no pattern then why have i suffered au a perhaps even the gods seek meaning and pattern and this is merely one attempt to find it look he waved his hands to indicate the newlyformed earth all this is fresh and michael moorcock moulded by logic perhaps the logic wiu control the new comers perhaps a factor will occur to destroy that logic the gods experiment the cosmic balance guides the destinyof the earth men struggle and credit the gods with knowing why they strugglebut do the gods know you disturb me further when i had hoped to be com forted he sighed i have lost wife and woridand do not know why i am sony i have come to wish you farewell nay friend do what you must aye shall i see you again no for we are both truly dead our age has gone sepiriz seemed to twist in the air and disappear a cold silence remained at length eirics thoughts were interrupted by moonghnn you must blow the horn eiric whether ft means nothing or muchyou must mow it and finish this business forever how i have scarcely enough strength to stand on my feet i have decided what you roust do slay roe with stonnbringer take my soul and vitality into yourselfthen you will have sufficient power to blow the last blast kill you moonglumi the only one leftmy only true friend you babble i mean it you must for there is nothing else to do fur ther we have no place here and roust die soon at any rate you told me how zarozinia gave you her soulweu take minetool i cannot moooglum paced towards him and reached down to grip stormbmgers hilt pulling it halfway from the sheath wo moonglum but now the sword sprang from the sheath on its own voli tion eiric struck moonglums hand away and gripped the hilt he could not stop it the sword rose up dragging his arm with it poised to deliver a blow moonglum stood with his arms by bis side his face ex pressionless though eiric thought be glimpsed a flicker of fear in the eyes he struggled to control the blade but knew it was impossible let it do its work eiric the blade plunged forward and pierced moonglums heart stormbringer his blood sprang out and covered it his eyes blurred and filled with horror ah noihadnotexpected thisi petrified eiric could not tug the sword from his friends heart moongluros energy began to flow up its length and course into his body yet even when all the little eastlanders vitality was absorbed eiric remained staring at the small corpse untfl the tears flowed from his crimson eyes and a great sob racked him then the blade came free he flung it away from him and it did not clatter on die rocky ground but landed as a body might land then it seemed to move towards him and stop and be had the suspi cion mat it was watching him he took the hom and put it to his ups he blew the blast to herald in the night of the new earth the night that would precede the new dawn and though the horns note was tri umphant eiric was not he stood full of infinite loneliness and infinite sorrow his head tilted back as me sound rang on and when the note faded from triumph to a dying echo that expressed something of eirics misery a huge outline began to form in the sky above the earth as if summoned by the hom it was the outline of a gigantic hand holding a balance and as he watched the balance began to right itself until each side was true and somehow this relieved eirics sorrow as he released his grip on the horn of fate there is something at least he said and if ifs an illu sion then its a reassuring one he turned his head to one side and saw the blade leave the ground sweep into the air and then rush down on him stonnbringer be cried and then the helsword struck his chest he felt the icy touch of the blade against bis heart reached out his fingers to clutch at ft felt his body constrict felt it sucking his soul from me very depths of his being felt his whole personality being drawn into the nmesword he knew as his life faded to combine with the swords that it had always been his destiny to die in this manner with the blade he had killed friends and lovers stolen their souls to feed his own waning strength it was as if the sword had al ways used him to this end as if he was merely a manifesta tion of stonnbringer and was now being taken back into the body of the blade which had never been a true sword and as he died he wept again for be knew that the fraction of michael moorcock the swords soul which was his would never know rest but was doomed to immortality to eternal struggle eiric of melnibone last of the bright emperors cried out and then his body collapsed a sprawled husk beside its com rade and he lay beneath the mighty balance that still hung in the sky then stormbringers shape began to change writhing and curling above the body of the albino finally to stand astrad dle it the entity that was stonnbringer last manifestation of chaos which would remain with this new worid as it grew looked down on the corpse of brie of melnibon and smiled farewell friend i was a thousand times more evil than thou and then it leapt from the earth and went spearing up wards its wild voice laughing mockery at the cosmic bal ance filling the universe with its unholy joy the end of the saga of eiric of melmbone about the author born in london in michael moorcock
