 fenchurch street mystery baroness orczy chapter i the fenchurch street mystery chapter ii a millionaire in the dock chapter iii his deduction chapter i the fenchurch street mystery the man in the corner pushed aside his glass and leant across the table mysteries he commented there is no such thing as a mystery in connection with any crime provided intelligence is brought to bear upon its investigation very much astonished polly burton looked over the top of her newspaper and fixed a pair of very severe coldly inquiring brown eyes upon him she had disapproved of the man from the instant when he shuffled across the shop and sat down opposite to her at the same marbletopped table which already held her large coffee her roll and butter and plate of tongue now this particular corner this very same table that special view of the magnificent marble hallknown as the norfolk street branch of the aлrated bread companys depфtswere pollys own corner table and view here she had partaken of eleven pennyworth of luncheon and one pennyworth of daily information ever since that glorious nevertobeforgotten day when she was enrolled on the staff of the evening observer and became a member of that illustrious and worldfamed organization known as the british press she was a personality was miss burton of the evening observer her cards were printed thus miss mary j burton evening observer she had interviewed miss ellen terry and the bishop of madagascar mr seymour hicks and the chief commissioner of police she had been present at the last marlborough house garden partyin the cloakroom that is to say where she caught sight of lady thingummys hat miss whatyoumaycalls sunshade and of various other things modistical or fashionable all of which were duly described under the heading royalty and dress in the early afternoon edition of the evening observer the article itself is signed m j b and is to be found in the files of that leading halfpennyworth for these reasonsand for various others toopolly felt irate with the man in the corner and told him so with her eyes as plainly as any pair of brown eyes can speak she had been reading an article in the daily telegraph the article was palpitatingly interesting had polly been commenting audibly upon it certain it is that the man over there had spoken in direct answer to her thoughts she looked at him and frowned the next moment she smiled miss burton of the evening observer had a keen sense of humour which two years association with the british press had not succeeded in destroying and the appearance of the man was sufficient to tickle the most ultramorose fancy polly thought to herself that she had never seen any one so pale so thin with such funny lightcoloured hair brushed very smoothly across the top of a very obviously bald crown he looked so timid and nervous as he fidgeted incessantly with a piece of string his long lean and trembling fingers tying and untying it into knots of wonderful and complicated proportions having carefully studied every detail of the quaint personality polly felt more amiable and yet she remarked kindly but authoritatively this article in an otherwise wellinformed journal will tell you that even within the last year no fewer than six crimes have completely baffled the police and the perpetrators of them are still at large pardon me he said gently i never for a moment ventured to suggest that there were no mysteries to the police i merely remarked that there were none where intelligence was brought to bear upon the investigation of crime not even in the fenchurch street mystery i suppose she asked sarcastically least of all in the socalled fenchurch street mystery he replied quietly now the fenchurch street mystery as that extraordinary crime had popularly been called had puzzledas polly well knewthe brains of every thinking man and woman for the last twelve months it had puzzled her not inconsiderably she had been interested fascinated she had studied the case formed her own theories thought about it all often and often had even written one or two letters to the press on the subjectsuggesting arguing hinting at possibilities and probabilities adducing proofs which other amateur detectives were equally ready to refute the attitude of that timid man in the corner therefore was peculiarly exasperating and she retorted with sarcasm destined to completely annihilate her selfcomplacent interlocutor what a pity it is in that case that you do not offer your priceless services to our misguided though wellmeaning police isnt it he replied with perfect goodhumour well you know for one thing i doubt if they would accept them and in the second place my inclinations and my duty wouldwere i to become an active member of the detective forcenearly always be in direct conflict as often as not my sympathies go to the criminal who is clever and astute enough to lead our entire police force by the nose i dont know how much of the case you remember he went on quietly it certainly at first began even to puzzle me on the th of last december a woman poorly dressed but with an unmistakable air of having seen better days gave information at scotland yard of the disappearance of her husband william kershaw of no occupation and apparently of no fixed abode she was accompanied by a frienda fat oilylooking germanand between them they told a tale which set the police immediately on the move it appears that on the th of december at about three oclock in the afternoon karl mьller the german called on his friend william kershaw for the purpose of collecting a small debtsome ten pounds or sowhich the latter owed him on arriving at the squalid lodging in charlotte street fitzroy square he found william kershaw in a wild state of excitement and his wife in tears mьller attempted to state the object of his visit but kershaw with wild gestures waved him aside andin his own wordsflabbergasted him by asking him pointblank for another loan of two pounds which sum he declared would be the means of a speedy fortune for himself and the friend who would help him in his need after a quarter of an hour spent in obscure hints kershaw finding the cautious german obdurate decided to let him into the secret plan which he averred would place thousands into their hands instinctively polly had put down her paper the mild stranger with his nervous air and timid watery eyes had a peculiar way of telling his tale which somehow fascinated her i dont know he resumed if you remember the story which the german told to the police and which was corroborated in every detail by the wife or widow briefly it was this some thirty years previously kershaw then twenty years of age and a medical student at one of the london hospitals had a chum named barker with whom he roomed together with another the latter so it appears brought home one evening a very considerable sum of money which he had won on the turf and the following morning he was found murdered in his bed kershaw fortunately for himself was able to prove a conclusive alibi he had spent the night on duty at the hospital as for barker he had disappeared that is to say as far as the police were concerned but not as far as the watchful eyes of his friend kershaw were able to spyat least so the latter said barker very cleverly contrived to get away out of the country and after sundry vicissitudes finally settled down at vladivostok in eastern siberia where under the assumed name of smethurst he built up an enormous fortune by trading in furs now mind you every one knows smethurst the siberian millionaire kershaws story that he had once been called barker and had committed a murder thirty years ago was never proved was it i am merely telling you what kershaw said to his friend the german and to his wife on that memorable afternoon of december the th according to him smethurst had made one gigantic mistake in his clever careerhe had on four occasions written to his late friend william kershaw two of these letters had no bearing on the case since they were written more than twentyfive years ago and kershaw moreover had lost themso he saidlong ago according to him however the first of these letters was written when smethurst alias barker had spent all the money he had obtained from the crime and found himself destitute in new york kershaw then in fairly prosperous circumstances sent him a ј note for the sake of old times the second when the tables had turned and kershaw had begun to go downhill smethurst as he then already called himself sent his whilom friend ј after that as mьller gathered kershaw had made sundry demands on smethursts everincreasing purse and had accompanied these demands by various threats which considering the distant country in which the millionaire lived were worse than futile but now the climax had come and kershaw after a final moment of hesitation handed over to his german friend the two last letters purporting to have been written by smethurst and which if you remember played such an important part in the mysterious story of this extraordinary crime i have a copy of both these letters here added the man in the corner as he took out a piece of paper from a very wornout pocketbook and unfolding it very deliberately he began to read siryour preposterous demands for money are wholly unwarrantable i have already helped you quite as much as you deserve however for the sake of old times and because you once helped me when i was in a terrible difficulty i am willing to once more let you impose upon my good nature a friend of mine here a russian merchant to whom i have sold my business starts in a few days for an extended tour to many european and asiatic ports in his yacht and has invited me to accompany him as far as england being tired of foreign parts and desirous of seeing the old country once again after thirty years absence i have decided to accept his invitation i don t know when we may actually be in europe but i promise you that as soon as we touch a suitable port i will write to you again making an appointment for you to see me in london but remember that if your demands are too preposterous i will not for a moment listen to them and that i am the last man in the world to submit to persistent and unwarrantable blackmail i am sir yours truly francis smethurst the second letter was dated from southampton continued the old man in the corner calmly and curiously enough was the only letter which kershaw professed to have received from smethurst of which he had kept the envelope and which was dated it was quite brief he added referring once more to his piece of paper dear sirreferring to my letter of a few weeks ago i wish to inform you that the tsarskoe selo will touch at tilbury on tuesday next the th i shall land there and immediately go up to london by the first train i can get if you like you may meet me at fenchurch street station in the firstclass waitingroom in the late afternoon since i surmise that after thirty years absence my face may not be familiar to you i may as well tell you that you will recognize me by a heavy astrakhan fur coat which i shall wear together with a cap of the same you may then introduce yourself to me and i will personally listen to what you may have to say yours faithfully francis smethurst it was this last letter which had caused william kershaws excitement and his wifes tears in the germans own words he was walking up and down the room like a wild beast gesticulating wildly and muttering sundry exclamations mrs kershaw however was full of apprehension she mistrusted the man from foreign partswho according to her husbands story had already one crime upon his consciencewho might she feared risk another in order to be rid of a dangerous enemy womanlike she thought the scheme a dishonourable one for the law she knew is severe on the blackmailer the assignation might be a cunning trap in any case it wag a curious one why she argued did not smethurst elect to see kershaw at his hotel the following day a thousand whys and wherefores made her anxious but the fat german had been won over by kershaws visions of untold gold held tantalizingly before his eyes he had lent the necessary ј with which his friend intended to tidy himself up a bit before he went to meet his friend the millionaire half an hour afterwards kershaw had left his lodgings and that was the last the unfortunate woman saw of her husband or mьller the german of his friend anxiously his wife waited that night but he did not return the next day she seems to have spent in making purposeless and futile inquiries about the neighbourhood of fenchurch street and on the th she went to scotland yard gave what particulars she knew and placed in the hands of the police the two letters written by smethurst chapter ii a millionaire in the dock the man in the corner had finished his glass of milk his watery blue eyes looked across at miss polly burtons eager little face from which all traces of severity had now been chased away by an obvious and intense excitement it was only on the st he resumed after a while that a body decomposed past all recognition was found by two lightermen in the bottom of a disused barge she had been moored at one time at the foot of one of those dark flights of steps which lead down between tall warehouses to the river in the east end of london i have a photograph of the place here he added selecting one out of his pocket and placing it before polly the actual barge you see had already been removed when i took this snapshot but you will realize what a perfect place this alley is for the purpose of one man cutting anothers throat in comfort and without fear of detection the body as i said was decomposed beyond all recognition it had probably been there eleven days but sundry articles such as a silver ring and a tie pin were recognizable and were identified by mrs kershaw as belonging to her husband she of course was loud in denouncing smethurst and the police had no doubt a very strong case against him for two days after the discovery of the body in the barge the siberian millionaire as he was already popularly called by enterprising interviewers was arrested in his luxurious suite of rooms at the hotel cecil to confess the truth at this point i was not a little puzzled mrs kershaws story and smethursts letters had both found their way into the papers and following my usual methodmind you i am only an amateur i try to reason out a case for the love of the thingi sought about for a motive for the crime which the police declared smethurst had committed to effectually get rid of a dangerous blackmailer was the generally accepted theory well did it ever strike you how paltry that motive really was miss polly had to confess however that it had never struck her in that light surely a man who had succeeded in building up an immense fortune by his own individual efforts was not the sort of fool to believe that he had anything to fear from a man like kershaw he must have known that kershaw held no damning proof against himnot enough to hang him anyway have you ever sen smethurst he added as he once more fumbled in his pocketbook polly replied that she had seen smethursts picture in the illustrated papers at the time then he added placing a small photograph before her what strikes you most about the face well i think its strange astonished expression due to the total absence of eyebrows and the funny foreign cut of the hair so close that it almost looks as if it had been shaved exactly that is what struck me most when i elbowed my way into the court that morning and first caught sight of the millionaire in the dock he was a tall soldierlylooking man upright in stature his face very bronzed and tanned he wore neither moustache nor beard his hair was cropped quite close to his head like a frenchmans but of course what was so very remarkable about him was that total absence of eyebrows and even eyelashes which gave the face such a peculiar appearanceas you say a perpetually astonished look he seemed however wonderfully calm he had been accommodated with a chair in the dockbeing a millionaireand chatted pleasantly with his lawyer sir arthur inglewood in the intervals between the calling of the several witnesses for the prosecution whilst during the examination of these witnesses he sat quite placidly with his head shaded by his hand mьller and mrs kershaw repeated the story which they had already told to the police i think you said that you were not able owing to pressure of work to go to the court that day and hear the case so perhaps you have no recollection of mrs kershaw no ah well here is a snapshot i managed to get of her once that is her exactly as she stood in the boxoverdressedin elaborate crape with a bonnet which once had contained pink roses and to which a remnant of pink petals still clung obtrusively amidst the deep black she would not look at the prisoner and turned her head resolutely towards the magistrate i fancy she had been fond of that vagabond husband of hers an enormous weddingring encircled her finger and that too was swathed in black she firmly believed that kershaws murderer sat there in the dock and she literally flaunted her grief before him i was indescribably sorry for her as for mьller he was just fat oily pompous conscious of his own importance as a witness big fat fingers covered with brass rings gripped the two incriminating letters which he had identified they were his passports as it were to a delightful land of importance and notoriety sir arthur inglewood i think disappointed him by stating that he had no questions to ask of him mьller had been brimful of answers ready with the most perfect indictment the most elaborate accusations against the bloated millionaire who had decoyed his dear friend kershaw and murdered him in heaven knows what an outoftheway corner of the east end after this however the excitement grew apace mьller had been dismissed and had retired from the court altogether leading away mrs kershaw who had completely broken down constable d was giving evidence as to the arrest in the meanwhile the prisoner he said had seemed completely taken by surprise not understanding the cause or history of the accusation against him however when put in full possession of the facts and realizing no doubt the absolute futility of any resistance he had quietly enough followed the constable into the cab no one at the fashionable and crowded hotel cecil had even suspected that anything unusual had occurred then a gigantic sigh of expectancy came from every one of the spectators the fun was about to begin james buckland a porter at fenchurch street railway station had just sworn to tell all the truth etc after all it did not amount to much he said that at six oclock in the afternoon of december the th in the midst of one of the densest fogs he ever remembers the from tilbury steamed into the station being just about an hour late he was on the arrival platform and was hailed by a passenger in a firstclass carriage he could see very little of him beyond an enormous black fur coat and a travelling cap of fur also the passenger had a quantity of luggage all marked f s and he directed james buckland to place it all upon a fourwheel cab with the exception of a small handbag which he carried himself having seen that all his luggage was safely bestowed the stranger in the fur coat paid the porter and telling the cabman to wait until he returned he walked away in the direction of the waitingrooms still carrying his small handbag i stayed for a bit added james buckland talking to the driver about the fog and that then i went about my business seein that the local from southend ad been signalled the prosecution insisted most strongly upon the hour when the stranger in the fur coat having seen to his luggage walked away towards the waitingrooms the porter was emphatic it was not a minute later than he averred sir arthur inglewood still had no questions to ask and the driver of the cab was called he corroborated the evidence of james buckland as to the hour when the gentleman in the fur coat had engaged him and having filled his cab in and out with luggage had told him to wait and cabby did wait he waited in the dense foguntil he was tired until he seriously thought of depositing all the luggage in the lost property office and of looking out for another farewaited until at last at a quarter before nine whom should he see walking hurriedly towards his cab but the gentleman in the fur coat and cap who got in quickly and told the driver to take him at once to the hotel cecil this cabby declared had occurred at a quarter before nine still sir arthur inglewood made no comment and mr francis smethurst in the crowded stuffy court had calmly dropped to sleep the next witness constable thomas taylor had noticed a shabbily dressed individual with shaggy hair and beard loafing about the station and waitingrooms in the afternoon of december the th he seemed to be watching the arrival platform of the tilbury and southend trains two separate and independent witnesses cleverly unearthed by the police had seen this same shabbily dressed individual stroll into the firstclass waitingroom at about on wednesday december the th and go straight up to a gentleman in a heavy fur coat and cap who had also just come into the room the two talked together for a while no one heard what they said but presently they walked off together no one seemed to know in which direction francis smethurst was rousing himself from his apathy he whispered to his lawyer who nodded with a bland smile of encouragement the employйs the hotel cecil gave evidence as to the arrival of mr smethurst at about pm on wednesday december the th in a cab with a quantity of luggage and this closed the case for the prosecution everybody in that court already saw smethurst mounting the gallows it was uninterested curiosity which caused the elegant audience to wait and hear what sir arthur inglewood had to say he of course is the most fashionable man in the law at the present moment his lolling attitudes his drawling speech are quite the rage and imitated by the gilded youth of society even at this moment when the siberian millionaire s neck literally and metaphorically hung in the balance an expectant titter went round the fair spectators as sir arthur stretched out his long loose limbs and lounged across the table he waited to make his effectsir arthur is a born actorand there is no doubt that he made it when in his slowest most drawly tones he said quietly with regard to this alleged murder of one william kershaw on wednesday december the th between and pm your honour i now propose to call two witnesses who saw this same william kershaw alive on tuesday afternoon december the th that is to say six days after the supposed murder it was as if a bombshell had exploded in the court even his honour was aghast and i am sure the lady next to me only recovered from the shock of the surprise in order to wonder whether she need put off her dinner party after all as for me added the man in the corner with that strange mixture of nervousness and selfcomplacency which had set miss polly burton wondering well you see i had made up my mind long ago where the hitch lay in this particular case and i was not so surprised as some of the others perhaps you remember the wonderful development of the case which so completely mystified the policeand in fact everybody except myself torriani and a waiter at his hotel in the commercial road both deposed that at about pm on december the th a shabbily dressed individual lolled into the coffeeroom and ordered some tea he was pleasant enough and talkative told the waiter that his name was william kershaw that very soon all london would be talking about him as he was about through an unexpected stroke of good fortune to become a very rich man and so on and so on nonsense without end when he had finished his tea he lolled out again but no sooner had he disappeared down a turning of the road than the waiter discovered an old umbrella left behind accidentally by the shabby talkative individual as is the custom in his highly respectable restaurant signor torriani put the umbrella carefully away in his office on the chance of his customer calling to claim it when he had discovered his loss and sure enough nearly a week later on tuesday the th at about pm the same shabbily dressed individual called and asked for his umbrella he had some lunch and chatted once again to the waiter signor torriani and the waiter gave a description of william kershaw which coincided exactly with that given by mrs kershaw of her husband oddly enough he seemed to be a very absentminded sort of person for on this second occasion no sooner had he left than the waiter found a pocketbook in the coffeeroom underneath the table it contained sundry letters and bills all addressed to william kershaw this pocketbook was produced and karl mьller who had returned to the court easily identified it as having belonged to his dear and lamented friend villiam this was the first blow to the case against the accused it was a pretty stiff one you will admit already it had begun to collapse like a house of cards still there was the assignation and the undisputed meeting between smethurst and kershaw and those two and a half hours of a foggy evening to satisfactorily account for the man in the corner made a long pause keeping the girl on tenterhooks he had fidgeted with his bit of string till there wsnot an inch of it free from the most complicated and elaborate knots i assure you he resumed at last that at that very moment the whole mystery was to me as clear as daylight i only marvelled how his honour could waste his time and mine by putting what he thought were searching questions to the accused relating to his past francis smethurst who had quite shaken off his somnolence spoke with a curious nasal twang and with an almost imperceptible soupзn of foreign accent he calmly denied kershaw s version of his past declared that he had never been called barker and had certainly never been mixed up in any murder case thirty years ago but you knew this man kershaw persisted his honour since you wrote to him pardon me your honour said the accused quietly i have never to my knowledge seen this man kershaw and i can swear that i never wrote to him never wrote to him retorted his honour warningly that is a strange assertion to make when i have two of your letters to him in my hands at the present moment i never wrote those letters your honour persisted the accused quietly they are not in my handwriting which we can easily prove came in sir arthur inglewoods drawly tones as he handed up a packet to his honour here are a number of letters written by my client since he has landed in this country and some of which were written under my very eyes as sir arthur inglewood had said this could be easily proved and the prisoner at his honours request scribbled a few lines together with his signature several times upon a sheet of notepaper it was easy to read upon the magistrates astounded countenance that there was not the slightest similarity in the two handwritings a fresh mystery had cropped up who then had made the assignation with william kershaw at fenchurch street railway station the prisoner gave a fairly satisfactory account of the employment of his time since his landing in england i came over on the tsarskoe selo he said a yacht belonging to a friend of mine when we arrived at the mouth of the thames there was such a dense fog that it was twentyfour hours before it was thought safe for me to land my friend who is a russian would not land at all he was regularly frightened at this land of fogs he was going on to madeira immediately i actually landed on tuesday the th and took a train at once for town i did see to my luggage and a cab as the porter and driver told your honour then i tried to find my way to a refreshmentroom where i could get a glass of wine i drifted into the waitingroom and there i was accosted by a shabbily dressed individual who began telling me a piteous tale who he was i do not know he said he was an old soldier who had served his country faithfully and then been left to starve he begged of me to accompany him to his lodgings where i could see his wife and starving children and verify the truth and piteousness of his tale well your honour added the prisoner with noble frankness it was my first day in the old country i had come back after thirty years with my pockets full of gold and this was the first sad tale i had heard but i am a business man and did not want to be exactly done in the eye i followed my man through the fog out into the streets he walked silently by my side for a time i had not a notion where i was suddenly i turned to him with some question and realized in a moment that my gentleman had given me the slip finding probably that i would not part with my money till i had seen the starving wife and children he left me to my fate and went in search of more willing bait the place where i found myself was dismal and deserted i could see no trace of cab or omnibus i retraced my steps and tried to find my way back to the station only to find myself in worse and more deserted neighbourhoods i became hopelessly lost and fogged i dont wonder that two and a half hours elapsed while i thus wandered on in the dark and deserted streets my sole astonishment is that i ever found the station at all that night or rather close to it a policeman who showed me the way but how do you account for kershaw knowing all your movements still persisted his honour and his knowing the exact date of your arrival in england how do you account for these two letters in fact i cannot account for it or them your honour replied the prisoner quietly i have proved to you have i not that i never wrote those letters and that the manerkarshaw is his namewas not murdered by me can you tell me of anyone here or abroad who might have heard of your movements and of the date of your arrival my late employйs at vladivostok of course knew of my departure but none of them could have written these letters since none of them know a word of english then you can throw no light upon these mysterious letters you cannot help the police in any way towards the clearing up of this strange affair the affair is as mysterious to me as to your honour and to the police of this country francis smethurst was discharged of course there was no semblance of evidence against him sufficient to commit him for trial the two overwhelming points of his defence which had completely routed the prosecution were firstly the proof that he had never written the letters making the assignation and secondly the fact that the man supposed to have been murdered on the th was seen to be alive and well on the th but then who in the world was the mysterious individual who had apprised kershaw of the movements of smethurst the millionaire chapter iii his deduction the man in the corner cocked his funny thin head on one side and looked at polly then he took up his beloved bit of string and deliberately untied every knot he had made in it when it was quite smooth he laid it out upon the table i will take you if you like point by point along the line of reasoning which i followed myself and which will inevitably lead you as it led me to the only possible solution of the mystery first take this point he said with nervous restlessness once more taking up his bit of string and forming with each point raised a series of knots which would have shamed a navigating instructor obviously it was impossible for kershaw not to have been acquainted with smethurst since he was fully apprised of the latters arrival in england by two letters now it was clear to me from the first that no one could have written those two letters except smethurst you will argue that those letters were proved not to have been written by the man in the dock exactly remember kershaw was a careless manhe had lost both envelopes to him they were insignificant now it was never disproved that those letters were written by smethurst but suggested polly wait a minute he interrupted while knot number two appeared upon the scene it was proved that six days after the murder william kershaw was alive and visited the torriani hotel where already he was known and where he conveniently left a pocketbook behind so that there should be no mistake as to his identity but it was never questioned where mr francis smethurst the millionaire happened to spend that very same afternoon surely you dont mean gasped the girl one moment please he added triumphantly how did it come about that the landlord of the torriani hotel was brought into court at all how did sir arthur inglewood or rather his client know that william kershaw had on those two memorable occasions visited the hotel and that its landlord could bring such convincing evidence forward that would for ever exonerate the millionaire from the imputation of murder surely i argued the usual means the police the police had kept the whole affair very dark until the arrest at the hotel cecil they did not put into the papers the usual if anyone happens to know of the whereabouts etc etc had the landlord of that hotel heard of the disappearance of kershaw through the usual channels he would have put himself in communication with the police sir arthur inglewood produced him how did sir arthur inglewood come on his track surely you dont mean point number four he resumed imperturbably mrs kershaw was never requested to produce a specimen of her husbands handwriting why because the police clever as you say they are never started on the right tack they believed william kershaw to have been murdered they looked for william kershaw on december the st what was presumed to be the body of william kershaw was found by two lightermen i have shown you a photograph of the place where it was found dark and deserted it is in all conscience is it not just the place where a bully and a coward would decoy an unsuspecting stranger murder him first then rob him of his valuables his papers his very identity and leave him there to rot the body was found in a disused barge which had been moored some time against the wall at the foot of these steps it was in the last stages of decomposition and of course could not be identified but the police would have it that it was the body of william kershaw it never entered their heads that it was the body of francis smethurst and that william kershaw was his murderer ah it was cleverly artistically conceived kershaw is a genius think of it all his disguise kershaw had a shaggy beard hair and moustache he shaved up to his very eyebrows no wonder that even his wife did not recognize him across the court and remember she never saw much of his face while he stood in the dock kershaw was shabby slouchy he stooped smethurst the millionaire might have served in the prussian army then that lovely trait about going to revisit the torriani hotel just a few days grace in order to purchase moustache and beard and wig exactly similar to what he had himself shaved off making up to look like himself splendid then leaving the pocketbook behind he he he kershaw was not murdered of course not he called at the torriani hotel six days after the murder whilst mr smethurst the millionaire hobnobbed in the park with duchesses hang such a man fie he fumbled for his hat with nervous trembling fingers he held it deferentially in his hand whilst he rose from the table polly watched him as he strode up to the desk and paid twopence for his glass of milk and his bun soon he disappeared through the shop whilst she still found herself hopelessly bewildered with a number of snapshot photographs before her still staring at a long piece of string smothered from end to end in a series of knots as bewildering as irritating as puzzling as the man who had lately sat in the corner
