st clares the second form at st clares blyton enid off to school again the last week of the summer holidays flew by and the twins pat and isabel osullivan seemed to be in a rush of buying clothes fitting them on looking out lacrosse sticks finding lacrosse boots and hunting for all kinds of things that seemed to have completely disappeared where is my knittingbag said pat turning a whole drawerfull of things upside down i know i brought it home at the end of last term i can only find one of my lacrosse boots wailed isabel mummy have you seen the other yes it came back from the bootmakers yesterday said mrs osullivan where did you put it packing to go to school is always much more muddling than packing to come back home said pat i say isabelwont it be fun to be in the second form this term who is your formteacher there asked their mother unpacking half pats things and packing them all over again miss jenks said pat ill be sorry to leave miss roberts and the first form in some ways we did have fun there i bet well have some fun in miss jenkss class too said isabel i dont think shes quite so strict as miss roberts dont you believe it said isabel trying to cram a tin of toffees into a corner she may not have miss robertss sarcastic tonguebut shes all there dont you remember how she used to deal with tessie when tessie used to try on her pretendsneezes yessent her to matron for a large dose of awful medicine supposed to stop a cold giggled pat all the same i bet well get away with quite a lot of things in miss jenkss form i hope you mean to work said mrs osullivan putting in the top tray of isabels trunk i was quite pleased with last terms report dont let me have a bad one as soon as you go up into another form will you well work all right mummy said pat i can tell you the teachers at st clares arent easygoing where work is concerned they keep our noses to the grindstone i mamzelles the worst she really seems to think we ought to learn to talk french better than we speak english no wonder your french accent is so much improved then said mrs osullivan with a laugh now pat let me see if i can possibly shut your trunk youd better sit on it whilst i try to shut the clasps the trunk wouldnt shut mrs osullivan opened it again and looked inside you cant take all those books she said firmly mummy i must said pat and i simply must take those games toowe love jigsaws in the winter term well pat all i can say is youd better take books games toffees biscuits and knitting things and leave behind your clothes said the twins mother nowbe sensibletake out three books and we can shut the trunk pat took out three books and when mrs osullivan was not looking put them hurriedly into isabels trunk her own trunk now shut down fairly easily and was locked then mrs osullivan went to isabels the things you girls take back with you nowadays when i when you were a girl you only took a small case and that held everything chanted the twins who had heard these remarks before mummy well both sit on isabels trunk shall we mrs osullivan opened the trunk and firmly removed three books from the top layer she looked at them in surprise i seem to have seen these before she said the twins giggled they sat on the trunk and it shut with a groan and now to pack your handbag with nightthings in said mrs osullivan looking at the schoollist to make sure nothing had been forgotten that wont take long nightgowns toothbrushes faceflannels and sponges went into small bags then the twins were ready they were both dressed neatly in their school whiter uniforms of grey with blue blouses and scarlet ties they put on grey coats and grey felt hats with the school ribbon round and looked at each other two good little st clare girls said pat looking demure not so very good said her mother with a smile nowthere is the car at the door ready to take us to the station have we really got everything you must write and tell me if you want anything else oh were sure to want lots of things said pat youre a darling the way you send us things its fun to be going back to st clares im awfully glad you sent us there mummy and how you hated going at firstsaid mrs osullivan remembering the fuss the twins had made expensive school yeswe made up our minds to be so awful that the school wouldnt keep us said pat and we were awful toobut we couldnt keep it up st clares was too much for uswe just had to be decent in the end do come on said isabel we shall miss the train im longing to meet all the girls in london and see them again arent you pat i do like the journey down to st clares they were off at last they had to travel to london and go to the station where the st clare train started the whole train was reserved for the st clare girls for it was a big school there was a terrific noise on the platform where scores of girls were waiting for the train their mothers were there to bid them goodbye and teachers moved about trying to collect the girls together porters shoved luggage into the van and every one was excited bobby oh theres bobby yelled pat as soon as they arrived on the crowded platform and janet too hie bobby hie janet hallo twins cried bobby her merry eyes crinkled up as she smiled its good to see your turnup nose again said pat slipping her arm through bobbys hallo janet got any more tricks from that brother of yours wait and see grinned janet a mistress came up at that moment and overheard the remarks ahdid i hear the word tricks janet she said well just remember youre in my form this term and there are really terrible punishments for tricks like yours yes miss jenks grinned janet ill remember are all the others here yet now we must get into the train the guard is looking rather worried i see carlotta get into our carriage yelled bobby seeing the darkeyed darkhaired girl running down the platform what sort of hols did you have did you go back to the circus carlotta was a source of great attraction and admiration to the girls for she had once been a circusgirl and her understanding and handling of horses was marvellous now she had to settle down at st clares and learn many things she had never heard of she had found her first term very difficult but at the end of it she was firm friends with most of her form and the mistresses were pleased with her she ran up to the twins and bobby her vivid little face glowing with pleasure hallo she said ill get into your carriage oh looktheres your cousin alison she looks rather miserable i feel miserable said alison osullivan coming up looking very woebegone i shall miss my friend sadie dreadfully this term sadie had been an american girl with no ideas in her head at all beyond clothes and the cinema she had had a very bad influence on alison but as she was not coming back that term it was to be hoped that the featherheaded alison would pull herself together a little and try to do better she was a pretty little thing who easily burst into tears her cousins welcomed her warmly hallo alison i dont fret about sadie youll soon find other friends they all got into the carriage doris arrived panting hilary wentworth who had been head of the first form flung herself down in a corner seat she was very much wondering if she would be head of the second form she was a trustworthy and responsible girl who liked being head hallo everybody she said nice to see you all again well carlottabeen riding in the ring i suppose lucky kid you know i dont belong to a circus any more said carlotta i went to spend my holidays with my father and my grandmother my father seems to like me quite a lotbut my grandmother found a lot of fault with my manners she says i must pay more attention to them this term even than to my lessons i you must all help me oh no said pat with a laugh we dont want you any different from what you are my dear hottempered entirely natural perfectly honest little carlotta we get more fun out of you than out of anyone we dont want you changed one little bit i any more than we want bobby changed we shall expect some marvellous tricks from you this term bobby right said bobby but i tell you here and now im going to work too miss jenks will see to that said hilary remember we shall no longer be in the bottom form weve got to work for exams and pass them were off said pat leaning out of the window goodbye mummy well write on sunday the train steamed slowly out of the station the girls drew in their heads all the carriages were full of chatterers talking about the wonderful hols they had had the places they had been to and what sort of term it would be any new girls said isabel i havent seen one i think theres only one said bobby we saw a miserablelooking creature standing a little way up the platformi dont know whether shell be second form or first form not second i hopeshe looked such a misery alisons doing her hair again already said pat alison put your comb away girls i think well have to make it a rule that alison doesnt do her hair more than fifty times a day every one laughed it was good to be back good to be all together once more the winter term was going to be fun in the second form it was very strange at first to be in the second form instead of the first the twins felt very important and looked down on the firstformers feeling that they were very young and unimportant but the thirdformers also looked down on the second form so things soon shook themselves out and every one settled down its funny to go to the second form classroom instead of to miss robertas room said pat i keep on going to the first form room as i always used to do so do i said janet miss roberts is beginning to think were doing it on purpose wed better be careful theres a whole lot of new girls in the first form after all said pat miss roberts must have collected them altogether on the train thats why we didnt see them theres about twelve i shall never know all their names said isabel anywaytheyre only little kidssome of them not yet fourteen t all the firstformers have been moved up said bobby except young pamand shes only just fourteen i bet shell be head of the first form pam boardman had been new the term before and was a very hardworking child as bobby said she was made head of the first form and was extremely proud of the honour she had many new girls under her and was eager to help them all only two girls had been left down in the second form elsie fanshawe and anna johnson the girls who had just come up were sorry to see them there for they were not much liked elsie fanshawe was spiteful and anna johnson was lazy i suppose one of them will be head girl said hilary with a grimace welli dont fancy either of them do you bobby they both think themselves very superior to us said bobby just because theyve been secondformers for a year i should be ashamed said carlotta i would not like to spend more than a year in any form but anna is so lazy she will never get up into the third formim sure i believe miss jenks didnt send them up because she hoped theyd buck up a bit if they were heads said pat i rather think shes going to make them joint head girls we shall have to look out if elsies headshes really catty weve got that miserygirl in our form after all said bobby looking at the new girl who was standing mournfully not far off looking at nothing she never says a word but looks as if shell burst into tears at any moment the miserygirl as the others called her was named gladys hillman the girls tried to make her talk and bobbie did her best to make her laugh but gladys took no notice of any one she walked by herself seemed to ream all the time and hardly spoke a word better leave her alone said hilary perhaps shes not many of the st clare girls felt homesick when they returned to school because it was all so jolly and friendly and there was so much to do that there seemed no time to miss home and parents the beginning of term was always fun new books given out new girls to size up new desks to sit in and sometimes new forms to go to theres a new mistress said bobby in excitement shes to take elocution and drama look there she is isnt she dark miss quentin certainly was dark and extremely good looking she had black piercing eyes and a beautiful voice alison thought she was wonderful you would said bobby youll be doing your hair like miss quentin next swept over your brow and round your ears therell always be some one for you to copy my dear alison do you remember last term how you copied everything your dear friend sadie did alison flushed she was always being teased and she never seemed to get used to it she turned away with a toss of her pretty head the others laughed at her there was nothing bad in alison but on the other hand there was nothing very good either she was as pat so often said just a pretty little featherhead the second form soon settled down with miss jenks at first it seemed strange to them not to have miss roberts teaching them for most of the morning they missed her dry remarks and crisp words of praise miss jenks was not so shrewd as miss roberts nor was she so cool when angry she could not bear the slightest hint of rudeness and she had no sympathy at all for frills and fancies as she put it no girl dared to fuss her hair out too much or to wear anything but a plain gold bar for a brooch in miss jenkss class alison is in for a bad time grinned bobby one morning when alison had been sent to remove a bow from her hair and a brooch from her collar so is carlotta said pat miss jenks doesnt like frills and fanciesbut she doesnt like untidiness either just look at your hair carlotta its wild enough in the ordinary waybut it looks like a golliwogs hair at the moment does it really said carlotta who never cared in the least what she looked like well those sums we had to do were so hard i just had to clutch my hair all the time old mamzelles still the same said isabel funny old hottempered flatfooted thingbut i like her all the same she always gives us some excitementand i bet she will this term too do you remember how she and carlotta nearly came to blows last term yesthe summer term had been a very exciting one the girls looked at mamzelle and remembered all the jokes they had played on her dear old mamzelle she always fell for everything she was very terrifying when she lost her temper but she had a great sense of humour and when her shortsighted eyes twinkled behind their glasses the girls felt a real fondness for her ah said mamzelle looking round the second form ah you are now the second formvery important very responsible and very hardworking nest ce pas the firstformers they are babies they know nothing but as soon as you arrive in the second form you are big girls you know a great deal your french will be quite perrrrrfect and dorisah even doris will be able to roll her rs in the proper french way every one laughed poor doris always bottom at oral french could never roll her rs doris grinned she was a dunce but nobody minded she was a wonderful mimic and could keep the whole form in roars of laughter when she liked rrrrrrr said carlotta unexpectedly she sounded like an aeroplane taking off and mamzelle frowned you are now in the second form carlotta she said coldly we do not do those things here no mamzelle said carlotta meekly of course not tricks and jokes are not performed in any form higher than the first warned mamzelle whilst you are firstform babies one does not expect much from youbut as soon as you leave the bottom form behind it is different we expect you to behave with dignity one day the headgirl may be one of you here and it is not too soon to prepare for such an honour winifred james the muchadmired headgirl had left and belinda towers the sports captain had taken her place this was a very popular choice for belinda was well known by the whole school and very much liked as sports captain she knew practically all the girls and this would be a great help to her as headgirl she was not so gentle and quiet as winifred and many girls were afraid of her outspokenness but there was no doubt she would make an excellent headgirl belinda visited every common room in turn and made the same short speech to the girls there you all know im headgirl nowand im still sportscaptain too you can come to me if youre in a spot of trouble at any time and ill help if i can youll all have to toe the mark where games are concerned because i want to put st clares right on the map this winter with lacrosse we must win every match we play weve got some fine players for a school team but i want every form to supply players for the second and third matchteams too so buck up all of you and practise hard alison groaned as belinda went out of the second form common room why do we have to play games she said they just make us hot and untidy and tired you forget they do other things as well said janet we have to learn to work together as a teameach one for his side helping the others not each one for himself that sort of thing is especially good for you my dear alisonyoud sit in a corner and look at yourself in the mirror all day long if you couldand a fat lot of good that would do to you or anybody else oh be quiet said alison youre always getting at me it was fun to be back again and to hear all the familiar school chatter to groan over prep to eat enormous teas to talk about lacrosse to laugh at somebodys joke and to look forward to the class you liked the bestpainting maybe or music or elocutionor even maths there was a surprise for the second form at the end of the first week another new girl appeared she arrived at teatime with red eyes and a sulky mouth she looked defiantly at every one as she took her place at the second form table this is mirabel unwin said miss jenks she has arrived rather late for beginning of termbut still better late than never mirabel i didnt want to come at all said mirabel in a loud voice they tried to make me come on the right day but i wouldnt i only came now because my father promised i could leave at halfterm if id come now i suppose he thought once he got me here id stay but i shant that will do mirabel said miss jenks soothingly you are tired and overwrought dont say any more you will soon settle down and be happy no i shant said the surprising mirabel i shant settle down and i shant be happy i shant try at anything because whats the use if im leaving at halfterm well well see said miss jenks be sensible now and eat some tea you must be hungry the girls stared at mirabel they were not used to people who shouted their private affairs out in public they thought mirabel was rather shockingbut rather exciting too i thought she was another miserygirl at first but i believe shes just spoilt and peevish said pat i say the second form is going to be quite an exciting place this term two headgirls and two new girls miss jenks made both the old secondformers into joint headgirls of the form she and miss theobald the head mistess had had a talk about them and had decided that perhaps it would be the making of them elsie is a spiteful type said miss jenks she has never been popular though she would have liked to be so she gets back at the others by being spiteful and saying nasty things and anna is bonelazywont do a thing if she can help it well a little responsibility may be good for them said miss theobald thoughtfully it will give elsie a sense of importance and bring out any good in her and anna will have to bestir herself if she wants to keep her position let them both try i dont know how they will work together said miss jenks doubtfully they dont like each other very much let them try said miss theobald elsie is quick and she may stir anna up a bitand anna is too lazy to be spiteful so perhaps she will be good for elsie in that way but i too have my doubts elsie fanshawe was delighted to be a joint headgirl though of course she would very much rather have been the only one still after being thoroughly disliked and kept down by the whole of the second form it was quite a change to be topdog now i can jolly well keep the others down and make them look up to me thought elsie pleased i can get some of my own back these silly little firstformers who have just come up have got to learn to knuckle under a bit i can make anna agree with all i dolazy thing ill have every single one of the rules kept and ill make a few of my own if i want toand ill report any one who gets out of hand its worthwhile not going up into the third form to be top of the second the others guessed a little what elsie was thinking although they had not known the girl very well when they were firstformers they had heard the others talking about her they knew elsie would try to get her own back just what a headgirl shouldnt do said janet she should try and set some sort of example to the others or whats the use of being a leader look at old hilary when she was head of the first form she was a good sport and joined in everythingbut she always knew where to draw the line without getting our backs up i cant bear elsie said carlotta i would like to slap her hard oh carlotta i have you still got that habit said bobby pretending to be shocked really a secondformer too what would elsie say elsie overheard the last remark what would i say to what she asked coming up oh nothingcarlotta was simply saying shed like to slap some one said bobby with a grin please understand carlotta that you are in the second form now said elsie in a cold voice we dont even talk ofslapping people yes we do said carlotta wouldnt you like to know whom i want to slap dear elsie elsie heard the dangernote in carlottas high voice and put her nose in the air im not interested in your slapping habits she said and walked off shut up now carlotta said bobby dont go and get all wild and spanish again you were bad enough with prudence last term well thank goodness old sourmilk prudence was expelled said carlotta i wouldnt have stayed if she had come back it was the hour when all the second form were in their common room playing working or chattering they loved being together like that the wireless blared at one end of the room and doris and bobby danced a ridiculous dance to the music gladys hillman sat in a corner looking as miserable as usual nobody could make anything of her isabel looked at her and felt sorry she went over to her come and dance she said gladys shook her head whats the matter asked isabel are you homesick youll soon get over it dont bother me said gladys i dont bother you yes you do said isabel you bother me a lot i cant bear to see you sitting here all alone looking so miserable havent you been to boardingschool before no said gladys her eyes filled with tears isabel felt a little impatient with her hadnt she any courage at all you dont seem to enjoy a single thing said isabel dont you like any lesson speciallyor gamesor something i like acting said gladys unexpectedly and i like lacrosse thats all but i dont like them here i dont like anything here she wouldnt say any more and isabel gave her up she went across to pat hopeless she said just a mass of selfpity and tears i shell fade away and well never notice shes gone if she doesnt buck up id almost rather have that rude mirabel than gladys mirabel had been the source of much annoyance and amusement to the second form she was rude to the point of being unbearable and reminded every one every day that she wasnt going to stay a day beyond halfterm dont tell me that any more begged bobby you cant imagine how glad i am youre going at halfterm its the only bright spot i can see but i warn you dont be too rude to mamzelle or sparks will flyand dont get on the high horse too much with our dear headgirl elsie fanshawe or youll get the worst of it elsie is pretty clever you know and youre rather stupid no im not flashed mirabel angrily i only seem stupid because i dont want to trybut you should hear me play the piano and the violin i then youd see why you dont even learn music said bobby and ive never seen you open your mouth in the singing dass we all came to the conclusion that you couldnt sing a note thats all you know said mirabel rudely golly what a school this is i always knew boardingschool would be awfulbut its worse than i expected i hate living with a lot of rude girls who think theyre the cats whiskers just because theyve been here a year or two oh you make me tired said bobby and walked off really what with you and the miserygirl and spiteful old elsie were badly off this term miss jenks kept a very firm hand on mirabel you may not intend to work she said but you are not going to stop the others from working i you will do one of three things my dear mirabelyou will stay in the classroom and workor you will stay in the classroom and do nothing at all not even say a wordor you will go and stand outside the classroom till the lesson is finished at first mirabel thought it was marvellous to defy miss jenks and be sent outside but she soon found it wearisome to stand there so long waiting for the others to come out also she was always a little afraid that the head mistress miss theobald would come along loudly as mirabel declared that she cared for nobody nobody at all at silly st clares she was in awe of the quiet head mistress did you tell miss theobald that you didnt mean to stay here longer than halfterm asked pat every girl had to go to see the head mistress when she arrived on the first day of course i did said mirabel tossing her head i told her i didnt care for anyone not even the head this was untrue mirabel had meant to say quite a lotbut miss theobald had somehow said it first she had looked gravely at the redeyed girl when she had come in and had told her to sit down mirabel opened her mouth to speak but miss theobald silenced her i must finish this letter she said then we will talk she kept mirabel waiting for ten minutes the girl studied the heads calm face and felt a little awed it would be difficult to be rude to someone like this the longer she waited the more difficult it would be to say what she had meant to say miss theobald raised her head at last well mirabel she said i know you feel upset angry and defiant your father insisted you should come away to school because you are spoilt and make bis home unbearable you also domineer over your smaller brother and sister he chose st clares because he thought we might be able to do something for you nodont interrupt me believe me i know all you want to saybut you dont know what have to say there was a pause even defiant mirabel did not dare to say a word we have had many difficult girls here said miss theobald we rather pride ourselves on getting the best out of them you see mirabel difficult children often have fine things hidden in their charactersthings that perhaps more ordinary children dont possess what things asked mirabel interested in spite of herself wellsometimes difficult children have a great talent for somethinga gift for art or drama a talent for music or maybe they have some great qualityoutstanding courage perhaps well i dont know if this is the case with you or whether you are just a spoilt and unruly girlwe shall see all i want to say now isgive yourself a chance and let me see if there is anything worthwhile in you this halfterm if there is not we dont want you to stay we shall be glad for you to go was so unexpected that mirabel again had nothing ne ka mean say tnat nothing on earth would make her stay at st clares beyond the halft here was miss theobald saying that she didnt to keep her longer than thatunlessunless she worthwhile i worthwhile i dont care if im worthwhile or not thought to herself indignantly and how dare daddy write and tell miss theobald those things about me why couldnt he keep our affairs to himself mirabel voiced this thought aloud i think it was horrid of my father to tell you things about me she said in a trembling voice they were said in confidence to some one who understood said miss theobald have you kept your own tongue quiet about your private affairs this afternoon mirabel noi rather think you gave yourself away to the whole school at teatime when you arrived mirabel flushed yesshe had said far too much she always did she could not keep control over her tongue you may go said miss theobald picking up her pen again and rememberit is not st clares which is on trialit is you i hope i shall not say goodbye to you and rejoice to see the last of you at halfterm but i shall not be surprised if i do mirabel went out of the room her ears tingling her face still red she had been used to getting all her own way to letting her rough tongue say what it pleased and to ruling her parents and brother and sister as she pleased when her father had at last declared in anger that she must go away there had been a royal battle between them the spoilt girl had imagined she could rule the roost at st clares too but she certainly could not rule miss theobald never mindill lead everyone else a dance she thought ill show daddy and the others that i mean what i say i wont be sent away from home if i dont want to go and so mirabel set herself to be as annoying as possible to spoil things for the others and to try and domineer in the classroom as she had always done at home but she had not bargained for the treatment she got at last from an exasperated class mirabel is a nuisance the second form did not so much mind when mirabel was annoying in classes they disliked such as the maths class which they found difficult that termor even in mamzelles class when she took irregular french verbs hated by every girl but they did dislike it when she spoilt or tried to spoil the english class or the art class it spoils our reading of the tempest when you make idiotic remarks or flop about in your seat and make miss jenks keep on saying sit up i said hilary angrily either behave badly enough to get sent out of the room at once idiot or else keep quiet and if you dare to upset your paintwater all over somebody again and make us lose ten minutes of the art class whilst we all get ticked off by miss walker ill scrag you said carlotta all in one breath we wouldnt mind so much if you did something really funny like bobby or janet did last termwhat you do snfunnyjust idiotic spoiling things for the whole class o i shall do what i like said mirabel f you will not said elsie spitefully im headgirl of this formwith annaand we say you are to behave yourself or well know the reason why you do know the reason why said mirabel pertly any one would think you were six years old the way you behave said bobby in disgust welli warn yonyoull be sorry if you keep on like this were all getting tired of you the explosion came during the drama class this was taken by the new teacher miss quentin and was really rather an exciting dass the girls were to write and act their own play darkeyed miss quentin was full of good suggestions and the play was almost written the new teacher was not much good at discipline she relied on her good looks and rather charming manner and on the interest of her lessons to help her to discipline her classes alison adored her and as the girls had already foreseen was copying her in everything from her little tricks of speech to the way she did her hair most of the girls liked miss quentin though they did not very much respect the way she coaxed them to behave when they became a little unruly they really preferred the downright methods of miss roberts or miss jenks mirabel of course soon found that miss quentin was quite unable to keep her in order your turn now mirabel dear miss quentin would say smiling brightly at her mirabel would pretend not to hear and miss quentin would raise her voice slightly mirabel your turn now dear the class disliked miss quentins dears and lambs and other namesexcept alison she loved them they all looked at mirabel impatiently she was always losing time like this when they wanted to get on mirabel would pretend to come back to earth with a start fumble for the place be gently helped by miss quentin and at last say something usually incorrect when there was any acting to be done she came in at the wrong moment said the wrong lines and altogether behaved in a most annoying manner miss quentin was at a loss to know how to deal with her mirabel i have never yet sent a girl out of my class she would say in such a sorrowful voice that it quite wrung alisons heart now comepull yourself together and try again one morning alison was waiting to act a part she loved she had rehearsed it over and over again to herself acting it as she thought to perfection she was longing for her turn to come so that she might gloat over the sugared words of praise she felt sure would drop from miss quentins lips there were ten more minutes to gojust about time for alisons turn to come and then mirabel chose to be stupid again saying her lines incorrectly doing the wrong things so that miss quentin had to make her speak and act two or three times the teacher following her usual rule of being patient and encouraging wasted nearly all the precious ten minutes on mirabel alison cast her eye on the clock and bit her lip all her rehearsing would be wasted now how she hated that stupid mirabel holding up every class in order to be annoying now mirabel dear said miss quentin in her charming patient voice say it like this it was too much for alison she stamped her foot mirabel stop fooling i its hateful the way you take miss quentin inand shes so patient too youve wasted half the timeand now i shant have my turn poor little alison said mirabel mockingly she badly wanted to show off to her precious miss quentin hear her say well done darling there was a dead silence then alison burst into a of tears and carlotta boxed mirabels ears very smartly miss quentin stared in horror girls girls what are you thinking of carlotta you amaze me i cannot have this behaviour i really cannot carlotta apologize at once to mirabel f certainly not said carlotta i dont mean to be rude to you miss quentinbut you must see for yourself that mirabel deserved it i knew noone else but me would dare to do itand its been coming to mirabel for quite a long time the bell rang for the next class miss quentin was most relieved she had no idea how to tackle things of this sort she gathered up her books quickly there is no time to say any more girls she said i must go to my next class carlotta i still insist that you put things right with mirabel by apologizing she went out of the room in a flurry carlotta grinned round at the others well she said dont stand staring at me like that as if id done something awful you know quite well youve all wanted to box mirabels ears yourselves were as tired of her as we can be its a pity halfterm isnt here and we can see the back of her carlotta you shouldnt do things like that said janet alison for pitys sake stop howling mirabel you deserved it and now perhaps youll shut up and behave properly mirabel had gone rather white she had not attempted to hit back at carlotta if you think that will stop me doing what i like to spoil things for anybody youre mistaken she said at last in a tight kind of voice itll make me worse o i suppose it will said hilary wellill give you a warning if you dont stop being an idiot we shall make things uncomfortable for you i dont mean we shall box your ears we shant but there are other ways mirabel said no morebut as she made no attempt that day or the following to behave sensibly the girls made up their minds that they must carry out their threat they met in one of the musicrooms elsie fanshawe was pleased this excited herit gladdened her spiteful nature and added to her sense of importance for as she was one of the headgirls she could direct every one in what they had to do weve met together to decide how to get back at mirabel she began hilary interrupted her wellnot exactly get back elsie she said its more to prevent her from going on disgracing herself and our class call it what you like said elsie impatiently now what i propose is this well take her books from her desk and hide them well make her an applepie bed each night well stitch up the pockets and sleeves of her outdoor coat well put stones into her wellingtons well it all sounds rather spiteful said hilary doubtfully need we do quite so many things i know mirabel is perfectly sickeiiing and needs a good lessonbut dont lets make ourselves as bad as she is welldo as you like said elsie rather sneeringly if youre too goodygoody to follow the lead of your headgirls well there will be plenty of us wholl do what i say i bet anna didnt think of any of those things said bobby looking at the plump placid anna sitting beside elsie the meeting discussed the matter a little more and r carlotta boxed mirabels ears very smartly then at the sound of a schoolbell broke up only gladys had said nothing she had sat as usual in a kind of dream paying hardly any attention to what was said the girls were becoming so used to the miserygirl as they called her that they really hardly noticed whether she was there or not well said hilary as the girls ran off to change for games i suppose we must do something to teach mirabel that two can play at being annoyingbut somehow a lot of spitefulness seems to have got mixed up in it its bound to with elsie fanshawe to lead us said bobby i wish she wasnt our headgirl shes not the right sort as for anna shes no use at alljust a lazy lump mirabels going to have a few shocks from now on said alison who was more pleased than anyone to think of the tricks that were to be played on mirabel i for one will do everything with the greatest pleasure i hope your darling miss quentin will be pleased with you said bobby with a grin and scampered off to the field before alison could think of any reply mirabel and the miserygirl it was not pleasant to be thought a tiresome nuisance by girls and teachers alike mirabel was getting tired of her defiant pose nobody had ever thought it was funny as she had hoped nobody had ever laughed they had just got impatient the girl began to feel sorry she had ever started her irritating behaviour a great feeling of misery overtook her the evening of the day she had been slapped by carlotta she felt that no one liked her and certainly no one loved her hadnt her own father sent her away and her mother had agreed to it i how could she put up with that there was no way to answer things like that except by being defiant mirabel felt that she did not want to be with the others that evening in the noisy common room she stole away by herself to one of the musicrooms she had spoken truly when she had told bobby that she could play the piano and the violin she loved music and was a really good performer on the piano and a beautiful player of the violin but because of her defiant obstinacy she had refused to learn either of the instruments at st clares when her father had spoken to her about them you can learn well there he had told her there are excellent teachers of both whats the use mirabel had flashed back at him im only going to be there for half a termand you dont want to have to pay full fees for two lots of music lessons do you as well as full fees for the ordinary lessons very well have it your own way said her father so nothing had been said about learning music and the girl had missed her weekly lessons very much music had always helped her strong domineering natureand now without it she telt lost she was depressed and unhappy tonighther mind longed for something to fasten on something to love she thought of her violin at home and wished with all her heart that she had brought it with her it was dark hi the musicroom mirabel did not turn on the light for she was afraid somebody passing might see her and she did not want any company just then she leaned her arms on a little table and thought io inc jj uu fukm ai bl ixake s her hands touched somethinga violin case something in the feel of it stirred her and suddenly with hands that trembled a little she undid the strap and took out the violin inside she put it lovingly under her chin and groped for the bow and then the little dark musicroom was full of music as mirabel played to herself she played to comfort herself to forget herself and the notes filled the little room and made it beautiful thats better said mirabel at last thats much better i didnt know how much id missed my music i wonder whereabouts the piano is ill play that too why didnt i think of this before she groped her way to the piano and began to finger the notes gently in the darkness she played from memory and chose melodies that were sad and yearning to match her own mood she thought she was alone and she put her whole heart into her playing then suddenly she heard a sound in the room beside her and she stopped at once her heart thumping she heard a stifled sob whos there said mirabel in a low voice there was no answer someone began softly to grope her way to the door mirabel felt a stir of anger who was it spying on her who had come into the room like that she jumped up and grabbed wildly at the some one near the door she caught a blouse sleeve and held on who is it she said megladys said a voice i was in here alone when you came in i didnt know you were going to play but you played such beautiful music i had to stayand then it got sad and i cried youre always crying said mirabel impatiently o whats the matter i shant tell you said gladys youll only tell the others and theyd laugh they call me miserygirl i know its hateful theyd be miserygirls too if they were like me like youwhy whats the matter with you asked mirabel her curiosity aroused look heretell me i shant jeer at you or anything well dont turn on the light then said gladys youll think im very feeble so id rather tell you in the dark you are a queer fish said mirabel come on whats the matter its my mother said gladys shes awfully illin hospitaland i dont know if shell get better i simply cant tell you how much i love her and how much i miss her i havent a father or brothers or sisters only my mother ive never been away from her even for a night till now i know it sounds silly to you youll call me babyish and mothers girland so i am i suppose but you see mother and i havent had any one but each otherand im so terribly terribly homesick and want to be with mother so much gladys burst into sobs again and cried so miserably that mirabel forgot her own troubles for the moment and put her arm awkwardly round the girl she saw how little courage gladys had gotshe saw how little she tried to face what had come to herand she felt a little scornful but no one couid help feeling sorry for the miserable girl mirabel had no idea what to do for the best well she said saying the first thing that came into her head well how would you like to be me sent away from home by your mother and father because they didnt want you and said you upset your brother and sister and made every one unhappy thats what ive got to put up with im not so lucky as you i think gladys raised her head and for the first time forgot her unhappiness in her scorn of mirabel you unlucky dont be sillyyou dont know how lucky you are to have a father and a mother a brother and a sister all to love and to love you and i only have my mother and even she is taken away from me mirabel you deserve to be sent away from home if you cant understand that families should love one another i can tell you if i had all those people to love i wouldnt behave so badly to them that theyd send me away you ought to be ashamed of yourself coming from the silent gladys this was most astonishing mirabel stared into the darkness not knowing what to say gladys got up and went to the door im sorry she said in a muffled voice youre unhappyand im unhappyand i should be sorry for you and comfort you but you made your own unhappinessand i didnt make mine thats the difference between us the door banged and mirabel was alone she sat still in surprise who would have thought that gladys could say all that mirabel thought back to her own home she saw the golden head of her little sister the dark one of her brother bent over homework she saw the gentle patient face of her mother who always gave in to every one she remembered the goodhumoured face of her father changed to a sad and angry countenance because of her own continual insistence on her own way it was mothers fault for giving in to me she thought and harry and joan should have stood up to me but its difficult for younger ones to stand up for themselves and after all i am difficult i wish i was home now im lonely here and ive behaved like an idiot i know mother would always love meand yet ive been beastly to herand turned daddy against me too harry and rjoan will be glad ive gone nobody in the world wants frje or loves me selfpity brings tears more quickly to the eyes than anything else mirabel put her head on the table and jjyept she forgot gladys and her trouble she only felt sorry for herself she dried her eyes after a while and sat up i shall stop behaving badly she thought i shall leave at halfterm and go back home and try to do better im tired of being silly ill turn over a new leaf tomorrow and perhaps the girls will feel more friendly she got up and switched on the light her watch showed five minutes to ninealmost bedtime she sat down at the piano and played to herself for a while and then when the nineoclock bell sounded made her way upstairs to bed full of good resolutions she began to make pictures of how nice the girls would be to her when they found she was turning over a new leaf perhaps the twins would find she was somebody worth knowing after all poor mirabel when she got into bed that night she found that she could only get her legs halfway down it the girls had made a beautiful applepie bed and not content with that elsie had put a spray of holly across the bend of the sheet mirabel gave a shout of dismay as the holly pricked her toes oh i whos put this beastly thing into my bed its scratched my foot horribly mirabel had never had an applepie bed made for her before she could not imagine what had happened she tried to force her legs down to the bottom of the bed but only succeeded in tearing the sheet the girls were in fits of laughter they soon saw that mirabel had not experienced an applepie bed before and had no idea that the top sheet had been tucked under the bolster and then folded in half halfway down the bed and brought back to fold over the blanket doris rolled on her bed in glee and even placid anna squealed with joy golly youll have to report that tear to matron in the morning said elsie when she heard the sheet torn in half you idiot you might have guessed that would happen youll spend the next sewingclass mending a long rent mirabel threw the holly at elsie she had now discovered what had happened and was angry and hurt she got into bed and drew the covers round her the others chuckled a little and then one by one fell asleep in the morning mirabel awoke early she lay and thought over what she had decided the night before it wasnt going to be easy to make a complete changeover but she didnt see anything else to do she simply could not go on being idiotic once you were ashamed of yourself you had to stop if you didnt then you really were an idiot so full of good resolutions still mirabel went to her classes she would work well she would give mamzelle a great surprise she would please miss jenks she would make up for her rudeness to miss quentin she would even be decent to that wild little carlotta and forgive her for that box on the ears the girls would see she wasnt so bad as they thought she was and they would turn over a new leaf too and be friendly to her everything would be lovely againand at the halfterm she would leave and people would be sorry to see her go it was with these pleasant thoughts that poor mirabel entered on a day of horrid shocks and unpleasant surprises a day of shocks and surprises alison and elsie were the two who enjoyed punishing jlirabel more than any of the others elsie because she rfas naturally spiteful and alison because she had been so annoyed at losing her turn in miss quentins class ill sew up the sleeves of mirabels coat said alison to elsie ill do them awfully tightly shell be furious ill take out some of her books and hide them said elsie anna go and find mirabels wellington boots and put small pebbles insiderright in the toes oh cant some one else do that said anna i shall have to go down to the gamesroom to get the boots bobbie you go elsie went to the classroom before morning school and removed various books and exercise papers there was no one else in the room the girl spitefully dropped ink on to a maths paper that mirabel had done this will teach her to behave better said elsie to herself nowwhere shall i put the books she decided to put them at the back of the handwork upboard and cover them with the loose raffia there so into the cupboard went the books and then elsie having a few minutes to spare looked round for something else to do she saw the list of classroom duties hung up on the wall and went to read them it was mirabels turn that week to keep the vases wellfilled with water elsie pursed up her lips spitefully ill empty out the waterand then when the flowers begin to droop miss jenks will notice and mirabel will get ticked off for forgetting the water thought elsie so but of the window went the water from the four big vases the flowers were hurriedly replaced just as the first bdl went for lessons the second form trooped in to take their places alison went to hold the door for miss jenks mirabel took a look round at the girls hoping to get a smile from some one she was longing to say that she meant to turn over a new leaf but nobody looked at her except elsie who nudged anna and then turned away shes coming hissed alison the class stopped lounging over their desks and talking they stood up and waited in silence miss jenks was very strict about politeness and good manners in her class good morning girls said the mistress putting her books on her desk sit please we will good gracious alison what is that you are wearing on your left wrist a bracelet said alison sulkily the girls looked at it and giggled it was very like one that miss quentin wore alison loved to wear anything that even remotely resembled her beloved miss quentins belongings alison i am getting tired of asking you to remove bows and brooches and bracelets and goodness knows what said miss jenks what with putting up with mirabels stupidities and your vanities im going really grey miss jenks had flaming red hair with not a scrap of grey in it the girls smiled but were not certain enough of miss jenkss temper that day to laugh out loud bring me that bracelet alison said miss jenks in a tired voice you can have it back in a weeks time providing that during that tune i havent had to remove any other frills and fancies from you alison sulkily gave up the bracelet she knew it was iftfle that no jewellery should be worn with school but the little featherhead was always trimming up with something or other now please get out your maths books and the ise you did for prep and we will go on to the next of sums said miss jenks its much the same as ioiie we did yesterday work them out please and is any difficulty let me know come up one by las i call you with your maths exercise paper and i correct it at my desk with you class got busy desks were opened and books got pencils were taken from boxes exercise books opened and there was a general air of getting down ird work filirabel hunted all through her desk for her maths how curious it didnt seem to be there aye you borrowed my maths book she asked janet a whisper no whispering said miss jenks who had ears like a x what is it mirabel one of your usual interitions i suppose no miss jenks said mirabel meekly i cant find maths book thats all mirabel youre always pretending you cant find this that said miss jenks get your book at once and but miss jenks it really isnt here said mirabelfiflinting frantically through her desk again the girls ifjfltidged one another and grinned they all knew where spit was at the back of the handwork cupboard mirabel look through her desk all day but she wouldnt jlnd her book offk ooo share janets book then said miss jenks shortlyonly halfbelieving mirabel mirabel heaved a sigh of jf relief and opened her arithmetic book to copy down the sums from janets textbook she put ready her maths paper which she had done in prep the night before to show to miss jenks but as she turned it over the right way she stared at it in horror it was covered with inkspots just as ive made up my mind to turn over a new leaf all these things happen thought mirabel in dismay i cant imagine how i got that ink on my paper miss jenks will never believe i didnt know it was there mirabel was rightmiss jenks didnt believe it she looked in disgust at the untidy paper she would not even correct it another of your nice little ways i suppose she said do it again please miss jenks i really didnt make all those inkspots said mirabel but she had given in too many badlydone papers before on purpose for miss jenks suddenly to believe her now i dont want to discuss the matter said miss jenks do it all again and let me have it this evening without any mess on it at all mirabel went back to her desk she caught elsies spiteful smile but she did not guess yet that there was a campaign against her she sat down angry and puzzled the french class came next and mirabel discovered to her dismay that not only her french books but also the french paper she had written out the day before as homework had disappeared she hunted through her desk again and again and mamzelle grew sarcastic mirabel is it possible for you to come out of your desk before the lesson is ended soon i shall forget what your face is like mamzelle im sorry but i cant seem to find the french paper i did yesterday said mirabel emerging from her desk flushed and worried if there was one thing that mamzelle could not stand it was the nonappearance of any work she had set the class to do she frowned and her glasses slid down her big nose the girls watched gleefully the knew the signs of gathering wrath mamzelle replaced her glasses on the bridge of her nose ah mirabel you cannot seem to find the work you id you say how many tunes have i heard that excuse since i have been here at st clares a thousand times ten thousand times i you have not done the work do not deny it i know you are a tiresome girlyou have been tiresome ever since the first day you came you will always be tiresome you will give me that work before the end of the morning or you will not play lacrosse this afternoon but mamzelle i really did do it protested mirabel almost in tears i cant find my ordinary french books either theyre gone always this mirabel holds up my class cried mamzelle raising her hands to the ceiling and wagging them in a way that made doris long to imitate her at once she loses thingsshe looks for themshe makes excusesi cannot bear this girl nor can anybody said alison delighted at the success of the trick mirabel flashed an angry glance at her she was beginning to wonder if the girls had had anything to do with the mysterious disappearance of her things its too bad all this happening now she thought mamzelle might believe me i really am speaking the truth but mirabel had so often been silly and untruthful that she had only herself to blame now if no one believed her when she did actually tell the truth she tried once more with mamzelle o jf lease do believe me mamzelle she begged elsie saw me doing the paper last night didnt you elsie indeed i didnt said elsie maliciously ah this untruthful mirabel cried mamzelle you will do me the paper once because you have not done it and again you will do it for me because you have told an untruth mirabel saw her time at break going she would have to do the two papers then she looked round the class for sympathy usually comforting glances were sent from one girl to another when somebody got into trouble but there were no comforting glances for mirabel every one was glad that the nuisance was in trouble poor mirabel her troubles were neverending that morning miss jenks noticed all the drooping flowers in the waterless vases during the next lesson and spoke sharply about it who is roommonitor this week i am said mirabel well look at the flowers said miss jenks it doesnt seem as if they can have a drop of water in the vases by the look of them why i filled them all up yesterday said mirabel indignantly i did really miss jenks went to the nearest vase and tipped it up not a drop of water she said i suppose you will suggest next that somebody has emptiedall the vases mirabel it flashed across the girls mind that some one might actually have done that to pay her back for all the annoying things she had done but it seemed such a mean trickto make flowers die in order to getsomebody into trouble she flushed and said nothing i suppose you thought i would let you miss part of the lesson whilst you filled up the flowers said miss jenks in disgust hilary have you finished answering the questions on the blackboard goodthen just go and get some water for the vases will you mirabel spent the whole of break doing the french paper twice over she guessed now by the grins and nudges among the girls that most of her troubles were due to them and she was angry and hurt just as i had made up my mind to be decent she thought as she wrote out the french papers quickly its beastly of every one she was late for games because she could not put on her coat in time to go to the field with the others alison had sewn up the sleeves well and trulyso tightly that it was impossible to break the stitches mirabel had to go and hunt for a pair of scissors to cut the sewnup sleeves she was almost in tears and then when she put on her wellingtons to go across the muddy fieldpath she squealed in pain nasty little pebbles made her hobble alongand at last she had to stop take off the boots and empty the pebbles into the hedge miss wilton the sports mistress had already started the lacrosse game going youre late mirabel she called stand aside until halftime if you cant bother to be in time you can miss part of the game it was cold standing and watching mirabel felt miserable everybody and everything was against her what was the use of trying to be different miss wilton took her to task at halftime why were you so late you know the time perfectly well you were almost fifteen minutes after the others she waited to hear mirabels excuse the other girls listened they had not bargained for miss wilton enquiring into the matter alison felt uncomfortable she didnt want to get into trouble for sewing up mirabels coatsleeves she did not want another bad report last terms had been very poor and her father had had a good many things to say that were not pleasant to hear mirabel opened her mouth to pour out her woeshow her coatsleeves had been sewn upstones put into her wellingtonsand goodness knows what else done to her then she shut her mouth again how often had she scolded her young brother and sister for telling tales of her when she had made things unpleasant for them she had always said that a talebearer was some one quite impossible the girls deserve to have tales told about them thought mirabel but i shant make myself into something i hate just to get back on them so she said nothing at all well said miss wilton impatiently as you have no excuse it seems take off your coat and join in the second half of the game but next time if you are late you will not play in the game at allyou can just go back to school and ask miss jenks to give you something to do the game went on one or two of the girls began to feel uncomfortable it was decent of mirabel not to give them away you couldnt attack people if they behaved well its time we stopped going for mirabel thought hilary ill tell elsie so tonight a meeting in the common room another meeting this time called by hilary was held that night it was held in the common room every one was there but mirabel who was doing her maths paper all over again in the classroom whats the meeting for asked elsie halfindignant jthat any one but herself should call a meeting its about mirabel said hilary you know she didnt split on us when she had the chance toso i vote we stop playing tricks on her now anyway we pretty well put her through it today i were certainly not going to stop said elsie at once what stop when shes only just begun to learn her lesson shell be as bad as ever if we dont go on showing her we can make things just as tiresome for her as she has made them for us no weve done enough said hilary it makes ine feel rather mean i rather wish we hadnt done quite so many thingsand anyway i dont know who spilt ink over her maths paper and took the water out of the flowers we didnt arrange that who did it there was a silence elsie went red she did not dare to say she had done anything more than had already been arrangedthe others might think her spiteful or mean i believe it was elsie said carlotta suddenly look how red shes gone every one looked elsie scowled of course i didnt do anything she said i dont think we did nearly enough i think a girl who openly says shes jolly well going to make herself too beastly to stay more than half a term ought to be well shown up well she has been shown upby her own self said janet no one would have known anything about her or her private affairs if she hadnt gone round yelling them out i think hilary is rightrwe wont do anything more you talk as if hilary is headgirl said elsie spitefully wellso she was in the first form said bobby losing her temper and let me tell you she was a much better one than you elsie dont forget that anna is headgirl too said pat anna smiled sleepily bobby turned on her at once as if anyone can remember that anna is headgirl or anything i whats the good of a headgirl who is always too lazy to do a single thing weve got two headgirls in this formand one is spiteful and catty and overbearingand the other is fat and lazy shut up bobby said hilary uncomfortably its no good losing your temper like that lets get back to the pointand that is were not going to persecute mirabel any more lets give her a chance and see if todays lessons have taught her anything she knows well enough we have all been working against herand that must be a very horrid experience hilary wentworthif you dont stop talking as if you were head of this form youll be sorry said elsie angered by bobbys candid speech annafor heavens sake sit up and back me up but i dont think youre right said anna in her gentle voice i dont want to persecute mirabel either i dont feel spiteful towards her now youre too lazy to feel anything said elsie surprised and furious at annas unexpected refusal to back her up you know perfectly well that as headgirls we must work togetherand its an unwritten rule that the form go by what we say well i cant work with you in this said anna i may be fat and lazy and all the other things you probably think about me and dont saybut i am not catty so i say as headgirl of the formwe will not continue with our tricks against mirabel well said pat this is going to be difficulttwo headgirls each saying different i suppose wed better put it to the vote which girl we follow nowhands up for anna and doing what she says every single hand went up at once anna grinned for once sat up really straight elsie went white nowhands up those who wish to follow elsie said not a single hand went up of course elsie stood angrily this is what comes of having to stay down with a lot halfbaked firstformers she said her voice trembling wellill tell you who emptied the water out of the vasesand dropped ink on mirabels maths paperit was your precious anna if you want to follow a girl who does things like that and then is ashamed to own up to them well you can she flung herself out of the room and slammed the door loudly anna raised her wellmarked eyebrows well girls she said in her rather drawling voice i assure you i am not guilty every one believed her anna might be lazy and not bother herself or undertake any kind of responsibility but at least she was truthful and honest im not going to count elsie as headgirl any more faid isabel well have only anna come on anna stir yourself and settle things one way or another poor annashe will have to open her eyes and wake up at last said carlottas high voice rather maliciously anna stood up suddenly wellim just as tired of elsies spite and cattiness as you are she said so if youll do with just me as headgirl ill wake up a bit its not been easy trying to work in with elsie im not going to give her away but i just cant bear some of the things she says and does nowits not enough just to stop persecuting mirabel cant we do something positivei mean something to put her right instead of just stopping her being wrong every one gaped at anna this was the first time the big sleepyeyed girl had ever made such a long speech or suggested anything of her own accord hilary thought her suggestion was excellent yesthats the way to do things really she agreed its not enough to stop things going wrongyouve got to set them going the other wayon the right road but i dont for the life of me see how mirabel is terribly difficult i cant see that shes any good at anything at all there isnt anything to work on shes bad at lessonsno good at gameshopeless at artpoor at gym said isabel if there was something she was good at we could make it our startingpointyou know praise her up a bit and give her some selfrespect thats what people need when things have gone wrong then the second form had a great surprise the miserygirl spoke in her rather timid little voice mirabel is good at something awfully good every one stared at gladys in doubleamazement astonished that she should have spoken at all and amazed to hear what she said gladys seemed to shrink under the gaze of so many pairs of eyes she wished she had not spokenbut she had been interested in spite of herself in the scene that had been going onand she had suddenly felt that she would like to help stupid mirabel after allshe had put her arm round her the night before and had been kind in her own awkward way what do you mean said anna wellshes frightfully good at music stammered gladys horrified now to think she had to speak to so many girls at once how do you know asked janet shes never pkyed any instrument hereand she doesnt even open her mouth in the singingclass i know because ive heard her said gladys she was in the musicroom last nightyou know the one next to the bootcupboardand first she played a violinoh st beautifullyand then she pkyed the piano and it all in the dark too in the dark said carlotta in surprise whatever you two doing there in the dark how queer i you usually go and sit in the musicrooms in the dark gladys didnt know what to say she couldnt confess at she often went to the lonely little musicrooms by elf when she felt extra homesickthe girls would ptugh at her and she couldnt bear that she stared at rlotta and said nothing r well cant you answer said carlotta impatiently do you often go and listen to mirabel playing in the rk noof course not said gladys ii just happened be therewhen mirabel came inand she didnt see so i heard her playing you see the girls looked at one another so gladys disappeared sjlfato the dark little musicrooms at nightall alone jjjhat a queer girl she was they looked at her thin lite little face and two or three of them felt a pang of apathy for the miserygirl and her lonely thoughts atever they might be nobody laughed or teased her about being in the dark in the musicroom even down right carlotta made no remark about it you know said janet looking round at the little company of girls mirabel reminds me in some ways of the osullivan twins what do you mean said pat indignantly welldont you remember how awfully difficult you were a year ago when you first came to st clares said janet you just made up your minds to be awkward and you were you ought to understand mirabels point of view and be able to tell us how to tackle her what made you two change your ideas and want to stay here ohas soon as we realized we were acting stupidly and you were friendly to uswe just sort of settled down and loved everything said pat trying to remember that first exciting term right said anna taking charge of the meeting again thats just what well do we think mirabel was decent for not splitting on us todayso well be friendly towards her now instead of beastlyand perhaps if we get her to play to us and praise her up a bitshell settle down too what about it yes anna said every one gladys too hilary gazed in surprise at anna she would never have thought that sleepy anna could have come to the fore like this why she really seemed to be taking a keen interest in everything and taking the lead too perhaps it would be a good thing that the class had broken away from elsies leadership anna seemed as if she was going to take the chance offered to her by the unexpected quarrel sh i here conies mirabel said pat as the door opened at once the girls began to chatter and gabble about anything that came into their heads mirabel looked at them suspiciously she felt sure they had been discussing her horrid things wellif they had boon planning fresh tricks to play on her she would go back to her old ways and upset every single class she could mirabel gives the form a surprise the twins talked together that night when they were in bed their beds were next to one another and they could whisper without any one else hearing what they said we ought to have a few excitements now whispered pat i bet elsie wont sit down under this shell find some way of getting back at annaand all of us as well i hope mirabel will be sensible now said isabel she looked most suspiciously at all of us i thought and she hardly answered janet at all when she spoke to her well im not surprised really said pat with a yawn after allwe did do an awful lot of things to her today it was funny at firstbut i didnt like it much afterwardseven though i must say i think mirabel deserved a little roughhandling i saydidnt you think it was funny gladys speaking up like thatand admitting she was in the musicroom all alone funny kid isnt she pat what janet said was quite true said isabel speaking rather loudly sh i dont speak so loud whispered pat what do you mean well you knowwe did behave a little bit like mirabeland we did hate it when every one disliked us it was a miserable feeling said isabel so lets make a beeline for mirabel tomorrow and buck her up a bit st clares has done a lot for uslets do a bit for mirabel pat isabel if you dont stop talking at once ill report you to miss jenks tomorrow suddenly came elsies sharp voice through the darkness you cant youre not headgirl came carlottas cheeky voice before the twins could answer ill report you too for untidy drawers and cupboard said elsie furiously wellit will only be the fiftieth time i should think said carlotta lazily go ahead miss catty elsie there was a delighted squeal of laughter from the dormitory at this elsie sat up in bed furious carlotta i if you dare to talk like a lowdown circus girl to me she began but at that every one sat up in bed indignant listen began bobby any one who calls carlotta lowdown deserves a spanking with a hairbrush i were all proud of carlottaremember how she saved sadie from being kidnapped last term its you who are lowdown elsie nowjust you remember what i said about that hairbrush elsie was furious she began to tell bobby exactly what she thought of her she forgot to keep her voice low and when miss jenks came along to see that all was quiet in the dormitory she was amazed to hear a voice going on and on in the darknessan angry voice a spiteful voice she switched on the light and stood in silence by the door every girl was sitting up in bed elsies voice died away in horror she stared wideeyed at miss jenks who was that talking just now enquired miss jenks in her cool voice nobody answered elsie simply could not bear to own up she swallowed hard hoping that miss jenks would deliver a general lecture and go miss jenks didnt she just stood and waited who is in charge of this dormitory she asked oh you i suppose elsieas you are one of the headgirls for this form wellas the culprit does not seem to have enough courage to own up perhaps you as headgirl will see to it that the girl is punished by going to bed one hour earlier tomorrow will you yes miss jenks answered elsie in a very subdued tone there was a smothered giggle from carlottas bed hurriedly turned into a loud cough you seem to have a cold carlotta said miss jenks pretending to be quite concerned perhaps you had better go to matron tomorrow morning and get a dose of medicine for it oh i shall be quite all right tomorrow morning miss jenks thank you carlotta hurriedly assured her good night girls said miss jenks and switched off the light as soon as her footsteps had died away the girls began to giggle and whisper elsie see you put yourself to bed an hour earlier tomorrow whispered carlotta elsie lay in bed her cheeks burning why hadnt she owned up then she wouldnt have been so humiliated i she jolly well wouldnt go to bed early the next night anyway she shut her ears with her fingers so as not to hear what the girls were whispering she did not dare to tell them to stopand as for threatening to report themwell that would make them laugh all the more every one felt scornful of elsiebut they also thought the whole thing was funny the girls were quite determined that elsie should go to bed early the next night they were not going to let her off the punishment she had meekly promised to give to wreak on the culprit the next day the twins gave mirabel a cheerful grin at the breakfasttable she smiled back surprised and wanned she had been expecting a few more tricks and the unexpected smile surprised her very much after breakfast pat and isabel spoke to mirabel did you hear about the row in our dormitory last night asked pat i knew there was something up said mirabel i heard the others talking about it what was it the twins told mirabel about elsie and miss jenks and the girl smiled thanks for telling me she said it was funny i sayis the form going to do beastly things to me today you know id just decided to turn over a new leafwhen you did all those things had you really decided to change said pat in surprise welldont worrywere not going to get back at you any more but for goodness sake do your bit too its pretty sickening having class after class upset you know you may feel in a temper about your homeaffairsbut that really isnt any reason for venting your temper on the class noi see that now said mirabel im an idiot always have been welli bet youll be glad to see the back of me at halfterm wait and see said isabel i sayour form is giving a concert next week in aid of the red cross every one is to do something could you play the violin for us do you think and perhaps the piano too how do you know i play asked mirabel in surprise but at that moment miss jenks bustled the whole class off for a naturewalk and mirabel found herself walking with the timid gladys who remembering the night in the dark musicroom felt afraid to say a word mirabel felt awkward too so the two hardly exchanged a single word the twins when the chance came hurriedly told the rest of the form that they had asked mirabel to play at the concert planned for the following week every form had been asked to get up something in aid of the red cross and this was to be the second forms contribution did she say she would asked bobby nobut well put her name down on the programme said pat i bet she will i she was quite nice this morning mirabel found her books back in her desk that day anna had taken them from their hidingplace and put them back elsie had scowled but had said nothing she didnt know whom she hated mostannaor that saucy carlotta when the programme for the red cross concert was drawn up that evening isabel called across to mirabel hie mirabel ive put you down for a violin solo and a piano solo what will you play can you tell us the names of the pieces i havent my violin here said mirabel hesitatingly poohyou can easily send a telegram home for it said pat and anna will lend you hers to practise on this weekwont you anna of course said anna ill go and get it now and you can see if you like the feel of it its a good one anna went to fetch her violin she took it out of its case and put it into mirabels hands as she had said it was a good one mirabel drew the bow across it lovingly play something said isabel and then as in the dark musicroom mirabel played some of the melodies she loved she forgot the girls in the common room she forgot st clares she forgot herself she was a real little musician and she put all her heart into the music she loved the girls listened spellbound two or three girls in the school played the violin very wellbut mirabel made it speak the notes rang out pure and true and anna was amazed that her violin could produce such music when mirabel stopped every one clapped frantically i say you are marvellous said pat her eyes shining gollyyoull make every one sit up at the concert next week i can tell you now go and play something on the piano go on you simply must mirabel looked round at the admiring audience with flushed cheeks and bright eyes only elsie fanshawe did not applaud she sat at a table reading a book taking no notice at all go on mirabelplay us something on the piano insisted pat mirabel went across to the old piano in the common room it was there for the girls to strum on if they wanted to usually dance music or popular songs were hammered out on itbut tonight something quite different was played mirabels long sensitive fingers ran over the notes and one of chopins nocturnes filled the quiet common room most of the girls loved good music and they listened in delight gladys shut her eyes music always stirred her very much though she learnt no instrument and knew little about it the notes died away the girls sat up pleased look hereplay that at the concert next week said hilary its heavenly i heard it on the wireless in the holsbut you play it much better i dont said mirabel red with embarrassment and pleasure all rightill play it and if you really want me to play something on the violin too ill send a telegram tomorrow asking for my own violin to be sent annas is a lovely onebut im more at home with my own good said isabel i sayarent you a dark horse never saying a word about your musickeeping it up your sleeve like that youve got a real gift i wish i had a gift youre lucky mirabel went to help isabel to draw up the programme her words echoed in her mind youve got a real gift she remembered miss theobalds words too difficult children often have some hidden qualitysome giftsomething to make them worthwhile nobody at home thought her worthwhileor surely they wouldnt have sent her away but she was worthwhile see how the girls loved hearing her play it was a pity she hadnt accepted her fathers offer to learn music at st clares she had no other gift but music and she had refused to develop that out of obstinacy i bet you could pass any music exam you went in for said isabel handing mirabel a few programmes to print nobody in our form is specially good at music its a pity you dont learn you would be a credit to usyoud make some of the topformers sit up i bet and i guess youd win the musicprize wellill certainly send that telegram tomorrow said mirabel printing the programmes neatly she felt happy for the first time that term it was nice to be working in friendliness with some one like isabel it was lovely to be praised for something nobody thought a great deal of her music at home because none of them were musicalexcept her brotherand dear me how she snubbed him mirabel felt annoyed with herself when she remembered that she ought to have encouraged him i really must have been tiresome she thought wellgoing away from home does make you see things clearly when i go back at halfterm ill show them im not as bad as they think that night at eight oclock all the second form winked at one another if elsie was going to bed an hour earlier it was time she went but she showed no sign she had come back from supper and had settled down to read again saying nothing to anybody bedtime for little girls said carlotta elsie took no notice naughty girls must go to bed early said bobby loudly elsie did not move the girls looked at one another it was quite clear that elsie was not going to get up and go she had not only been afraid to own up to miss jenks the night beforebut she was nowlgoing to evade the punishment i to every ones surprise anna spoke elsie j she said you know perfectly well what you have to do dont make us all ashamed of you you cant talk to me like that said elsie turning over a page i can said anna calmly i am headgirl of the form i have the right to tell you what to do you havent said elsie furiously im headgirl too youre not youre not cried a dozen voices we only recognize anna as headgirl now we dont want you only miss jenks can decide a thing like that said elsie looking round at the girls perhaps you are right said anna in her slow voice come with me and we will let miss jenks decide hilary looked at anna in admiration she knew that this was the one thing that would defeat elsie on no account would elsie go to miss jenks at the moment it would be far too humiliating elsie hesitated the girls waited they knew elsie would not consent to go with anna anna stood up as if she was going im not going to miss jenks said elsie in a low voice i thought not said anna and sat down again welleither miss jenks decides this matter or the girls do i dont mind well decideweve already decided said janet anna is our headgirl and we dont want elsie and that being so elsieyoull just do as anna says and go off to bed its your own silly fault that was too much for elsie her obstinacy rose up and she pursed her thin lips im not going she said im not obeying anna she may be your headgirl but i wont admit shes mine right said carlotta cheerfully getting up come on bobbyjanettwins get hold of elsie and well bump her all the way upstairs to bed we cant have her disobeying miss jenkss orders like this my word wont the third form stare when we go by with poor elsie nodont cried elsie in dismay jumping to her feet she knew the wild little carlotta would stop at nothing ill go ill go but i hate you all she burst into tears and with loud sobs went to the door carlotta sat down when elsie had gone she looked round i didnt really mean us to bump her up the stairs to bed she said but i guessed shed go of her own accord if i suggested it shell be awful tomorrow said bobby anna shook her big head no she said i know elsie she will begin to feel a martyr and terribly sorry for herself she will try to get our sympathy by being subdued and meek yesi think youre right said janet wellthe best thing is not to take any notice of her at all we dont want to get spitefuljust lets leave her alone and take no notice at all thats the best thing said anna she took up her knitting again oh dearbeing the only headgirl is very wearing there seem so many things to decide anna sees the headmistress the next morning mirabel wanted to send her telegram anna told her what to do youll have to go and get permission from miss theobald then you can slip down into the town with somebody after morning school she said ill go with you if you like mirabel went to ask permission she knocked at miss theobalds door and was told to come in the head mistress looked up she did not smile what is it mirabel she asked please miss theobald may i send a telegram home asked mirabel still miss theobald did not smile or unbend in any way she looked really stern mirabel began to feel very uncomfortable what is the telegram about she asked you know that you cannot leave before halfterm there is no sense in upsetting your household with telegrams its nothing to do with my leaving said mirabel itsitswell miss theobald i just want to ask my mother if shell send my violin thats all the head looked surprised your violin she said why you dont learn music do you no saidmirabel i wish i did now but i wouldnt when daddy gave me the chance you see the second form are giving a concert for the red cross next weekand i said i would play for them id like my own violin to play on its a beauty miss theobald looked at mirabel so you have a gift mirabel she said you remember what i said to you i wonder if there is anything worthwhile in you after all mirabel went red she stood on first one foot and then on another she felt certain that miss theobald had had bad reports of her from every mistress im not sure that i shall let you ask for your violin said miss theobald at last i hear that you misbehave at practically every class you try to spoil everything it seems how do i know that you will behave at the concert i will said mirabel earnestly you wont believe me perhapsbut ive turned over a new leaf now ive got tired of being silly i see said miss theobald youve stopped misbehaving just because youre tired of itnot because youre ashamed of it or want to do better or want us to think well of you only just because youre tired of it you disgust me mirabel go please im disappointed in you i had hoped that possibly you might turn over a new leaf for some better motive i thought i saw some courage in you some real intelligence that might help you to realize your foolishness and selfishness in behaving as you did now i see that you have noneyou only stop because you yourself are tired of misbehaviour and possibly are tired also of having the others unfriendly towards you please go mirabel was struck with horror at the cold stern words she had felt so pleased with herself to think she was turning over a new leaf she had been ashamed of herself she hadnt only got tired of being silly she opened her mouth to defend herself but the sight of miss theobalds stern face frightened her she went out of the room without a word miss theobald sat and thought for a few minutes then she rang her bell ask miss jenks to come to me for a few minutes she told the maid miss jenks soon appeared sit down for a moment said miss theobald i want to talk to you about mirabel unwin i have had continual bad reports from you about her is there any improvement at all yes said miss jenks at once she seems suddenly to be settling down i dont quite know why has anything happened i saw her just now and she looked as if she had been crying probably she had said miss theobald and told miss jenks what had just passed between her and mirabel i should like to know if the girl has suddenly changed for the right reasons or the wrong ones she said perhaps the headgirls could tell me send them will you there seems to be some sort of upset between the two headgirls of my form said miss jenks i dont think elsie fanshawe has gone down very well with the firstformers who came up into my form but anna seems unexpectedly to be showing some signs of responsibility and leadership ill go and send the two girls to you perhaps they can tell you more about mirabel personally i think we might give her a chance now and let her have her violin she left the room and went to find anna and elsie they were in the common room with the others as the door opened and miss jenks appeared all the girls rose to their feet and stopped chattering janet turned off the wireless miss theobald wants the two headgirls to go to her for a few minutes said miss jenks in her cool voice will you go at once please she left the room there was a silence anna stood up to go so did elsie but quick as thought carlotta pulled her down again to her chair youre not headgirl elsie you know youre not we wont have youand if we wont have you then anna is the only headgirl you are not going to miss theobald dont be an idiot snapped elsie scrambling up again you know ive got to go i cant tell miss theobald im no longer headgirl well anna can said hilary its unfortunate elsiebut we all happen to think the same about this you were a bad headgirland we wont accept you you wouldnt let miss jenks decide ityou accepted our decisionand youve got to abide by it anna must go alone shes not to shes not to said elsie halfcrying its shameful what will miss theobald think you should have thought of these things before said hilary anna go say as little as you can about elsie of coursebut please let it be understood that you are the only headgirl of the second form now anna went elsie saw that the whole of the second form would stop her by force if she tried to follow so she lay back in her chair looking as forlorn and miserable as she could letting the tears trickle down her cheeks she hoped that the girls would feel uncomfortable and very sorry but nobody did in fact they took no notice of her at all and went on cheerfully chattering among themselves it was saturday morning and except for an hours lessons they were free to do as they chose mirabel was not there she had had a shock and it had upset her very much she did not want anyone to see that she had been crying so she had gone to the cloakroom to bathe her eyes she came out of the room just as anna passed it on her way to the head anna spoke to her hallo i did you get permission from the head to send for your violin ill come down to the postoffice with you if you like i didnt get permission said mirabel miserably anna miss theobald was awful to me she thinks ive only turned over a new leaf because i was tired of being an idiot but i havent im awfully ashamed of myself now it was dreadful having you all doing beastly things to me the very day id made up my mind to do better and now even miss theobald is against me whats the use of trying its just no good at all i shant play at the concert i shant do anything anna stared at mirabel surprised look here i cant wait now she said ive been sent for by the head but ill have a talk with you afterwards see im awfully sorry mirabel really i am cheer up she ran down the passage to miss theobalds drawingroom and knocked come in said the heads pleasant voice anna entered halfscared miss theobald was kind and just but her wisdom and dignity awed every girl and it was quite an ordeal to go for any kind of interview good morning anna said miss theobald where is elsie fanshawe elsie isnt headgirl now miss theobald said anna feeling awkward miss theobald looked most surprised i hadnt heard this she said why isnt she we all decided that she wasnt quite fit to be at present said anna finding it difficult to explain without giving elsie away too much miss jenks knows nothing of this said the head why didnt you ask her advice elsie didnt want us to said anna she said she would rather accept our decision without us taking matters any further itsits rather difficult to explain miss theobald without telling tales did hilary wentworth and the osullivan twins agree to this asked the head she had great faith in the fairness and common sense of these three girls oh yes said anna i wouldnt have done it myself im too lazy im afraid but once the girls wanted me to accept responsibility and carry on without elsie i had to take it of course said miss theobald sensing in anna something better and stronger than she had known before in the lazy slowmoving girl welli wont ask any more questions anna i think probably the second form are rightall i hope is that some good will come out of this for elsie i can see an improvement in you already anna blushed responsibility was a nuisancebut it did bring definite rewards not the least of which was an added selfrespect anna i sent for you because i want to ask you about mirabel unwin said miss theobald i always take the headgirls of any form into my confidence as you know will you tell me what your opinion is of mirabelwhether it is bad or goodanything that can help me in dealing with her you know all the details as to why she was sent here because she has told the whole school anna seldom wasted words she said shortly what miss theobald wanted to know mirabel has been awfully tiresome and the second form punished her for it shes ashamed of herself nowand she wants to show us shes some good could you let her send for her violin very well said miss theobald smiling at annas directness i refused her permission a little while ago will you as headgirl tell her i have changed my mind and she can go down and send off the telegram tell her too that i shall like to hear her play at the second form concert yes miss theobald said anna thank you the i left the room pleased for the first time in her lazy life she felt that she had some importance the head had sent for her and actually listened to her it was worth making an effort if people like miss theobald appreciated it she went to look for mirabel she found her in the common room reading rather soberly her eyes still red mirabel come on down to the postoffice and send that telegram said anna miss theobald says you may and she says she will look forward to hearing you play at the concert next week mirabel looked up astonished and delighted this was a lovely surprise after having her hopes dashed and her good resolutions misunderstood she stood up glowing anna its because of you miss theobald said i could send the telegram thanks awfully youre a brick it wasnt altogether me said anna hurry up and get your coat on we havent much time they hurried down to the postoffice the telegram was sent offand caused much surprise in mirabels home she wants her violin said her mother in astonishment why she must be settling down a bit i am glad so the violin was packed up registered and sent off at once it arrived on the monday of the week following and mirabel unpacked it joyfully her own violin now she would be able to play beautifully she would show the second form what real music was and ill astonish miss theobald a bit too thought mirabel shell see i have a real gifteven if i havent anything else id like her to think i was worthwhile i really would gladys is surprising the second form were very busy preparing for their concert they were going to charge sixpence for the tickets and all the first form most of the third form and even a few of the higher form girls had promised to come all the mistresses had promised too it was to be quite a big affair the girls were to manage everything themselves they prepared the programmes and the tickets isabel drew a fine big poster and coloured it she put it up in the big assembly room where every one could see it the concert was to be held in the gym where there was a fine platform the second form grew quite excited about it too excited for mamzelles liking she could not bear to feel that the class were thinking about something else in her lessons isabel pat did you not sleep last night that you dream so this morning what was the question i have just asked the class the twins stared at mamzelle in alarm neither of them had heard the question carlotta whispered softly she said has anyone here seen my glasses whispered carlotta grinning this was quite untrue as everyone knew but the twins fell into the trap at once they stared innocently at mamzelle seeing her glasses perched as usual on her big nose well said mamzelle sharply what did i ask the class you asked if we had seen your glasses anywhere said pat but they are on your nose mamzelle there was a squeal of laughter from the class mamzelle banged on her desk angrily ah que vous ties abominable she cried insupportable the twins glared at carlotta who was holding her sides she shook her head at them tears of laughter in her eyes wait till break you wretch said pat taisezvous said mamzelle pat i isabel of what were you thinking just now when i addressed the class be truthful well mamzellei was thinking of the concert our form is holding on saturday said pat im sorry my thoughts just wandered away so did mine said isabel if they wander away again i shall not come to the concert threatened mamzelle there was a loud and universal groan we shant hold the concert unless you come you must come mamzelle i you laugh louder than any one i will come if you write me a nice composition said mamzelle suddenly beaming again you shall write me a beautiful essay and tell me all that is to happen at this wonderful concert with no mistakes at all that will please me greatly that shall be your prep for tomorrow the girls groaned again french essays were awful to doand this one would be difficult anyway the idea had put mamzelle into a better temper so that was something two girls were doing nothing in the concert at all elsie had refused to do anything and had announced her intention of not even coming and nobody had asked the little miserygirl to do anything every one felt certain that gladys would not and could not do a thing they thought it would be kinder to leave her out altogether gladys was hurt because she was not asked yet glad isabel painted a big poster for the concert that she was not pressed to do anything she shut more and more up into herself only spoke when she was spoken to and was so quiet in every lesson that the teachers hardly knew she was there only in miss quentins class did she show any real animation not that miss quentin ever asked her to act a part because like everyone else miss quentin always passed over gladys thinking that such a little mouse could never do anything but gladys watched the others acting and for once in a way forgot to brood over her troubles when she saw bobby strutting across the room as a king or duke and carlotta playing the part of a jester alison adored miss quentins classes she really did work hard in thoseharder than she worked in any one elses for one thing she was pretty and graceful and parts such as princesses or fairies were given naturally to her and for another thing she lived for miss quentins words of praise she thought miss quentin was just wonderful the preparations for the concert went on well doris was to give some of her clever imitations she meant to mimic mamzelle who had all kinds of mannerisms which were a joy to the class she meant to imitate clara the cook a jolly roughandready person much liked by the girls and she meant to dress up as matron and imitate her doling out advice and medicine to various girls doris you really are a scream said bobby enjoying the girls clever performance in rehearsal you ought to be on the stage im going to be a doctor said doris ohwell youll be a jolly good one because youll make all your patients scream with laughter said bobby every one was doing somethingeither reciting playing the piano or violin singing or dancingevery one that is except elsie and gladys carlotta was going to give a display of acrobatics she was marvellous at such circus tricks as turning cartwheels walking on her hands and so on you and doris carlotta will be the hits of the evening said pat she and isabel were going to give a dialogue supposed to be funny but they both felt it was not nearly so good as any one elses contribution bobby was to do conjuring tricks she was very good at these and had a lot of idiotic patter that fell from her lips in a neverending torrent i bet mirabel will be a hit too said janet after the girl had played her concert piece to them during rehearsal good thing we found out she could play by the wayhow did you find out asked mirabel putting her violin into its case i kept meaning to ask you i didnt think anybody knew yessomebody did said janet looking round to see if gladys was in the room but she was not it was gladys who told us gladys said mirabel suddenly remembering the night in the dark musicroom yesof courseshe heard me that night she said you were in the dark said pat so that means she was too funny kid isnt she sitting about in dark rooms all by herself she really is a little misery i cant think whats the matter with her she never tells anyone if she did we might help her a bitget a smile out of her occasionally or something ohshe told me whats the matter said mirabel remembering everything gladys had said did she said bobby in surprise well what is the matter with her its her mother said mirabel shes in hospital awfully illperhaps shes going to die gladys said shes only got her motherno father or brothers or sisters and they were sort of allinall to one another shed never been away from her mother even for a night till she was sent here when her mother went to hospital she said she was awfully homesick and missed her mother terribly i suppose she thinks every day she may hear bad news or something the girls heard all this in silence they felt sorry and uncomfortable the little miserygirl really did have something to worry about everyone there but carlotta had mothers they lovedand fathersand most of them had brothers and sisters even slowminded anna who had little imagination knew for one short moment the sort of heartache that gladys carried with her day and night why didnt you tell us this asked bobby i didnt remember it till now said mirabel well i think you should have told us at once said hilary we might have been decenter to gladys shes a poor little thing without any courage or spunkbut we havent exactly made things any easier for her you really are to blame for not having told us mirabel mirabel was really consciencestricken she couldnt think how she could have forgotten gladyss troubles she had been so wrapped up in her own and then when the girls had become friendly and helped her she had been so happy that she had not given a thought to the little miserygirl she stared unhappily at hilary im sorry she said i should have told you all the same i dont think gladys would like it if she knew that everyone knew about her troubles so dont tell her you know just be nice to her and notice her a bit the second form received this advice in silence mirabel sensed that they did not think very much of her for forgetting another persons troubles she said no more but went off to put her violin away i wonder where gladys is she thought ive a good mind to hunt for her and ask her if shes heard any news of her mother lately after all it might help a bit if someone shares the news with her mirabel went to look for gladys she could not seem to find the girl anywhere it was puzzling well she simply must be somewhere said mirabel to herself i wonder if shes up in the boxrooms i saw her coming down from there the other day and wondered whatever had taken her there she went up the stairs to the top of the school trunks and bags were kept in the attics but little else there was a light showing under the door of one of the attics and from the room came a voice it didnt sound like gladyss voice it was deep and strong mirabel listened in surprise the voice was declaiming one of the speeches in the tempest which the second form were taking that term with miss jenks thats not gladys thought mirabel i wonder who it is ahnow theres a different voice there must be two or three people there but who can they be only the second form are doing the tempest this termand ail but gladys were at rehearsal this evening a third voice spoke gentle and feminine mirabel could bear it no longer she really must see who the speakers were they were declaiming shakespeares words beautifully she opened the door the voice stopped at once mirabel stared into the room expecting to see three or four people there rehearsing the play but there was only one person theregladys golly its only you said mirabel in astonishment i thought there must be lots here i heard all kinds of different voices was it you yes said gladys go away cant i even do this in peace what are you doing asked mirabel going into the room and shutting the door do tell me it sounded fine do you know it all by heart yes i do said gladys i love acting i always have but miss quentin never gives me a chance in the drama class i could act the parts well i know i could you see me act bobbys part in that play were doing with miss quentin and before mirabels astonished eyes the girl began to act the part that had been given to bobby but she acted it superbly she was the part the little miserygirl faded and another character came into the attic someone with a resonant voice a strong character and a fierce face it was extraordinary mirabel stood and gaped her astonishment and admiration were so plain that gladys was impelled to show her another part in the playmariettas part here again she was twice as good as the fiery carlotta and her voice wild and strong quite different from gladyss usual meek milkandwater voice rang through the attic gladys i youre simply marvellous said mirabel youre to come and show the girls come on come on downstairs at once i never saw anything like it in my life you to act like that i who would have thought it youre such a mouse and your voice is so quietand yet when you act youre somebody and you quite frighten me you simply must come down and show the girls what you can do no said gladys becoming herself again and looking naif the size she had seemed two minutes before oh gladys said mirabel suddenly remembering why she had been looking for the girl gladyshows your mother i do hope youve got good news thank youits just about the same said gladys mother cant even write to me shes so ill if i could just get a letter from her it would be something does she get your letters asked mirabel of course said gladys i keep telling her how much i miss her and how lonely and unhappy i am without her but gladyshow silly said mirabel what do you mean asked gladys half indignantly mother wants to know that i should have thought she would have been much gladder to think you were trying to settle down and be happy said mirabel it must make her very miserable indeed to feel you are so lonely and sad i should think it would make her worse it wont said gladys her eyes filling with tears if she thought i was happy here and getting other interests she would think i was forgetting her i do think youre silly gladys said mirabel wishing she was hilary or anna so that she might know the best way of tackling some one like gladys dont you want your mother to be proud of you shell think you are an awful cowardno spunk at alljust giving in like this and weeping and wailing oh you are hateful cried gladys as if my mother would ever think things like that of me ever go away i wont come down with you and dont you dare to tell any one what you saw me doing its my secret youd no right to come spying like that go away mirabel looked at gladyss angry little face and wondered what to do or say she hadnt done any good that was certain i suppose i havent got the character to help people properly like hilary or anna thought mirabel going soberly downstairs ive got a lot to learn when i go home at halfterm next week ill really try and do better she went down to the library to get a book but as she hunted through the shelves she kept thinking of gladys she couldnt just do nothing if she mirabel couldnt help gladys maybe somebody else could hilary could she was always so sensible so was bobbyand the twins too she would go and tell them what had happened and leave it to them to do what they could mirabel was beginning to have a very low opinion of herself and her powers she left the library and went to find hilary she was lucky enough to see her in a musicroom with bobby janet and the twins practising something for the concert good this was just the chance to tell them what had happened i a disappointment for the second form i say said mirabel opening the door can i interrupt a moment i suppose so said bobby whats up its about gladys said mirabel and she told them how she had found the girl acting all by herself in the boxroom then she went on to tell them what she had said to gladys and how she had failed to help heronly made her angry well said hilary listening intently i think mirabel you gave gladys some very sound advice really i do of course gladys ought to stop moaning to her mother she must find a little pluck somewhere or shell go to pieces you did right to say that it would help her mother if she knew gladys was settling down and trying to do well ohim glad you think that said mirabel im not so good as you are at knowing what to do for the best for people by the waygladys said she didnt wantme to tell everybody well you havent said hilary youve only told us fiveand we understand perfectly but mirabel as it seems that gladys has taken you into her confidence and nobody else i think youd better go on tackling the matter yes said all the others oh no said mirabel horrified i came to ask you to help im no good at this sort of thing well its time you were said hilary firmly now come on mirabelwe all tried to help you when you needed ityouve got to do the same to gladys be friends with her and buck her upand if you can persuade her to show us how she can act well all listen and applaud and she must be in the concert she cant be its the day after tomorrow and all the programmes are written out objected isabel we really cant write them all out again she wouldnt want to be in the concert anyhow said mirabel all right hilaryill do what i can but i really am very bad at this sort of thing it was distasteful to mirabel to mention the matter to gladys again she always felt awkward at anything involving tact or understanding in anothers troubles she would very much rather have left it to the others still once she said she would do a thing she did it gladys was surprised and not too pleased to find mirabel always at her elbow the next day gladys i didnt mean to make you angry mirabel said when they were alone for a few minutes im clumsy in what i say i know i am but i really and truly am sympathetic i dont expect i can help at allbut id like to well said gladys looking at mirabels earnest face i was angry yesterday nobody likes being told theyre cowardly but i thought it all over and in some ways i think youre right i shouldnt keep writing to my mother and telling her how miserable and lonely i am i know it would worry herand that might keep her from getting well yes it might said mirabel pleased that what she had said had after all had some effect on gladys i say look herewouldnt she be thrilled if she knew you were in the concertacting like thatbeing clapped by everybody i do wish youd let the girls see you act gladys hesitated she did know quite certainly that her mother would be pleased to hear of any success she madebut she was such a mouse so afraid of everything it would be a real ordeal to show off in front of the girls and of course she couldnt possibly be in the concert she would be scared out of her life i mirabel saw her hesitate and she went on pressing her gladys come onbe a sport lookif youll show what you can do and get the girls to put you into the concert ill write to your mother myself and tell her how well you did see because i know youll do well and then think how pleased shell be the thought of mirabel actually writing to her mother for her touched gladys more than anything else could have done she stared at mirabels earnest face and tried to blink back the tears that came far too easily you are a good sort she said rather chokily you really are i thought at first you were such a selfish coldhearted sort of girlbut youre not be friends with me mirabel you havent any friend here and neither have i ill do anything you ask me if youll be friends well said mirabel remembering that it was the halfterm the following week im leaving soon you know at halfterm i never meant to stay longer than that so its not much use your being friends with me really because ill soon be gone oh said gladys turning away thats just my luck people i like always go away now dont start that sort of thing again said mirabel halfimpatiently all right ill be your friend till i gobut mind youve got to be sensible and do what i say and the first thing i say isyouve got to show the girls how you can act it was quite pleasant to have some one taking such an interest in her gladys felt warmed and looked gratefully at mirabel she was a weak timid character mirabel was strong and decided even though she was often wrong yesi will show the girls if you want me to gladys said well after tea in the common room this evening you show them said mirabel ill clap like anything at the end so you neednt be afraid perhaps the girls will put you in the concert after all when they see how good you are isabel said something about not being able to alter the programmesbut im sure it could be done i could help mirabel felt rather proud of having got her own way with gladys she told hilary and the others and they looked forward with interest to seeing what gladys could do that evening it certainly was a surprise to every one gladys looked terribly nervous at first and her voice shook but in a minute or two as she forgot herself and threw herself heart and soul into the part she was acting it seemed as if the little miserygirl was no longer there but some one quite different that nobody had seen before gladys acted many parts from different shakespeare playslady macbethmirandamalvoliohamlet she knew them all by heart her mother had been very fond of shakespeares works and the two of them had studied them together evening after evening gladyss dead father had been a fine actor and gladys had inherited the gift gladys stopped at last changing from bottom the weaver to her own timid self the girls roared with delight at her and clapped loudly you monkey fancy not telling us you could do all that said pat youll bring the house down at the concert i i saywe simply must put her in cant we possibly please please dont begged gladys in alarm i couldnt possibly do it in front of most of the school well i might if id more time to rehearse with you but the concerts tomorrow i should die if you made me be in it please dont wellif you feel so strongly about it i suppose well have to leave you out said janet is there by any chance anything else youve kept us in the dark about can you paint marvellous picturesor work wonderful sums in your head gladys laughedthe first laugh since she had been at st clares theres only one other thing im good at she said thats lacrosse well you dont seem to have shone there to any great extent said bobby in surprise i know i didnt bother said gladys i just didnt care whether i ran fast or not or scored a goal or anything thats why miss wilton kept making me goal keeper i expect she thought i was only good for stopping goals not for anything else but i can play well if i try i was in the top team at my day school good said mirabel well make you shoot dozens of goals and then you can write that to your mother too sony about your mother gladys said hilary tell us any news you get were all interested gladys went to bed really happy that night she had a friend she had been clapped and applauded she had thrown off her reserve and let the other girls speak to her of her mother things didnt seem so bad now for the first time she fell asleep without lying and worrying in the middle of the night five of the girls lay and tossed restlessly pat and isabel doris bobby and carlotta could not sleep their throats hurt them they coughed and sneezed it was most annoyingbecause the concert was to be the next evening i i shant be able to speak a word thought doris as she tried to ease her throat this really is bad luck i cant possibly be in the concert blow i was so looking forward to it in the morning all five went along to matron feeling very miserable and sorry for themselves she took their temperatures youve got the horrid cold that has been running round the school she said briskly youve all got temperatures except carlottaand it would take a lot to give her one but she can go to bed just the same to the san all of you but matronits the concert tonight said bobby hoarsely we cant possibly go to bed put your coats on and your hats and scarves said matron taking no notice of bobby at all and go across to the san immediately youve all got the same feverish cold thats plaincaught the chill watching lacrosse in that cold wind the other day i supposeso the germ found you easy prey bobby are you deaf go and get your coat and hat at once and dont stand arguing it never was any good trying to argue with matron she had dealt with girls for many many years and bed and warmth and the right medicine in her opinion cured most things very quickly so concert or no concert the five girls were bundled into bed in the san and there they lay moaning about the concert and wondering what was going to happen it didnt take the rest of the form long to decide what was to happen we cant possibly hold the concert without those five said hilary doris was one of the stars said janet and bobby said hilary and carlotta too it would be a very weak affair without those three well have to postpone it well have it next week we cant said anna the third form are having theirs well the week after then said hilary that will give the invalids time to get over their colds i hope nobody else feels like sneezing or coughing if they do for goodness sake go to the san and get it over so that we can have the concert all right in a fortnights time gladys can be in it this time said kathleen that makes another good performer oh good said anna looking at gladys that will he fine youll have loads of time to practise and rehearse now gladys gladys couldnt help feeling thrilled she did love actingand it would be fun to rehearse with the others it hadnt been nice to be left out now she would be able to join in and would be clapped just as the others were there would be a lot to tell her mother when shf wrote she felt a wave of gratitude welling up fm mirabel it was mirabel who had made all this possiblt for her she went up to mirabel and slipped her arm througl hers its a pity about the others isnt it she said but theyll be better in a fortnightand i shall lik being in the concert now i shall clap like anything when your turn comes mirabel i think youll be thi best of us all mirabel did not smile she looked rather cold an blank gladys wondered what the matter was how many pieces are you going to play she asked do you want me to turn over the pages for you at th piano i shant be in the concert said mirabel in a funny even voice you know im going home at halfterm and by the tune the concert comes ill be gone i fee disappointed of courseso dont keep on rubbing it in she took her arm from gladyss and walked off ho sickening everything was gladys tackles mirabel the second form seemed to have dwindled considerabl now that five of them were away hilary and aliso went down with the cold the next day so there were man empty desks the concert was put off for two weeks and the second form girls felt very flat and gloomy jilsie was the only one who was at all pleased she had consistently refused to take any interest at all in the concert and she felt glad that this disappointment had come upon the others as anna had predicted elsie had adopted a martyrlike attitude looking leftout and miserable all day long but no one took the slightest notice of her the girls pride was hurt she had not liked to ask anna what she had said to miss theobald on the day when both of them had been sent for but it was clear to her now that not only the girls no longer regarded her as one of their heads but miss jenks also appeared to think that only anna was headgirl it was most exasperating elsie sometimes wished she was like carlotta and could slap and box peoples ears when she felt like it i she would box the ears of every one in the form the seven girls in the san had a bad time for the first day or two and then when their temperatures went down they sat up and recovered their spirits it was fun for so many to be together they could play games and talk its halfterm next week said isabel our mothers coming over to take us out sos mine said doris carlotta is your father coming to take you out yesand my grandmother too said carlotta gloomily i get on with my father all right nowbut i just seem to go all common and badmannered with my grandmother i remember all my circus ways and she just hates them oh deari meant to try and get terribly goodmannered this term and not box any ones ears or lose my temper or anything mirabel is supposed to be going at halfterm isnt she said bobby suddenly she wont be in the concert thenand she wont know if shes been chosen to play in any of the lacrosse matches eitherand shell miss the birthday feast that carlottas going to give shes an idiot said doris she cant think straight thats whats the matter with her she wouldnt be a bad sort if she made up her mind to shake down and be sensible said pat i quite like her now and i must say shes good to that timid little gladys when kathleen came in to see us yesterday she said that mirabel really does look after her and walk with herand gladys is like a little dog with hertrots after her and does everything shes told well who would have thought that those two would pair up said isabel and theres another astonishing thing toowho would have thought that lazy old anna would pull herself together as she has done by that weekend the seven invalids were very much better they could not possibly have attended the concert if theirs had been postponed only a week so it was just as well that it had been put off for three weeks they would be well enough to go to the third forms concert which was on the thursday before halfterm mirabel was looking very glum halfterm seemed to be coming quickly the postponing of the concert had been a bitter disappointment it was dull without half the class at lessons the only bright spot was her new friendship with gladys the girl was showing unsuspected sides of her character to mirabel she could make excellent jokes and had a fine sense of humour she was fun to walk with because she could keep up a merry chatter she seemed to have quite thrown off her preoccupation with her own troubles she really was very fond of mirabel and the girl although embarrassed at any show of affection in the ordinary way liked to feel gladys slipping her arm through hers mirabel i you wont really go home at halfterm will you gladys said that weekend there are only a few days more its lovely being friends with you dont go will you of course im going said mirabel impatiently i told you id made up my mind to go at halfterm even before i arrived here i and im not going back on that i never go back on what ive said no i know you dont said gladys with a sigh its only people like me who change their minds and alter what they meant to do but i do wish you werent going mirabel gladys said the same thing to hilary that day when she went to see her in the san i do so wish mirabel wasnt going she said i feel a different person since she was nice to me and all of you clapped me that time i acted for you whats she got to go for said hilary she has settled down all right shes happy shes one of us now and she enjoys life here whatever does she want to go home at halfterm for now shes all right well you see said gladys earnestly she cant go back on what she said she said she was going home at halftermshe made up her mind about thatso she she cant possibly change her mind can she shes such a strong character you see well its strong characters who ought to be able to change their minds at times said hilary i call it weak to stick to something when you know its silly and it is silly for mirabel to go back home now we want her for the concert she knows that shes just being weak not strong gladys was astonished to hear this it seemed to make things quite different weak little gladys had thought that strong characters must be able to make right deci sions and carry them outbut now she saw that a strong character could do something wrong or stupid because it was too proud to unmake a decision it was something quite new to her she stared at hilary i wish youd say that to mirabel she said say it yourself said hilary youre her friend arent you well you tell her she wouldnt listen to me said gladys what you mean isyoure afraid to tackle her said hilary with a laugh go on mousetake the bull by the hornsand if you really do care for mirabel and want her for your friend dont be afraid of telling her what you think get a little spunk poor gladys i every one always seemed to be telling her to get a little spunk it was something she was sure she would never possess she had been such a mothers girl that now it was difficult for her to stand on her own feet all the sameits no good having a friend unless youll do something for them thought gladys trying to screw up her courage i shall lose mirabel if i dont tackle herand if i lose her because shes angry with me for tackling her well i shant be any worse off so ill do it it wasnt easy it never is easy for a timid person to tackle a strong one especially if it is to point out that the strong one is wrong gladys went to mirabel and slipped her arm through hers mirabel she said ive been thinking over what you said about going homeand not changing your mind and all thatand i really do think youre wrong thats my own business said mirabel rather roughly no it isnt its mine too said gladys hoping her voice would not begin to tremble youre my friend and i dont want you to go ive told you i cant change my mind i never do said mirabel dont bother me if you were really as strong a character as you make out you would change your mind said gladys boldly you know you could stay here happily nowbut youre too proud to own youve been sillyand you call it being strong enough not to change your mind gladys how dare you talk to me like this cried mirabel astonished and angry anybody would think you are miss theobaldpicking me to piecestelling me im no goodnot worthwhile im not telling you that said gladys getting distressed im only sayingdont let your pride stand in the way of your happiness thats all mirabel wrenched her arm out of gladyss and walked off red in the face how dare gladys say things like that to her she put on her hat and coat and went out into the school grounds fuming gladys stared after her miserable i knew it wouldnt be any good she thought of course mirabel wouldnt let me say things like that now she wont even be friends with me for the last two or three days before she goes mirabel walked round the grounds hot and angry but as her anger died her mind began to work more calmly there was a great deal in what gladys had said though how that timid little thing ever thought that all out beats me said mirabel to herself there must be more in her than i thought and the way she stood up to me too i she has come on she must like me a lot to make up her mind to go for me like that in order to try and make me change my mind so that she can still have me for a friend the wind cooled her hot cheeks she sat on the wall and looked down over the valley it was very pleasant how dare gladys say anything like that to me thought mirabel there it would be marvellous in the summer st clares was funthere was no doubt about that now lets think things out calmly said mirabel to herself i was angry because my family sent me away because i didnt fit in at homeand i vowed to get back as soon as i could just to show them they couldnt send me away now i like being hereand i see that i am better away from home and shall go back really thrilled to see every one i dare say ill learn lots of things here i ought to have learnt beforethinking of other people not always having my own way and things like that well thenwhat is stopping me from staying here she gazed down on the valley and did not like to think out the answer but she had to all that is stopping me is as gladys pointed out my pride im too proud to tell daddy that ill stay i was so angry at being sent away that i wanted to pay them out by coming back as soon as possible and being beastly and i think im a strong character golly all this makes me sound as hateful as catty elsie she stayed for a few minutes longer and then she sprang down from the wall she went into the school building and took off her outdoor things she went straight to miss theobalds room and knocked at the door come in said miss theobald she was talking to miss jenks and mamzelle mirabel was a little taken aback when she saw all three teachers therebut what she had come to say had to be said no matter how many people were in the room miss theobald she said rather loudly may i stay on please and not go home at the halfterm would you let me i like being here and im sorry i was so silly at first miss theobald looked at the girl and smiled her nicest smile warm and friendly yeswe shall be very glad to have you she said isnt that so miss jenksmamzelle it is said miss jenks and nodded kindly at mirabel ha said mamzelle cest bien cal i too am pleased i will telephone to your parents said miss theobald i am glad mirabel that you have something worthwhile in youno i dont mean your music i something better than that well done praise like this was very sweet mirabel walked out of the room warm and happy she knew she had a great deal to learnthings would go wrong and she would make mistakesbut nothing could take that moment from her she went to find gladys she found her curled up in a corner of the common room looking rather small and woebegone she went over to her and gave her an unexpected hug well old thing im staying on ive just been to tell miss theobald and all because you ticked me off like that and set me thinking half in tears gladys returned the hug it was marvellous she a weak person had summoned up enough strength to tackle a strong oneand had actually got what she wanted it was too good to be true youll be in the concert she said and youll come to carlottas feast wnat fun well have i oh mirabel im so proud of you im rather proud of you too said mirabel awkwardly you gave me a surprise telling me hometruths like that youre a good sort of friend to have what a lot i shall have to write and tell my mother said gladys and i saywont every one be pleased youve changed your mind and are staying on the girls were pleased they had begun to like mirabel now and they admired her for being able to alter her mind and own that she had been wrong soon they would forget mirabels extraordinary behaviour the first few weeks of the term only one girl was displeased that was elsie why should such a fuss be made of that ridiculous mirabel who had behaved so badly and who had been partly the cause of elsies disgrace elsie brooded over this and cast many spiteful glances at mirabel wondering what she could do to pay her out for being popular when she elsie was never taken any notice of at all but mirabel was thickskinned she neither saw nor felt elsies hostility but looked forward happily to the remainder of the term at st clares halfterm holiday halfterm came and went it was a pleasant break for every one most parents came to take out the girls for some kind of treat and those that lived near enough went home for a day or two alisons parents were away so she went out with the twins and their mother well how are you all getting on this term asked mrs osuuivan working hard i hope but nobody said anything about work the twins poured out their news about the concert and about lacrosse and how carlotta was going to have a feast on her birthday alison talked of nothing but her beloved miss quentin shes awfully clever said alison its lovely learning drama under her she says i have the making of a good little actress oh do shut up talking about miss quentin groaned pat mummy last term alison was all over sadie greene that american girlwho by the way has never even written to you alison i and this term its miss quentin i isnt there any medicine or pill we can give alison to stop her raving about people alison had been very hurt that her best friend sadie had not taken the trouble to write to her at all she thought it was mean of pat to remind her of it well miss quentin wouldnt be like that she said ive made her promise to write to me every week in the holidays shes loyal i know i think shes marvellous shes beautiful shes wonderful shes marvellous shes magnificent said isabel with a grin but the thing iswhat does she think of you alison not much i bet youre always going about thinking somebody is wonderfulyou never seem to imagine they might be bored with you the idea of her beloved miss quentin being bored with her made alison hot and angry she glared at the twins mrs osullivan saw the look now now she said dont lets waste our precious time in quarrelling please ive no doubt miss quentin is a very admirable person and im sure alison works hard in her class at least if she doesnt in anyone elses mirabels father and mother came over to see her at halfterm and took her out to lunch a theatre and tea afterwards mirabel was intensely excited at the thought of seeing them she forgot all about the temper in which she had been when she had parted from them she forgot the horrid things she had said and the threats she had made she stood at the front door eagerly waiting for them when they arrived they were startled by some one who hurled herself at them flung her arms round them and exclaimed in a choky voice mummy daddy i its lovely to see you again her mother and father looked at the excited girl whose eyes shone with welcome this was a different mirabel altogether they hugged the girl and looked with interest at the school neither of them had seen it it had been a very sudden decision on mirabels fathers part to send mirabel away and he had chosen a school recommended to him very highly by a friend it had all been done in such a hurry that the parents had not had time to see the school itself what a lovely place said mrs unwin is there time to look round mummy you simply must see everything cried mirabel and she dragged her parents all over the school from top to bottom even showing them the bathroom where she had her nightly bath there was great pride in the girls voice her parents exchanged happy glances with each other it was quite plain to them that mirabel was extremely proud of st clares already and felt it to be her own splendid school daddy im so pleased you chose st clares said mirabel when they came back to the front door at last its marvellous it really is she looked at her parents and hesitated a little she had something to say that was difficult mirabel hated saying she was sorry about anything you knowi really am sorry i was so awful at home said the girl rushing her words out i can see you all better now because im far away from youand i think i was awful to every one weve forgotten it all said her father we shall never remember it again all that matters to us is that you are happyand will be happy when you come home again we felt so proud when miss theobald let us know that you wanted to stay on she said one or two nice things about you did she really asked mirabel pleased i hated her at firstshe said some awful things to mebut now i think shes fine oh mummyi do wish youd brought joan and harry with you i did want to see them they wanted to see you too said her mother but it was too far to bring them nowwhat about going we shall never get any lunch if we dont start soon mummywould you do something for me asked mirabel suddenly ive got a friend hereand her mothers ill in hospital so theres no one to take her out for a halfterm treat could she possibly come with us do you think of course said mrs unwin surprised and pleased to think that her difficult daughter had actually made a friend she wondered what the friend would be like she had never liked mirabels chosen friends before they had always been noisy impolite and outofhand a little like mirabel herself ill go and get her said mirabel she ran off to find gladys she was getting ready for the school lunch feeling a little lonely for nearly all the other girls had left for the halfterm holiday mirabel rushed at her gladys youre to come with me go and ask miss jenks if you can come quickly mummy and daddy say you can come a shock of joy ran through gladys she felt nervous of meeting mirabels parentsbut to think that mirabel wanted her to come was marvellous her depression fell away from her at once and she stared in joy at her friend she had had few treats in her life and it did seem to her that going out to lunch and a theatre was too good to be true gladys dont stand staring there cried mirabel impatiently hurry up go and find miss jenks ill get your outdoor things in three minutes gladys was at the front door with mirabel red with shyness hardly able to say a word mr and mrs unwin took a look at the nervous girl and were astonished so this was mirabels friendwell what a change from the tiresome girls she had chosen before i they took a liking to gladys immediately and mrs unwin smiled a motherly smile at her in some ways mrs unwin resembled gladyss own mother both were the gentle kindly type and gladys wanned to mrs unwin at once in no time at all she was telling mrs unwin all about her own mother revelling in the understanding and kindness of mirabels mother i say i do think youve got a nice mother she whispered to mirabel when they went to wash their hands at the hotel before lunch next to mine shes the nicest ive ever met and isnt your father jolly i feel a bit afraid of him but i do like him arent you lucky mirabel was pleased she was seeing her mother and father with different eyes now that she had been away from them for some weeks it was pleasant to hear some one liking them so much she squeezed her friends arm its fun having you she said im glad my people like you a real surprise was in store for gladys when mrs unwin asked her what hospital her mother was in she heard gladyss answer with astonishment whythats quite near where my sister lives i often go over to see my sisterand perhaps i could go to the hospital and find out how your mother is i might even see her if she is allowed visitors gladys stared at mrs unwin red with delight it would bring her mother much closer somehow if she knew some one was going to the very hospital where her mother was and just suppose she was allowed to see her mrs unwin could write and tell her about it oh thank you said the girl if you only could i it would be marvellous the halfterm went all too quickly all the girls enjoyed it it was a very pleasant break indeed and they went back to school full of chatter about what they had done hallo said the twins meeting carlotta when they arrived back how did you get on was your grandmother very standoffish noshe seemed quite pleased with me said carlotta grinning i didnt walk on my hands or do anything she disapproves ofand i made my hair so tidy you wouldnt know me i was most frightfully polite to her and my father was awfully pleased with me he gave me a pound note for my birthday gracious said pat what luck and my grandmother told me i could order anything i liked for my birthday party at the shop in the town said carlotta her eyes lighting up with delighted expectancy i saywont we order lots of things she gave me some things out of her store cupboard too ive got a big box in the cupboard in our dormitory i dont know whats in it yet but i bet my grandmother has given me plenty how gorgeous said the twins you sound as if youve got enough to feed the whole school nojust our form said carlotta and im not sure yet if well have it properly in the afternoon at teatimeor whether well make it really exciting and go in for a midnight feast again i think we ought to have a midnight feast every term you know i school doesnt seem really complete without that it looked as if the latter half of the term was going to be exciting there was the concert to look forward to that weekseveral lacrosse matchesand now carlottas foast i all the girls glowed what fun they had bobby had a secret and so had janet they had gone out together with bobbys parents and with janets brother whose halfterm holiday was the same weekend he was as much of a monkey as janet always up to tricks he had given janet and bobby an old trick to play on mamzelle it was a curious looking thing consisting of a long stretch of narrow rubber tubing with a little bladder on one end and an indiarubber bulb on the other which when pressed sent air down the tube into the little bladder which at once expanded and became big but whats it for asked the twins in curiosity you put the bladder under some ones plate at mealtime giggled bobby and run the tubing under the tablecloth then when you press the bulb the bladder fills and up tips the plate imagine mamzelles astonishment when her plate starts dancing about we shall all be in fits of laughter this was really something to look forward to as well mamzelle was a marvellous person to play tricks on she was always taken in and had caused more enjoyment than all the mistresses in the school put together oh bobby lets do it soon begged doris do lets we havent played any tricks this term at all well after all we are the second form said janet teasingly bobby will be playing tricks when shes headgirl said isabel im surprised she has gone as far as halfterm without thinking of any oh ive thought of plenty said bobby but miss jenks isnt an easy person to play about with she doesnt keep her temper like miss roberts did she flares up suddenly and i dont particularly want to be sent to miss theobald now im in the second form it may have escaped your notice that im working hard this term dont forget im not dontcare bobby as was last term im using my brains for other things besides tricks and jokes lets have a rehearsal for the concert said pat weve only got a few days now bring your violin mirabeland gladys make up your mind what youre going to act out of all the hundreds of parts you seem able to play come on everybodylets enjoy ourselves i a marvellous show the days flew by and the night of the concert came miss jenks had to be lenient with the second form because she could see that they really did mean their show to be a great success mamzelle was the only teacher who would not make allowances so the class groaned and worked for her as best they could it is bad to have concerts in the middle of the term mamzelle grumbled to miss jenks these girls they think of anything but their work now when i was a schoolgirl you worked all day and you worked all night you had no games you prepared no concerts chanted miss jenks with her wide smile the teachers had heard a thousand times of mamzelles hardworked youth there are other things as important as lessons said miss roberts we are not out to cram facts and knowledge into the girls heads all day long but to help them to form strong and kindly characters too this concert now that you grumble atit is making the second form work together in a wonderful way it is bringing out all kinds of unexpected talentlook at mirabel and gladys for instanceand it will help a great cause it makes the girls resourceful and ingenious tooyou should see the costume doris has made for herself as matron and as cook mamzelle did not know that doris was going to imitate her as well the other mistresses guessed it and they were looking forward to it they all liked mamzede and admired her sense of humour she could take a joke against herself very well the third form concert was quite good said miss lewis the history teacher but i think the second form will be more entertaining the third form were rather highbrow and didnt provide a single laugh for any one i fancy we shall find plenty to laugh at this saturday the second form were getting very excited only elsie was apart from all the thrills and enjoyment the girl still obstinately refused to take part in anything and would not even be prompter but elsie every one will think it very funny that you are the only secondformer out of things said pat impatiently we keep on offering you things to do and you keep turning them down i think its very decent of us to be so patient with you ill take part on one condition said elsie sullenly what asked bobby coming up that you let me be headgirl again with anna said elsie youve punished me for weeks now by taking away my authority as headgirl isnt it about time you let me have it back again wellwell ask the rest of the form said pat so that night in the common room before a rehearsal was held anna put the question to the meeting elsie says she will take part in the concert if we let her be joint headgirl again what does every one think about it why should she bargain with us cried carlotta it is we who should bargain with her we should say you can be headgirl again if you show that you are worthy of it i quite right called doris look how she has behaved all these weeks said janet has she tried to give us a better opinion of her has she shown us she could be trusted to lead us again no all she has done is to look spiteful be catty when she has a chance pose as a martyr and hope shell get our sympathy well she hasnt weve just taken no notice at all and she hasnt liked it i dont see why we should bother with her said isabel i really dont will you show in the usual way whether you would like her again or not asked anna hands up those who will give elsie another chance as headgirl not a single hand went up anna grinned well she said thats that elsie will have to put up with it she hasnt come at all well out of this i must say i would have been willing to work with her again if youd said sobut im glad i havent got to elsie was not there and nobody bothered to fetch her to tell her what had happened they began their rehearsal and were soon busy criticizing and applauding as one after another performed gladys was by now used to an audience and she acted as naturally as every one else she and doris were both natural actresses though in a different way doris could imitate any one she had seen but not act a partand gladys quite unable to imitate any one around her was excellent at interpreting any part in a play the two admired each other and gladys was fast making another friend welli really think weve got everything all right now said bobby at last it will be fun i doris youll bring the house down with your imitation of mamzelle i only hope mamzelle wont mind but i dont think she will the door opened and elsie came in you held the rehearsal without me she said what do you want me to do at the concert well elsieyou said you would only be in it if we recognized you as headgirl again said anna rather awkwardly we put the question to the second form and im afraid they decided not to give you the chance so we didnt think youd want to help with the concert in that case couldnt you have told me you wouldnt have me as headgirl and still let me be in the concert said elsie the others stared at her dont be silly said bobby at last thats not the point the point is you always refused and then wanted to make a bargain with us and we wouldnt make it i suppose youre beginning to feel very awkward about being left out of the concert in front of the whole school so youre climbing down a bit and want to help even if we wont accept you as headgirl again wellhelp if you likebut dont expect us to fall on your neck and give you a warm welcome because we shant this was a long speech and elsie listened to it in growing anger all that bobby said was true elsie was now beginning to feel horrified at being left out every one in the school would notice it they would whisper about her they would nudge one another as she passed elsie couldnt bear it but neither had she the strength to overrule her rage and accept bobbys lukewarm offer to let her help she made a curious explosive noise of rage and walked out of the room doris immediately imitated the explosive noise and the whole form burst into laughter elsie heard the squeals and stopped she felt inclined to go back and hit out at every one then a wave of self pity overcame her and she burst into tears the concert was an enormous success half the school was there and all the mistresses the curtain was drawn at exactly eight oclock and everything went like clockwork the third form had been late in starting and there had been long intervals between the various turns which had bored the audience but the second form were most efficient turn after turn was put on and loudly applauded mirabels playing was encored twice the girl was so thrilled at her success that she could hardly speak for joy her pianoplaying was really excellent and as for her violin solo it amazed every one even the four musicteachers who were by now used to gifted children springing up in their classes at times carlottas acrobatics were hailed with delight by the whole school every one knew hat carlotta had once been a circusgirl and they clapped till their hands smarted when she did some of her graceful circustricks the firstformers gaped in admiration and secretly determined to try out all the acrobatics themselves gladys got an encore too when the nervous whitefaced girl stepped on to the stage the audience waited rather critical expecting to be bored but before their eves the girl changed into the characters she acted and held the whole school spellbound she was really gifted there was no doubt about it the most surprised person in the whole of the audience was miss quentin she took the drama class herself and prided herself on knowing the capacities of everyone in the second form privately she had thought that doris and carlotta were the only ones worth teachingand now here was the quiet little mouse gladys bringing down the house with her polished and beautiful interpretations of many of the most difficult parts in shakespeares plays i miss theobald leaned across to miss quentin i must congratulate you on one of your pupils performances she said in her quiet voice i can see that you must have helped the child a great deal she could never have done all this by herself it is amazing miss quentin was not honest enough to say that she was as astonished as miss theobald she loved praise as much as alison did and she nodded her head pretending that she had taught gladys all that she knew secretly she made up her mind to cultivate gladys hillman and give her the most important part in the play the second form were doing with her she knew alison had hoped for itbut she couldnt help that gladys must certainly have it then miss quentin could take all the credit to herself for the excellent performance she was sure gladys would give the concert went on the twins were applauded and so was janet the firstformers loved bobbys conjuring tricks and her ceaseless ridiculous patter and gave her an encore but it was doris who was the real star of the evening when she stepped on to the stage dressed up as the jolly fat old cook there was a roar of delighted laughter doris pretended to make a pudding keeping up a mono logue in the cooks irish accent bringing in all the phrases that the girls knew so well they squealed with laughter then she altered her cooks uniform deftlyand lo and behold there was matron bobby ran on with some big bottles of medicine and a thermometer and doris proceeded to imitate matron interviewing various girls sent to her for treatment or inspection matron was in the audience shaking with laughter the girls roared with delight missing many of doriss jokes because they could not stop laughing she was extremely clever and extremely funny she should be on the stage said matron wiping her streaming eyes oh am i really as funny as that its time i retired if im such a joke this girl will be the death of me wait till she comes for medicine ill get my own back then doris went off the stage grinning the audience looked at the next item she was to doanother impersonation who they knew as soon as she appeared again she had made herself plump with padding she had scraped back her hair into a bun put on enormous flatheeled shoes secretly borrowed from mamzelles room and wore glasses crookedly on her nose mamzelle shrieked the girls in delight marvellous doris approached the edge of the stage and addressed the girls in mamzelles identical voice taking off her english accent to perfection the audience roared with laughter as doris scolded them for misbehaviour cest abominable she finished then she turned away rearranged some things on a desk behind and proceeded to take a lesson in the way that mamzelle took it with hands wagging towards the ceiling and her glasses slipping down over her nose every one looked at mamzelle herself to see how she was taking it mamzelle was lying back in her chair helpless with laughter tears pouring down her cheeks the girls felt a warm wave of liking for herhow nice she was to laugh at some one taking off her little foibles and mannerisms the girls had to laugh at mamzelles squeals as much as at doriss acting it was a marvellous show and a great success every one had loved it and crowded round at the end to clap the performers on the back and congratulate them it was pleasant for both mirabel and gladys to feel these pats and hear the generous words of praise mother will hardly believe it all said gladys to herself her face shining with delight i must tell her every single thing and wasnt mirabels playing good i clapped till my hands were sore weve made four pounds three shillings and sixpence by selling tickets programmes and getting in extra subscriptions announced anna isnt that good i bet no form will do as well as that the second form enjoyed coffee and biscuits for a treat after the show generously provided by matron and mamzelle though why we should do this for a form whose chief success is putting up mamzelle and myself to be laughed at i really dont know said matron beaming round by the waywheres elsie she wasnt in the concert and i dont see her now the second form were so elated by their success that they wanted elsie to join in the coffee and biscuits but she was nowhere to be found she was in bed alonebut not asleep the only girl who had not shared in or applauded her forms success i poor elsieher thoughts were very bitter that night as she heard the echoes of laughter from the concertroom elsie is foolish the next big event was carlottas birthday she was fifteen and planned a really good feast she had opened the box of goodies given to her by her grandmother and it had proved to be even better than the second form had hoped sardines said bobby taking out three or four of the oblong tins and whats thisan enormous tin of pineapple chunks its ages since ive tasted pineapple and what a fine big tin bars of chocolatecream said janet enough to feed the whole school i should think tins of prawns cried hilary i sayi do like prawns golly prawns and pineapple what a heavenly mixture that would be heres a gingerbread cake said alison isnt it big carlotta i must say you own a firstclass grand mother i mines good for a cake and a bottle of boiled sweets but thats about all yours is super well shes only just begun to be super said carlotta with a grin when she didnt approve of me she handed me out two shillings and a new hairslide see what happens when she does approve of me lets teach carlotta some really marvellous manners said janet so that she will make a wonderful impression on her grandmother in the christmas hols shell come back with half a grocers shop then i should think oh i saywhats this said bobby pulling out what looked like a large medicine bottle full of a yellow liquid she read the label o it then laughed do listen one tablespoonful of this to be taken sardines said bobby and a huge tin of pineapple by each girl after the birthday feast oh carlotta your grandmother is a scream did you say you could go down to the tuckshop in the town and order anything else you liked for your birthday asked hilary looking at the fine selection of things spread out on the floor i shouldnt think you want anything else do you id like a good big birthday cake with fifteen candles on said carlotta i know candles are childish when youre fifteen but i cant help it i think a cake looks so pretty when they are all lighted and if we have the party at night we can let the cakecandles light us are we really going to have the feast at night asked mirabel thrilled ive often read of midnight feasts in schoolstories but i didnt really think they happened of course they happen said bobby you wait and see what well do i must order heaps and heaps of gingerpop said carlotta i always feel i can drink a lot at night and ill get lemonade too and buns we can butter and put jam on i like those its a pity we cant cook kippers too i do like kippers every one laughed carlotta loved kippers and pineapple two things she had had a good deal of in her circus days she had often described to the girls how lovely frying kippers smelt being cooked on a stove in the openair in the dark of the night after a show no carlottawe must draw the line at kippers said anna the smell would wake the whole school you know how we smell kippers frying even when cook has the kitchen and the scullery door shut elsie heard all the talk about carlottas birthday she knew there was to be a feast or a party of some sort she saw the amount of goodies taken out of carlottas box and she wondered if she was going to be asked or not the others debated the point when elsie was not in the room are we going to ask catty elsie or not said pat not said almost every one oh yes lets said easygoing anna she likes good things as much as any one i daresaybut we dont want her spiteful face glowering at us all the time said isabel at this moment elsie came to the door of the common room she stood outside listening she was always wondering if the others were discussing her this time they were well as its my birthday i can choose my own guests said carlotta its for me to say whether ill ask catty elsie or not yesall rightyou say carlotta cried half a dozen voices at once welli say thisill ask her but at the same time ill tell her shes got to drop this awful pose of being a miserable martyr and act sensibly said carlotta she goes about looking like a wet dishcloth im sure every one in the school must laugh at her shes a disgrace to our form anyway ill ask her to the feast and see if shes properly grateful and will behave herself yes do that said anna who was as tired as any one else of seeing elsie walking about looking as if she was going to weep at any moment maybe she learnt her lesson when she was left out of the concert perhaps she will jump at the chance of being friends again poor catty elsie said doris and she began to imitate elsies rather high silly voice tearful and excited every one roared with laughter they had no idea at all that elsie was outside the door listening they would have been very scornful of her if they had known that for eavesdropping was not looked on favourably by any member of the second form they had very strict ideas of honour and liked to keep to them elsie forgot that those who listen behind doors seldom hear any good of themselves she stood there trembling with anger and selfpity hating all the girls who tossed her name about so scornfully and laughed at her so unkindly a movement towards the door made her hurry away quickly she turned a corner and went into a cloakroom pretending to fetch a pair of shoes the secondformers pouring out of their common room to go to a nature meeting did not guess that she had overheard nearly all they had said there was no time then to ask elsie to the party for the girls were already late for the meeting elsie joined them and sat sulkily silent whilst the second and thirdformers decided various matters concerning the natureclub she didnt hear a word that was said she remembered instead what she had just overheard and looked with rage at carlotta and the others how she wished she could punish them in some way that night carlotta went up to where elsie was sewing in the common room elsie i i expect you know im having a birthday soon dont you i should think the whole school knows said elsie spitefully wellim having a party or a feast of some kind said carlotta and every one is coming the thing is id like you to come toobut only if youll pull yourself together and act sensibly were all tired of the way youre behaving come on elsie nowcant you have a bit of common sense and be one of us we dont like you a bit as you are now but we are quite willing to change our ideas of you if youll be sensible very kind of you very kind of you indeed said elsie in a trembling sarcastic voice the great carlotta is most bountiful and condescending i and i know i should be very grateful and bow before her thanking her for her great kindness dont be an idiot said carlotta uncomfortably im not said elsie changing her tone of voice and almost snarling at the surprised carlotta im just saying no thanks i im not coming to your beastly feast hobe a good little girl and you can come to the party i thats what youve said to meme who ought to be your headgirl i i would hate to come and what is more if youre going to hold it at night anna had better look out youre secondformers now not firstformers and if youre caught anna will soon find she isnt headgirl any more either youre impossible elsie said carlotta in disgust at elsies tone of voice well if you dont want to come dont i for one am pleased so are we all cried pat isabel and a few others who had listened in indignation to elsies stinging speech keep away elsie the party will be better without you elsie went on with her sewing pursing up her thin lips scornfully she badly wanted to go to the party for she loved good things as much as anyone else but her spitefulness and obstinacy made it impossible for her to climb down and accept she sat sewing thinking that if she could possibly prevent the party from being held she would if i could find out when and where carlotta is going to hold it i could drop a hint to miss jenks she thought miss jenks doesnt look kindly on things like that ive only got to say a wordor write an anonymous note and the feast would be stopped before it had begun that would be fine but the others did not mean to let elsie know when the feast was to be held they felt certain she would try to spoil it in some way they had decided to hold it on the night of carlottas birthday in the common room itself if they drew the blinds and shut the door they were reasonably safe the common room was a good way away from any mistresses room and yet fairly near their own dormitories they talked about it with excitement whenever elsie was not in the room as soon as she appeared they dropped the subject at once not one girl not even silly little alison mentioned the subject when elsie was there much as they sometimes wanted to carlotta had been down to the shop in the town and ordered what she wanted the cake was to be a magnificent affair with fifteen coloured candles it was to have pink icing with roses round the edge and silver balls and sugared violets for decoration the candles were to be fixed in roses made of sugar every one was very excited about it the gingerpop has come announced carlotta gleefully i got the boy who brought it to put it at the back of the bicycle shed i was afraid miss jenks would have a fit if she saw all those bottles of gingerbeer and lemonade arriving for me well each have to bring in a bottle or two when its safe it will be fun said mirabel she looked at gladys who was beaming too im glad i stayed on fancy missing carlottas feast i would have been an idiot you would said gladys the mouselike girl was no longer the miserygirl she laughed and smiled with the rest and followed mirabel about like a shadow the bigger girl was very fond of her and the two were quite inseparable st glares had already done a good deal for both of them i wed better not cook anything at all said pat i remember when we fried sausages once in the middle of the night they made a terrific smell wed better just be content with cold things well borrow some plates from the diningroom cupboard there are heaps of old ones on the top shelves that wont be missed for a day or two it was fun to plan everythingfun to smuggle glasses and mugs plates and dishes and spoons and forks into the common room carlottas birthday was coming nearer and nearer the birthday cake was made and the girls went down to the shop to inspect it it was marvellous i wish your birthday night would come carlotta said pat what sport well have and what a feast carlottas birthday party the girls were gathered in their common room the day before carlottas birthday alison took a quick look round the room elsie was not there what times the feast tomorrow night she asked exactly at midnight lets make it exactly its much more thrilling miss quentin calls it the witching midnight hour and somehow i suppose youd like to ask your beloved miss quentin said isabel pulling alisons curly hair can you see her sitting here in our common room her hair done up in curlpapers her face shining with grease eating pineapple chunks and sardines i cant she doesnt do her hair in curlpapers said aliso indignantly shes got beautiful naturally wavy hair why are you always so unkind about her i wish she could come to the feast im sure shed love it well we shouldnt said pat who had no great liking for the rather affected teacher of drama you make me sick the way you go mooning round after miss quentin shes not so marvellous as you think she is i think it was pretty mean of her to take the credit to herself for gladyss acting at our concert the other night whatever do you mean cried alison indignantly well alison you know when gladys put up that grand performance of shakespeares characters the other night said pat who thought it was about time that alison was cured of her senseless admiration for miss quentin yes said alison well at the end of it miss theobald leaned across to miss quentin and congratulated her on gladyss performance and said she was sure she herself had coached her for it said pat mercilessly and your wonderful miss quentin just nodded and smiled and looked pleased and didnt say that she knew nothing about gladys hillmans acting powers at all i we all think that was pretty mean i dont believe it cried alison quick to defend the mistress she so much admired well pam boardman was sitting near and she heard it all said pat she told us so now just stop thinking miss quentin is the worlds greatest wonder alison changed the subject quickly it really hurt her to hear such things of miss quentin she was always one to shut her ears to possibly unpleasant things to come back to what i was saying she said what times the feast tomorrow night well as you so badly want it at exactly midnight well have it then said carlotta ive got a dear little alarm clock ill set for the timeand one of you in the other dormitory can stick it under your pillow so that itll wake you without rousing every one in the building i darent put it under my pillow because miss catty elsie sleeps near me and would wake too we want to be sure she doesnt know the time all right thenmidnight exactly tomorrow night said doris in her clear voice at that moment the door opened and hilary came in she had been to the school library to choose a book she looked round at the others i hope you havent been talking about anything that matters she said because dear sweetnatured honestsouled elsie was outside the door listening for all she was worth i the others stared at her in dismay blow said carlotta we have been talking about the feastand we said a good many times it was to be midnight tomorrow blow blow blow well elsie will certainly do her best to spoil it for us tomorrow night said pat shes sure to split on us somehowabsolutely sure to im not going to have our feast spoilt said carlotta in a determined voice pat go to the door and see if elsies anywhere about now stay by the door and wani us if she comes pat looked outside the door there was no one there elsie had got the information she wanted and was content i now listen said carlotta the feast is off for tomorrow nightbut its on for tonight instead goody goody said every one pleased we must make sure elsie doesnt hear us creeping out of the room said bobby she sleeps very soundly said carlotta i think we can manage it all right now not a word any one well hold the feast tonightand elsie will get a frightful shock tomorrow when she finds its all over and she hasnt been able to spoil it elsie had no idea that the time of the feast was altered she hugged her secret all day long pondering how she could spoil the feast without any one guessing it was she who had done so should she tell miss jenks that would certainly stop the feast but miss jenks did not like talebearers should she write a note to miss jenks informing her of the feast but not sign her name this seemed quite a good ideabut then miss jenks might throw the note into the fire and take no notice of it elsie had once heard her say that no one should ever take notice of anonymous lettersthey were too despicable even to read its no good writing a note that miss jenks wont read or take notice of thought the girl i wish i knew the best way to spoil the feast she thought about it earnestlyso earnestly that mamzelle nearly went up in smoke as bobby put it because elsie paid so little attention in the french class elsie this is the third time i have asked you to come out and write on the blackboard said mamzelle exasperated ah i have the patience of a donkey or i would not put up with you you mean the patience of an ox mamzelle chuckled bobby a donkey is patient too said mamzelle i need the patience of cows donkeys sheep and oxen too when i deal with such a person as this elsie you will either depart from this room elsie or pay attention to what i say i will not have inattention in my class elsie had to give her thoughts to the french lesson after thatbut during prep time that evening she suddenly made up her mind what she would do ill wait till theyre all out of the room tomorrow nightthen ill slip along to miss jenkss room and say im very worried because all the others have vanished thought elsie shell come back to seeand will then go and hunt around and find every one feasting in the common room i can say i am afraid theyve been kidnapped or something after all that american girl sadie was nearly kidnapped last termso i can pretend to be afraid its happened again this seemed to elsie a good idea if she really pretended to be frightened that the others had been kidnapped miss jenks would not think she was telling talesand the others would not know she had given them away because it would be miss jenks who suddenly came along and found them i elsie had no idea that the feast was for that night not the next the secondformers kept their secret well in fact carlotta and bobby went a bit further and whispered loudly together in elsies hearing about all that was to happen the night following elsie took it all in and grinned to herself just wait you secondformers and see what happens to your wonderful feast tomorrow night that night carlotta wound up and set her tiny alarm clock she gave it to kathleen who slept in the next room with the others put it under your pillow she said when it goes off wake the others quietly then come and wake me in the next dormitory ill wake our lot and well all go to the common room as quiet as mice kathleen put the clock under her pillow she felt sure she would not need it because she was too excited to sleep but sleep overtook one tired girl after another and soon both dormitories were peacefully dreaming elsie was fast asleep too she was a heavy sleeper and sometimes snored tonight she was huddled up beneath her blankets because it was cold she meant to sleep well that night so that she would be wellrested and able to keep awake the following night every one was asleep at midnight the alarm clock under kathleens pillow suddenly went off with a tiny ringing noise kathleen woke with a jump she put her hand under the pillow and stopped the alarm from ringing no one else had waked up kathleen sat up in bed hugging herself in joy the midnight feast was about to begin i she sprang out of bed and put on her slippers and dressinggown then she went softly from one bed to another shaking the sleepers and whispering the magic words into their ears midnight feast midnight feast every one sat up at once dressinggowns and slippers were groped for in the dark excited whispering rose i cant find my slippers blow this dressinggown the girdles all tied in a knot sh warned kathleen weve got to be careful not to wake dear elsie you know she slipped into the next dormitory and made her way quietly to carlottas bed carlotta was under sheets and blankets curled up like a little animal kathleen shook her gently carlotta shot upright in bed and kathleen pressed her shoulder warningly midnight she whispered in carlottas ear carlottas heart jumped for joy her birthday feast of course she padded round the dormitory as quietly as a cat waking every one but elsie there was no whispering in that room and not a single giggle each girl took slippers and dressinggown and crept quietly to the door elsie snored a little much to every ones relief carlotta shut the door quietly and locked it she took out the key and put it into her dressinggown pocket now if elsie did wake up she couldnt get out and spoil the feast everyone went to the common room not until the door was fastshut and cushions put along the bottom to hide the crack of light was the light switched on then what a whispering and giggling there was elsie snored as we went out giggled carlotta such a nice gentle little snore nowcome onset out the plates and things everything was taken from the hidingplacesfrom the bottom of cupboards and the back of shelves from tuckboxes and this and from behind books in bookcases soon the common room tables were set with the empty plates and dishes the largest plate of all was put in the middle that was for the lovely birthday cake now for a real proper feast said carlotta happily she and the others set out the goodies they hadthe cakes and the buns the biscuits and the sweets they opened the tins and emptied the contents on to dishes sardines fruit salad pineapple prawnsthe most wonderful selection of things imaginable carlotta opened a dozen gingerbeer bottles at each pop there was a giggle heres to our dear sleepingbeauty elsie said bobby with a laugh and drank the fizzy gingerbeer come on every onelets really enjoy ourselves the second form play a trick the secondformers certainly did enjoy themselves after a bit they forgot to whisper and began to speak in their normal voices it didnt matter really they were too far from any sleeping mistress to be heard they giggled at everything and laughed till the tears came at doris and her idiotic antics with empty gingerbeer bottles they ate everything carlotta even ate sardines and pineapple together alison tried prawns dipped in gingerbeer which pat and isabel said were simply super but they made her feel sick taken that way however the others didnt mind and mixed all the food together with surprising results nobody would dream that sardines pressed into gingerbread cake would taste so nice said janet my brother told me that and i didnt believe him but its true the birthday cake was marvellous it melted in the mouth i the candles were lighted very soon and the light turned off all the girls sat munching happily watching the fifteen candles flicker and glow it was lovely a happy year to you carlotta said pat holding up her mug of gingerbeer its your birthday now because its past midnight many happy returns of the day thanks said carlotta her vivid little face radiant her dark eyes sparkled as she looked round at her friends it was lovely to give people pleasure she would tell her grandmother all about it happy returns said one voice after another happy birthday good old carlotta carlotta cut second slices of her big birthday cake for every one there was a fairly big piece left enough for two extra slices two more bits said carlotta slicing the piece in half who shall we give them to one to miss jenks said pat you neednt say we had xthe cake at midnight and one to miss quentin said alison eagerly dont be silly said carlotta do you think im going to waste my birthday cake on miss quentin i id rather give a slice to elsie well lets said anna unexpectedly its supposed to be good for people to heap coals of fire on their head you know return good for eviland anyway what a shock for elsie when we give her a bitand she realizes weve had the party well give it to her after the next night then said carlotta grinning let her try and spoil the feast this coming nightand then the next day well present her with a bit of cake that really would be funny everyone agreed to thatnot that they wanted to make elsie a present at allthey just wanted to see her face when she saw the piece of cake and realized that the feast had been held in peace without her and hadnt been spoilt well one bit for miss jenks and the other for darling elsie said carlotta and put them away in a tin now girls is there anything else left to eat there wasntand very little to drink either its a good thing said anna i simply couldnt eat another crumb fancy you saying that anna said pat with a laugh looking at the plump roundfaced girl i should have thought you could have gone on eating till breakfasttime dont be rude to your headgirl said anna lazily nothing ever ruffled her good temper carlotta wed better clear up and get back weve been here ages what a pity said alison with a sigh she never liked clearing up the girls set to work and stacked the dishes abd plates neatly at the back of a cupboard hoping they would be able to wash them and put them back into their proper places in the morning they swept up the crumbs and threw them out of the window they put the gingerbeer and lemonade bottles into a cupboard outside in the passage then they looked round the common room there was not a single sign of the lovely feast they had had good girls said anna now come alongas quietly as you can so as not to wake elsie the secondformers crept quietly back to their rooms carlotta unlocked her dormitory door the first sound that greeted her was the light snoring of the sleeping elsie she had not even stirred good thought carlotta cuddling into bed everything went off marvellously oh i wish we could have it all over again tomorrow night the secondformers were very sleepy the next morning they found it difficult to get up alison said she felt sick and so did kathleen well never mind it was worth it wasnt it said pat do you want to go to matron no said alison and kathleen together matron would only give them a large dose of nastytasting medicine she had an unfailing way of knowing when a midnight feast had been held and kept special medicine for girls who complained of feeling sick the next day i elsie did not for one moment suspect that the feast had been held nobody said a word about it in front of her the common room had been so wellcleared up that there was not a crumb left to give the secret away elsie looked at the secondformers as they worked in miss jenkss geography class you may think you are going to have a lovely time tonight she thought but you wont i miss jenks will come and spoil it alland that will serve you right for being so mean to me neither alison nor kathleen were sick after all but because they would eat no breakfast and no dinner miss jenks sent them to matron matron took their temperatures and found they had none hmmmm she said thoughtfully any one had a birthday in the second form its carlottas today said kathleen i thought so said matron you are both suffering from toomuchtoeat a dose of medicine will soon put you right that night the second form went to bed with giggles and nudges they felt quite certain elsie was going to give them awayor was hoping to they had made a lovely plan well all wake up at midnight and creep out of the room planned bobby then as soon as were gone i bet elsie will go off to tell miss jenks or even mis theobald you never know i when we see her go well all creep back into bed and be there pretending t be sound asleep when miss jenks comes what a sell for dear elsie every one approved of this plan elsie saw them whispering and giggling and felt certain it was about the feast that night i she made up her mind to keep awake whatever happened carlotta set her alarm clock for midnight once more this time under her own pillowas she wanted to make sure of waking elsie up that night it went off at twelve oclock and carlotta sat up she grinned to herself in the darkness she went from bed to bed waking every one up making rather a noise elsie woke up too for she had fallen asleep after all she pretended to lie fast asleep and did not stir until all the girls had crept out of the dormitory then she sat up and pulled on her own dressinggown the beasts enjoying themselves without me she thought maliciously forgetting that she could have joined in the party if she had said she would behave sensibly well now ill go and wake miss jenksand pretend im frightened because the others have all disappeared she slipped out of the dormitory carlotta who was hiding round a corner saw her going down the passage in the opposite direction on her way to miss jenkss room come along she whispered to the secondformers who were giggling nearby shes gone i bet miss jenks will be along in half a minute i what will she say to elsie when she sees us all safe and sound in our warm beds the girls took off dressinggowns and slippers and hurried back into their beds which were still nice and warm they cuddled down and waited giggling every now and again when someone made a silly remark meanwhile elsie was knocking on miss jenkss door there was no answer she knocked more loudly there was a creak from the bed and then miss jenkss voice whos there whats the matter elsie opened the door miss jenks switched on the light beside her bed she saw elsie who had put on a very frightened expression indeed is somebody ill asked miss jenks springing out of bed and dragging her dressinggown on quick tell me oh miss jenksim so frightened stammered elsie filling miss jenks with foreboding she looked so scared all the girls out of my dormitory have disappeared every one of them oh miss jenksdo you think they can have been kidnapped i feel so scared miss jenks snorted she had a wonderful snort which was often faithfully copied by doris my dear elsie dont be a ninny as if seven or eight girls could be kidnapped in your room and you hear nothing use your common sense for pitys sake miss jenks they really arent there said elsie looking more wideeyed than ever not one of them where can they be its carlottas birthday isnt it said miss jenks crossly i suppose its a feast just like you to try and spoil it oh miss jenks i never thought of that cried elsie pretending to be astonished and hurt oh so long as they arent kidnapped you really make me cross elsie said miss jenks who having had elsie for more than a year in her form knew her very well indeed well come alongi suppose ill have to look into thisbut youll just come along with me too my girland the second form can see whos spoilt things for them this was not what elsie had planned at all but it was no use she could not draw back now she had to go with miss jenks they went along to the dormitory where elsie slept the girls heard them coming and cuddled closer into bed shutting their eyes tightly hoping they would not giggle and give everything away doris gave one or two beautiful little snores so real that carlotta wondered if she could possibly have gone to sleep miss jenks heard the snores she switched on the dormitory light she stared in silence at the beds all except elsies occupied by apparently sleeping girls doris gave another marvellous little snore and then with a realistic grunt turned over in bed and settled down again miss jenks watched her she felt certain doris was awake elsie stared in the utmost astonishment and horror at the occupied beds she simply could not understand it she had not been more than three minutes away surely and yet here were all the girls asleep in bed could she have dreamt it all had the girls not stirred from their beds at all what had happened well elsie said miss jenks not troubling to lower her voice for she felt certain every girl was awake you appear to have brought me out on a wildgoose chase we shall have to have a talk about this tomorrow i think i dont feel at all pleased to be waked up with a story of wholesale kidnappings and then to find that the only girl out of bed is yourself not a very creditable performance on your part i feel elsie got into bed without a word miss jenks snapped off the light and went back to bed shutting her ears to the giggling and whispering that immediately broke out no one said a word to the cowering elsie let her try to puzzle out what had happened i after ten minutes giggling the room went to sleep againall but elsie who lay awake worrying about what was to happen to her the next day the first thing that happened had its funny side carlotta solemnly approached her and offered her a piece of the birthday cake you werent there so we saved it for you she said a very goodygoody expression on her glowing little face elsie was startled out of her silence she stared at the cake and said so you did have the feast after all when did you we had it when we were kidnapped said carlotta solemnly oooh elsieit was thrilling somebody came in the middle of the nightand kidnapped us all and took us awaybut we offered them a bit of the birthday cake and they were so pleased with it that they set us free dont tell such untruths said elsie angrily there were squeals of laughter at this untruths why who was it went and told miss jenks we had been kidnapped you cant talk about untruths elsie turned away she would not take the cake she was sick at heart and longed for a friendly look or a friendly word now she had to go and face miss jenks that would be awful too she had to go just before morning school at ten minutes to nine hi the classroom she went miss jenks was there busy as usual correcting piles of exercise books on the desk in front of her was a most surprising sighta large piece of birthday cake it had been offered to her by carlotta with a merry twinkleand had been accepted with a merry twinkle also elsie stared at it and bit her lip to think that miss jenks had accepted the cake why she must have guessed about the feastand here she was accepting a bit of the cake it was too bad elsie there is something seriously wrong with you this term began miss jenks you had a great chance as headgirl and both miss theobald and i hoped you would take it apparently you havent none of the girls will accept you instead of standing up to things and realizing you had to do better and change your attitude you chose to do stupid things like coming to me last night with a cockandbull tale in order to spite the others they were too smart for you i am pleased to see now what is to be done are you going to gq on like this for the rest of the term your report will not make pleasant reading if so or are you going to show that you really have a little courage and common sense in you and try to make up for your silly behaviour before it is too late plain speaking was miss jenkss strong point elsie listened in silence she looked at the calm eyes of her formmistress there was absolutely nothing else to be done now but admit herself to be in the wrong and say she had courage to do better that was hardbut the alternative was hardergetting a thoroughly bad report and having to bear the sneers of the girls for the rest of the term ill try to make up for being silly said elsie in a halfsulky tone youve been more than silly said miss jenks pull yourself together you know that st clares only keeps the girls it can do something with the secondformers are decent if they see you showing a little courage and common sense they will help you all right said elsie ungraciously but miss jenksdont make me tell them im sorry or anything i cant do that i really cant my dear elsie i havent had you in my form for over a year without knowing that i cant expect you to have either the good feeling or the courage to say youre sorry said miss jenks impatiently now here come the others go and get my books for me out of the mistresses common room and put on a little brighter face i simply cannot bear to see you looking like a hen left out in the rain any longer elsie went to fetch miss jenkss books as the secondformers crowded into the room they sat down at once surprised to see their formmistress there before them i want to say a word to you this morning said miss jenks about elsie she has agreed to try and have a little courage and do better from now onrather unwillingly i must admit she tells me she cannot possibly say she is sorry to you for her stupid conduct and in any case i dont think she is sorrybut try to act towards her in a way to help her efforts not hinder them will you after ailyou played a wonderful trick on her last night didnt you this unexpected ending made all the girls smile delightedly so miss jenks guessed everythingand there was the birthday cake sitting waiting to be eaten i good old miss jenks i the girls were ready to do anything she asked them all right miss jenkswell put up with elsie as graciously as we can said hilary smiling we got our own back last nightso we can afford to be generous elsie came back into the room she had tried to make her face pleasanter she placed the books on the desk thank you elsie said miss jenks in a pleasant tone and gave her a smile the girls saw it and approved what miss jenks could do they could do also things would be easier for elsie than she deserved an exciting match the term went on its way happy and busy with lessons games and fun lacrosse matches were played and the whole school turned out to watch and cheer at the home matches the second form were very proud of gladys anna had told miss wilton the gamesmistress that she thought gladys would be worth trying in some other position than goalkeeper and miss wilton rather doubtfully agreed to try her she has never shown any aptitude for running catching or tackling she said howeverwe will see so gladys to her delight was put in a position where running and catching would count and after once or twice the girl proved herself to be very good she was small but very wiry and agile and she was amazingly good at dodging the enemy and passing the ball quickly to some one else good gladys good miss wilton said time after time one monday afternoon you art coming on gladys flushed with pleasure she looked very happy these days miss quentin was taking a good deal of notice of her in the drama class and now miss wilton was praising her at lacrossethe two things she liked most she was writing very happy letters to her mother now and although she still had no reply she had had a letter from mirabels mother that had delighted her dear gladys i thought you might like to know that i was able to go today to the hospital your mother is in the nurse actually allowed me to see her for two minutes as it was one of her good days i told her about you and how you and my mirabel were friends she could not say much but she did say how delighted she was to hear what a success you were at the concert perhaps you will be able to see her in the holidays it is early days to say yet whether she is really making progress but i think you may be hopeful i will go to see her again if i can give my love to mirabel and say i hope she is treating you properly you are such a little mouse and mirabel is just the opposite love from elise unwin this letter gladys treasured greatly she thought with intense gratitude of mrs unwin she began to hope that her mother really might get better she knew that when she was well enough she had to have a serious operation and this thought worried her greatly but now that she was happier things did not seem so bad meantime there was lacrosse and the excitement of the next match which was to be a home one against st christophers belinda towers had let it be known that she would like to choose one girl from the second form for the team no one in the first form was good enough as yetbut the second form were on the whole not at all bad at the game you might be chosen gladys said mirabel halfteasingly she did not seriously think that the shy girl would be picked out for although she certainly was very good at the game now she was not half the size of some of the other girls in the form i wish i could said gladys but i know who will behilary shes terribly good i think hilary certainly was very goodvery sure and very swift her catching was graceful to watch and it seemed certain she would be chosen for the match but two days before the match hilary went down with a cold again matron popped her into bed in spite ofher wails about lacrosse belinda said i could play in the match she said cant i get up tomorrow for certain nothing is certain with bad colds said matron so dont count on anything thus it came about that hilary although chosen by belinda could not playand belinda running her pencil down the list of names in the second form suddenly came to a stop by gladys hillmans name she sat and thought that kids good thought the headgirl i watched her yesterday shes fastand jolly good at tackling although she is small ive a good mind to try her so when the list of names was put up on the big noticeboard showing the girls chosen for the next match gladys hillmans appeared at the bottomthe only one chosen from the second form i mirabel saw it and went hurriedly in search of gladys gladys i what do you think youre down for the match really said gladys her face flushing brightly ohhow marvellous golly i shall be nervous though no you wont youll just remember that your mother is longing to hear that youve shot twelve goals for st clares and that youve won the match for the school said mirabel laughing oh i sayi am pleased good for you gladys was happy to see mirabels real pleasure that was the best of friendsthey shared your troubles with you and they doubled your joys it was good to have a friend the school turned out as usual to watch the match the st christopher girls came in a big coach their lacrosse sticks beside them the st clares girls gave them a cheer the game began belinda was referee and blew her whistle sharply there was the click of lacrosse sticks as the two girls in the centre of the field began the game then the ball was flicked quickly away and margery fenworthy of the third form picked it up in her lacrosse net and flew down the field with it she passed to lucy oriell her friend and then when lucy was tackled cleverly caught the ball once more and passed to gladys who was hopping about in excitement ready for any chance click gladys caught the ball dodged a tackling enemy and threw to lucy from one to another went the ball and lucy tried to throw a goal which was deftly stopped by the st christophers goalkeeper the game was very even the st clare girls were better runners and catchers but the st christopher goalkeeper was marvellous she had a quick eye a firm wrist and a real talent for stopping the ball every time the st clare girls threw at the goal st christophers threw a goal first and the st clare girls clapped though their faces were rather anxious this was going to be a stiffer match than they thought thank goodness both margery fenworthy and lucy oriell were playing todaythey were always firstclass some of the st clare girls looked doubtfully at gladys hillman she seemed very small in comparison with the others margery fenworthy for instance was a big strapping girl who overtopped gladys by a head and a half play up gladys yelled mirabel every time her friend came near her go onplay up and the whole second form would yell in chorus play up gladys i what about a goal from you halftimeand no goals for the st clare girls onelove the st clare girls who were watching crowded round their team trying to buck them up and spur them on you are doing well margery and lucy said belinda towers approvingly her eye caught the flushed face of gladys hillman and she gave her one of her sudden wide smiles youre not doing too badly either kid i but keep a bit closer to margery will you you might be able to score a goal off one of her passes to you yes belinda said gladys happily ill try she kept her word she hovered closer to margery and caught the ball slickly each time twice she was tackled and had to pass before she could shoot at the goal but the third time she threw the ball with all her might at the net in the distance goal goal yelled the st clare girls but no the st christopher goalkeeper deftly flicked the ball away no goalbut a jolly good try go it gladys go it yelled the second form dancing about in excitement try again gladys did her best she was everywhere in and out running tackling passing time slipped on and still no goals were scored by st clares on the other hand no more were scored by st christophers either it was the closest match the schools had ever played oh golly its almost time groaned mirabel glancing at her watch gladys play up theres only four minutes more gladys heard and ran to tackle an enormous st christopher girl the girl dodged and gladys tripped she wrenched her ankle and gave a groan it was going to be painful to run now but she couldnt possibly give up the ball rolled near her she nipped it up into her lacrosse net and ran limping down the field she passed to margery who at once passed back again when she was tackled gladys didnt catch the ball it was neatly caught by a much taller girl who leapt into the air the ball fell into her net and she turned to run gladys raced after the ball down the field but quick as thought gladys hit her lacrosse stick upwards and the ball flew into the air gladys caught it and ran again she shot for the goal it was not such a good shot as beforebut the ball bounced over a tuft as it rolled towards the goal and avoided the waiting lacrosse net of the goalkeeper in the greatest dismay she saw it roll into the goal the st clare girls nearly went mad with joy the second form thumped each other on the back and yelled good old gladys at the tops of their voices it was all very thrilling the match was a drawone all the st christopher girls went back to tea with st clares and discussed the match at the tops of their voices the second form treated gladys to a special cake for making the score even good for you kid said belinda as she passed that was gladyss biggest reward words of praise from the great headgirl were words of praise indeed alison and miss quentin the term hurried on its way the girls began to talk about christmas holidays and what they were going to dopantomimes parties and theatres were discussed gladys looked a little bleak when the girls began to talk excitedly about the coming holidays will your mother be well enough to leave the hospital and have you home with her asked mirabel no im staying at school for the hols said gladys matron will still be here you know and two girls from the third and fourth form whose parents are in india but i shall be very lonely without you mirabel poor gladys said mirabel in dismay i should hate to stay at school for the hols i must say after all most of the fun of being at boardingschool is being with crowds of others day and nightit wont be any fun for you being with one or two wont your mother really be better shes going to have a serious operation soon said gladys so i know quite well she wont be able to leave the hospital mirabel but the operation may make her well again so im just hoping for the best and im quite willing to stay on at school for the hols if only i hear that mother is getting better after the operation mrs unwin had written to mirabel about gladyss mother she had told mirabel not to show the letter to gladys i feel rather worried about gladyss mother she wrote she is to have the operation soonand i cant help wondering if she really will get over it because she is very weak if there is bad news you must comfort gladys all you can she will be very glad to have a friend if sadness comes to her i will let her know at once if the news is good mirabel said nothing to her friend about the letter but she was extra warm and friendly towards gladys it was unusual for the rather selfish thickskinned mirabel to think of some one else unselfishly and tenderly it softened her domineering nature and made her a much nicer girl gladys was pleased to be able to tell her mother about the match she wished she had shot a winning goal but it was something to shoot the goal that made a draw shall write and tell your mother too said mirabel who could not do enough for her friend just then oh mirabelyou are good said gladys delighted you wrote to mother after the concert and i guess she was pleased to hear all you said my wordwhat a silly i was at the beginning of the term all mopey and miserable couldnt take an interest in anything i should think you hated me well i didnt like you very much said mirabel honestly but i guess you didnt like me much either gladys was not only shining at lacrosse but in the drama class as well i miss quentin who had been really amazed at gladyss performance on the night of the concert was making a great fuss of her and her talent alison didnt like it at all she was jealous and there were some days when she could hardly speak to gladys the play was to be performed at the end of the term miss quentin had tried out alison doris carlotta and now gladys in the principal feminine part there was no doubt that alison looked the prettiest and the most graceful and that she was quite wordperfect and had rehearsed continually but gladys was by far the best actress miss quentin had given alison to understand that she would have the chief part she had not actually said so in so many words but the class as a whole took it for granted that alison would take the part they found it quite natural too for they knew how hard the girl had worked at learning the words a task always difficult for her alison was really silly about miss quentin she waited round corners for her hoping for a smile she hung on every word the teacher said she was worse than she had been with sadie greene the term beforefor one thing sadie had had a little common sense and often laughed at alison but miss quentin had no common sense at all so alison became worse instead of better and the secondformers became quite exasperated with her then alison heard some news that gave her a great blowmiss quentin was not coming back the next term are you sure asked alison looking with wide eyes at hilary who had come in with the news well i heard mamzelle say to miss quentin well wellso you will be on the stage next term whilst we are all struggling with our tiresome girls i apparently miss quentm had only just heard the news herselfshe had a letter in her hand i think she must only have been engaged for a termits the first time weve had a proper drama class perhaps miss theobald was trying out the idea hilary looked at alison who had tears in her eyes cheer up alisonthe world wont come to an end because your beloved miss quentin isnt here next term i youll find some one else to moon round dont fret it was a great shock to alison she had dreamed of term after term in miss quentins drama dasses with herself taking all the chief parts hi every play hearing honeyed words of praise dropping daily from the teachers lips she went away by herself and cried very bitterly the silly girl gave her heart far too easily to anyone who attracted her or made a fuss of her whats come over alison asked pat in surprise when her cousin appeared with swollen eyes been in a row alison shes only sorrowing because her beloved miss quentin wont be here next term to pat her on her back and tell her she is very very good said janet alison dont be an idiot said isabel you know perfectly well miss quentin wont be much loss we all think shes too soft for words and think how mean she was in taking the credit for gladyss performance at the concert i have never believed that said alison tears coming into her eyes again you dont know miss quentin as i doshes the truest honestest most loyal person ive never met any one like her nor have said pat and thank goodness i havent alison why must you go and choose the wrong people to moon round sadie greene was amusing but she hadnt anything in her at alland neither has miss quentin now take miss jenks for instance miss jenks said alison with an angry sniff who would want to moon round miss jenks with her snappy tongue and cold eyes weu i think shes pretty decent said pat not that i should want to moon round her or any one for that matter im only just saying you will keep on choosing the wrong people to lavish your affections on sadie has never even written to youand i bet miss quentin wont either she will shes very fond of me said alison the others gave it up alison would never learn sense its a pity she cant find out how silly her miss quentin really ishow undependable said hilary your featherheaded cousin pat wants to lean common senseits a pity she cant find out that all her ideas about miss quentin are only dreamsthe real miss quentin isnt a bit as alison pictures her well we cant teach her said pat shell make herself miserable for the rest of the term now and for all the hols too i expect alison was really unhappy to hear that her favourite teacher was leaving she thought she would hang about near the common room of the junior mistresses and watch for miss quentin to come out then she would tell her how upset she was so she went to a little lobby near the common room and pretended to be hunting for something there she could hear miss quentins voice talking to mamzelle behind the closed door of the common room but she could not hear anything that was said then some one opened the door and came out it was miss lewis the history teacher leave the door open cried mamzelle it is stuffy in here so miss lewis left the door open and went off towards the school library alison stood in the little lobby her heart beating fast waiting for miss quentin to come out surely she would come soon the mistresses went on talking some of them had clear distinct voices and some spoke too low for alison to hear anything she did not mean to listen she was only waiting for miss quentinbut suddenly she heard her own name spoken by miss quentin herself alison stiffened and her heart thumped was miss quentin going to praise her to the others it would be just like her to say something nice alison osullivan is going to get a shock said miss quentin in the low clear voice that alison thought so beautiful the silly girl thinks shes good enough to play the lead in the secondform play shes been wearing herself out rehearsingit will do her good to find shes not going to have the part whos going to have it then asked miss jenks gladys hillman answered miss quentin promptly ive had my eye on that child ever since the beginning of the term shes three times as good as any one else she will be marvellous as the countess jeannette i wish alison worked as hard in my classes as she does in yours remarked mamzelle in her rather harsh loud voice ah her french exercises i but i think miss quentin she really does work at drama oh well she simply adores me said miss quentin easily i can always make her type work shell do anything for a smile or a kind word from melike a dear little petdog but give me somebody like that wild carlottasomebody with something in them alison bores me to tears with her breathless yes miss quentin no miss quentin oh can i miss quentin it will be good for her to have a shock and find she has to take back place to gladys hillman im not so sure said miss jenks in her cool voice shocks are not always good for rather weak characters miss quentin i hope you will break your news kindly to poor alisonotherwise she will weep all day and as exams are coming on tomorrow i dont want bad work from her because of you oh dont worry ill just pat her curly head and say a few kind words said miss quentin shell eat out of my hand she always does miss lewis came back and shut the door not a word more could be heard alison sat on a bench in the lobby sick at heart shocked and hurt beyond measure her mind was in a whirl she had not been able to help hearingand once she had grasped that her idol miss quentin was poking fun at her she had not even been able to get up and go she had had to sit there hearing every cruel word she was not to have the leading part in the play miss quentin wasnt fond of heronly amused with her thinking her a little petdog some one to pat and laugh at i miss quentin had told a lieshe had not noticed gladys hfflman at all until the night of the concert i miss quentin was bored with her i alison was too shocked even to cry she sat in the lobby quietly looking straight in front of her what was it that miss jenks had said shocks are not always good for weak characters was she alison such a weak character then the girl rubbed her hand across her forehead which was wet and clammy i have to think all this out said alison to herself i cant tell any one im too ashamed but i must think things out oh miss quentin how could you say all that poor alison i this was the greatest shock she had ever had in her easygoing life i all her admiration and love for miss quentin vanished at oncepassed like a dream in the night there was nothing of it left except an ache she saw the drama teacher as the others saw hersomeone pleasant and amiable but undependable disloyal shallow alison was a silly girl as changeable as a weathervane swinging now this way and now that easily upset and easily pleased as the others often said she hadnt much in her but in this hour of horrorfor it was horror to hershe found something in herself that she hardly knew she possessed and that something was a sense of dignity i she wasnt going to go under because of some one like miss quentin i she wasnt going to be a petdog eating out of her hand i she had too much dignity for that she would show miss quentin that she was wrong hurt and shocked though she was alison had a glimmering of common sense all at once and she held up her head blinked away the tears and made up her mind what she was going to do so it came about that when miss quentin broke the news to the drama class that gladys was to have the leading part and not alison the girl gave no sign at all of being disappointed her face was pale for she had slept badly that night but it had a calmness and dignity that astonished the watching girls so gladys is to have the part you see finished miss quentin she lightly touched alisons curly head im afraid my alison will be disappointed of course not miss quentin said alison moving away from the teachers hand i think gladys should have the part she is the best of us alland i am very glad the girls stared at alison in the greatest amazement they had expected tearseven sulksbut not this cool acceptance of an unpleasant fact who would have thought alison would take it like that said janet wellgood for her all the same i think its a shame miss quentin made us all think alison would have the part alison would not meet miss quentins eye she played the part she was given very well but seemed quite unmoved when miss quentin praised her miss quentin was puzzled and a little hurt girls i have something to tell you she said at the end of the lesson i shall not be here next term i shall miss you all very muchespecially one or two of you who have worked extremely hard she looked hard at alison expecting to see tears and to hear cries of oh miss quentin i we shall miss you but alison did not look at the teacher she gazed out of the window as if she had not heard hilary cleared her throat and spoke politely i am sure we are all sorry to hear that miss quentin we hope you will be happy wherever you go miss quentin was hurt and disappointed she spoke directly to alison alison i know you worked specially hard for me she said i worked hard because i like drama said alison in a cool voice looking miss quentin in the eyes for the first time this was a direct snub and the girls gasped in surprise whatever made alison behave like that they gazed at her in admiration so alison had seen through her beloved miss quentin at lastand instead of moaning and wailing had put on a cloak of dignity and coolness one up to alison miss quentin retired gracefully to her next class very much puzzled the girls crowded round alison alison whats happened has your beloved miss quentin offended you shut up said alison pushing her way between the girls i cant tell you anything i dont want to discuss it let me alone they let her go puzzled but respecting her request somethings happened said hilary watching the whitefaced girl going out of the room but whatever it is is for the best alison seems suddenly more grownup time she was said pat anywayif she stops mooning round somebody different each termor at any rate chooses somebody worthwhileit will be a blessing nobody ever knew what had made alison grow up so suddenly only alison herself knew and out of her hurt came something worthwhile that was to help her in many years to come an exciting end of term exams were being held and girls were groaning daily over them mamzelle was in a state of trepidation in case any of the girls fell short of passmarks the girls were in a far greater state feeling quite certain that nobody at all would pass in french mamzelle always threatened to give them such difficult papersbut when the time came they were not so bad after all gladys found the exams difficult because her mother was to have her operation that week she was very anxious indeed mirabel did all she could to help her to prepare each evening it was good to see the patience and kindliness of the bigger girl the others wanned greatly to mirabel because of it even elsie felt sorry for the anxious girl i hope youll hear good news soon she said gladys looked at her in surprised gratitude fancy elsie saying anything kind the others heard the low words and looked at one another with raised eyebrows they had kept their promise to miss jenks and had not hindered elsie in any way in her efforts to behave more reasonably but on the other hand no girl had been able to show any liking for elsie it was impossible the girl had been too spiteful too exasperating altogether to be liked now she would be tolerated but nothing else miss jenks watched every ones behaviour and came to the conclusion that it was hopeless to expect any happiness or real help for elsie from the secondformers on the other hand the lazy anna had been a great success as headgirl of the form she had thrown aside her laziness and had come to the fore taking responsibility and making decisions capably and quickly miss jenks was pleased with her she was now ready to go up into the third form and take her part with the older girls there hilary wentworth could be headgirl next term miss jenks spoke to miss theobald about it and the head agreed but what are we to do with elsie she said i will have a talk with her so elsie was sent for and sat rather sullenly in miss theobalds drawingroom expecting to be scolded or something even worseshe might be told that st clares didnt want her any more elsie said miss theobald i know you have found things difficult this termmostly your own fault as i think you will admit elsie looked at miss theobalds solemn face yes she said at last i suppose things were mostly my own fault the second form dont like me at all they will never have me as headgirl they just tolerate me thats all it makes things hard for me i feel i can never do anything to alter their opinion and so i cant very well take any pleasure in being there you see elsie one of the hardest things in the world to forget and forgive is spitefulness said miss theobald malice and spite rouse such bitter feelings in others other faults such as greed irresponsibility silliness these arouse disgust but are forgotten and forgiven spite always rankles and is never forgotten i can see you will never do any good either to yourself or to others in the second form elsie waited her heart sinking this meant that she was to be asked to leave she didnt want to do that she did like st clares she stared at miss theobald miserably the head guessed what the girl was thinking im not going to say you must leave st clares she said quickly i think the school can do a lot for you elsie and you may be able to do something for st clares too noyou shant leave i i think you must go up into the third form insteadleave behind the secondformers who have seen such a bad side of your character and go into the third form which next term will have five or six new girls you will have a chance then to show a different side of your character you are not really ready to go up either in your work or in your behaviourbut i will send you up if you will tell me that you will take this chance and work hard and more important still try to get the cattiness out of your nature that every schoolgirl detests elsies heart lifted in relief go up into the third formand leave behind the girls who would always dislike her wouldnt she work hard wouldnt she be kind and friendly and helpful to the new girls who didnt know anything about her she smiled gladly what about anna she asked is she going up too yesbut you can trust anna not to give you away at all said miss theobald shes a good girlshe really has turned out well as headgirl now elsietake this chance and make good i will said elsie thank you miss theobald i never thought of going up into the third form it makes all the difference in the world the girl went out pleased and hopeful she saw gladys hillman in the passage and went up to her with a warm gesture of friendliness any news of your mother old thing she asked not yet said gladys wondering whatever could have made elsie look so friendly and glad elsie went on her way and met bobby i say she said i saw poor old gladys just now cant we do something to take her out of herself a bit shes moping again good idea said bobby at once ill play that trick on mamzelleyou know the trick that makes plates jump about mamzelle is taking lunch today at our table because miss jenks is going out it will be sport so the secondformers were told that a trick was about to be played and they all cheered up forgot about exams and looked at bobby with bright eyes the first trick that term i it was time one was played i mamzelle was in a good temper the first form had done unexpectedly well in their french exam she beamed at everybody the secondformers beamed back and doris gave a deep chuckle exactly like mamzelles ah this bad doris said mamzelle clapping doris on the shoulder she can imitate me perrrrfectly but she cannot roll her rs yet in the true french way nowlet us go to the diningroom the bell for luncheon has gone today i take you for the meal because the good miss jenks is out the second form seated themselves at their table mamzelle was at the head bobby was three places away from her the others looked at her grinning they hoped she had been able to slip into the diningroom and lay her plans i bobby had prepared everything carefully there was a pile of plates at mamzelles place ready for her to serve the stew for each girl bobby had removed the plates and had deftly placed the long rubber tubing under the tablecloth so that it ran from where the plates were to bobbys own seat and hung down under the cloth the bladderend was where the pktes were and the bulb to press was by bobbys place bobby replaced the pile of plates over the bladderend the plates were too heavy to move when the bulb was pressedbut when all the girls were served and only mamzelles plate was there it would tip up beautifully as soon as bobby pressed the bulb which filled the bladderend with air i mamzelle served out the stew rapidly the girls began their meal hungrily one eye on mamzellos plate it was the only one left now mamzelle filled it with stew and gravy she was very fond of gravy at first said mamzelle conversationally taking up her knife and fork at first when i came to england i did not like this stew of yours i but nowah it is wonderful bobby pressed the rubber bulb she was holding under the cloth the bladderend under mamzelles plate filled with air and became fat and big mamzelles plate tilted up on one side gave a little wobble and subsided again as bobby let go the bulb she was pressing mamzelle was overcome with astonishment she felt her nose to see if her glasses were there yes they were but could she have seen right her plate had moved she took a quick look round at the girls they seemed to have noticed nothingthough actually all the girls had seen the plate lift and wobble and were fighting hard to keep from giggling mamzelle dismissed the matter from her mind she had imagined it i she began to make conversation again tomorrow you secondformers will have your french tests she said smiling round then she tried to cut a piece of meat with her knifewhilst bobby at the same moment pressed the rubber bulb air ran through to the bladder and mamzelles plate lifted itself up very suddenly and spilt some gravy over one side mamzelle looked at her plate in alarm it had done it again it was alive it had spilt its gravy on the doth tiens said mamzelle very much startled what is this what is what mamzelle asked janet with a solemn face nothing nothing said mamzelle hastily not liking to say that she feared her plate was alive but something certainly was the matter with it she looked down at it hardly daring to eat her meal bobby gave the plate a rest mamzelle looked at it warily for a little while and then plucked up her courage to eat her meal once more the plate seemed to be behaving itself then it suddenly went mad again it tipped up and down slowly and solemnly three times then jerked from side to side spilling some more gravy mamzelle grew really alarmed she glanced at the girls how strange that they did not seem to see what was happening i she must be going mad i dont you like your stew mamzelle asked pat solemnly i thought you said it was wonderful mamzelle looked suspiciously at her plate which was now quiet doris made a silly joke in order to let the girls laugh loudly for two or three of them were almost hysterical by now and would certainly have given the game away if they had not been able to laugh loudly the rest of the school looked in amazement at the bellowing girls miss theobald who sat at the head of the sixthform table was displeased quiet please she called to the secondformers they choked and became quiet doris was purple in the face with trying not to laugh again mamzelle looked round with a frown such a noise she said reprovingly but her attention was soon drawn to her plate again when it solemnly rose up and down twice and then became quite still mamzelle frowned this could not really be happen ing plates could not behave like that it was nonsense she would eat her dinner and not think about it dont do it again till the pudding comes whispered carlotta to bobby we cant help squealing with laughter now we shall get into a row give usa rest so for the rest of the first course the plate behaved itself and mamzelle was much relieved but when the pudding arrived and she had served it out leaving only her own plate in its place the fun began again the puddingplate leapt quite wildly and mamzelle pushed her chair back with a scream the girls choked and the tears ran down their cheeks ah this plate cried mamzelle it is as bad as the other one see how it jumps bobby kept the plate quite still doris exploded into laughter and two or three joined her helplessly miss theobald began to look really vexed the rest of the school craned their necks to see whatever could be happening at the secondform table the plate moved again and mamzelle backed away still farther miss theobald amazed and puzzled left her place and walked over to the secondform table every girl was rocking in helpless laughter not even the presence of the head mistress could stop them this was the funniest thing they had ever seen mamzelle what is the matter asked miss theobald really annoyed mamzelle turned to her wildly my plate she said my plate well what is wrong with it asked miss theobald impatiently thinking that mamzelle must really have gone mad it seems all right to me miss theobald it jumps it dances it leaps around the table said mamzelle earnestly exaggerating in the hope that miss theobald would be impressed it is a mad plate i cannot bear it the head mistress looked at the plate of pudding it lay quite still on the table perfectly ordinary she glanced round at the giggling girls she supposed they were laughing at mamzelles behaviour well it certainly was extraordinary you had better go and lie down mamzelle she said at last i think you cant be well i am well said poor mamzelle it is the plate that is mad you should see it jump miss theobald miss theobald looked doubtfully at the plateand bobby had a tremendous urge to make it jump again she pressed the bulb hard and the plate jumped up at once wobbled and fell back again miss theobald looked astonished and mamzelle gave another squeal the girls screamed with laughter miss theobald lifted up the plate and pushed back the tablecloth there underneath was the little rubber bladder attached to the tubing that led to bobbys place mamzelles eyes nearly fell out of her head when she saw it i think mamzelle one of the girls is playing a trick on you said miss theobald i will leave you to deal with it i daresay roberta can explain how it was done the girls stopped laughing they stared at miss theobald walking back to her seat they looked at mamzelle who glared at poor bobby what is this horrible trick she inquired in a loud voice bobby explained and mamzelle listened carefully she removed the whole thing and looked at it then she put back the tablecloth and her plate and began to eat her pudding looking straight in front of her with her sloeblack eyes the girls felt uncomfortable was mamzelle really offended really angry the trick was quite a harmless one they finished their pudding and sat still suddenly there came a snort from mamzelle and all the secondformers looked up in surprise mamzelle threw back her head she roared she bellowed she laughed so much that the relieved secondformers couldnt help laughing again too it was a good trick said mamzelle at last wiping her eyes yes a good trick i shall make my sister laugh till she cries when i tell her when i think of that plate jumping at me like thatah magnifique ill lend you the whole trick if you like said janet it belongs to my brother you can play the trick on your sister mamzelle stared at her in delight what a good idea she exclaimed beaming this will cheer my good sister immensely you shall show me how it works miss theobald smiled as she left the room it really had been funny what a good thing mamzelle had seen the funny sidebut she could generally be trusted to poor mamzellethe hundreds of tricks that had been played on her during her years at st clares she would never learn to be suspicious of the girls marvellous said janet when the secondformers were in their common room again discussing the affair simply super bobby you did it awfully well i thought i should have died trying to keep in my laughter oh dearwhen i think of that plate jumping about and mamzelles horrified facei want to scream all over again every one was amused and gladys who had seen few tricks played in her life laughed as much as any one she forgot her worry for a while and mirabel was glad to see her smiling face as she listened to the talk the next day mamzelle gave out the french papers they were much easier than the class expected and every one gave a sigh of relief even doris hoped she might get enough marks for a pass in the middle of the exam when everything was perfectly quiet some one flashed by the window on a bicycle mirabel glanced up it was a telegraph boy i she looked across at gladys gladys had seen him too and had gone white she wondered if the telegram held any news for her after a few minutes the door opened and a maid looked in please could miss gladys hillman go to miss theobald she said gladys stood up her knees shaking she was sure the telegram said that her mother was dead she went out of the room as if she was walking in a dream mirabel stared after her miserable she feared the worst too but in two minutes gladys was back i the door was flung open and she burst into the room her face beaming and her eyes shining she rushed to mirabel mirabel mothers had the operation and shes come through it wonderfully shes going to get better im to see her soon just for an hour perhaps next week mirabel isnt it marvellous mirabel was as glad as if it had been her own mother she forgot about the class and put her arm round the happy girl oh gladys she said its marvellous i am glad hurrah yelled bobby as delighted as any one good old gladys i too am glad beamed mamzelle forgetting all about the french exam for a wonder such a surprise for you now you will be able to smile again gladys glanced round the room suddenly remembering where she was she had forgotten everything for the moment except that she must tell mirabel her friend the great news she went back to her seat so happy that she felt she might cry with gladness at any moment and now we must look at our exam papers again said mamzelle in a kindly voice gladys you should do a wonderful paper with such good news to help you every one was glad the term had only two more days to go and the girls were pleased to think that gladys had something to look forward to they were as nice to her as they could be even elsie the last day came and packing was begun gladys couldnt help feeling a little sad as she saw every one preparing to go away for the holidays she would have to stay at schoolbut never mind she would be able to see her mother soon what a pity she was so far away it would be difficult to see her more than once just as the second form were in a complete muddle over their packing miss theobald came into the room with a letter in her hand she had just received it the girls stood up and listened oh mirabel said miss theobald in her clear voice i have just received a letter from your mother she says you can take gladys home with you for the holidays if i will give my permission as then she can go to see her mother twice a week quite easily from your home which is not very far from the hospital mirabel gave a shriek of delight gladys turned as red as a beetroot miss theobald t how marvellous i isnt mother a brick can gladys come with me of course said the head mistress smiling at the bewildered radiant gladys but she will have to pack very quickly hurry up gladys and see if you can be ready by the time the schoolcoaches arrive ready of course she could be ready helped by j willing hands gladys flew here and there cramming every thing in her heart singing with joy to go home with mirabelsee her friends brother and sistervisit her own mother twice a week i what wonderful luck and if i hadnt tackled mirabel that time and got i her to change her mind and stay on nothing like this i would have happened thought the girl packing her jerseys it just shows youve got to have courage and go straight for things
