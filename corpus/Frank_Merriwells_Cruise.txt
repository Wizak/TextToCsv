browning will be in party great sport anticipated merriwell jack diamond was reclining in a hammock suspended in the shade of an artificial arbor when this message from frank merriwell was handed to him by a boy he tore open the envelope and read it his eyes beginning to sparkle and a flush coming to his handsome aristocratic face just like him exclaimed jack before leaving fardale he aroused our curiosity about that part of the country and now he proposes taking us down there in his own yacht will i go will i i wouldnt miss it for the world it had not taken him a minute to decide a cab rattled up to the front of the american hotel on hanover street boston and stopped the door flew open and out stepped a smartly dressed young man wearing russet shoes a lightcolored box coat and a brown alpine hat he carried a handsome alligatorskin traveling bag in his hand paying cabbie without speaking a word this youth turned and walked into the hotel as he entered a colored boy hastened forward and relieved him of his traveling bag he stepped up to the clerks desk and said i am jack diamond of virginia and i wish to see mr frank merriwell who is stopping here yes sir said the clerk politely mr merriwell left orders that you be shown up immediately on your arrival twentythree show mr diamond to mr merriwells rooms right this way sah said the colored boy jack followed the uniformed bell boy who paused at the elevator shaft and pressed a button in a moment the elevator came gliding noiselessly down the door slid open a lady and a gentleman stepped out and diamond stepped in third said the bell boy and then he turned and disappeared while the elevator man closed the door and sent the car gliding upward he stopped at the third floor and to jacks surprise the bell boy with the grip was there calmly awaiting his arrival jack followed him to the door of a room at the front of the house as the boy lifted his hand to knock at the door there was a burst of laughter within plainly heard as the transom was open and frank merriwells voice cried hans if you could tell that story on the stage just as you told it then you would make your fortune vot vos der madder mit me exclaimed the voice of hans dunnerwust franks german friend dot nefer vos a funny stories you dond seen vot i larft ad dot peen a bathetic sdory i oxbected you vould took mein handkersheft oudt und cried id indo but you sed roundt und laugh ad dot bathetic sdory like i vos a lot of monkeys you dont like dot as vell as i might then there was another burst of laughter and the knock of the bell boy was not heard never mind said diamond taking his traveling bag and giving the boy a dime ill go right in he opened the door and stepped into the room hodge browning merriwell and dunnerwust were there bart was tilted back in a chair with his feet on the table while lazy bruce was half sitting and half reclining on a sofa frank sat astride a chair looking over the back of it at hans who had stood in the middle of the room as he told his bathetic sdory hello fellows cried the lad from virginia heartily there was a shout of welcome frank sprang forward quickly and grasped diamonds hand delighted old man laughed merry i was afraid you wouldnt come till i received your telegram stating that you would be on hand any trouble in persuading the mother not much though she said it did seem that i might remain at home a while longer and she told me to tell you that she is beginning to get jealous of you as i spend so much of my time during vacations with you how you vos shack said hans getting hold of diamonds free hand the latter having dropped his traveling bag i vos a sight vor sore eyes aind you you dond knew how dickled you vos to seen me hodge came forward and shook hands expressing his pleasure and with sundry grunts browning succeeded in getting upon his feet saying as he rose suppose ill have to stand to shake or youll challenge me you southerners are so confoundedly particular about courtesy and all that jack smiled i know you too well to resent it if you lay on your back and offered to shake hands with me in fact it surprises me to discover you hadnt rather fight a duel after you were obliged to get up than to get up when not absolutely forced to do so what baggage did you bring asked merry a trunk it will be brought to the hotel here there is no room for trunks on board the white wings said frank youll have to store your trunk and such stuff as you do not absolutely need till we get back here the white wings is that the name of your yacht yes good name how did you happen to buy a yacht got a bargain of her i came on to boston with miss burrage whose aunt was waiting here for her i met jack benjamin you remember him harvard man yes plays football yes i remember him his sister is a stunningly handsome girl huah grunted browning that explains how you happen to remember him well frank went on benjamin turned out to be a fine fellow invited me over to his house treated me beautifully he knows a lot of sporty chaps among them was walter pringle who owned this yacht pringle took a party of us out for a cruise down the bay and we had a grand time went to nantasket coming back pringle said he had planned to cruise down to the eastward this summer with a party of friends but something had come up that knocked out the arrangement then it was that i thought of a talk we once had while at fardale about making a cruise down along the maine coast and i spoke of it said id like to own his yacht saw pringle looked a little queer he stared at me a few moments and then asked what i would give for the white wings i questioned him some about her and then made an offer he didnt take me up but the next day he came and told me the yacht was mine i was astonished for i didnt offer much more than onehalf what she is really worth but he said he must have the money without delay as he was going to get out of boston in a hurry i dispatched prof scotch and he wired me the amount i bought the boat and now i hear pringle has left for seattle on his way to alaska his father is hot over it for he didnt want his son to go pringle had the fever and he sold the yacht in a hurry to raise money to go with i have a bargain we can make our cruise and then when it is over by looking about ill be able to get rid of the white wings for more than i paid for her are you sure the transaction is all right asked diamond all right how do you mean why strictly on the level pringle is not a minor no grunted browning but he has gone to be a miner here here cried frank quickly that wont do its prohibited it may be when we get on board the white wings but were ashore now and you are not capt merriwell yet pringle is twentyone said frank answering diamonds question he is all right and he was sole owner of the yacht he had the right to sell her of course benjamin told me pringle was strictly on the level well youre always lucky exclaimed the lad from virginia now you will get the fun of this cruise and when it is over youll be likely to sell the yacht for enough so that you will come out ahead on the whole deal expenses included i hope to acknowledged frank laughing i considered it a snap but that was not why i wanted the boat i wanted to make the cruise with my friends here are five of us and that is all the white wings will carry with absolute comfort there is plenty of room for us well make a jolly cruise of it fellows and i dont believe well ever regret going i have the boat stocked with provisions and some jew tailors up by scollay square are at work on uniforms for four of us well go out right away jack and you shall be measured for yours come on chapter ii inza and paula frank and jack left the american house and turned toward scollay square these tailors are rushers said merry they have made a reputation by turning out work in short order that is why we ordered the suits of them you know we sail tomorrow morning what not tomorrow sure well they will not have time to make up a suit for me oh yes they will impossible not at all old man they will get the work out in a hurry as i shall pay them to do it but i never heard of such a thing possibly not you are in boston now in virginia they require more time to accomplish anything down in this part of the country things move diamond could hardly believe that he could obtain a suit to order in such a short time they came to scollay square into which trolley cars were pouring from various sections and soon they reached the store of the jew tailors it was a large store and at least a dozen customers were looking over samples striking bargains or being measured however the boys were not forced to wait for one of the proprietors came forward greeted frank by name and said your order will be ready for you on time mr merriwell we sail at nine oclock tomorrow morning said frank here is a friend of mine who will require a suit like the others that is crowding us somewhat sir smiled the tailor i hardly think we can i will pay five dollars extra if the suit is delivered at the american house at six oclock in the morning said frank quietly very well sir i think that will cover the extra expense of rushing it through if the gentleman will step back this way his measure will be taken so jack was measured and ten minutes after entering the store the boys left it he didnt even ask a deposit of you merry said jack in surprise no benjamin vouched for me and that was all that was necessary no deposit was required under such circumstances what if he fails to get the suits round on time he wont he wouldnt want them left on his hands franks confidence reassured jack and they strolled over toward tremont street and finally came out at the common id like to have a little time to look boston over said jack you can do that when we come back if you were to stop long enough to take in all the interesting sights we wouldnt get down into maine this summer i want to spend a little more time in boston although i have seen faneuil hall the new public library building the old south church bunker hill monument and a hundred other interesting things the business portion of boston is not particularly attractive but the suburbs and the aristocratic dwelling sections are beautiful they walked across the common to the public gardens then turned round and strolled back from tremont row they went down temple street to washington and just as they reached jordan marsh cos store two girls stepped out upon the sidewalk and came face to face with them miss burrage exclaimed diamond lifting his hat inza cried frank also lifting his hat miss benjamin too this is an unexpected pleasure miss benjamin permit me to present a particular friend of mine mr jack diamond of virginia paula benjamin was a pretty girl her eyes met jacks and she showed her pearly teeth in a most bewitching smile as she bowed saying i have heard of mr diamond indeed exclaimed jack i was not aware i was quite as famous yes my brother mentioned you perhaps you know something of him his name is jack he plays on the harvard eleven and he spoke of me that is surprising dont see what he could have said about me i dont believe i will tell laughed the girl and her manner aroused all of the virginians curiosity please tell he urged smiling well hesitated paula still laughing before the game on jarvis field he said you were fool enough to think frank merriwell could beat the whole harvard eleven after the game he said you werent half the fool he took you for this caused them all to laugh and as the street was crowded they strolled on together oh frank exclaimed inza you cant guess what we are going to do then i will give it up without trying what is it paula and i are going to bar harbor what its true i am astonished i knew you would be weve been talking about it you know saying wed like to go yesterday paula had a letter from her cousin who is spending the summer down there her cousin urged her to come paulas mother said it was impossible as two girls like us should not be traveling about alone then aunt abigail said shed like to spend a week or two in bar harbor herself and she volunteered to chaperone us after a while paula obtained her mothers consent and we take the bangor boat for rockland tomorrow night by jove this is interesting well have to run in to bar harbor and see you on our cruise i didnt suppose we would see much of each other after leaving fardale i didnt know as you would care about that said inza carelessly care exclaimed frank you should know i would care how can you say anything like that what made you imagine i wouldnt care oh something something what was it tell me inza sometime perhaps tell me now urged frank in his masterful way during the last of my stay in fardale i noticed a change in your treatment of me inza did you she murmured lifting her eyebrows yes you were cold toward me and you seemed to shun me if i tried to be friendly as in the old days you would not give me the opportunity i did not understand it that is singular the reason was plain enough if so i must have been thickwitted elsie bellwood was there yes i read your secret you made your choice between us frank was astounded choice what can you mean inza i did not make any choice oh but you did if you say so but i really you made your choice that time when the boat upset and we were struggling in the water elsie and i you plunged in to her rescue i was quite as near to you as was elsie nearer if anything frank caught his breath beginning to realize what she meant inza went on you swam to elsies rescue you saved her that was the test i brought it about for i upset the boat intentionally to settle the point i wanted to know which one of us you cared the most for and i found out it was like her frank realized that he knew she was telling the truth when she said she upset the boat intentionally but you you could swim some inza i knew it did you know elsie could not swim n no she is the daughter of a sea captain and she has been with him on many voyages there was every reason to suppose that she could swim quite as well as i or better no frank you made your choice between us that day its all right and she forced a laugh that was not very musical i dont deny that at one time i did think more of you than any other fellow there was every reason why i should you saved me from a mad dog saved me from death beneath a railroad engine saved me from drowning but i am not a fool if i am a girl i have not been taking stock in all the passionate love stories i have read i got out of the way i remained elsies friend for she is the sweetest girl i know i dont blame you for thinking more of her than you do of me inza frank uttered the word in protest it was all he could say you cant deny it so dont try came almost harshly from the girl its all right were still friends well always be friends nothing more sometime ill be bridesmaid at the wedding and but frank had heard enough and he stopped her i am not likely to marry anyone very soon he said elsie knows that lets talk about something else how did it happen we met you inza seemed willing enough to permit the conversation to be turned into another channel we were out shopping you know making our last purchases before starting for bar harbor you must take us out on your yacht after we all get down there ill do it your aunt oh she will not object you know she thinks you the finest fellow in all the world she will come along at last the boys were forced to part from the girls but jack had made such progress with paula that she offered him her hand at parting saying laughingly next fall you will not pick the winner if you pick yale even if mr merriwell is on that eleven if you want to keep your record for wisdom be careful jove exclaimed jack after they had seen the girls on board a car shes a wayupper merry shes a good sample of the boston girl eh wheres her glasses you have been reading the comic papers she didnt mention emerson or browning and that surprised you why i didnt suppose the genuine boston girl could talk ten minutes without doing so boston girls are very much like other nice girls old man they are well educated refined and all that but they are not always quoting emerson and browning they do not all wear glasses they are not all cold and freezing and they are handsome they came to cornhill a car was coming down from scollay square and they paused close to it to let it swing out upon washington street just as the front of the car approached frank merriwell received a push from behind that sent him flat upon the track directly in front of the car wheels that particular car did not have a fender and it seemed that frank must be mangled beneath the wheels the motorman saw the lad go down and put on the brake hard but he could not stop the car in time frank realized that he had been pushed upon the track by some one whose deliberate purpose it was to maim or murder him but he could not save himself he struck the paving and the iron wheels seemed right upon him but jack diamond moved with marvelous quickness he made a grasp at frank as the latter fell almost caught him then stooped grasped his coat and yanked merry from the track the car brushed frank as it passed but he was not injured thank you old man said merriwell as he quickly rose to his feet you saved me that time but who pushed me they looked about a small crowd had witnessed franks peril and gathered in the crowd was a person slipping away with a bound frank was after him caught him by the shoulder swung him to get a look at his face get out the fellow snarled the words and struck at franks face with his clinched hand frank dodged wat snell he cried astounded yes wat snell grated the other who was a boy well known to him a boy who had been his enemy years before at fardale academy when they both went to school you pushed me accused frank you lie i did not touch you you fell i felt you push me you miserable dog dont dare talk like that to me hissed snell ill have you what you dont dare do anything that is cowardly and treacherous you did push me thats right exclaimed a boy i seen him do it there was a murmur from the crowd that began to gather about black looks were directed toward snell he ought to be lynched blustered a little old man then there were threats and snell grew pale looking around for some means of escape he saw accusing and angry faces on all sides and he quailed and trembled it was an accident he whined humbly i ran against you by accident ill swear i didnt recognize you and i didnt mean you any harm call an officer cried the little old man it was an attempt at murder have him taken care of with a gasp snell plunged through the crowd and took to his heels some tried to stop him but he ran like a deer up cornhill there was a short pursuit but the fellow doubled and dodged escaping his pursuers let him go said frank i wouldnt make a charge against him for it would detain me and we must get away in the morning wind and weather permitting he ought to be punished said diamond he tried to kill you it isnt the first time he has tried to do something to me we are old old foes why i supposed him in fardale so did i its singular hes here in boston rather what is the meaning of it i cant tell dont ask me he bobs up anywhere anyhow were not liable to see him again for some time after we leave here tomorrow they returned to the hotel and told the others of their adventures all the boys were astonished to learn that wat snell was in the city chapter iii a hoodooed yacht promptly at six oclock the following morning the uniforms were delivered at the american house without delay the boys put them on and they proved satisfactory in every way so frank paid the bill and the messenger who brought them departed satisfied the boys ate an early breakfast and all had good appetites the american house dining room is rather somber but they joked and laughed in the best of spirits after breakfast final arrangements for the care of their baggage were made then a cab was ordered and they all piled in and were rattled away toward atlantic avenue jack had not seen franks yacht and he was curious concerning her appearance not far from the pier of the bangor boat lay the white wings guarded by a watchman who saluted merriwell as the boys went aboard the white wings was a sloop yacht with club and jib topsails she was not large and it did not strike diamond that she would prove to be fast but she looked comfortable and comfort was what they sought they were not thinking of racing frank paid the watchman for his services and gave him something extra whereupon the man departed greatly satisfied come fellows called merry well go below and see how she looks down there they descended into the cabin which was locked merry having the key jack was astonished when they entered the cabin for it was far more roomy than he had supposed possible a glimpse at the curtained berths showed there was plenty of sleeping room for all of them there was a folding table an oil stove comfortable seats on the lockers and everything looked inviting four handsome repeating shotguns and a magazine rifle hung above the lockers how does she look down here fellows asked frank she looks all right grunted browning as he lazily rolled into one of the bunks excuse me i want to see what kind of a place ill be stowed in when i am seasick what do you think youll do with those guns frank asked jack cant tell smiled frank remember we are going down into maine yes but you told us maine was a civilized state from your talk when we discussed the matter i didnt suppose guns would be needed down there is virginia civilized well rather ever find anything to shoot up in the mountain region oh yes but thats all new york is civilized but there are bears and deer in the adirondacks well i didnt know we were going anywhere near a portion of maine where there was game cant tell where we may go besides if they have game laws down there it must be close time for hunting it is but all the same it will be a good scheme to have these guns along were going to rough it a great deal and we may need them i have brought all sorts of rigs for fishing and i have two tents on board my idea gentlemen is to make this a regular outing trip and when we are not on board the white wings we do not want to spend our time in hotels not much nodded hodge say merriwell cried diamond in admiration you are a dandy you have planned all our outings for the past two years and we have had sport galore but what makes me sore is the fact that you pay all the bills a truck team came rumbling down onto the wharf and hodge looked around baggage he called a truckman had arrived with their luggage from the hotel the boys excepting browning went on deck and brought the stuff aboard as frank was settling with the truckman the latter said i wish you good luck young man but i doubt if youll have it taking a cruise in that craft why is that asked merry what is the matter with that craft well sir they do say as how she is hoodooed indeed yes sir everybody as has owned her in the last two years has had hard luck this is interesting i hauled her first load of provisions and i have known her a long time on her trial cruise she capsized before she got out of the harbor is that all hardly her first owner committed suicide on board of her cut his throat down below they say she has been haunted by his spook ever since merry laughed this is decidedly interesting id have given more for her if i had known she owned a spook i am very fond of spooks they are interesting boo shivered the truckman dont want none in mine have you told me all the unlucky things that have happened to the white wings no next fellow that owned her ran down a rowboat and drowned a boy then he put her on top of a ledge but got her off without doing her much damage he sold her for a song what happened next next fellow as owned her went crazy and is in an asylum they say he saw the spook go through the suicide act in the cabin and that was what crazed him the interest increases the horrors are piling up anything more benjamin owned her next anything happen to him yes what he got the klondike fever that all aint that enough hes run away to alaska and his fathers rich as mud he didnt have no need to go up there into that infernally cold region and freeze and starve his old mans so mad he threatens to cut him off well laughed frank the white wings is mine now and i dont fancy all the spooks of the infernal regions could scare me away from her in fact id rather enjoy having a call from a few spooks youll have some kind of bad luck declared the truckman as he prepared to go i dont like to tell you that but i think you oughter be looking out a young man with a small curly black mustache came hurrying onto the pier he was well dressed and carried a cane he came straight up to frank and the truckman where is the person known as frank merriwell he asked i am frank merriwell merry answered what can i do for you you are the chap i want to see said the stranger i understand you bought the white wings of jack benjamin i did sir and he sold it to you as clear and free of encumbrance he did he beat you how is that i hold a bill of sale of that yacht and i am here to claim it as my property was the answer frank was surprised the truckman slapped his hand against his hip and muttered i told him the thing is hoodooed anybody as has anything to do with it is bound to buck against hard luck this is rather surprising information said frank merriwell speaking with the utmost calmness while he studied the face of the stranger with piercing eyes i hardly understand it i believe jack benjamin has the reputation in boston of being on the level and so i hardly understand a piece of business like this perhaps benjamin was stuck found it out and got out of the hole the best way he could how do you mean perhaps at the time he bought the boat he didnt know i held the bill of sale of her frank started ha he exclaimed then benjamin did not give you the bill of sale no chap that owned her before that did his name is fearson fearson is he the one who went crazy the very same put in the truckman when did he give you this bill of sale dont remember the exact date the bill will show sure why do you want to know i want to find out if he gave it to you before a certain time thats all the strange claimant of the yacht was suspicious i dont see the point he said i hold the bill and i claim the yacht just found out what benjamin had done and i came down in a hurry after getting track of the boat to warn you not to try to move her i wont have it it began to look like a scrape but frank was not flustered in the least he kept his head saying have you the bill of sale with you sir yes will you be kind enough to permit me to look at it the stranger started to do so but seemed to change his mind of a sudden and said no i wont bother i tell you not to move her if you do ill make you pay a big sum for damages so look out frank smiled sweetly that is a very silly threat he murmured if you do not show me the document i shall not believe it exists that doesnt make any difference to it makes this difference it is now twenty minutes to nine at nine i shall cast off from the pier wind and tide being right it will not take me long to get out of the harbor you wouldnt dare what is there to dare i fail to see anything why confound you id make you smart for it you couldnt you have made a lot of bluffing talk about holding a bill of sale but i do not take any stock in that till you produce the document i have purchased this yacht and as long as i believe myself her rightful owner i shall do with her as i see fit at nine oclock she sails the fellow hesitated and then snapped out oh i can prove to you that i am not lying i will prove it here is the bill see for yourself he took a number of papers from his pocket and selected one among them which he opened and held before frank merriwell looked the document over carefully it was a bill of sale of the yacht white wings from fergus fearson to parker flynn is your name parker flynn asked frank it is and you bought the yacht of fearson you bet nodded the claimant triumphantly i rather think this document settles it it does nodded frank quietly then he turned to the truckman and asked when was mr fearson committed to the asylum the latter part of may and this bill is dated may st the fellow must have been deranged then oh you cant make that go cried flynn quickly its no use for you to try to crawl out of a little hole like that why have you not claimed the yacht before holding this bill why didnt you claim it while it was in benjamins possession answer that question i was away out of the city faltered flynn all the time most of the time very well here is your bill i advise you to destroy it without delay or it may get you into serious trouble what cried the man angrily destroy it ill have that yacht this bill gives me the right to it that bill gives you the right to nothing came clearly and distinctly from merriwells lips either you have been badly fooled or you are a rascal trying to obtain property that you have not the slightest claim upon it looks as if the latter were the real condition of affairs fergus fearson is confined in a madhouse and so he cannot deny that he ever gave you a bill of sale of this yacht deny it here is his signature and that may be forgery i tell you to be careful it is not forgery it is genuine your bluff will not go sir the yacht is mine and i will have her even if the signature is genuine the bill is not worth the paper its written on declared merriwell with the utmost coolness more bluffing you are crazy why isnt it good because it is dated may st what of that the date is exactly four days after john benjamin purchased and paid for this yacht as i can prove by documents in existence if fergus fearson sold you the white wings on may st he sold you property that did not belong to him thats all mr flynn the claimant of the yacht turned pale and stared at the bill and then at frank who was standing there so coolly before him on the deck of the yacht were three boys who had heard the most of the conversation now hodge exultantly exclaimed that was a body blow merry has floored him thats right nodded diamond frank has the best of it but it did seem that we were in a scrape flynn gasped for breath i dont believe it he cried the boat is mine so dont dare cast off from this pier the white wings sails at nine oclock said frank turning away flynns face that had been so pale flushed and turned purple with anger all at once he lifted his walking stick to bring it down on merrys head a cry from the boys on the yacht warned merriwell who ducked and dodged just in time whizz the cane cut through the air but merry was not touched quick as thought frank turned and grappled with parker flynn he wrenched away the cane and with a quick motion broke it across his knee then as he coolly tossed it into the water he said if you try any more funny business sir youll follow your cane oh ill fix you flynn almost screamed ill get a warrant for you ill be back in a hurry dont dare leave before i return he dashed away on the run i told you you would have bad luck said the truckman its begun oh i dont know laughed frank if flynn paid money for the yacht he is the one in hard luck at nine oclock the white wings cast off from the pier her sails were hoisted and aided by the outrunning tide she soon got away enough to catch a breeze and parker flynn had not returned chapter iv in the fog its no use fellows we cant go any further in this fog tonight said frank merriwell on the fourth day after leaving boston we must go farther exclaimed diamond there is no anchorage here how do you know we havent tried for it but we are not in a harbor no we are somewhere near the whitehead islands near the mouth of penobscot bay well lets keep on as long as there is a breath of wind i dont fancy anchoring here we might be run down in the night and if we keep on the chances are two to one that well run onto a reef or pile up on an island i had much rather take the chances of anchoring here and being run down the wind is dying out and this fog is shutting down thicker and thicker well said jack in a dissatisfied way this is your boat and you are in command you can do as you like ill do as the majority believes best then anchor grunted browning i dont fancy this prowling about in the fog hodge was in favor of anchoring and hans agreed with them so jack was the only one who felt like going on he gave up in disgust while they were talking the last faint breeze had fallen swiftly and by the time it was definitely decided the white wings lay becalmed rolling helplessly on the swells that came in from the open sea shimminy gristmas groaned hans i dont like dot roll up und drop avay motions id makes me feel sick to your stomach you will get enough of that as long as we remain anchored out here said diamond unpleasantly frank gave the orders and down came the sails a sounding showed they could anchor without trouble and then the anchor was cast the sails were not reefed for it was not known when they might be required arrangements were made for raising them on short notice night came down swiftly lights were set but the boys felt that a light was poor protection for them in that darkness and fog if we are in the course of the steamers well be run down grumbled jack therell have to be a regular watch tonight declared frank and the fog horn must be used browning had managed to crawl on deck and he looked disconsolate and disgusted this is what they call a life on the ocean wave he grunted oh it is more fun than a minstrel show well have to put up with some discomforts said merriwell we made a mistake in coming further east than portland put in jack that was a good place to stop wait till the sun comes out tomorrow and we run into rockland harbor laughed the owner of the white wings you will change your tune well i hope so hans was given the first watch and he remained on deck while the others went below and had supper at intervals he blew a blast on the horn which sounded like some lost animal bellowing in the fog frank laughed and joked and he succeeded in putting the others in better spirits after a time it was comfortable in the cabin despite the fog outside hodge made coffee and the smell of it as it bubbled over the blaze of the oil stove gave all of them a ravenous feeling of hunger the little folding table was let down and spread and the sight of the food and smell of the coffee took their minds off the unpleasantness of their situation it was a foolhardy thing running down here without somebody who knew the coast said jack my dear fellow smiled frank we have our chart and compass and i know a little something about navigation quit your worrying ill land you in rockland tomorrow all right you were going to land us there today and so i would had the wind held right and this fog kept off i believe there is a fog factory down this way somewhere said browning hodge announced that supper was ready and they gathered about the table the white wings was riding on a steady regular swell so they were not shaken up down there and they found they could eat without discomfort browning was hungry as a bear and he pitched into the spread well i dont know as this is too bad after all he confessed taking a third slice of tongue weve been in worse places thats right nodded hodge pass the sugar i want a little of this coffee myself i made it the coffee is good acknowledged jack it warms a fellow up a little grog wouldnt go bad in a case like this there is no grog on this boat and will not be as long as i own her declared merriwell its a foolish thing for a lot of fellows on a cruise like this to think that they must have grog oh i didnt suppose you had any on board merriwell said diamond i know your temperance principles too well to look for anything like that by the time they finished eating all were in much better spirits no one but hans had been troubled with seasickness thus far on the cruise and the dutch boy had not been very sick hans was called down to eat and bart took his place while he was below uf i can haf some of dot coffee id vill done you goot said the dutch lad i dond pelief i vant to ead much mein stomach felt like id dond been aple to held much uf a loadt yaw so hans drank some coffee and ate a little hard bread after which he returned to his duties on deck having donned a suit of oil clothes frank got out his guitar and put it in tune thats right merry grunted browning rolling into his bunk give us a song to cheer us up what shall i sing some of the old college songs theyll make me homesick said diamond its a pleasant thing to feel homesick for old yale murmured frank dear old yale give us stars of the summer night urged hodge so frank sang the song that has sounded beneath the elms at yale so many times it was a beautiful song and it awakened in the memories of the listening lads thoughts of the gay times at college the moonlight nights the roistering lads the lighted windows of the quad and the groups gathered at the fence jack brushed his eyes dont sing anything more like that he urged make it something lively solomon levi or any old thing so solomon levi followed and they all joined in on the chorus other lively songs were sung and by the time frank put aside the guitar all were in fairly good spirits merriwell arranged the program of standing watch hans was relieved before they turned in all through the night they took turns at standing watch and blowing away at intervals on the fog horn and the night passed quickly enough without event when morning came however the fog still hung on the surface of the water they ate a light breakfast and frank fell to walking the deck impatiently if there was a breeze this fog would be liable to lift he said it is disgusting after a little a light breeze rose but it did not clear away the fog entirely however the coming of the sun had some effect on it and it was not long before merry decided to get up anchor and run up the sails the anchor was hoisted and the sails set frank took the wheel during the night the old swell had run out frank had studied his chart till he believed he knew about where they lay and he set his course by the compass not ten minutes after getting under way they found they were headed straight for an island in their vicinity the fog was not heavy but out beyond the island lay a bank of it immediately on sighting the island frank changed the course of the yacht bringing her almost about then he ran out past the island headed for the fog bank all at once there was a strange sound a roaring swish of water not one of them was certain which direction the sound came from vot dot vos exclaimed hans in alarm keep still ordered frank the sounds grew louder then all at once hans flung up his hands and shouted reef your rudder vrankie you vos running a sdeampoat ofer us out of the fog bank just ahead came a large sidewheel steamer headed straight toward them frank sighted the steamer at the same moment hans saw it and he realized their peril it was the boston boat city of bangor on its course up the bay in the twinkling of an eye merriwell threw the wheel over and over the white wings swung to port but headed straight across the course of the great steamer hoooooot hoooooot hoooooot sounded the hoarse warning whistle from the steamer if you had been whistling through that fog bank all would have been right muttered merriwell through his set teeth now if you run me down youll pay for this yacht there was a jangling sound of a bell on board the steamer and the pilot in the pilot house was seen to send his wheel spinning over with frantic haste at the same moment that the headway of the steamer grew less will she clear us cried hodge she is bound to cut us in two shouted diamond there isnt breeze enough for us to get out of her way vere vos der life breserfers squawked hans i vant to got me onto a lifebreserfer a hurry in the dutch lad made a headlong leap for the companion way at the head of the steps he stubbed his toe and down he went head first it happened that bruce browning had heard the commotion on deck and strange to relate it had aroused him so that he was coming up bruce had just started to go above when hans came flying through the air like a huge toad struck him full and fair and both went down in a heap on the cabin floor dot seddles id yelled the frightened dutch lad der yocht vos sunkin und i vos a goner you blundering dutch chump gasped bruce when he could catch his breath what is the matter didnt you toldt me der yocht vos sunkin shrieked hans id haf run ofer a pig sdeampoat uf you kept myseluf drownting from i vill haf to got oudt und valk ashore browning managed to get himself together and rise to his feet then he hurried up the companion way and reached the deck just in time to see the huge white hull of a steamboat looming above the yacht but merriwells prompt action and steady nerve had saved the white wings for the steamer with motionless paddlewheels was slipping past the yacht having cut square across her course it was a close shave and a few white faces looked over the forward starboard rail of the huge steamer if you chaps knew your business you would be at anchor instead of cruising round in this fog called a hoarse voice from the steamer if you knew your business you would blow your fog whistle while running through a fog bank returned frank merriwell promptly thats the stuff merry grated hodge whose face was still pale how do you suppose they happened to do such a thing probably that bank of fog is narrow and they only ran into it a few minutes ago perhaps they did not strike heavy fog till just before they broke through and came into view well it was a piece of reprehensible carelessness and its lucky the white wings was not cut in two as the huge steamer slipped past the boys saw not many persons were astir on her she had made an allnight run from boston and the passengers were still sleeping in their staterooms with a few exceptions near the stern of the steamer were two persons in mackintoshes they seemed to regard the yacht with interest not to say excitement and their movements attracted the attention of the boys one of the passengers clutched the other by the arm and pointed out the white wings then both leaned over the rail jack diamond leaped to merriwells side grasped merry by the shoulder and cried in his ear look merriwell look where on the steamer there the two fellows astern i see them know them by jove i believe i do one of them is wat snell sure and the other is the chap who claimed this yacht parker flynn exactly great scott what are they doing on that boat following us perhaps they are perhaps there is no perhaps about it of course they are but snell and flynn together how does that happen i cant tell that but they are together and they are following us thats sure you are not done with flynn it seems he will get into trouble if he bothers me any more i shall not stand any nonsense from him as for wat snell all i want is a good chance to square up with him i will make him sorry he ever heard of me thats the talk frank exclaimed diamond approvingly snell will be easier to dispose of than the other chap for it is probable that flynn believes he can take this boat away from you because he has a right to it or he would not be following us he has no right to it and he will not be able to take it see frank what is the fellow going to look out on the steamer flynn had been seen to hastily unbutton his mackintosh jerk something bright out of his hip pocket and point it toward the yacht it was a revolver jack diamond realized the desperate fellows purpose and he caught hold of frank merriwell and gave him a push that threw him to the deck beside the wheel there was a flash of fire from the revolver a puff of smoke and then a bullet whistled over the yacht striking the water beyond well of all the foolhardy cowardly tricks i believe that takes the premium said frank as he arose and grasped the wheel again that man is drunk or crazy the moment flynn fired snell took to his heels and scudded out of sight disappearing on the other side of the steamer flynn hastily put up his revolver shook his fist toward the yacht and then followed snell both of them getting out of the way before anyone attracted by the sound of the shot came aft to investigate the big paddlewheels of the steamer were in motion again and she was forging on her course as if nothing had happened frank brought the white wings round and set his course to follow as closely as the wind would allow in a short time the steamer was almost out of sight in the thin mist that hung over the water where there was no fog then at last hans dunnerwust came puffing and stumbling on deck fairly loaded down with lifepreservers he fell at the head of the companion way and the lifepreservers flew all over the deck put me onto them kvick he squealed uf i dond haf a life breserfer on ven der yocht sinks you vos a goner the boys laughed at his ludicrous appearance and he sat up on the deck staring around blankly vere dot sdeampoat vos he asked in astonishment why the steamer is a mile away by this time said hodge if she had run into us wed been at the bottom long before this laughed frank you are too slow hans vale i done your duty anyhow sturdily declared the dutch boy you dond got me to makin no mistake in dot then he was set to gathering up the life preservers and carrying them below again the encounter with the steamer and the desperate action of parker flynn furnished food for conversation on board the yacht the boys talked it over and over and it was the general opinion that the presence of flynn and snell in company on the steamer was not an accident well see more of those fellows before long prophesied diamond and it strikes me that flynn is more dangerous than snell for he is a desperate fellow if he had shot anybody on this boat there was no way of making it seem an accident when snell pushed you in front of the car he could have sworn it was an accident if the car had killed you look out for parker flynn i will said merriwell it was nearly nine oclock before they rounded owls head and pointed into rockland harbor the mist still hung on the water and the outlines of the city were hidden frank however felt confident that he was all right well take dinner ashore if you say so fellows he said oh i dont know said jack i dont believe these natives down in this country know how to cook anything fit to eat frank smiled i fancy you have a few notions that will be knocked out of your head after you have been down this way a short time you still seem to fancy you are going into a howling wilderness where there are only savages and halfcivilized white people perhaps we are said jack by way of being odd you dont know yourself for this is your first visit down here out through the mist came a tiny steam launch all at once it was headed straight toward the white wings she acts as if she is coming for us said hodge scowling as the launch came nearer five persons were seen in her the interest of the boys increased rapidly for everything seemed to indicate that she was making straight for the yacht all at once diamond uttered a cry turned to frank and said i knew it i told you wed see more of him see the fellow in the bow of that launch its parker flynn chapter v a boarding party sure as shooting nodded frank he is in a hurry to see me thats plain yes he couldnt wait till we got into the harbor its probable he thought we might not come into rockland after seeing him on the steamer and so as soon as he could get ashore he hired the launch to run out and head us off snell is with him said hodge oh id like to get a crack at that fellow you may have a chance smiled merriwell coolly how i dont propose to let those chaps come aboard my yacht unless they show that they have a right to do so good for you cried bart his face growing stern i am with you merry and i exclaimed diamond vale i dond knew but i vos redy vor a liddle schraps observed hans then we will stand by to repel boarders if they try the trick said frank call browning on deck so the big yale man was called and he came up in his shirt sleeves he was interested immediately the situation was explained to him and he seemed well pleased when frank expressed his intention of preventing the strangers from boarding without authority this promises to be a real warm morning he said with a lazy smile im rather glad im here by this time the launch was close at hand ahoy the yacht called a voice ay ay called back merriwell in true nautical style on board the launch whats wanted lay to we have business with you keep off we havent time to bother with you dont act foolish was the angry exclamation if you do you will be sorry if you bother us without a legal right you will be sorry flung back frank we are not to be trifled with this morning the launch made a circle and swung round so that she was heading in the same direction as the yacht if you dont lay to said the spokesman on board the launch well run alongside and board you try it you will find the warmest job you ever struck why you will not resist officers of the law not if we know the officers have authority well we have the authority so head up into the wind you say you have authority but i do not even know you are an officer in fact judging by the company you are in i should take you for anything else there were muttered words on the launch savage suppressed oaths and a stir that was significant they do mean to run alongside and board exclaimed diamond are you still in for keeping them off merry you bet nodded frank grimly if i decide otherwise i will give you the word in time bruce browning began to roll up his sleeves baring his brawny arms there was a flush on his face and an eager look in his eyes some of those gentlemen will take a bath this morning he said both diamond and hodge flung aside their coats the men on the launch saw these significant movements and could not misunderstand them they were surprised by the attitude of the crew of the white wings you fools cried the spokesman of the party who had a full black beard you will get yourselves jailed if you make any resistance i am sheriff ulmer of rockland where is your badge demanded frank show that the man who claimed to be the sheriff hesitated he cant do it muttered hodge triumphantly i have papers to serve on you said the blackbearded man you can serve them when i come ashore returned frank i am going into the harbor and i shall be ashore in thirty minutes after dropping anchor but you are on a stolen yacht and i am here to take possession of it i am not on a stolen yacht and i do not mean that you shall take possession of it unless you have the right to do so this yacht belongs to me i bought it and paid for it with good money and i mean to hold it if you really are sheriff ulmer which i am inclined to doubt you have been deceived by that rascal in the bow of the launch he holds a worthless bill of sale of this boat which if it is not a forgery was made out by a crazy man who did not own the boat at the time its a lie snarled flynn the bill of sale is all right and were going to take that yacht you will have to fight for her if you do if you fight you fool you will go to jail there is a firstclass jail in rockland too ill take my chances of going to jail keep off this is a fair warning by this time the launch was close to the yacht and the faces of all the persons in the small boat could be seen and studied wat snell was pale and it was plain he did not relish his position with the fellow who claimed to be sheriff was a hangdog looking chap who looked like a fighter the man who was running the launch acted as if he had no intention of taking any part in the fight if one should occur it was plain he had been hired to set the others on board the white wings and he did not mean to do anything more than that hans called frank take the wheel and hold her steady as she is you will get out of the scrimmage and i want to have a hand in that hans took the wheel and frank prepared to take a hand in the repulse if the enemy tried to board the man in the launch who had claimed to be sheriff stood up and waved his clinched fist above his head in the name of the law i command you to surrender he shouted show your authority calmly returned merriwell here it is the bill of sale of that yacht that is no authority do you think you can bluff us because we are young you will find you have made a big mistake board them cried flynn take the yacht that is the only way to do it you will find that is a mighty hard way to do it grated bart hodge come on snell i want to get at you the launch ran alongside the yacht and the man with the fellow who claimed to be the sheriff caught the rail of the white wings with a boat hook come on roared the blackwhiskered chap stand by to repel boarders rang out franks clear voice chapter vi the struggle for the yacht the big man with the whiskers was the first to make an attempt to reach the deck of the yacht he gave a leap that landed him on the rail then bruce browning picked him up and tossed him back into the launch the man was surprised but he made another rush to get onto the white wings in the meantime parker flynn had tried to get aboard but had been struck on the jaw by merriwells hard fist and knocked back into the launch snell started to climb over the rail of the yacht but tumbled back of his own accord when hodge made a rush for him the hangdogappearing chap was the spryest man on the launch with a catlike leap he cleared the rail of the white wings and reached the deck he found himself face to face with jack diamond and a second later they clinched you are not wanted here exclaimed jack but im going to stay here said the other diamond was strong and smart but he found his hands full had he not taken the chap at a slight disadvantage in getting the first hold the stranger would have been his master as it was they slipped and staggered about the deck the stranger struggling to break jacks hold in his excitement hans failed to hold the yacht steadily on her course as frank had directed and suddenly she swung so the main boom swept across the deck it struck diamonds antagonist on the back of the head and stunned him for a moment that moment was long enough for jack to lift him and drop him over into the launch hans sent over the wheel and brought the yacht back so the boom swung out of the way but his negligence had aided diamond to a large extent on falling back into the boat snell had scrambled up and stood snarling at hodge who was urging him to come within reach oh i do want to get my hands on you said bart ill give you something to remember me by you sneaking cur you are a sneak yourself cried snell or you would not be hanging around with frank merriwell after he licked you and got the best of you in everything you did it is a compliment to be called a sneak by you you coward come up here let me give you a black eye but snell kept just out of reach although he made several bluff attempts to board the white wings probably the most astonished man was the big fellow with the black whiskers he realized that browning had handled him easily and carelessly but still it did not seem possible that the rather fleshy smoothfaced chap could have much strength large as he was better stay down there advised bruce next time i shall throw you farther next time you wont throw me at all came from the professed sheriff as he made another spring for the yacht it seemed that bruce caught him on the fly now the big fellow was fully aroused and he swung the stranger over his head and gave him a terrific heave the man whirled through the air passed clean over the launch struck the water beyond and disappeared from view at that very moment frank merriwell got another crack at parker flynn who had not learned his lesson by his first experience and again tried to board smack the blow sounded and with a groan flynn dropped down into the launch the man who was running the launch seemed satisfied for he suddenly let go with the boat hook and the yacht swung away from her foe the selfstyled sheriff came to the surface and was pulled aboard the launch the ducking seemed to have taken the spirit out of him he glared at the yacht but all his eagerness to board her seemed gone parker flynn sat up and swore holding onto his aching jaw he had not realized that there was a set of fighters on board the white wings although wat snell had warned him to that effect now he realized that the yacht could not easily be captured in the manner in which he had attempted to accomplish the feat the meeting of flynn and snell came about in this way snell on finding frank and his friends were in boston had played the spy on the party he followed them to the pier the morning they went aboard the white wings and he saw the encounter between frank and flynn when flynn left the pier snell followed and spoke to him after that it did not take wat long to work into the good graces of flynn infuriated by his failure to obtain possession of the yacht flynn proceeded to get drunk and stay so on the second day of his spree he determined to pursue merriwell and take the yacht by force if it could not be obtained in any other manner then he hunted up snell and it was not hard to induce wat to accompany him flynn knew the poker gang in rockland and he knew there were a few desperate fellows among those who made up the gang he had dropped his roll in rockland once when he struck the town with an idea in his head that he was getting against a lot of jays and on that occasion he became friendly with peter mcswatt and hunk gardman gardman did not belong in rockland but he came in frequently from an adjoining town to play poker he was a crook and a sneak and he showed it in his face mcswatt was not quite as smooth as gardman he could not handle the cards as well but he could sit in a game with gardman and play what his crooked pal dealt him so that after every game there was usually an illgotten pot to be divided if there was any trouble mcswatt did the fighting flynn telephoned mcswatt and told him when he would be in rockland asking to be met at the boat by mcswatt and a good man who would stand by in a scrap he ended by saying there was good money in it and his offered inducements led mcswatt and gardman to be on hand at the time set flynn was still under the influence of liquor had it been otherwise he would not have fired at the white wings from the deck of the city of bangor on arriving in rockland he found his chosen tools waiting for him and he explained that the yacht white wings had been stolen from him to convince mcswatt and gardman he showed the bill of sale which he held he explained that he could not afford the time to recover the boat by regular process of law and said that it would be an easy thing to take it from the boys who were on board he showed money and paid his tools something in advance a few drinks of liquor put them in the mood for almost anything and then the steam launch was hired to go out in search of the white wings as flynn feared the yacht might not come into rockland at all the owner of the launch was convinced that flynn really owned the yacht and had a right to take her by force if necessary but he did not agree to have anything to do with the seizing of the boat further than putting the party alongside snell had warned flynn that the party on the white wings was made up of fighters but the man sneered at them as a lot of boys it was not believed that there would be any real difficulty in obtaining possession of the yacht but it was thought best that mcswatt should claim to be an officer thus it came about that the white wings was met by the steam launch as she headed into rockland harbor but the crew on board the launch met with the surprise of their lives and they were thoroughly disgusted when they were beaten off without much difficulty the two cracks frank had given flynn knocked some of the conceit and bravado out of him and for some time after the yacht and the launch swung apart he sat still and swore mcswatt was not in a pleasant mood as he wrung the water out of his clothes he glared at flynn and snarled thought you said they were a lot of boys who could be scared out of their skins boys why they are young devils the fellow i went against is a regular samson theyre in a bad scrape now said flynn with an attempt at fierceness they have resisted the rightful owner of that yacht and they shall smart for it thats all right but they might have been fooled in a different way here they are running right into the harbor and they will stop there we might have watched till the most of them went ashore and then we could have taken her easily how did i know they would run in here they might have kept on up the bay and i didnt suppose a lot of beardless chaps could put up such a scrap well we have done all you asked of us and we want our pay done you havent done anything i hired you to help me take the yacht and misrepresented the case to us you will pay me or ill chuck you overboard there was a glare in mcswatts eyes that cowed flynn oh we mustnt quarrel he quickly said of course i will pay you as i agreed i thought so and i will double the sum if you stand by me a while longer i tell you i cant fool with those chaps i cant waste time i must get possession of my boat at once well if you are thinking of attempting to board her again youll have to get somebody in my place i have had enough of that kind of work flynn saw that mcswatt meant it all right he growled well stay out and keep watch of her till she drops anchor i want to be sure they mean to stop here so the launch cruised about keeping in sight of the white wings till the yacht ran slowly into the harbor and let fall her anchor in the vicinity of half a dozen other pleasure yachts laying near together chapter vii arrested in rockland there were some indignant lads on board the white wings a regular case of piracy declared diamond if we had not been too much for that gang they would have seized the boat sure nodded hodge whose eyes were gleaming while his breast across which his arms were folded rose and fell with excitement we handled them too easy grunted browning it would have served them right if we had split the skull of every man who tried to come over our rail der pig poom come britty near sblitting der skull uf one grinned hans you pet dot chap half a swelt head on me frank had returned to the wheel he did not say much but his cheeks were flushed with excitement and his lips were pressed together remember what the truckman told you merry questioned diamond what was that why about this boat being hoodooed yes it begins to look as if he was right oh i dont know well if this hasnt been a hoodoo cruise from boston i dont know a thing it has been rather eventful admitted frank his face relaxing somewhat uf you vos lookin oxcitement for we haf found him put in hans those chaps are keeping watch of us now said frank i suppose they think of trying the trick again dont believe they will said hodge well be in the harbor pretty soon and they wont dare make another attempt like that as they ran in the mist lifted and vanished and they saw the city stretched before them to the north was the breakwater that protects the harbor and away in the distance loomed some mountains what are those hills there asked diamond those are the famous camden mountains answered frank the town lies at the foot of those mountains and thomas wentworth higginson says the scenery in the vicinity of camden is the most varied and beautiful to be found anywhere in the world are we going to stop at camden well that is on the program well run up there tomorrow they anchored near the other yachts and vessels purposely running into the very midst of them as long as one of us stays on board those chaps will not attempt to seize the yacht by force while we remain here said merriwell dont be too sure of that warned hodge they are desperate characters and there is no telling what they will try they watched the launch run into a wharf and saw the party leave her not one of the baffled boarders remained in the vicinity but all quickly disappeared i believe they are afraid of the consequences now said merry they are getting out of the way in a hurry it was not long before the others were of the same opinion however frank was not certain but this movement on the part of the enemy was a ruse to lull their suspicions three of us will remain on the yacht he said jack and i are going ashore how asked diamond we have no boat and we are anchored off here in the bay i am going to buy a boat here i think we can get one of the boats from some of these vessels to set us ashore the nearest vessel was hailed and it did not take long to get a sailor with a boat to come over to the yacht and take frank and jack off he rowed them to the steamboat wharf and would not take a cent for doing so all right mates he said in a hearty way ill want a turn sometime perhaps then after telling them that if they did not get a boat they could whistle him up and he would bring them off to their yacht he rowed away there were a number of truck teams about the wharf loading with the freight left there that morning by the steamer frank inquired of one of the truckmen where to find a man who would sell them a firstclass rowboat and the truckman directed him to a man who had boats to let and to sell this man the boys sought without delay but he was not at his shop they were told that he had gone uptown and so they walked up sea street into the heart of the city as they came out on main street diamond halted with an exclamation of astonishment great scott burst from his lips is this real is what real asked frank do i really see a trolley car running along the street here or am i dreaming oh come along laughed frank they have trolley cars down in this country and i dont think it looks quite as wild and uncivilized as you expected they entered the thorndike hotel together and just as they passed through the door frank suddenly clutched his friends arm giving a gasp of astonishment himself jack saw merry was staring toward the flight of stairs he looked up and there on the stairs descending toward them were two girls inza burrage and paula benjamin merriwell recovered his composure immediately and stepped forward to meet the girls at the foot of the stairs accompanied by diamond the boys lifted their hats and frank said another unexpected pleasure we didnt dream of this supposed you were in bar harbor the girls shook hands with them and both seemed to show confusion it is a pleasure declared inza we are stopping here in rockland a few days frank longed to ask questions but he knew it would be an act of rudeness and he refrained however paula seemed to think that inzas explanation was not sufficient and she added yes we decided to stop off here a day and we are so interested with the city and the surrounding country that we will remain a little longer that will be pleasant said frank weve just got in and are rather salty now but we mean to brace up and get some of the brine out of us perhaps we may have the pleasure of seeing you often while we remain here i hope we may put in jack quickly looking earnestly at paula who let her eyes droop before his gaze i am sure it will be agreeable to us smiled inza tell us something about your voyage did you have a nice time nice isnt any name for it laughed frank thats right nodded jack it isnt we have encountered excitements galore such as fogs and storms and steamboats and pirates mercy pirates well they attempted to board us and seize the yacht what did you do we gave them a jolly good welcome a uniformed policeman entered the hotel and stepped up to the boys which one of you is frank merriwell he asked i am sir said frank then said the officer i shall have to take you take me cried frank what do you mean i mean that you are under arrest chapter viii a stir in limerock city both girls uttered a little cry of amazement and alarm and paula shrank close to inza clasping her about the waist under arrest repeated frank slowly for what stealing a yacht and resisting the real owner when he attempted to regain possession of it merry laughed heartily this is a joke he exclaimed the officer seemed puzzled but he frowned at frank saying you are not likely to find it a joke young man it is a serious offense and if you have not some rich folks who will settle handsomely for your little lark you will go to jail my dear sir said merriwell with perfect coolness you are taking too much for granted you are standing on the ground that the charge against me is true it will be the easiest thing in the world to prove that it is not you will have to prove that to the judge said the officer with his hand on franks shoulder just now youll have to accompany me if you resist or make any trouble it will be worse for you he produced handcuffs what do you mean to do hoarsely demanded diamond his eyes bulging youre not going to handcuff him it is necessary i am not taking any chances a chap who will steal a yacht is liable to be pretty desperate i will go along with you quietly said frank paling a bit at the thought of being led shackled through the streets i give you my word on that its an outrage cried diamond i advise you to keep still said the officer sternly you may be arrested as an accomplice i dont care if i am came fiercely from jacks lips i say it is an outrage and i will stand by it mr merriwell purchased the yacht and paid his money for it as he can prove he is the rightful owner of the boat i am not going to discuss that the officer was about to put the irons on frank when jack cut in with have a little decency about this mr officer if you believe this young man such a desperate fellow call an assistant surely two of you ought to be able to take him to the lockup without handcuffing him the policeman was angry and frank saw that what jack was saying was not making things any better so he asked his friend to be quiet then he said something in a low tone to the officer the latter hesitated put yourself in my place said frank you are not sure this charge is true think how you would feel to be dragged along the street with irons on your wrists when you had not been guilty of committing a crime and he tells you the truth sir when he says he bought the yacht broke in inza fearlessly i know it he purchased it of my friends brother that is true spoke up paula with sudden braveness my brother sold him the yacht he never stole it why he is frank merriwell of yale and everybody knows frank merriwell would not steal anything she was startled by her own boldness but her words brought about a good result of course the arrest of frank had attracted the attention of all who were in the office of the hotel among whom were several commercial men one of the latter stepped forward quickly frank merriwell of yale he exclaimed is this the famous yale pitcher by jove it is i have seen him pitch several games but i didnt know him in this yachting suit mr merriwell i am glad to see you but sorry you are in trouble however if i can aid you in any way you may count on me thank you said frank its pleasant to know i am not quite unknown and friendless down here unknown exclaimed another man if you are frank merriwell we all know about you we have read about you in the papers you are the best known college man in this country officer i dont believe this young gentleman is either a thief or a desperado if he says he will go along with you ill vouch for him if you say so mr franch i do i will be responsible for him the officer put his handcuffs out of sight all right he said come along young man by this time the report had gone abroad that there had been an arrest in the thorndike and a crowd was gathering outside the door in the crowd were a number of excited small boys for they had heard that the person arrested was the famous yale football and baseball player frank merriwell one of the boys in the crowd saw a friend on the opposite side of the street and yelled hey charley get a wiggle on an come over here wat yer tink ther cop has nabbed that feller weve been readin about frank merriwell aw wat yer givin us flung back the other this aint no fust of april its dead straight charley frank merriwell is right here in ther thorndike an old briggs has pinched him dont yer want ter see him dont i gasped the one across the street as he bolted from the sidewalk id rudder see frank merriwell than have a season ticket to der ball games and he could not get over quick enough by the time the officer was ready to bring frank out of the hotel all the men and boys outside knew who had been arrested and the excitement was great the crowd grew swiftly and everybody was eager to get a look at the yale athlete of whom they had heard such wonderful stories the young men of the town were no less excited than the boys there was scarcely one of them who did not know something about frank merriwell and his record and even before they could find out why he had been arrested they denounced the arrest as an outrage another policeman came along and attempted to clear the sidewalk in front of the hotel but the crowd did not want to disperse the officer who had arrested frank came out with merriwell at his side a hand on his arm there he is was the cry that went up that is frank merriwell jack diamond who walked beside frank was amazed at the crowd and to hear them call franks name they know you merriwell he said it seems so said frank with a faint smile its a shame cried one of the young men whats he arrested for dont know admitted another but ill bet my clothes he is all right frank merriwell is on the level thats so shouted twenty voices the crowd followed the officer and his prisoner somebody proposed a cheer for frank merriwell and it seemed that every human being in that following crowd cheered as loudly as he could then somebody proposed three groans for old briggs the officer and the crowd groaned in a most dismal manner some of the small boys grew so excited that they kept yelling at briggs to let frank go but they were scarcely less excited than the lads of eighteen or twenty a dozen of them got together and actually talked of taking briggs prisoner from him in their enthusiasm they might have tried it but for the coolness of one or two among them its a blamed shame to have this thing happen in rockland declared one fellow what will merriwell think of us he will be dead sore on this town he isnt a fool said a cooler head if he is all right it isnt likely that any harm will come to him he cant blame briggs for doing his duty if there is a warrant for his arrest so frank was marched away to the lockup but his arrest had created more excitement in the city than any other event since the opening game of baseball in the knox county league july fourth frank was locked in a cell jack did not leave him till the door had closed on his friend the boys had found out that the warrant for franks arrest was sworn out by parker flynn he shall pay dearly for this piece of business muttered the young virginian as he left the lockup the crowd that still lingered in front of the building stared at jack they had seen him with merriwell and they knew he must be one of franks particular friends the small boys envied him for that very reason diamond had learned that merriwell would have a hearing before a local judge at two oclock that afternoon and he resolved to do whatever he could for his friend before that time but diamond had not left frank thirty minutes before there were two visitors to see the prisoner they were admitted by the guard and merriwell was staggered when he saw the face of one of them jack benjamin he cried it cant be but it is declared the little fellow as he grasped merrys hand and shook it warmly but but youre astonished exactly i dont wonder folks at home think me on the way to alaska the governor thinks so as long as he thinks that he wont interfere with my little outing down this way but the deception i dont understand it expect id better make a clean breast to you said benjamin blushing in a remarkable manner you see its this way last year at newport i met a young lady on whom i got badly smashed shes a star merriwell shes the only one for me but the old man excuse me the governor objected said i was too young to know my mind and all that rot he found out the girls folks were not very rich and then he set about raising the high dinkeydink with everything well the result was that he did smash things for a time this summer when i wanted to spend my vacation down in maine he sat down on it hard you see he did so because the young lady lives here in rockland i was forced to give up the idea apparently but i began to talk about alaska then i sold you the white wings to get enough money for my summer outing left word that i was off for alaska and came down here thats the whole of it here i am then i understand how it happens your sister and inza are stopping in rockland she knows you are here sure sis is all right she sticks by me thus far frank had paid no attention to his second visitor but now the fellow stepped forward saying howdydo merriwell i suppose you know me what cried frank grasping the extended hand is it fred moslof of dartmouth what are you doing down here i havent seen you since our opening game last spring when you spoiled two daisy hits for me by digging them out of the dirt down around third bag moslof laughed i am playing ball down here this summer he said well that is a surprise are you playing on the rockland team no i am manager of the camdens as soon as benjamin told me you were here we came right up i played with rockland last summer and i know stacks of influential men in both rockland and camden ill fix this matter of bail for you and get you out of here in a hurry if you like well that is kind of you smiled frank and i appreciate it i shall be glad to accept your offer old man then it is settled said benjamin moslof can do the trick it may take an hour or two to fix it but well see that its done just make yourself easy when they departed they left frank in good spirits for he knew he could easily refute the charge of stealing the yacht for benjamin was there in rockland to substantiate his statements merriwell was resolved to settle that matter and then make it very warm for mr parker flynn it took something more than an hour for moslof and benjamin to fix things but they finally returned to the lockup accompanied by an officer with an order for franks release merriwell told them all about flynns attempt to obtain possession of the yacht by force and then he accompanied them to the office of a justice of the peace where he swore out a warrant against flynn and saw it placed in the hands of an officer to be served well give that gentleman the surprise of his life smiled benjamin he wont expect to see me down here if he had not thought me on my way to alaska he would not have dared attempt such a highhanded proceeding moslof said that he must return to camden he had come down to confer with the rockland and thomaston managers about the schedule and he had finished his business at parting he said look here merriwell cant you pitch one or two games for us if no more camden has a better team than rockland but rockland is stronger in the box we started out with a lead the first of the season but weve been dropping games to rockland right along lately and we wont be in it if the thing keeps on i have telegraphed and telephoned all over the country for a strong pitcher but i havent got hold of the right man youd be just the man for us why you would paralyze rockland with that doubleshoot of yours well old man said frank i hate to refuse you anything after what you have done but you know i want no part in professional baseball this is only semiprofessional part of our team are not under salary and nearly all are college players i might get myself into trouble if i pitched moslof i cant promise well promise me that you will pitch for camden if you pitch at all in the knox county league ill do that smiled merry but you must not expect me to pitch at all moslof was forced to be satisfied with that at least he knew rockland would not secure merriwell and that was some satisfaction as he had heard rumors that the rockland management meant to have the famous yale twirler if he was to be procured for love or money frank accompanied benjamin back to the thorndike where he was received with great delight by inza paula and inzas aunt miss abigail gale i didnt dare tell you jack was here when we first met said paula but when that horrid policeman took you away i just hurried to let him know what had happened he said he would have you out all right in a short time well he kept his word and now i am after the fellow who put this job up on me i have sworn out a warrant for his arrest and he will find himself in my place before night frank remained at the hotel thirty minutes chatting with the girls and miss gale and then he said that he must return to the yacht and let his friends know he was all right on his way to the wharf frank called at the shop of the boat builder again and found the man in he was pleased to learn that the man had two boats for sale both of which were in the water after looking the boats over merry made a bargain for one of them and paid for it then he got into the boat rowed out round the wharf and pulled away for the yacht as he approached the yacht hans came on deck saw him and raised a shout that brought the others up in a hurry all were astonished and delighted to see frank jack had been there and told them what had happened then he had hurried away to see if he could do anything for merriwell frank told them the story of his release and as it was midday he stayed on board to eat a hearty meal while they were eating jack returned having been taken to the yacht by a boatman he had hired knew you must be here cried the virginian i was making a hustle to get you out when i heard you were out already why i never saw a place like this frank everybody in town has heard of you and everybody was furious over your arrest why this is a great country boys im stuck on it already the people down here are all right not quite such jays and hayseeds as you thought eh smiled frank i tell you they are all right they are not jays at all after dinner the boys left browning and dunnerwust on the yacht to guard it and then went ashore barely had frank appeared in the city before the manager of the rockland baseball team fell on him and offered him all sorts of inducements to pitch for his nine but it was no use for merry had given moslof his promise frank expected to hear that flynn had been arrested instead he learned that neither flynn nor snell could be found so the warrant had not been served it was supposed that flynn would be on hand when court was called to order that afternoon but he did not appear and so the charge against frank was dismissed as there was no one to push it later it was learned that in some way flynn had learned that jack benjamin was in rockland as soon as he heard this he made all haste to get out of the place taking an electric car to camden where he had disappeared as completely as if wiped off the face of the earth but i do not believe you have heard or seen the last of the fellow merriwell said hodge he will bother you again barts words were destined to come true chapter ix along the coast to camden nellie was a sailors lass a sailors lass was she heave ho my lads then heave away waiting for her sailor lad who sailed the deep blue sea heave ho my lads then heave away three lads were getting up the anchor on board the white wings which lay in rockland harbor on the coast of maine and they sang a nautical song as they pulled at the cable they were bart hodge jack diamond and hans dunnerwust frank merriwell was busy making other preparations for the run up to camden that glorious summer morning while bruce browning was doing something below no one knew what holdt on a vile till you spit on my handts exclaimed the dutch lad breathing heavily i vant to got a petter holdt mit my feet to kept from slipping der rail ofer und der varter indo i vas glad you dond af to bull ub anchors to make me a lifings keep at it hans ordered hodge you remind me of the irishman who caught his friend by the heels just as the friend was falling headlong into a well said diamond as he continued to pull away how vas dot asked hans he held on as long as he could said jack and then he called down to his friend jist wait a minute where yez are mike till oi let go an get a betther hold then he let go yaw said hans soberly but i dond seen der boint der story of his friend couldnt wait explained jack frank merriwell laughed never before had he heard the virginian tell a humorous anecdote and he was not a little surprised as well as pleased for it showed that jack who had grumbled a great deal during the unlucky and unpleasant cruise down the coast was in better spirits now they were at last in the waters of penobscot bay the anchor broke water and was soon secured in place already the jib had been raised and frank was at the wheel to bring the yacht round as soon as she felt the breeze after the anchor was atrip every indication was that there was just breeze enough outside the harbor to give them a pleasant sail to their destination under franks orders the boys set sail hoisting both the jib topsails and club topsails in fact cracking on every stitch hans grew weary again before the mainsail was up get hold of the halyards and get into gear dunnerwust ordered bart sharply you are getting to be as bad as browning and he is no earthly use on the water hey grunted the big fellow his head appearing as he came up from below well whats the use of being any earthly use on the water whats the matter with you hodge the matter with you is that you need something for that tired feeling returned bart like a flash if you would get out and make a bluff at pulling on a line now and then it would seem rather more decent i never make any bluffs everything is on the level with me im not much of a sailor but im pretty good at repelling boarders ducking bogus sheriffs and such things dont worry about me just go ahead getting under way ill be with you then he calmly watched them get all the sails set as if he did not consider it necessary for him to lend a hand and as if he had no idea of doing so on any condition if he could avoid it browning was lazy and he knew it he made no attempt to conceal the fact really he almost seemed to glory in it at college he was familiarly called the laziest man on earth and it pleased rather than disturbed him ordinarily a lazy man is despised by his companions but such was not the case with browning genial bighearted strong as a giant yet gentle as a baby he made hosts of friends and very few enemies at one time he had been really ambitious but that was before the coming of frank merriwell to yale browning had been dropped to merriwells class and as there could be but one real leader in the class he lost his ambition when merriwell showed his superiority but no man had proved a truer friend to merriwell than the once famous king of the sophomores browning was not particularly demonstrative in his affection but he could be depended on in any case of emergency as frank had learned and the big fellow was a good man to have for a backer browning could not be driven to do anything nor could he be jollied into it a fact that irritated hodge more or less there is one thing we do not possess that we should have said merry as jack came aft and stood near the wheel whats that a gun why you have four or five below i dont mean that kind we need a small cannon to fire when we anchor and when we get under way we are not doing the thing properly unless we have one i never thought of that i did not think of it till it was too late to get one in boston well have to get along for the present without it they ran past the end of the breakwater and were opposite the bay point hotel a handsome summer hotel near the city of rockland outside the harbor they found a breeze that made the white wings heel over and take a bone in her teeth although the sloop was not in the racing class frank was well satisfied with her for he had discovered that she possessed many good qualities she could be held pretty near to the wind without yawing and she was not at all cranky nor did she require much weather helm of course she could not run as near to the wind as a cutterrigged yacht of the racing class but she could do better than the ordinary cutter the wind was off shore and favorable so the white wings seemed to fly that morning the boys found comfortable positions and enjoyed the sail and the scenery soon rockland was left behind disappearing from view behind the point on which the hotel sat and then the camden mountains began to loom higher and higher to the northwest we met a warm reception in rockland said frank i wonder how it will be in camden the sunshine was bright on the blue bay the distant islands looked inviting and there was something about the cool greenness of the woods along the shore that was soothing to the eye it was not long before rockport lighthouse came into view beyond the lighthouse they saw the narrow harbor and the village with the houses seeming to cling to the heights that surrounded the harbor from the limekilns rose black smoke that added to the picturesque charm of the scene but rockport was quickly passed and negro island at the mouth of camden harbor was before them there was a lighthouse on the island standing there like an old woman in a white dress and black cap now the mountains seeming to rise from the very sea were near at hand and strikingly beautiful clothed in their summer garments of green on the top of the nearest mountain stood a hotel with a high observation tower boys cried diamond i am going up there and stop a week i wonder how anybody ever gets up there grunted browning i shall not go if i have to climb no need to tell us that said hodge we knew it as they came abreast negro island two girls came down on the rocks and waved handkerchiefs to them the boys returned the salute and hans dunnerwust cried vale uf i aind got a mash you vos a liar uf id vasnt for gettin my feets vet i vould valk ashore righd avay kveek alretty yaw then he waved his cap to the girls kissed his hands bowed low with his hand on his heart and nearly fell overboard as merry suddenly brought the yacht up closer into the wind oxcuse me uf i stayed righd in camden der rest uf your life said hans as he gathered himself up dalk apout peaches vale vot peen der madder mit dose the others smiled at his enthusiasm passing the island they came in full view of the harbor and town several vessels and yachts lay in the harbor amid the trees the tastily painted redroofed cottages were to be seen far up at the head of the harbor rose handsome brick buildings church spires could be seen here and there from the flagstaff of a hotel on the heights floated the american flag on the black rocks under the shadow of the trees that stood far above the shore was a picnic party the blue smoke of their fire rising from their midst to the south of the town lay a beautiful cove with a sandy beach summer cottages could be seen on the point beyond the cove to the north of the town was another cove and a heavily wooded point in an opening of the trees on this point stood white tents and over all hung the mountains the village seeming to have clambered up the side of the nearest one as far as it could go it was a most beautiful and captivating scene that glorious summer morning and it is not strange that stoical bart hodge uttered an exclamation of admiration while frank merriwell cried hurrah fellows here we are and from the looks of things well stay a while there looms old mount megunticook and here in the harbor under its shadow we will anchor boys arent you glad you came you bet cried every one of them chapter x too well known taking care not to strike one of the line of ledges that almost closes the mouth of camden harbor they ran in and dropped anchor from the rocks the picnickers waved white handkerchiefs and called to them they responded in a similar manner with a strange lightness and exultant feeling in their hearts even bruce browning showed enthusiasm for he could not help imbibing some of the spirit of the occasion the sails came down with a rattle and were properly and carefully taken care of a task that consumed time then every line was coiled and put in its proper place and nothing was neglected so that when franks orders had been obeyed everything about the yacht was shipshape and in order not till he had seen things in order did frank think of leaving the sloop then he asked who would stay on board and who wished to go ashore diamond and hodge were eager to go ashore browning and dunnerwust expressed a willingness to go later so three of the crew entered the small boat and pulled away up toward the distant wharves at the head of the harbor they rowed up to a float beside a wharf twenty other boats floated about the platform and a boy was watching them may we land here asked frank well i dunno said the boy doubtfully ye see these bots are to let might let yourn if some folks come along an wanted it the boy grinned as he finished speaking we might come back and want our boat only to find it gone said hodge lets not leave it here merriwell the boy gave a jump whats your name he almost shouted looking straight at frank its frank merriwell was the reply frank merriwell yelled the boy dancing up and down whoop i heard you was in rockland my goodness wont the fellers be tickled to see you in this town there aint a chap here that dont know all about ye jest you let me have yer painter ill take care of that bot an there dont nobody touch it you bet thank you laughed frank i will pay you for your trouble not by a jugful think id take any pay of you no siree id set right here on this float an watch your bot for a week thout eatin or sleepin an never charge you a cent i never spected to live to see frank merriwell oh jingoes wont the fellers be glad to see ye the boy took charge of the boat just then another boy came onto the wharf and the boat boy saw him hey there bennie he yelled what dyer know you cant guess it in a year hes come whos come frank merriwell here he is the jaw of the boy on the wharf dropped and he stood staring openmouthed at frank for some moments he seemed awe stricken and then of a sudden he turned and ran as if for his life quickly scudding out of sight he acted as if he were scared of you merry said diamond hes gone to tell tother fellers in town explained the boat boy say laughed frank this is getting altogether too interesting id rather not be so well known well you cant help it said hodge theyve all heard of you down this way and i had an idea they never heard of anything away down here exclaimed jack my ideas of this part of the country are completely upset lets hurry into town urged frank if we wait its ten to one well be escorted by a gang of my admirers i havent forgotten rockland so they left the wharf and hastily walked up bay view street just as they reached the bank building at the public square they saw a dozen small boys coming down elm street on the run headed by the one who had disappeared so suddenly from the wharf the moment the running boys saw merriwell and his companions they halted and huddled around the leader who pointed at the three strangers in the place yelling there he is fellers frank laughed outright and hodge and diamond smiled the excitement of the boys had attracted more or less notice and the people on the streets looked at the three young yachtsmen with interest it was the height of the season at camden and the town was literally gorged with summer visitors from every part of the country so the streets presented a lively appearance the handsome turnouts of philadelphia and new york millionaires could be seen street cars were running bicycles darting hither and thither and the pedestrians on the streets nearly all wore clothes suitable for summer outing after coming up bay view street which in the neighborhood of the wharves did not present a very attractive appearance the young yachtsmen were surprised and pleased to come out to the square where they could look around and see handsome brick blocks and buildings of which a city might be proud but the crowd of excited small boys attracted attention for the time they came a little nearer and the leader cried lets give three cheers for frank merriwell ready now yell fellers yell they did they threw up their hands tossed their caps into the air and yelled as loudly as they could great scott gasped frank see what they have done why everybody on the street is staring at us it was true the spectators had been attracted by the shrill cheers of the small boys and they were looking toward the three embarrassed lads on the corner by the bank a man who was passing stopped and asked one of the boys why they were cheering so loudly see that handsome feller there with the lace on his suit asked the boy pointing frank out yes i see him thats frank merriwell declared the boy excitedly and proudly frank merriwell repeated the man doubtfully who is he wat yelled the boy voice and face expressing the greatest amazement and scorn didnt ye never hear of frank merriwell wats ther matter with yer why dont you go die his contempt was crushing and humiliating and the man passed on wondering who in the world frank merriwell could be that he was so well known and famous but there were plenty of men and youths who had heard of merriwell and the report that the great yale pitcher was in town flew like wildfire only the small boys stared at frank with absolute rudeness however those older looked at him with interest but were careful not to make their attentions embarrassing merry and his friends walked up into the village going toward the post office there were pretty girls on the street and some of them flashed a brief admiring glance at the trio of handsome lads in yachting suits the small boys trooped along behind talking excitedly among themselves their chatter was amusing to hear look here jimmy cried one in fierce contradiction of a statement made by another that aint so an you oughter know it harvard never got fourteen hits offen frank merriwell in one game fourteen hits yelled another in derision wat yer givin us jimmy they never got ten hits offen him in one game you better go read up about him youre woozy thats wats ther matter with you that doubleshoot of his is wat paralyzes em put in another he can make ther ball cut all kinds of riggers in the air thats all right said jimmy sullenly slatridge sez ther aint no such thing as a doubleshoot he says that riginated in ther mind of some of them newspaper fellers wats writin up stories bout frank merriwell then there was a howl of scorn from all the others and one shook a finger under jimmys nose shouting slatridge knows it all in his mind that fellers too tired to play baseball he can pitch sometimes but he dont git woke up only when he thinks hes likely to lose his job dont you take stock in evrything he says fellers said a tall solemnlooking boy out at knees and elbows id give a hundred thousan dollars to see frank merriwell pitch against rockland an use his doubleshoot on em id give moren that to see it if i jest had the price of admission ter git inter ther game declared a barefooted boy why dont moslof nail him fiercely demanded a frecklefaced youngster if i was manager of the camdens i wouldnt let frank merriwell go away alive if he wouldnt play ball for me i bet rockland will have him if moslof dont git him if rockland gits him camden might jest as well crawl right into the smallest hole she can find and pull the hole in after her she wont never win another game the most of this talk could be distinctly heard by frank and his friends and it proved very amusing in the window of the drug store near the post office hung a printed poster announcing a game of ball in camden that afternoon between rockland and camden the bill also stated that rockland and camden were tied for first place in the knox county league so that the result of one game would put one or the other team at the head well have to see that game fellows said frank it is evident that there is plenty of baseball excitement down in this part of the country at this moment two young men came down from the rooms of the business mens association in the opera house building and frank uttered an exclamation of satisfaction there are two dartmouth men boys he said moslof and mcdornick moslof is managing the camdens and playing third lets go over and see them they walked over to meet the dartmouth men chapter xi false reports moslof seized franks hand and shook it heartily that rockland affair didnt amount to anything after all did it he asked no said merry the chap who caused my arrest skipped out when he learned that jack benjamin the man i bought the yacht of was in rockland he didnt stay to press the complaint of theft he thought benjamin had gone to alaska it must have been a frightful shock to him youve met diamond yes let me introduce bart hodge hodge cried moslof you caught for merriwell this season jove but you made a record for a freshman i am glad to know you hodge they shook hands and moslof said here is mcdornick our left fielder the biggest little crank on earth and the best base runner in the knox county league if i do say so we need more of them too mcdornick shook hands all round spluttered a little about the beastly luck the camdens had been having and ended by swearing that camden would wipe up the earth with rockland before the season was over he was very vehement in his expressions weve been awfully weak in the box said moslof bascomb of the university of maine is a good little man but he has had poor luck against the rocklands thats the trouble with our pitchers they are all right against thomaston but they do not work to advantage against rockland and ill swear that thomaston has the heaviest batting team if often works that way said frank but the worst of it is moslof went on rockland has a pitcher who is a hoodoo for camden he is pie for thomaston but he makes monkeys of our men who is he dayguild late of the new england league rockland has found out that he can play thunder with camden and they hold him back for us all the time they dont care about thomaston its camden they want to beat how is it with camden well laughed moslof to tell the truth the feeling is just as strong up there wed give our boots to down rockland and we dont care so much about thomaston i played with rockland last year they used me well down there but said i couldnt bat any that made me mad this year for the first two weeks of our season i led the league in batting i am falling off a little but still i am ahead of the average they are beginning to change their mind down there about my batting well said merry we are going to see your game this afternoon i suppose it will be pretty hot hot you bet i expect woods and makune of the disbanded portlands here by noon we have williamson of the lewistons but he has been ill and is not in the best form were going to do our best to take the lead again today woods is a dandy little pitcher and a fine fellow but if we had you merriwell wed be all right said mcdornick say old man wont you pitch for us this afternoon makune will cover second and we can put woods anywhere with you in the box we can paralyze rockland frank shook his head its no use he said i cant play with you i hope the stories that fellow has been telling about you are not true said moslof slowly what stories why hes been saying that rockland had secured you sure that you came down into maine on purpose to pitch for rockland when i told him you had given me your word to pitch for camden if you pitched at all he laughed in my face and said i was easily fooled he swore that he knew for an absolute fact that you had signed with rockland as frank listened to this he flushed and then turned pale there came a dangerous fire into his eyes and he laughed in a manner that was a danger signal for those who knew him best moslof he said you must know these reports are lies you must know i cant sign a contract as that would bar me from college baseball i didnt believe it said the manager of the camdens but there are plenty who did and the men who are backing the club here are sore on me for letting you get away after helping you out of that scrape in rockland if rockland got you now id jump this town in a hurry dont let that worry you a bit old man i said i would pitch for camden if i pitched at all and i rather think i am known as a man of my word moslof seemed relieved oh say exclaimed mcdormick impulsively just pitch this game for us this afternoon well sink the knife deep into rockland i hate to refuse said frank but i must what i want to know is who this fellow is who has been telling that rockland had me oh he is a fly chap who is stopping at the bay view a summer boarder what does he look like hes a loud dresser wears plaids pink shirts lots of rings loud neckties and so forth whats he look like in the face how old is he he may be nineteen his eyes are set near together and he is freckled and foxy looking hes a sneak broke out mcdornick in his impulsive way i knew it the first time i saw him where is the bay view asked merriwell right there answered moslof motioning toward a large building sitting back on the opposite side of the street this fellow is stopping there yes what is his name dont know lets go over i want to see that gentleman i hope we may find him around the hotel if youll punch him ill pay your fine said the hotheaded mcdornick as they crossed the street while they had been talking in front of the opera house a small boy was standing near them his hands clasped and an ecstatic look of happiness on his face while his eyes were not taken off frank merriwell for a moment when frank had started to cross the street with the others the boy heaved a sigh a gentleman who was passing stopped and looked at the boy in surprise well my little man said the gentleman what is the trouble you look as if you had seen a vision ive jest seen somebody i never thought id see said the boy oh id like to grow up and be famous like him it must be fine to be famous my boy said the gentleman encouragingly if you live you may be a great man some day i cant never be like the feller ive just seen why who could this wonderful person have been i didnt know there was such a famous man stopping in camden at present was it the governor of the state naw somebody biggern him a united states senator perhaps senators aint in it with this feller really you surprise and interest me it could not have been the president of the united states bigger feller than the prince of wales oh if i could grow up to be like him now i am astounded exclaimed the gentleman who can this wonderful person be wont you tell me his name his name is frank merriwell and he is a lollypolooser hes the most wonderful feller living in the whole world frank merriwell repeated the gentleman in perplexity its strange i never heard of him what has he ever done done cried the boy excitedly and enthusiastically what aint he done hes traveled round the world shot panthers and greasers in south america gorillas in africa tigers in india elephants in ceylon and bears and other critters out west in this country done why he made a bicycle trip across the country from new york to san francisco and he licked everybody that tried to bother him on the way done mister he goes to yale college and he is the greatest football player in the world he pitches on the yale nine and he wiped up the earth with harvard and princeton this spring done if theres a thing that feller aint done an cant do i want ter know it the gentleman was gasping for breath really he said a most remarkable person and you want to grow up and be like him if i thought i could if i ever did id die happy strange i never heard of this person before i dont believe he is very well known now dont fool yourself mister hes known by every boy in the united states weve all heard of him and all the boys down in this town would give anything to be like him i tell you he is a bird where is he now hes just gone over to the bay view with moslof and some other fellers really i believe ill have to go over and see what this wonderful person looks like and the gentleman crossed the street toward the hotel in the meantime frank and his companions entered the hotel in search of the person who had been circulating the false reports about merriwell the report that merriwell was in town had reached the hotel and no sooner had the boys entered the office than the landlord came forward and greeted them heartily moslof introduced merry and his two friends the landlord proved to be a cordial pleasant gentleman mr merriwell he said you have caused me no end of trouble i have exclaimed frank astonished yes how is that well there isnt a table girl a kitchen girl or any other girl in this house who does not know all about you they read those yarns about you so much that they neglect their business and mr merriwell with sudden sternness i think you will have to settle with me for it all right smiled frank what is the bill there is no bill i mean you have to settle at this hotel and stay here while you are in town there will be no bill you shall have the best the house affords and it shall not cost you a red cent frank was surprised but he thanked the genial landlord saying really sir you are too kind but we have everything comfortable on my yacht and the fellows would not like it if i deserted them then bring them all here im crowded but ill find room for you if i have to give up a room myself he was in earnest too frank thanked him warmly once more but exclaimed that such a thing would not do as the white wings might be stolen by the party who had attempted to seize her in the very mouth of rockland harbor while they were talking a very pretty roguisheyed girl came into the office making an excuse that she was there on some sort of an errand she cast sly glances at frank for really she was there to see him of a sudden the landlord laughing caught her by the arm and drew her round saying here mr merriwell is your greatest admirer in the house miss phebe macey i heard her say once that she thought frank merriwell the finest fellow in the world and she wondered why some of the camden boys were not like him frank was a little confused but he lifted his cap and bowed saying miss macey i am glad to know i have such an ardent admirer here phebe was blushing crimson but the roguish look was still in her eyes never in all her life had she looked prettier than in that moment of excitement and confusion she lifted her hand and felt it grasped by frank and then in dismay she turned and fled laughing to cover her agitation she quickly disappeared but her laugh rang in merriwells ears for it was quite as bewitching as her roguish eyes the landlord seemed to enjoy the agitation he had caused the girl and he laughed again in fact he was quite a man to laugh he urged frank to remain to dinner and merry finally consented although jack and bart who were likewise invited decided to return to the yacht while they were talking moslof suddenly grasped merriwells arm saying in his ear heres the fellow you want to see he turned frank toward a person who had just entered the office in a moment merry advanced toward that person confronted him and sternly said so sir having failed to injure me in other ways you have been lying about me well its quite like you snell merriwell gasped the other recoiling and turning pale the dickens frank and his old foe wat snell were again face to face chapter xii snell is fired so its that sneak who has been telling yarns grated bart hodge i hope merriwell will smash him if he doesnt i will muttered jack diamond i thought we had seen the last of him when we left fardale i hoped so confessed hodge but i cant have a fight here said the landlord firmly it wont do he seemed on the point of interfering between frank and wat but hodge said a word to merriwell is enough mr drayben he will be careful not to cause you any trouble mr drayben saw that merriwell was holding himself in reserve and he felt a sudden curiosity to know what would pass between the enemies who had met there in his hotel so he did not speak to frank at once where is your fine friend mr parker flynn who you aided in your piratical attempt to seize my yacht asked frank snell swallowed down a lump in his throat and made an effort to recover his composure the yacht belongs to mr flynn he said huskily his voice betraying his craven spirit you know better than that if so why didnt flynn remain in rockland and push the case against me why did he suddenly take to his heels when he learned that benjamin from whom i bought the white wings was in rockland business called him back to boston faltered snell and business called you out of rockland in a hurry too but you stopped too soon it would have been better for you if you had kept on going snell understood merriwells meaning and he quailed before the flashing eyes of the boy he had slandered oh you cant scare me with your threats he declared in a weak manner im not afraid of you mr frank merriwell if you had kept still about me said frank i should not have known you were in this town but you tried to hurt me in a mean contemptible manner and i found you out never tried to hurt you in any manner how about the lies you have been circulating concerning me i dont know what you mean yes you do i swear i do not you have been telling that i have signed a contract with rockland well havent you you know i have not you know i would not do such a thing for any money as it would disqualify me for the yale team but i fancy i see through your crooked game you thought i might pitch for rockland because you knew they would offer me more money than camden possibly could you judged me by yourself and you knew you would sell yourself to do anything for money you sought to turn the college men here against me so they would carry back the report to their colleges that i had played for money under a signed contract then i would be debarred from the yale team and your revenge would be complete oh i can read you snell i know the workings of your evil mind you are wholly crooked and wholly contemptible what you deserve is a good coat of tar and feathers franks plain words had drawn a crowd about them and drayben saw it would not do not to interfere as the talk could be heard in the parlors this will have to stop he said firmly i cant have any more of it in my hotel he is to blame for it all whined snell the landlord gave him a look of contempt i do not blame him for anything he declared i know you have told the stories he claims my only wonder is that he did not knock you down on sight i might have done so said frank but was ashamed to soil my hands on the fellow at this thinking he was not in danger of immediate personal violence snell became suddenly bold that is well enough to tell he said but no one will believe it you will find that you cant crowd me mr merriwell i dont want to crowd you but i want you to keep your mouth closed as far as i am concerned if you try to circulate any more lies about me i shall forget that you are a whining cur without a spark of courage in your whole body and i shall give you the drubbing you deserve bah cried snell as i have discovered the sort of a person you are said mr drayben quietly but sternly i do not care to keep you in my hotel another hour what gasped snell what do you mean i mean that you are to pack up and get out at once but you cant turn me out in that manner this is a public house and you have no right to turn me out like that i have the right to refuse to keep rascals and crooks in my house sir it is my duty to protect my guests by turning out such persons when their true character is discovered you will get out as soon as you can do do do you dare call me a rascal and a crook gurgled snell take care sir shaking his finger at the landlord my father is a rich man he is at the head of the yokohama and manhattan tea company mr drayben and he will make you regret it if you turn me out of your old hotel i dont care if your father is the mikado of japan or the mayor of new york came from the landlord who flushed with anger when snell shook a finger at him you will get out of this house in a hurry just the same you cant turn me out till after dinner cant i well see about that but its almost dinner time now that makes no difference you cant eat another meal here settle and git it was a terrible humiliation for snell but he found there was no appeal and he was forced to settle his bill pack his traveling bag and leave the hotel without his dinner i have not liked the appearance of the fellow from the start said mr drayben he talked too much if he stayed in the house another week he would have driven away some of my best guests you have done me a favor mr merriwell by giving me an excuse for getting rid of him hes a revengeful sneak said frank hell try to get even with me some way jack and bart decided it was time for them to return to the yacht and so they left merriwell at the hotel surrounded by several members of the camden ball team who had come in to see him moslof introduced frank to the members of the team as they appeared and merry shook hands with slatridge and putbury the principal battery of the nine two men who were redheaded freckled slow of movement slow of speech and who looked so much alike that in their uniforms one was often mistaken for the other cogern the center fielder of the team was another big fellow who was said to be a terrific batter being valuable for that very reason williamson proved to be tall and thin but pop had a reputation as a pitcher and a hitter on account of his illness he had not been able to pitch since joining the camdens and so he was covering first base mower was a professional and a good man when he attended to business he played short bascomb a little fellow with a swagger and a grin that showed some very poor teeth was change pitcher with slatridge frank looked the men over they were a cleanlooking set of ball players and he was favorably impressed with them why you seem to have a strong team here he said to moslof i fancied by what i heard down in rockland that you had a lot of farmers they know better than that exclaimed the manager of the camdens flushing we gave them a shock by winning from them in our opening game they thought they had a snap they have been hustling since then but we held the lead for a long time now we are tied with them for first place and this game today decides who holds the position if woods and makune arrive on the twelve oclock car well try to give rockland a surprise this afternoon woods is a pitcher isnt he he is and hes a good man too but his arm is not in the best condition he hurt it a few weeks ago and it hasnt got back yet all the same he says he will pitch for us this afternoon telephoned me to that effect hes on the level and he wouldnt want to pitch if he didnt think he could win then i dont see why you want anything of me smiled frank woods can play any position said moslof quickly with you in the box wed have the strongest nine ever seen in this state you have started my baseball blood to boiling laughed merry but i think ill keep my head cool and not play at this moment some one announced that the twelve oclock car was coming and all hurried out to see if woods and makune were on it they were they were met by moslof who shook hands with them and then introduced them to merriwell what exclaimed makune frank merriwell the yale man the same confessed frank why portland tried to get you two weeks ago but couldnt get track of you moslof you did a good trick when you nailed merriwell but i havent nailed him said the manager of the camdens ive tried every way possible to get him he is stopping here on his own yacht woods did not seem to be much of a talker but when he shook hands with merry many in the crowd noticed a strong resemblance between them merriwell was the taller and darker woods was very quiet in his manner and he impressed the observer favorably at a glance he had the air of a gentleman even though he was a professional ball player that day woods makune moslof and merriwell dined together at the bay view and frank told himself that never had he met a pleasanter set of fellows there was something about woods that drew merry to him in a most remarkable manner frank had not known him an hour before he felt as if they were old friends do you think you can win from rockland this afternoon walter asked moslof i can try said woods quietly win exclaimed makune why he is sure to win if you have the team you say you have well eat rockland hows your arm walter asked moslof i think its all right assured woods all right cried makune of course its all right never was better you didnt hurt it much anyway walt yes i did declared woods truthfully i thought i had killed it and i reckoned that my ball playing days were over i didnt care much either if it hadnt been for you makune id quit anyway oh youre too sensitive chuckled makune you see gentlemen walter doesnt drink a drop doesnt smoke chew or swear wont play cards for money in fact hasnt a single vice the fellows jolly him about it and it makes him sore franks sympathy was with woods at once after dinner woods and makune went to their rooms to change their clothes and merry went out to stroll through the town frank found himself stared at in a manner that was rather embarrassing in the candy store opposite the bay view were a number of girls who seemed to be watching for him to appear they did not try to flirt with him but it was obvious that everyone of them was just dying for a fair look at him frank walked down through town and strolled up onto high street as far as the handsome stone mansion known as villa norembega here he was at the very base of the mountains and he could look out over the harbor and the bay the view was the most beautiful his eyes had ever rested upon and he stood there gazing upon it for a long time down in the harbor amid the other yachts the white wings lay at anchor and his keen eyes could detect figures moving about on her deck jingoes thought merry this is a lovely spot i wonder more people do not come here during summer there cant be anything more beautiful at bar harbor he walked back into town and on the corner near wileys market he met mcdornick and cogern who were in their ball suits he paused to chat with them a moment well have a mob up from rockland this afternoon said cogern they know weve got woods and makune perhaps they wont come for that very reason said mcdornick they may not want to see their team beaten well give them fits today baseball is something you cant depend on said frank warningly dont be too sure of winning i have seen a strong team lose just because it was too confident if we had you this afternoon we couldnt lose declared cogern that is not certain smiled merry but i guess you are all right anyway here comes the two oclock car from rockland said mcdornick wonder if it brought up any rooters the car was coming down around the curve the motorman letting it run without power as the grade was rather steep there of a sudden cogern uttered a cry and frank heard a sound that caused him to whirl about instantly on the track directly in front of the oncoming car a young girl had fallen from her bicycle she seemed to be stunned and the car was rushing upon her swiftly although the frantic motorman was banging the gong and twisting away at the brake with all his strength cries of horror went up from twenty persons who witnessed the downfall of the girl for it looked as if the car must pass directly over her quick as thought frank merriwell sprang to save the imperiled girl two pantherlike bounds took him to the car track and he stooped to lift her again there were cries of horror for it seemed that the car must knock him down and that two lives instead of one would be crushed out beneath the wheels women on the street turned their heads away that they might not witness the awful tragedy it did not seem that frank paused in his rush although he stooped caught hold of the girl lifted her and bore her on he snatched her up in a manner that utterly bewildered every person who witnessed the act and then as the car seemed sure to strike him with one of those wonderful leaps he cleared the track holding the girl in his arms he felt the car brush his elbow but that was all he was not harmed and the girl was safe in his arms although her wheel was crushed beneath the wheels of the car people came rushing toward them from all directions but frank did not mind them at that moment he looked down at the pale face of the panting girl miss macey he exclaimed it was the pretty roguisheyed girl to whom he had been introduced by landlord drayben you are not hurt are you he asked no she faintly whispered a bit of color coming back to her face but you saved me from being killed mr merriwell well frank was forced to confess i think i did get you away just in time my bicycle smashed oh im so sorry but id rather it would be that than myself thank you mr merriwell i am happy to do so much for you my only regret is that i was not able to save your wheel too you did all you could she said a bit of the roguish light coming back to her eyes i didnt suppose you would do so much for me a stranger im always ready to do anything in my power for a pretty girl said merry softly with laughing seriousness then pitch for the camdens this afternoon murmured phebe will you frank was thrown into consternation for he saw he was trapped its too late now he said moslof has decided to pitch woods if asked again to pitch ill do it by this time they were surrounded by the crowd a dozen men were asking phebe if she were hurt or were loudly praising merriwell for his prompt action in going to her rescue let me escort you to the hotel said frank i will return and see about your broken wheel if you will be so kind she murmured then with her clinging to his arm they walked toward the hotel it seemed that two hundred persons knew what had happened a score of girls saw phebe macey clinging to franks arm and even though she had lost her bicycle beneath the wheels of the car she was envied by them all chapter xiii quick work a steady stream of men women boys and girls were pouring in at the entrance of the camden ball ground which lay in a most picturesque location directly at the foot of the mountains it was plain that the greatest crowd of the season had turned out to witness the struggle which should place either rockland or camden at the head of the knox county league the grand stand filled rapidly it was a hot afternoon but there was a draught through the grand stand so that the upper seats were comfortable beyond the dusty diamond the green woods looked cool and inviting the ball ground was on an elevated spot from which a view of the village and bay could be obtained winding through the distant line of woods the river might be seen away to the west loomed a range of purple mountains dressed in their scarlet uniforms the camdens were on the field practicing although bascomb was going to be on the bench that afternoon he was warming up as if he expected to go into the box he had cast aside cap and sweater and was pitching all kinds of shoots to a young chap he had found willing to catch him woods was batting to the infield but somebody was needed to give the outfield some work merriwell was called for by mcdornick frank was leaning on the rail down near the peanut stand diamond hodge browning and dunnerwust being with him the entire party had left the yacht to witness the game of ball but the white wings was being watched by a young man on another yacht that lay near her wheres frank merriwell cried mcdornick from the field let him knock out some sky scrapers for us moslof asked merriwell to bat some to the outfield and so frank tossed aside his yachting jacket and advanced toward the plate there was a sudden burst of applause from the grand stand and it went all round the ground bringing a hot flush to merrys face i wish they wouldnt do that he muttered surely he was a handsomelooking fellow in his yachting suit he selected a bat and then without any apparent effort drove out a high liner for cogern in deep center he gave the fielders all the work they wanted here come the rocklands a great crowd was coming up the road in the van of which could be seen the boys in gray from the limerock city the rockland rooters had not been frightened away by the report that woods and makune would play with camden they were coming in a body to whoop and yell and growl for their team yes to fight for it if necessary they poured into the ground all the available standing room was taken and the crowd overflowed so that it encroached upon the field the camdens came in and let their opponents have the field for practice fellows smiled frank as he joined his friends this is going to be a hot afternoon all of that nodded hodge its plain there is an intense feeling of rivalry between these two towns say fellows put in jack diamond i havent stopped wondering yet what about asked frank this part of the country you told me we would have sport down here but i never expected anything like this why theres rivers of sporting blood in this section how do they get together such ball teams camden must pay mower big money or he would be in one of the big leagues they must have coughed liberally to woods and makune for either of those two fellows could get into a big league rockland has a fullsalaried team and they say she pays her men two hundred and fifty dollars a week all told thats more money than the new england league pays they dont go into anything halfway down here smiled merry i fancy the ball team is a good thing for camden it advertises the town as all the games are reported in the boston dailies and it attracts summer visitors a good percentage of the spectators here now are summer people the rockland team began practice they appeared more like professionals taken as a whole than the camdens nearly all of whom seemed college lads practice was over in a short time and then the home team prepared to go to bat first and the umpire took his position and called play although the rockland rooters were on hand to shout for their team the fact that camden had woods and makune made them cautious about offering bets in fact two of rocklands principal sports were seeking to put money on camden but could not find takers without giving odds dayguild rocklands champion pitcher the man held in reserve for camden was sent into the box he had seemed to hoodoo camden and rocklandites hoped he would keep up the good work some thomaston men who had come over to see the game stopped near merriwell and his party and laughed over the snap camden would have that day one of them was telling the others how easy it was to rattle dayguild and break his courage by hitting him hard and putting two rattling coachers on the line to keep him up in the air frank did not miss a word of this talk pop williamson was the first man to go to bat for camden he stood up at the plate and looked at dayguild dayguild laughed at him saying pop youre easy pop laughed back observing i have to be easy with you gil or id show you up and you would lose your job thats what i call wit exclaimed merriwell in appreciation pop is all right hell get a hit he did he cracked out dayguilds first ball for an easy single and laughed at the rockland pitcher as he trotted down to first thought i wouldnt put it into the woods this time gil he said thats a good start to rattle dayguild if they would get after him said a thomaston man but camden made the mistake of splitting her coachers putting one at third and one at first and the men did not open up in a way to get the rockland pitcher on the string putbury or old put followed williamson he was a lefthand hitter and a good man but dayguild managed to give him the evil eye and struck him out im afraid you wont get away from first pop said dayguild winking at williamson in a tantalizing manner oh theres lots of time returned the runner calmly cogern followed putbury he fanned twice and then he cracked out a daisy cutter that looked like a safe hit for it got past the pitcher and was going directly over second with smithers the baseman playing away off but smithers was a little fellow who could cover ground wonderfully how he ever reached second as soon as the ball and gathered it in was a marvel but he did the trick with an ease that brought an exclamation of admiration from merriwell as he picked the ball off the ground smithers touched second and put williamson out then he whirled like a cat and sent the ball whistling to first rocklands first baseman smothered it with ease before cogern could get much more than halfway down the line and a double play had been made which retired camden with a whitewash as a starter what a wild howl of satisfaction went up from the throats of the rockland rooters how they hammered on the railing and yelled their satisfaction was unlimited for they had not dreamed there could be such a happy termination of the camdens half of the first inning sorry for you pop grinned dayguild its a good thing for you there was a man like smithers on second returned williamson it was a clean case of luck at this dayguild laughed derisively walking in to the bench camden took the field woods stripped off his sweater and went into the box he was a clean finelooking fellow in his suit he had warmed up a little and now he tossed a few to williamson who was on first smithers the captain of the rocklands was the first man to go to the plate he was known to be a most remarkable little hitter without a weak point that any pitcher had been able to discover woods looked smithers over and then sent in a swift one that the little man let pass the umpire called a ball whew exclaimed diamond thats what i call speed you dond peen aple to seen dot pall ad all eh cried hans merry said bart woods is the first fellow i ever saw who reminded me of you in the box smithers went after the next ball but fouled it over the fence and a new ball was put into play again and again he fouled you are finding him cried the rockland rooters at last smithers hit it fairly on the trade mark and sent it out into right field for a single the rockland crowd was delighted why woods is easy they roared woods was not ruffled in the least when the ball was thrown in he entered the box with it immediately and then suddenly snapped his left foot out and shot the ball over to first smithers saved himself by a hairs breadth it was a close decision on the part of the umpire did you get onto that motion with his foot came eagerly from hodge its merriwell exactly why the fellow appears more and more like you frank thats so grunted browning edwards rocklands shortstop followed smithers at bat he was a large stocky redheaded fellow inclined to swagger and make more or less unnecessary talk but a good ball player and a hard hitter dont let him catch you smithers he cried ill land you on third woods smiled he was feeling first rate and he did not believe edwards could keep his word while standing carelessly in the box he gave a hitch at his pants with both hands the right hand holding the ball and then sent a scorcher over the plate so quickly that edwards was not prepared and did not offer at it one strike decided the umpire thats the way to fool em on the first one laughed frank merriwell softly woods is up to tricks boys that fellow is a dandy i believe smithers tried to get a good start from first but woods kept him close to the base much to the delight of the camden crowd all camden was confident that rockland was doomed to defeat that day the second ball was a coaxer but edwards let it pass then came another swift one and the batter went after it and missed it entirely the camden crowd howled its delight thats the stuff woodsie yelled a voice leave smithers on first same as they left williamson he cant do it you know sung back a rockland rooter woods was the essence of coolness he teased edwards with two outdrops and then he seemed to gather himself for a speedy one as the batting score stood three balls and two strikes the batter felt that woods would use a straight swift ball and try to cut a corner of the plate woods seemed to send the ball with all the strength he could command but strange to say it lingered in the air and too late edwards saw it was a slow one the big shortstop bit at it he smashed at it with all his strength and he hit the ball with the tip of his bat the coacher had sent smithers for second on that ball when it left woods hand it was too late to stop him when they saw the ball popped up into the air as an easy infield fly makune called out that he would take it and ran in under it edwards who had a lame knee ran as if sprinting for his life the ball hung in the air a long time while makune stood under it waiting for it to come down when it did come down it created one of the sensations of the day for it dropped into makunes hands and fell out there was a roar of astonishment that this crack infielder of the new england league should drop a ball like that makune was the most astonished man within the inclosure of that ball ground for he had not done anything like that before during the entire season then there was a kick as moslof claimed that makune dropped it purposely and as he had thrown the ball over to first on picking it up edwards was out on an infield fly even though he had reached the base ahead of the ball the umpire knew his business however and did not get rattled he knew that the rules declared a batter was out on an infield fly that could be handled providing there was a runner on first even though the fielder dropped the ball for the purpose of luring the man off first but smithers had left first before edwards struck the ball and was well on his way to second while makune had not dropped the fly as a trick but because he could not hold it the umpire decided that smithers had stolen second and edwards was safe on first which caused the rockland crowd to go wild with satisfaction while the camdenites groaned in dismay those who did not understand the point in the game declaring it was an outrage and those who did feeling that the umpire understood it too well to be fooled gulsiver rocklands center fielder was the next batter he went after the second ball and found it knocking it straight at mower mower was an erratic player and on this occasion he stopped the ball but he chased it around his feet long enough to permit gulsiver to get first safely and smithers and edwards moved up a base each the bags were full thats a hard start for camden said frank merriwell feeling his sympathy go out toward the boys in red dot voods dond seem to peen doin a great deal mit der rocklandt poys observed hans its not woods fault declared merry smithers is the only man who has secured a hit off him if woods was worried or disgusted he did not betray it he continued to pitch coolly and deliberately for all the yelling of the rockland crowd and chinning of the coachers he struck out the next man and followed that up by causing hammond the fifth batter to put up a low infield fly which woods looked after himself and caught then it was camdens turn to howl again for although the bases were full two men had been sent to the bench in a minute by the cool little pitcher in crimson this looks better said merriwell beginning to smile again ill bet something rockland does not score shaddock was the next man at bat woods fooled him on a wide curve and a swift inshoot then shaddock got mad and nearly broke his back hitting the ball the ball struck the ground near the home plate and rolled lazily down toward third smithers had started for home and woods started for the ball as he passed the ball smithers tried to kick it aside even though he was taking chances of being seen by the umpire in doing the trick he failed to touch it however and the next instant woods gathered it up with one hand taking it as he ran directly from first base smithers was between him and the plate and he could not see the catcher he did not hesitate a fraction of a second he did not even pause to straighten up but in a stooping position he swung his arm low and sent the ball whistling to first spectators afterward declared that at no time was that ball more than two feet above the ground it went straight to first williamson gathered it in and the rocklands were out without scoring then such a roar went up to the heights of old megunticook the old mountain must have fancied that the indian warriors of long long years ago had returned and were holding a mighty powwow down there in its shadow men and boys were frantic they hammered each other on the back they flung their hats into the air women screamed with joy and waved their handkerchiefs and woods just then he was the hero of the moment scores of pretty girls were hugging each other and declaring that he was just perfectly lovely but he was as cool and unruffled as ever seemingly utterly deaf to the roars of applause i guess camden is all right after all laughed merriwell woods is a dandy said diamond they do not need me to pitch for them today declared frank dayguild grinned and chewed gum as he entered the box and faced little mcdornick champion base runner of the camdens mcdornick was palpitating with eagerness to hit the ball he hated to let the first one pass although dayguild sent in a wide teaser he went for the second one and hammered it out for two bags although with an ordinary runner it would have been no more than a pretty single gil youre pie laughed williamson from the bench you will find him hot pie before the game is over said a rockland man moslof went to bat he was eager also far too eager for he struck at the first ball although it was not within reach but mcdornick stole third on it reaching the bag in advance of the ball by a beautiful lone slide then moslof batted one down to edwards and was thrown out at first mower came next sometimes he was a hitter this was not one of the times he fanned out and still mcdornick was shivering on third makune faced dayguild it was not for the first time as he had faced him many times before in the new england league although makune was not a heavy hitter he had done remarkable work for the first of the season and dayguild was afraid of him with the ball under his arm the rockland pitcher turned to observe the positions of the men in the field his back was toward mcdornick there was a shout of warning from the crowd and dayguild whirled to see a figure in crimson shooting toward the plate like a streak of fire it was mcdornick attempting to steal home the nerve of the act dazed dayguild for a moment and then he threw the ball to the catcher thinking to put out the runner with ease the catcher dropped it mcdornick made a headlong plunge for the plate touched it leaped up and dodged away before the catcher could pick up the ball camden had scored roar roar roar the crowd went wild with joy the black cliffs above flung back the burst of sound it seemed enough to wake the dead in the distant cemetery tinder the slope of battie it was heard far down in the heart of the town and it brought more spectators hurrying to the ball ground williamson sat on the bench and laughed tauntingly at dayguild who was flustered and excited now if they know how to do the trick they can win the game in this inning said a thomaston man but makune was not in good form and he rolled one down to third being thrown out at first which retired camden with one score but woods pitched wonderful ball the next inning and rockland was given another whitewash by this time dayguild had recovered his composure and he pitched so well that slatridge woods and williamson went out in quick succession then came a fatal half for camden merriwell had seen woods feeling of his elbow and working it as if it did not feel just right and he was not surprised when rockland fell to batting the new pitcher of the camdens moslof ought to take woods out frank said to diamond he has hurt that lame arm already you must be wrong merry said the virginian see the speed he is using why i can hardly see the ball as it goes over the plate speed is all he is using declared merriwell and rockland is eating speed he cant use his curves as it hurts his arm to do so now the rockland crowd had a chance to yell and laugh and cheer for although woods seemed to be pitching good ball the limeburners had donned their batting clothes and were hitting anything and everything the fielders were kept busy and rockland players chased each other round the bases till six scores had come in i said moslof ought to take woods out said merriwell soberly the game is lost now woods cant be the pitcher we thought he was said diamond in disappointment woods is all right if he doesnt spoil that arm asserted frank if he sticks to professional ball and takes care of his arm hell be in the national league before many years footnote a prophecy that has come true as walter woods was signed by chicago several years ago he can play any position on the diamond and is one of the cleanest men in the business not long ago he pitched on the camden team of the knox county league in the state of maine sockalexis the indian player who was with the clevelands last season and who created a sensation wherever he appeared also played in the knox county league the author at last woods struck out the third man and rockland was retired but not till she had secured a lead of five scores dayguild laughed at williamson as he went into the box its all over now he declared camden is buried you cant tell about that returned williamson you have had your turn ours will come but it did not come that day although woods pitched the game out and held rockland down so that she obtained but one more score the game finally ended seven to five in favor of rockland a more delighted crowd than the rooters from the limerock city could not be found they guyed every camdenite they knew they declared that camden was a snap for rockland and always would be a snap they were insolent in their satisfaction and delight down into town rushed the rocklandites they bought every tin horn they could find and at least a dozen cow bells they bought tin pans and drummed on them with sticks they bought brooms and paraded with them to indicate that they had swept camden clean they made a frightful racket in the very heart of the village and their scornful remarks about camden and camdenites in general were of a nature to arouse the anger of any inhabitant of the town at the foot of the mountains at last the cars from rockland came three of them being required to handle the crowd they piled on and went out of camden blowing horns ringing bells beating tin pans and howling derision frank merriwell stood on the corner near the opera house and heard all this he could feel the blood within him getting warmer and warmer he considered moslof a fine fellow and he admired woods his sympathy was with camden moslof and woods came down the street together and paused near frank woods was making no excuses they hit me out thats all he said i want to pitch against them again when this arm is rested frank stepped forward when do you play rockland again moslof he asked tomorrow was the answer the schedule brings these two games together who will pitch i dont know woods cant williamson is not in shape i am afraid to put slatridge in and bascomb never was any good against rockland although he is a good man against any other team you wanted me to pitch today said frank yes i might not have done any better than woods he is a dandy and he can monkey with rockland when his arm is all right i knew you ought to take him out at the beginning of the third and i told diamond so i could see that his arm was keeping him working speed and rockland was eating speed thats right nodded woods it was the best i could do that inning no matter where i put them they hit them out i worked a change of pace but that did not seem to bother them after that inning however i kept them guessing you pitched winning ball all through the game with the exception of that fatal inning and it is probable those fellows would have hammered anybody that inning they had a batting streak and they made the most of it then he suddenly turned to moslof asking do you want me to pitch for you tomorrow moslof gave a jump do i want you he exclaimed i should guess yes will you do it i will moslof seized merrys hand old man you have won my everlasting gratitude tomorrow well put a team into the field that will paralyze rockland it will be such a team as rockland or the state of maine never saw before will we do em oh say well wipe em off the earth oh thats not certain cautioned frank you cant be sure of a victory till it is won camden thought she had a sure thing today it will be different tomorrow said moslof if you pitch a winning game the people of camden will give you the whole town when we get back here well i shall do my best to pitch winning ball assured merry directly after supper which all the boys except hans took at the bay view the dutch lad being sent off aboard the white wings a buckboard with four wide seats came round for a party and merry was surprised to find that he was expected to be one of the party browning diamond and hodge were included the others were members of the camden ball team when the buckboard was loaded the driver cracked his whip over the four handsome horses and away they went through town up over harbor hill and along the street that led toward the foot of the mountains soon they were close under the cliffs of battie there were some splendid singers in the party and they awoke the echoes with the old college songs in the cool shadows of twilight they rolled along the famous turnpike with battie behind them and the frowning heights of megunticook rising directly over their heads on maiden cliff standing out against the sky they saw the white cross that marks the spot where a beautiful girl fell to her death on the cruel rocks below at times the winding road seemed to lead directly into the lake that they could see shimmering through the trees it was one of the most beautiful drives merriwell had ever taken they turned about finally and came back by the way of lake city a charming collection of cottages assembled at one of the most picturesque spots to be found around the islanddotted lake the driver pointed out the spot where the famous lake city inn had stood before the fire that wiped out the beautiful summer hotel by this time night had fallen but the full moon was high in the heavens shedding a pure white light over all and giving the scene a glamour that it could not have by day indeed it was so light that the cross on maiden cliff could be seen even better than they had seen it in the twilight now fellows said moslof there is another place we had better visit tonight where is that asked several the summit house on mount battie hurrah for the summit house shouted the boys well have to do some walking we can walk up all right i dont know about that grunted bruce browning i came out to ride it will do you good to walk but bruce could not agree with merriwell and moslof laughing said that browning should not leave the buckboard till he was safely on the top of battie this relieved the big fellows mind and he grunted all right go ahead before they reached the foot of the mountain after leaving lake city they turned off into a road that led back into the woods soon they came to the new road that had been constructed by the energy and determination of the shrewd owner of the hotel on the heights this road proved to be even better than the boys had anticipated but it was very steep in places so that every man except browning walked as for bruce no amount of guying could induce him to get off and climb the moonlight sifted down through the trees making white patches amid the black shadows there was not much air and the walking lads were perspiring freely before they were far from the foot of the ascent but they stuck to it and at last they were relieved to come out of the winding way and see the lights of the hotel before them with a cheer they rushed forward toward the building moslof led the way round the end and then all stopped uttering exclamations of admiration below them in the white moonlight lay the village the harbor the bay the great stretch of beautiful country hundreds of lights twinkled in the town the electric street lamps showing white and clear and marking the limits of the village away to the south was rockport her electric lamps paled by the clear moonlight miles beyond rockport was rockland her location also plainly marked by lights between rockport and camden a lighted trolley car was flying along jack diamond drew a deep breath and his hand fell on franks arm merriwell he said i want to thank you for bringing me down into this country it surely is a wonderful land at this season of the year no matter what it may be in winter this is the most beautiful view my eyes ever rested upon everybody says that put in moslof no matter where they have been they say that i have traveled a little over the world said merriwell and i must say this is the most entrancing view i have ever looked upon im glad i took the trouble to come up sighed browning as they were standing there gazing enraptured upon the scene there was a burst of girlish laughter from the hotel then at least a dozen girls came out upon the veranda what have we struck exclaimed frank it must be a party said moslof lets go in go in they did the proprietor of the hotel meeting and welcoming them it proved that moslof was right there was a party of girls up from the village and franks sharp eyes found phebe macey was among them not a few of the girls were known to the boys those who were not known were introduced what a place for a dance thought frank as he looked the dining room over these tables could be cleared away and then we he caught sight of the proprietor and in another moment he drew the man aside if you want to dance im willing was the consent of the genial owner of the summit house but wheres your music theres a fiddle here but who can play it ill find somebody cried frank and he rushed for diamond but before the dance could be started it was found that the consent of the young lady chaperon who had accompanied the girls must be obtained frank approached her at first she was not favorable but merriwell used diplomacy and finally won her over so that she consented to let the girls remain and dance an hour then there was a hustling to clear the dining room floor the old violin was brought out and diamond proceeded to tune up frank sought phebe and asked her to waltz with him i dont think i will dance she said pretending to pout a bit why not asked merry in surprise you do dance do you not oh sometimes and you will refuse me you deserve to be refused why pray asked frank surprised i asked a favor of you today a light broke in on frank oh is that it you wanted me to pitch for camden yes and i didnt well cant you pardon me this time really i do not think you deserve it perhaps not but if i promise to do better will you its too late now how is that camden lost and might have lost just the same if i had pitched no she said with confidence i know all about your pitching you would have won the game there is another game tomorrow oh thats in rockland and the rocklands always win on their own ground is that their reputation well perhaps we may be able to break the spell and defeat them on their own ground once we what do you mean by that it cant be that you will pitch for camden tomorrow will you waltz with me if ill agree to do so yes was her instant answer done said frank ill pitch then diamond struck into a beautiful waltz and frank and phebe were the first on the floor his arm about her waist her hand gently clasped in his chapter xiv merriwells double shoot here come the lobsters the cry was uttered by a small boy as the camden ball team entered the rockland ball ground a great crowd had assembled in the cigar box as the ground was sometimes called because of its narrow limits all rockland had heard that camden would have a new battery and nearly all rockland had heard of merriwell and hodge for frank had insisted that bart should support him behind the plate the fact that rockland had won from camden with woods in the box made the rooters feel that their team was invincible that it could not be defeated by camden they had turned out in a way to make the heart of the rockland manager rejoice as the quarters came jingling into the cash box the car had been delayed and the camden team was late it was followed by such a swarm of camden people as had never been seen on the rockland ball ground this band of rooters was marshaled by a camden man who had instructed them to hang together and who was to lead them in the cheering they packed in upon the bleachers near first base as they had bought a large reserved space there and it was held for them rockland had finished practicing and so the camdens took the field everybody was asking where frank merriwell was but no one seemed able to discover him it was a false report somebody said and then the spectators thinking they had been deceived began to growl but merriwell and hodge had slipped into the ground in ordinary clothes and were getting into suits in the dressing room beneath the grand stand as soon as they were dressed they came out and frank began to warm up by throwing to bart here they are a boy uttered the cry and then every eye seemed turned on the famous yale battery among those who had been watching for merriwells appearance was wat snell the fellow ground his teeth with rage as he saw frank come out in a baseball suit he shall not win this game vowed wat i have the stuff in my pocket that will fix him if i can get it into him then snell hastily sought some chaps who were grouped in a little bunch talking in low tones among themselves mr bixton said wat i want to speak with you a moment he drew one of the young men aside and whispered in his ear bixton scowled and nodded answering ive got fifty dollars on this game then snell whispered some more but bixton shook his head and said aloud theyd kill the feller they caught doin it french is a reglar fool he wants to beat camden but he wouldnt win in a crooked way for a thousand dollars hed be the first to jump on a chap that was caught doin up a camden man he neednt know it said snell and then he whispered some more but he couldnt seem to win bixton over all right said snell youll be sorry when you lose your fifty plunks i aint lost em yet you will if frank merriwell pitches the whole game practice was over the umpire took his place and called play the camden team was in the field merriwell walked down into the box he wore his yale uniform as he had been unable to obtain a camden uniform that would fit him the rockland crowd looked at merriwell with curiosity but all the applause he received came from the camden rooters at one side of the diamond were gathered twenty small boys usually these youngsters were full of taunts and jeers for camden but now they were strangely silent one of them turned to the others and said fellers rockland eats dirt terday we kin lick anything else on ther face of ther earth but we cant do up that battery ive read all about frank merriwell an there aint nothin walks on two legs what kin pitch ball with him strange to relate he was not disputed in the assertion the umpire broke open a box and tossed a beautiful new spaulding to merry who caught it and rubbed a handful of dirt over it smithers advanced to the plate frank had heard that it was impossible to discover the little mans weak point and he resolved to start right in by fooling him if possible hodge knew what was coming when merry assumed a certain attitude then without any flourish frank shot in what seemed at the start to be a straight swift ball smithers took it for an inshoot and in his judgment it must be a fair ball he swung for it and then he dropped his bat and gasped the ball had reversed from an in to an out causing smithers to miss it by at least six inches it was merriwells wonderful double shoot those in the grand stand who had seen the double curve of the ball uttered exclamations of amazement and some of them would not believe their eyes had not deceived them smithers picked up his bat muttering if id been drinking lately i wouldnt wonder at it hodge returned the ball and in a moment merry was ready to deliver again smithers fancied he had been deceived by his eyes and so when frank pitched another ball that was exactly like the first he smashed at it again and missed again there was a commotion in the grand stand a loud voice was heard declaring the ball had curved in and out and that merriwell was a wizard another person was speaking soothingly to the excited individual not a sound from the camden rooters for their leader was holding them in check he had not given the signal for applause on all the ground there was no man half as amazed as smithers he fancied he had batted all kinds of pitching but here was something new to him there was a hush as frank again assumed position for delivery smithers assumed a look of determination and made ready then the yale pitcher shot in another ball this time changing his curves so the sphere started with an out and suddenly changed to an in seeing it was an out at the start smithers instantly decided that it must go beyond his reach when it changed to an in and passed over the plate it was too late to get his bat round and so he stood with the wagon tongue poised not even having offered at it three strikes out called the umpire then the camden crowd could be held no longer never before had smithers been struck out like that but three balls had been pitched and yet the crack batter of the rocklands a man without a weak point was retired the men and boys from under megunticook rose up and yelled like a thousand fiends they felt that a man who could strike smithers out like that would have a snap with the rest of the team and the joy in their hearts knew no bounds for once the rockland rooters were silent they did not even have sufficient nerve left to guy the camdenites they stared and stared at the man who had struck out smithers with three pitched balls and their dismay and disgust knew no bounds whats the matter that rockland didnt get that feller growled one it was a fool trick to let camden get him smithers walked to the bench and sat down in a dazed way muttering well ill be blowed edwards picked up a bat and advanced to the plate with his usual swagger just try that on me he invited instantly frank decided to do so bart was ready and merry snapped in a swift one giving it the double curve edwards let it pass one strike cried the umpire a roar from the camden crowd bart sent back the ball edwards grinned and then scowled he made ready frank reversed the curves and drove in a whistler that could scarcely be seen as it passed through the air this time edwards struck but he found only empty air two strikes from the umpire another roar from the camden crowd edwards began to look doubtful what are we up against he muttered to himself merriwell took his time to pitch the third ball all at once he seemed to send in one like the last edwards believed the double curve would cause it to cross over the plate and he struck at it it proved to be a straight ball and edwards never touched it striker is out decided the umpire it is impossible to describe the tumult that followed for once at least camden was well represented on the rockland ground and the rooters for the boys in crimson could not make noise enough their hour of triumph had arrived and they were making the most of it edwards looked sour enough as he went to the bench whats the matter asked gulsiver who was swinging two bats so that one would seem lighter to him when he came to strike that yale chap is the devil growled edwards gulsiver was a college man and a fine fellow he had played with camden the previous season and camden was sorry it did not have him that year he looked anxious but determined to do his best as he went to the plate frank had decided that he was using the double shoot altogether too much for it would soon put a kink in his elbow if he kept it up he had used it on edwards because the rockland shortstop had challenged him to do so gulsiver was tried with a coaxer but he let it pass then frank gave him a rise and he hit it the ball popped up into the air and fell into merriwells hands retiring rockland on eight pitched balls without a single batter getting started toward first base the camden crowd was happy and the rocklandites were disgusted but rockland had a pitcher who more than once proved a hoodoo for camden the redoubtable grandpa morse was to go into the box this day there had been a time when morse could scare the camden players with his speed and fool them with his southpaw delivery rockland hoped that time had not passed even though the rooters of the limerock city were aware that morse was not dealing with tenderfeet this day moslof had placed hodge at the head of the batting list at merriwells suggestion bart picked up a heavy stick and advanced to the plate as morse entered the box the rockland men were in their places on the field morse was working his jaw over a chew of gum he had a glove on his right hand and with this he covered the ball so it could not be seen at the very start merriwell made a kick about this and morse was forced to show the ball in his hand he grinned at frank with an expression that seemed to say he would get even and then putting on all the steam at his command he sent a high ball over the plate thinking to daze hodge with his speed hodge swung at it hit it fairly without much effort and put it over the center field fence trotting around the bases to the music of the cheers of the camden crowd then morse was riled williamson came next and grandpa struck him out giving the rocklandites a chance to yell a little cogern followed and made a hard try for the center field fence but gulsiver got back against the fence reached up into the air and pulled the ball down to the increased delight of the rockland spectators mcdornick was too anxious and he hit an easy roller to edwards who threw him out at first but the first inning had ended one to nothing in camdens favor then merriwell went into the box again but he did not attempt to work his double shoot till rockland had filled the bases with a hit a wild throw by mower and a dropped fly by mcdornick followed by a poor throw to third now rockland thought her time had come the coachers were doing their best to rattle merriwell aided by the yelling crowd but frank never was cooler in his life he struck out the next man and the next popped up a little fly to makune then merry took a hot liner from the next batter and rockland did not score then bixton hunted up snell ill give you ten dollars to get that drug into merriwell he said furnish me with a boy to pass merriwell the water and ill do it said snell merriwell would suspect me bixton found the boy and the plot to knock frank out was laid snell called the boy aside and gave him full instructions here is a little vial he explained all you have to do is stick by the water bucket at the end of the camden bench keep this vial in your hand uncorked and ready you can keep it out of sight when merriwell wants a drink it will be easy for you to drop some of the stuff in the vial into the bucket as soon as he drinks upset the bucket so nobody else will get any of the stuff heres ten dollars for you the boy took the vial and the ten dollars then when snell was not watching him he looked around for french the rockland manager found him and told him the whole plot french was furious i wouldnt have that happen on this ground for a hundred dollars he declared point out the fellow who hired you to do this and i will have him arrested we are winning no games in that way the boy pointed snell out and five minutes later wat turned pale as an officer tapped him on the shoulder and said come with me dont make any fuss or the crowd will find out that you hired a boy to drug frank merriwell youll be lynched if they do find it out snell could not say a word with the officers hand on his shoulder he was marched off the ground while the crowd wondered why he had been arrested bixton the crooked sport saw this and it did not take him long to disappear so the plot to knock merriwell out was frustrated and frank pitched the game through giving rockland just four hits at the end of the eighth inning the score stood two to one in favor of camden with the beginning of the ninth a combination of bad plays placed a rockland man on third with one man out then the next batter drove out a long fly to cogern and the man on third attempted to score on it cogern made the throw of his life nailing the runner at the plate and spoiling rocklands last chance the game was over and camden had won by a score of two to one it had been a beautiful game and once more camden and rockland were tied for first place in the knox county league the camden rooters were happy while the rockland spectators melted away and disappeared from view with amazing suddenness when the last man was out it was plain enough that the rockland people expected the visitors to celebrate as rockland had done in camden but nothing of the kind was permitted still it was a joyful crowd that loaded the two trolley cars and went through the main street of the city singing boomtadeaye boomtadeaye deboomta deboomta debooratadeaye we won today we won today oh we won oh we won oh we won today as they passed the star office the bulletin was out baseball today camden rockland the crowd on the cars cheered as they passed the bulletin and they sang all the way to camden but when those cars entered camden what a reception awaited the victors it seemed that half the town had turned out to meet them everybody had a horn as the first car carrying the ball players approached the opera house there was a deafening blare of sound and the explosion of cannon crackers and cheer after cheer rent the air the moment the car stopped frank merriwell was torn from his seat by admirers was lifted to the shoulders of sturdy fellows and carried to the hotel without being allowed to touch his feet to the ground while the throng surged around him and shouted an hour later as he sat in the office of the hotel surrounded by friends and admirers he said fellows id like to spend the rest of the summer right here in this town its all right im glad ive found camden and you may be sure its not the last time i shall stop here then the mayor of the town who happened to be present said mr merriwell camden belongs to you if there is anything here that you want take it if you dont see what you want ask for it i dont know that we can do any better by you than that that evening landlord drayben gave the baseball boys a dinner at the hotel and there were speeches and toasts and cheers for merriwell after the dinner the dining room was cleared an orchestra appeared and there was dancing again frank was the first on the floor with phebe macey as his partner and phebe was the happiest girl in camden that night chapter xv off for bar harbor it was nearly midnight when a boat containing four lads pushed out from fish market wharf and pulled down camden harbor toward the fleet of yachts that lay anchored in dillinghams cove the moon had dropped down into the west but it still shed its pure white light on the unrippled water of the harbor and despite the lateness of the hour several boating parties were out from away toward the spindles came the sound of a song in which four musical voices blended harmoniously nothing stirs the entire soul with a sense of the beautiful like the sound of a distant song floating over the silvered bosom of a peaceful bay or lake on a moonlight night in midsummer hodge and diamond who were rowing the boat rested on their oars and the four lads listened a long time beautiful murmured merriwell who was sitting in the stern of the boat the rudder lines in his hands browning grunted the yelling of the camden crowd on the rockland ball ground today sounded better to me he said quoth merriwell the man that hath no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons strategems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted huah said bruce talk about a concord of sweet sounds what could be sweeter than the howls of those baseball rooters when you worked your double shoot on the rockland batters and kept them fanning the breeze that was what i call music fellows sighed frank this has been a lively day it certainly has nodded hodge things move in a hurry down here at this season of the year put in diamond its rather too lively for me confessed merriwell i am stuck on camden but i must get out of it right away why asked the others in a breath the people here will not give me any rest if i remain it will be impossible for me to refuse to play ball with the camden team and i did not come down here for that why i could have a hundred dollars a week if i would play with camden money doesnt seem to be of value to the people here now that they think i can beat rockland every time i go into the box they are ready to give up anything to beat rockland i havent any grudge against rockland in fact if what i hear about wat snells attempt to drug me is true i have every reason to be grateful toward manager french for he caused snells arrest and it is likely that wat is languishing in the rockland lockup tonight that fellow will land in prison all right said diamond he is the most vindictive creature i ever saw if french pushes him he may be shut up for a while down this way observed hodge i was going to spend a week up there on the mountain said jack looking toward the top of battie where the lights of the summit house were still gleaming despite the hour if we get out of here in a rush ill not get up there again we were there last night said frank that was a jolly time and no one expected it after dancing on the mountain last night pitching a game of ball today and then dancing at the bay view tonight i am ready to rest tomorrow browning grunted again i believe you are getting frightened he yawned of what the girl with the roguish eyes phebe sure why should i be frightened of her she has hypnotized you with those eyes notice how often he danced with her fellows inza burrage is down this way and she is in bar harbor now well thats not far you are counting on getting away from phebe before she weaves her spell about you so you cant break away its wonderful how you read a fellow laughed merriwell you should go into the mindreading business anyhow well get up anchor early if there is a breeze and leave camden behind us for good asked diamond anxiously oh perhaps not for good we may drop in here on our way back cant tell just what we will feel like doing a boat was gliding past them it came near enough for its occupants to recognize the lads in the other boat somebody said its merriwell and his party then a feminine voice called hello frank merriwell you are a dandy thank you said frank laughing there are others not in your class was the quick retort you are the only one of the kind who was that asked diamond as the boat passed on couldnt tell you my boy answered frank why thats strange she spoke to you as if she knew you familiar for a stranger evidently she is intoxicated by the moonlight grunted browning if we stay down this way long i fancy well find there is considerable freedom at these summer resorts said merry people do not always wait for introductions down here but the girl in that boat would not have spoken had it been in the daytime she knew i could not recognize her and that is how she ventured to do it well lets get on board urged bruce im tired and i want to turn in pull away directed frank and the boys began rowing again they passed other rowboats and the sound of voices and laughter came over the moonburnished bosom of the harbor on board one of the yachts not far from the white wings a jolly party had gathered somebody was picking away at a guitar and softly humming the latest song others were chatting and laughing the yacht was decorated with chinese lanterns and was burning bright lights those lights would look better if there wasnt any moon observed diamond as they approached the white wings a figure suddenly arose on the deck and leveled something at the boat while a voice called stood still vere i vos und gafe der coundersign uf i dond done dot you vill oben vire onto me here here hans exclaimed merry what are you trying to do shoot us be careful with that gun vos dot you vrankie asked the faithful dutch boy lowering the gun vale i dond vant to make no mistook und so i peen careful not to led any vellers come apoard uf me vot i dond vant to seen i vos glad you haf camed they ran up to the sloop and were soon on board it was necessary to tell hans what had happened that day but he simply said oh i knew how dot vould peen all der dime uf course vrankie blayed marples mit rocklandt that night they slept well in their berths for a cool breeze sprang up about midnight so the cabin of the yacht was not too warm and there was the gentlest of rocking motions to lull their senses frank was astir at daybreak and it did not take him long to turn the others out when he discovered there was a land breeze its just what we want he said we must get away in a hurry fellows we can take our breakfast after we get outside the harbor so the anchor was raised the sails run up in a hurry and the white wings with frank at the wheel headed for the spindles at sunrise she was outside the harbors mouth with her course set due east outside the harbor there was a strong steady breeze and it was not long before the twin mountains of camden began to sink into the purple morning mists chapter xvi diamonds plans the season at bar harbor was at its height and the most famous resort on the coast of maine was overflowing with rich fashionable and famous people congressmen and their families were there millionaires from various parts of the country were there titled persons from abroad were there frenchmans bay was almost crowded with yachts and excursions were pouring into the town by the railroad and by steamboats there were drives by day excursions to various points about the bay and by night there were hops at the hotels strolls in the moonlight and gay times on board the yachts that clustered in the harbor two days at bar harbor made frank and his friends long to get away this isnt much like camden dont you know yawned browning as he rolled into his berth on the afternoon of the second day we made a mistake in running away from that town in a hurry you know why we did it said frank quickly we were too well known there now over here we have been discreet and kept our identity secret that was not such a task either for i do not fancy one out of a thousand of these people ever heard anything about any of us or would take the trouble to turn round to look after us if they had heard of us and knew who we were by jove i find it rather agreeable fellows oh thats all right nodded diamond i dont fancy notoriety any more than you do merry but there is something about the atmosphere here that i dont quite relish although i cant tell what it is frank laughed i fancy i know what it is old man then let me into the mystery it is the air of commercial aristocracy these people wear now by birth and breeding diamond you are a true aristocrat but with you blood is everything and it rather galls you to witness the boorish air of superiority assumed by some of these millionaire pork packers with neither education nor refinement i dont wonder when you came to yale you had some silly notions about aristocracy but you have gotten over them to a certain extent so that now you recognize a gentleman as a gentleman even though his father was a day laborer but you realize that no man is a gentleman simply because he is worth several million dollars and has a daughter he is trying to marry off to a foreigner with a title and a blasted reputation we are getting nearer together in our ideas every day diamond whether you realize it or not these moneymade aristocrats with their boorish manners and their inability to speak or spell the english language correctly are quite as repugnant to me as they are to you there are plenty of such society people here and they are making you tired old man i dont wonder i am becoming a trifle fatigued myself yaw grunted hans who had been listening with an owlish look of wisdom on his fullmoon face vot makes me dired vos dose beoble vot dond knew how to speak der english language mitoudt a misdake makin their spelling in i cant say that i relish bar harbor so very much said hodge speaking for the first time i think i have seen enough of it lets move grunted browning oh you will trouble yourself a lot about moving laughed frank ill move when the yacht does and help get up the anchor oh say ill pay hans to do my share of pulling on the anchor line my heart is weak and i am liable to strain it by overexertion you are not at all liable to for you will not overexert yourself if we leave bar harbor where shall we go fellows asked diamond oh there are plenty of places assured frank mention some of them as you know penobscot bay is full of islands and on some of those islands are villages now it is my belief that some of those villages would be interesting places to visit a good suggestion we might run down to greens landing or isle au haut say exclaimed diamond say it i have an idea vos dot as pad as der rheumadisms asked hans innocently vere did id hurt me most lets invite the girls said jack inza and paula yes huah grunted browning from his berth anybody might have known it think of john diamond of virginia getting soft on a boston girl ha ha ha the big fellows words and laughter irritated diamond and he snapped i dont see what there is so very funny about that then browning laughed all the more saying you see he doesnt deny it fellows i suspected it when they met in rockland it was a case of love at first sight paula benjamin is a splendid girl said frank and you are stuck on her yourself browning jealousy is what ails you the big fellow flopped over in his berth with remarkable suddenness his face becoming wonderfully red now look here merriwell he exclaimed that wont go down with this crowd you all know i dont care a rap about girls and vot made you got so red aroundt der gills pruce chuckled hans dot peen a deadt gife avay jack was glad the tables were turned and he joined in the general laugh oh go to thunder the whole of you roared browning as he again flopped over in his berth what would we do with the girls asked hodge we have not sufficient room on the boat to accommodate them here and there must be some sort of a hotel at greens landing said diamond quickly of course miss gale inzas aunt would go along as chaperon well it would be a change from bar harbor said frank this place is too much like all other fashionable seaside resorts to suit me and still i do not feel like running away and leaving the girls they would think it a mean trick if we were to do so so soon perhaps they wont go said hodge who did not seem much in favor of the project well we can ask them spoke up diamond quickly i am to see inza this evening and ill find out about it said frank if they can go we want to get away bright and early tomorrow providing there is a breeze chapter xvii the man who saw the monster the girls gladly welcomed the plan for they felt there would be much pleasure in a cruise among the islands of the bay at first however miss gale was opposed to it but frank won her over as inza felt certain he could so the next morning the girls appeared on the pier at an early hour accompanied by the sternfaced but kindhearted old maid having been brought down from the hotel by a carriage the boys were on the watch for them and a boat containing frank and jack pushed off from the white wings immediately the girls the chaperon the baggage all were taken into the boat and soon set aboard the yacht half an hour later with all sails set the white wings was running out to round the end of the breakwater with favorable wind and conditions it is just a delightful halfdays cruise from bar harbor to greens landing off southwest harbor the wind proved something of a gale as nothing in the shape of land lay between them and the open ocean from which the wind swept in powerfully although the yacht buried her starboard rail at times and fairly hissed through the water frank did not take a reef in a single sail for there were no squalls and corinthian though he was he was gaining confidence in his ability to handle the white wings paula was rather timid but inza enjoyed every moment of the sail with a position near frank who was at the wheel she chatted and laughed not in the least affected by the motion or the heeling of the sloop remarkable to state browning did not remain below and sleep in his bunk as was his custom he came on deck looking remarkably wide awake and he made himself agreeable to the girls and miss gale there was not swell enough to make anyone seasick which added to the pleasures of the cruise diamond was doing his best to make himself agreeable to paula and she seemed to find his company acceptable but after a time she called bruce to her so that she was between them dont you think mr merriwell very reckless mr browning she asked mr diamond insists there is no danger but just see how frightfully the yacht tips at times of course i wouldnt want to frighten you miss benjamin said bruce giving her a significant look and winking toward jack but we all know frank merriwells a veritable landlubber and he hasnt any more judgment about running a boat like this than a fouryearold youngster paula looked alarmed at this and diamond muttered something under his breath when jack was not looking bruce gave the boston girl a reassuring smile whispering not the least danger in the world miss benjamin she looked relieved and then a mischievous expression flitted over her face for she understood brownings little game immediately she pretended to be both frightened and indignant with diamond i knew it she exclaimed mr diamond could not deceive me i was sure there was great danger of course said the big fellow in his peculiar way we may reach greens landing in safety but the chances are against it however if we are capsized i shall not fail to assist you in getting to the mainland miss benjamin how thoughtful of you she murmured nestling a bit nearer the big fellow while jack ground his teeth and looked as if he longed to murder somebody how far away is the mainland only about five miles a short walk hem i mean a short swim diamond sourly observed without doubt you could walk it much easier than you could swim it mr browning oh that is an easy swim said bruce offhand i have often swam ten or fifteen miles without doubt i could get miss benjamin safely ashore it is nice to have such a wonderful swimmer near one i feel so safe now said paula under his breath the virginian growled something that sounded like confounded liar eh said bruce what were you saying sir but jack looked away pretending to be interested in a distant island he showed his anger so plainly that paula was aroused to tease him still more and she turned to chat confidentially with bruce jack could not stand that a great while with a sudden assumption of having forgotten something he politely excused himself and went below he did not come on deck again till greens landing was in sight although he missed the most captivating portion of the sail across the eastern bay as for browning he had started into the affair in jest but he grew more and more interested in paula as they talked during the sail he found her remarkably bright and sensible and not at all flighty she talked to him of things in which he was interested and he was astonished by the knowledge she displayed concerning some things of which he had not fancied she was posted in the least on the other hand the boston girl was astonished to find in bruce who had on first acquaintance seemed somewhat slow and dull a fellow who was interesting in various ways who did not talk nonsense to her the moment the opportunity offered to say something that she alone could hear who had an air of dignity and was not at all selfconscious never before in all his life had bruce made a better appearance and long before greens landing was sighted paula had quite forgotten that diamond had left them and had not returned there were other vessels and yachts in the harbor at greens landing more of them than any of the party had expected to see there in fact there was an air of prosperity about the town built on the slope facing the harbor although there were no large and attractive buildings and the houses seemed scattered about in a helterskelter manner the white wings ran in amid the vessels and swung up her head to the wind her anchor going over with a splash and her sails coming down as if the halyards were handled by veteran yachtsmen instead of a lot of amateurs in fact merriwell had sailed the boat like one familiar with the eastern bay seeming to fear no dangers from sunken ledges and shoals and his air was that of a veteran yachtsman but he had spent hours over his chart so that he was perfectly familiar with its appearance and he could have drawn from memory a practically perfect chart marking every ledge every shoal and every island and giving them their correct names having become thus familiar with the chart it was not so strange that he had been able to sail across the eastern bay as if it were the open sea having come to anchor paula was for going ashore at once but frank urged them to remain and take lunch on board the yacht and inza was pleased with the idea so they stopped that was a jolly luncheon there was plenty to eat and plenty of light drinks kept cool by the fresh supply of ice taken in at bar harbor the sailors on board the vessels in the vicinity looked on with interest envying the merry party not all on the white wings were merry jack diamond was silent and not once did a smile cross his face paula tried to cheer him up but she did not succeed at all and so she finally gave up in despair again turning to browning an hour after luncheon was over bruce and frank set the girls and miss gale ashore carrying their luggage up to the hotel where accommodations were obtained we will leave here tomorrow if you get enough of the place in that time said frank having seen them to their rooms he went down into the office of the hotel where several roughlooking men were listening to the yarn of a redheaded redbearded man in rubber boots bruce seemed to be listening to the story and when frank said something about going out he grunted wait a minute yes sir said the redheaded man squirting a stream of tobacco juice at the stove which was well plastered with it already i have seen the critter and i know by huck it aint no lie hes right there on the island and if he aint the old devil hisself hes clost relation to him now i pull my traps right down past there every day said an old lobster fisherman and i swanny i aint never seen northing of this here pesky critter ef jeb warnt sech a dinged liar with a jerk of his thumb toward the redheaded man id jest go down there myself and spend some time ahuntin this critter with horns an hoofs an glarin eyes id find out what sort of a critter it was oh yes returned the one who had been derisively designated as a liar ef you wasnt sech a darn coward you might do something of the kind sile but you are the biggest coward this side of long islan so the critter down on devil island wont git bothered by you none to mention this was said with the utmost calmness the speaker not seeming in the least excited by being called a liar nor did the man he had designated as a coward do anything more than grunt derisively and remark thats all right jeb dont nobody take no stock in what you say and though this yarn about a critter on devil island has been goin abaout a year i dont know a mortal bein whose word is wuth a cod line that ever said he saw the varmint whut

gittin to the landin an take a chance of straddlin a ledge i got inter the harbor all right an kinder thought id try ter root out a few clams on bold island beach my old boat laid nearer to the back of devil island than it did to bold island i rowed off to bold island in my dory but the tide was comin in an i didnt git no clams to speak of it was plum dark when i pulled back to the pinkey jest as i run alongside i heered a sound that riz my hair by huck it was kinder like a groan and a smothered screech an i swan to man if it didnt seem to come right out of my pinkey scart waal it did give me something of a jump an that i wont deny if sile had abin there hed kerwollopsed i riz right up with an oar in my hand ready to slam it over ther head uf any dadbum thing that wiggled round the pinkey jest then i heard that sound agin an i made out it come from the point of rocks that makes off inter ther harber i looked that way an jest then ther consarnedest varmint i ever sot eyes onto riz right

rocks if youll wait till i tell the story mebbe youll find out humph go ahead with yer yarn ez i said up jumped this critter his face was all burnin like fire and his eyes was just like two black holes fellers what have told how his eyes shined and flashed aint never seen him for ill swan his eyes was jest two black holes in his head he waved his hands in the air an them hands shone fiery same as his face then he let out a screech that might have been heard down to ther spoon islands an away he went up over the rocks and inter the woods say i aint easy skeered but i will admit i was a bit shaky then i jest got inter the pinkey pulled ther anchor then tumbled back inter ther dory an took ther old pinkey in tow i wasnt very long gittin out of bold island harbor neether i wouldnt a stayed there that night fer a hundred billion dollars i towed the pinkey clean to the landin an you dont git me round devil island agin arter dark by huck what do you think of that yarn browning asked frank speaking softly into the big fellows ear huah grunted bruce i think sile was all right in calling jeb a liar i have heard that these fishermen are remarkable at drawing the long bow and jeb is an artist some of those who had listened to the fishermans story did not accept it with such scorn as the lobster catcher had evinced there was a sound of excited voices when jeb had finished and one young fellow with a hunchback and a cunning face jumped up crying it aint no lie an ill swan ter that ive seen ther old critter on devil island myself though i aint bin tellin much about it fer i knowed every dern critter on deer island would call me a thunderin liar there by huck cried jeb now whut do you think of that you hear whut put wiley has to say oh yes we hear it drawled sile who was calmly filling a black pipe but put allwus was seein queer things that nobody else could see i spose he dreamed that he saw the demon of devil island it warent no dream fiercely declared the hunchback i saw the critter when i was on the island moren that the varmint chased me hey cried several the excitement increasing ill swan to it declared put stanchly when did all this take place asked one of the listeners last sunday and we never heard of it before say put i never knowed you to tell anything crooked but its a big yarn youre givin us now if all this happened last sunday why aint you told of it afore in the fust place cause i was darn scart in the second place cause i knowed everybodyd think i was lyin how did you happen to be down there on devil island sunday last time jerry peg was in bold island harbor he said he saw a partridge fly up on the shore of devil island he went ashore an tried to shoot her he didnt shoot her but he said he scart up six or eight others in the thick woods he come away without gittin one of them sunday i didnt have northing to do so i loaded up my old gun and rowed over to devil island didnt git there till three in the afternoon beached my dory an hitched the painter to a tree wisht i hednt hitched her arterward took out my old gun and went up inter ther spruces tramped round to ther old stone quarry one way but didnt see northing turned and tramped clean roun to tother end of the island scart up two partridges and fired at em both knocked down the second one then i chased tother scarin him up and scarin him up but never gittin him though i fired at him twict i was mad said id stay right there an hunt that dern partridge till ther eastern bay froze over but id git the thing arter a while i couldnt fin him at all but i kept prowlin round in the woods till it was beginnin to git dark i heard somethin like a rustlin under some cedars and saw somethin move then i ups and fires when i done that there was a yell that might have been heard clean down to ther hosses out of them cedars came a critter that i swan was the old devil him own self he had horns an he had a fiery face and hands an he had black holes fer eyes jest as jeb told it and he had a redhot spear of iron in his hand he run at me to stick that spear inter me i know he was goin to spear me and then kerry me down below fer shootin partridges sunday he warent moren six feet of me when i poked out my old gun an fired the second barrel right inter his face and eyes it never bothered him a bit run why i flew never kivered ground so fast before an i never spect to agin i bet sometimes i jumped as much as fifteen feet to a leap the speaker took out a dirty handkerchief and mopped the big drops of perspiration off his face he was shaking with excitement and his eyes gleamed he showed every symptom of extreme terror as he related the story and it seemed plain enough that he believed every word he was uttering go on cried several i dont know how i ever got away said the hunchback huskily i do know that monster was chasin me right through the woods tryin to ram his spear inter my back as if i was a flounder an he was arter lobster bait i managed to hold onter my old gun though at the time i didnt know i was adoin of it if i hed stopped ter think id throwed the gun erway when i came out ter ther bank nigh ter whar my dory was hitched i made a jump that took me clean from ther top to ther bottom it seems as if right when i was in ther air i thought how that bot was tied with her painter an i rammed my hand inter my pocket fer my knife when i got ter ther boat i had the knife in my hand i flung ther gun in an yanked open ther knife jest as ther critter came down over ther bank arter me an he sailed down where i had jumped i saw him do it and i know he spread out some red things like wings i dont say they was wings but they looked like wings i yanked open my knife and i cut the painter the tide was in and the dory was afloat which was a good thing fer me for when i jumped in i gave her a shove that sent her away from the shore i got ther oars inter ther water and pulled the critter didnt chase me any arter it reached the edge of the water again the excited speaker wiped his face with the soiled handkerchief and then he sat down in a chair as if the remembrance of the adventure had taken all the strength out of him he was shaking all over frank merriwell and bruce browning looked at each other how is that for a vivid imagination grunted the big fellow its pretty good but he seems to believe it himself said frank he does act that way confessed bruce i am getting interested declared frank when i get a chance i shall visit devil island where is it not far from here if i remember right if i thought there was anything down there worth seeing i wouldnt mind going myself said the big yale man but these fishermen are such confounded liars that you cant tell those who had been listening to the story were urging the hunchback to tell some more after a little time he stopped wiping his face and said thats all the critter turned tail and disappeared while i nigh pulled my arms out gittin away anybody that wants to can go nosin round devil island but put wiley will keep away next time the critterd git me sure now whut do ye think of that sile collins cried jeb triumphantly if im a liar i aint ther only one on deer island humph grunted sile let a yarn like this git started an half the folks that go near devil island will see this ere critter some folks is great at seein such things but his appearance of ridicule did not disguise the fact that he had been impressed by the story of the hunchback devil island alwus hes bin haunted declared one of the listeners thats why its deserted terday the quarry aint worked out but the big boardin house stands empty on the island the house aint occupied sence that woman from rockland lived in it broke in another she didnt live there long i guess she saw things on the island that made her reddy to git off queer freak for a woman to live there all alone anyhow observed jeb we used to see her round the house or on the shore when we run down past the island but all to once she was gone sence then put in a man who had not spoken before ive seen lights in the winders of the old boardin house at night and in the winders of the other house though ive never ketched a glimp of a livin critter movin on the island by day oh its haunted nodded the one who had declared so before anybody what wants to can go foolin round there but im goin to keep away he rose to his feet he was tall and thin with a broken nose that seemed to tell the story of some fierce fight at an island dance his starboard eye was crooked so that it was difficult to tell just which way he was looking he took in a fresh chew of tobacco and slouched out of the hotel this is a place to see odd characters said merriwell browning nodded they listened to the men who remained and for some time there was an animated discussion about the creature on devil island in the midst of it the hunchback left the room i want to have a talk with that fellow said frank come on they followed the hunchback outside wait a minute if you please called frank hurrying after the hunchback the fellow paused and turned round what do ye want he asked his voice was harsh and unpleasant and there was a suspicious look in his eyes i heard your story about the creature you saw on devil island said frank waal what of it my yacht is out there in the harbor and i am thinking of taking her and running down to devil island i have a great desire to get a look at the monster you spoke about bold island harbor and i want to find out just how to get in there and how near i can anchor to devil island the light in the eyes of the hunchback seemed to shift in a queer way as he stared at frank browning had come up and was watching the fellow closely you keep away from devil island almost snarled put wiley as the deformed fellow had been called you dont know what youll strike there and ill take my chances on that all i want of you is to tell me the best place to lay while i am down there i want the white wings in a good harbor if a storm should come up waal i dont tell ye northing about it all ive got ter say is keep away then despite franks effort to say something more to the fellow he hurried away well thats a really jolly chap observed browning all of that laughed frank he didnt seem to like your appearance merry well i cant say that i admired his appearance you will have to seek your information elsewhere it wasnt so much that i wanted to find out about bold island harbor i wanted to get him talking thought i might be able to trip him up if i got a good chance to ask him questions but he wouldnt talk he seemed suspicious they watched the hunchback go into a store just before passing through the door which stood open he turned his head and looked back wanted to see if we were following him smiled frank they walked about the village finally returning to the hotel as they approached the hotel inza and paula came out and asked to be shown around the village for an hour the four strolled about from the yacht in the harbor diamond saw them occasionally and the virginians heart was throbbing with anger he felt that he could kill bruce browning without a qualm of conscience finally the party returned to the hotel but before leaving the girls frank had invited them to be ready for a short cruise on the yacht the following morning and they had promised to do so as the boys approached the wharf beside which their boat floated a man came toward them and spoke to them he was the man with the crooked eye and broken nose i hear you chaps are thinkin of goin down to devil island he said one eye seeming to look at frank while the other looked at bruce is that right we may go down there answered frank tomorrow better not why its dangerous how you heard the yarns about the critter on the island and you ought to know why those yarns are the very things that make me want to go down there declared frank the cockeyed man looked surprised you dont want to be ketched by the monster do ye no but wed like to catch the monster laughed frank you cant do that the critter aint human if he aint the devil hisself hes one of the devils imps well wed like to catch a genuine imp if we could capture a real imp and take him to boston or new york we could get a royal good figure for him from the manager of some dime museum freaks and curiosities are in great demand and they are very scarce the cockeyed man seemed astonished and disgusted why you dern fools he exclaimed you dont magine you kin ketch a real imp do ye we can give him a good hustle answered merry with apparent seriousness hell have to be lively if he gets away ive hearn tell of how you city chaps didnt know much but i did spose you knowed moren that cried the man youll be kerried off if you go down to devil island and try to chase the critter there youll disappear an youll never be heard of agin well take our chances say i want ter tell you something we dont say much about it round here but most evrybody knows it there was a man kem here this spring from boston he heard about devil island being haunted and he was jest darn fool enough to want to go down there and see the spook he went he got some lobster ketchers to set him ashore and wait for him they wouldnt go ashore with him but they stayed in the boat reddy to take him on when he got reddy to leave he never left what happened to him who knows bout halfanour arter he went ashore there was the awfullest screech of agony come from somewhere on the island seemed jest like a man givin a death yell it scart them lobster ketchers so they rowed off a piece but they waited till dark he never come then they rowed off and nothing of that air man has ever bin seen sence didnt anybody go down to the island to see if they could find him a tree may have fallen on him or something of that sort there was six men went down from here two days arterward an whut do you spose they found the man from boston didnt i tell ye he hadnt never been seen sence they found a newmade grave what was in the grave they didnt wait to see but they saw whut was at the head of the grave what was that a new granite headstone yes trues im here it was cut out nice an clean an on it was chiseled some words what were the words sacred to the memry of rawson denning who was rawson denning that was the name the man from boston sailed under the cockeyed man whispered the words his effort plainly being to make them as impressive as possible now said merriwell you have awakened my curiosity so that nothing can keep me away from devil island i wouldnt miss going down there for anything i simply dote on mysteries and this seems to be a most fascinating one i am going to lay claim to it and ill wager something that i solve it hereafter the mystery of devil island belongs to me till i make it a mystery no longer waal you are a fool snarled the cockeyed man i told you this for your own good so you might have sense enough to stay away but you aint got no sense in your head go on if ye want to and ill bet you git planted side of the man from boston then he turned round and walked away it is plain enough murmured frank that you do not want us to go to devil island we will go there tomorrow i should guess yes grunted browning i am feeling just like looking the place over then they entered their boat and rowed off to the yacht chapter xviii the monster of the deep the following forenoon the white wings sailed out of the harbor at greens landing bearing beside her regular crew miss gale and the girls she was bound for devil island and neither the girls nor their chaperon had wished to be left behind it was a glorious summer day with a medium breeze as they ran out of the harbor frank noticed a man at work in a lapstreak sailboat it was the fellow with the broken nose and the crooked eye and he seemed to be preparing to get away he did not even glance toward the white wings merry called brownings attention to the man there is our amiable friend who gave us the warning he said thats so nodded bruce by jingoes thats a peculiar boat hes in look at her long and narrow dont look as if shed carry much sail without upsetting thats right agreed frank it is a queer boat but she has mast enough for a big spread of canvas they thought no more of the boat till they were in sight of devil island then bruce saw a small boat that lay low in the water and carried her big spread of canvas in a reckless manner although she was laying over before the wind this boat was literally flying through the water and it was plain enough that she was a wonderful sailer look here merry said bruce isnt that the lapstreak in which we saw our friend the cockeyed man as we were leaving greens landing frank had a glass at hand and he quickly took a survey of the flying sailboat sure as you are born he cried that is the very boat how in the name of all that is wonderful does she stand up under that spread of sail dont ask me grunted bruce i didnt suppose she could carry half as much look at the speed of her exclaimed hodge theres only one man in the boat is there merry asked bruce i believe there is said frank our friend with the crooked eye is steering i dont see anybody else because the other person is keeping out of sight what there is a man lying in the bottom of that boat how do you know i saw him lift his head to look at us a few moments ago thats strange its plain enough he doesnt want to be seen what does it mean dont know they watched the flying boat take the lead of them and saw it bear toward a distant rocky point of the island ahead near that point some sagging sheds could be seen the small boat rounded the point and was hidden behind the island there is bold island famed for its wonderful clams over yonder said frank bold island harbor must lay between that and devil island but i didnt find it on the chart however there is a passage between the two islands which is perfectly safe at high water we will run down in there and drop anchor as near devil island as possible they did so finding a sheltered cove where it was plain that a boat could lay in any kind of a storm close to them was the rocky shore of devil island beyond the rocks rose a high bank upon which was a gloomy tangle of woods there was something forbidding in the appearance of the island with the unpleasant name frank and bruce were eager to get ashore at once as soon as the sails were cared for and things were shipshape they prepared to leave the yacht in vain paula had tried to draw diamond into conversation jack would answer her questions he was extremely polite but he made no attempt to be entertaining at last just as frank and bruce were preparing to enter the small boat she left jack and called to inza come on then to the astonishment of the boys the girls came over to the rail and asked to be assisted into the boat eh grunted browning where are you going with you answered paula were not going to stay here and mope with nobody to talk to aunt abigail is reading in the cabin and i dont believe she will mind perhaps you had better ask her said frank weakly it isnt necessary assured inza quickly come help me into the boat you lazy fellows did you expect to get out of giving us a row i know you dont want to pull us around but you cant get out of it and then she came over the rail and leaped lightly into the boat browning aided paula after giving frank a helpless look we cant get out of it whispered merry well row them round a while and then well bring them back to the yacht bruce had brought out a repeating rifle from franks supply of arms in the cabin and that was placed in the prow of the boat both girls sat on the stern seat with a double set of oars the boys pulled off from the yacht it was a strange spectacle to see bruce browning handling an oar but he had been a famous allround athlete when he first entered yale and he had not forgotten how to row they asked the girls where they wished to go and paula answered oh anywhere under other circumstances browning might not have been so willing to pull at an oar but he knew diamond was gnawing his heart out and the big fellow had developed a sudden satisfaction in tormenting the virginian a distant island attracted the girls on a ledge near it was a flock of white gulls covering the ledge so it looked as if it were a mass of snow they pulled toward the island the gulls proved shy and keen of sight for they began to leave the ledge shortly after the boat drew away from the yacht and half the distance to the island had not been covered before not a gull remained on the ledge didnt even get near enough for a real good shot with the rifle grunted bruce id like to get a shot at something then he gave a cry of astonishment took in his oars quickly and caught up the rifle what is it asked frank look look exclaimed the big yale man rising to his feet with the rifle in his hands there is a target for me they looked in the direction indicated and they saw something that at first seemed like a black rock but it moved it was swimming slowly along the surface of the water a whale by jove shouted merriwell let him have it bruce browning lifted the rifle and took careful aim crack he did not miss his mark the whale was seen to give a sudden start and then stung by the bullet the monster of the deep rushed straight at the boat look out hes coming my goodness not till he saw the whale start straight for the boat did bruce browning realize what a foolish thing he had done it seemed that the monster was bent on the destruction of the boat and its occupants merriwell uttered the first cry which was a warning to bruce who was still standing rifle in hand frank was going to use the oars and he knew he would throw bruce into the bottom of the boat by starting suddenly without warning the two girls uttered the other exclamations paula screamed and covered her face with her hands while inza turned pale and stared at the onrushing monster frank fully realized their peril he knew that it meant certain death to them all if the whale struck the boat and there seemed no possible escape bruce dropped down and frank gave a surge at the oars that made the boat give a leap like a thing of life then merriwell pulled as never before had he rowed not even in the nervestraining soulkilling college races against harvard jump jump jump how he made the boat leap through the water he was making the boat leap to get out of the whales course bruce tried to get his oars into the rowlocks and aid but for once in his life at least the big fellow had lost all his coolness and he lost an oar overboard hell strike us were lost hold fast frank continued to pull but he was ready to drop the oars and make a leap for inza the moment the boat was struck ill do my best to save her he mentally exclaimed still he knew the shock would hurl them far into the water while the boat would be shattered in pieces he might be stunned he might be instantly killed for all that inza stared straight at the whale it is probable that she realized their terrible peril far better than paula who was so frightened that she covered her eyes with her hands frank began to realize that there was a possibility of getting out of the way if the whale did not change its course he strained every nerve he pulled for life thank heaven browning gasped the words for the monster had not swerved from its original course and it dashed past the boat some distance astern even then frank was not satisfied that the danger was past he expected to see the whale stop turn about and rush at them again nothing of the kind happened the monster was headed straight for the distant passage that led out between the islands toward the lower bay and the open sea he seemed to be in a great hurry too for he made the water fly as he sped along the waves in his wake causing the little boat to rock when he had passed merriwell stopped pulling and sat watching the whale never uttering a word till it had passed out of sight far down the bay then he turned and observed its plain enough that he doesnt consider it healthy around here and he is in a hurry to get away there was a smile on his face and he seemed quite undisturbed by what had happened oh frank cried inza what if he had struck us he would have bumped his nose oh how can you joke now now is the time to joke i didnt have time to think of a joke a little while ago browning dug himself out of the bottom of the boat hoisted his huge body to a seat and drew a deep breath of relief a man who shoots at a whale with a rifle is a thundering fool he observed and a man who tells him to shoot is another laughed frank that is my first adventure with a whale said the big yale man and if i have my way about it it will be my last is is he really gone faltered paula looking around yes miss benjamin assured frank he has departed in the direction of greenland and he didnt touch the boat if he had wed be enjoying a swimming match for the yacht now if he had said inza some of us would have been killed right away and the rest of us would have been drowned lets go back to the yacht urged the trembling paula her voice choking i am quite ready said inza i dont care about going over to that island now so frank pulled back to the floating oar and then the boat was headed toward the white wings merriwell did his best to restore the girls spirits he joked and laughed and before the yacht was reached he had almost convinced them that they had been in no great danger but oh it gave me such a fright said paula just to see that huge creature coming through the water straight toward us it was awful frank was chosen as the one to relate the adventure to miss gale for the girls were aware that she might scold them for leaving the yacht without her consent and frank could make it all right with her hans was on deck but he had not seen their adventure with the whale although he had heard the report of the rifle for he cried as they approached vot you shooted i heard der gun ven id fired you off we shot a large seabird answered frank but the varmint got away from us vot kindt up a pird vos a varmint asked hans you dond remember dot i haf efer seen von do i it is large enough to make a fish chowder explained merry vot vos i gifin you cried hans who efer heart a pird uf dot could make a vishchowter i vos guyin you i oxpect browning threw him the painter as they came alongside and soon the girls were safely on the yacht come back as soon as you have fixed it with miss gale said bruce and we will go onto the island and investigate frank nodded and then went below in a few minutes he came out laughing and assured the girls that it was all right then he dropped into the boat again and soon he and browning were on devil island they pulled the boat up on the beach and made it fast frank took the rifle and bruce looked at his revolver which he had slipped into his pocket before leaving the yacht the first time the white wings was riding at anchor within easy speaking distance of the shore which way shall we go asked bruce the buildings are on the other side of the island said merry lets go straight across all right they found a path by which they could climb the bank making it plain that human beings had traveled on the island not a little at some time even if the place was deserted then following the path a short distance they came to three small camps built of logs the camps were not in a very pleasant location although it was a sheltered spot after looking around the huts a few minutes they turned from the path and struck straight up through the woods which were thick and dark beneath their feet twigs crackled and the dead leaves of a year before sometimes rustled where they had piled together but had not rotted the woods were dark and in places the ground was covered by moss so that their feet made not a sound higher and higher they climbed till they came out into a natural opening that was surrounded by the gloomy trees this seemed close to the highest ground on the island which could be seen rising rocky and bare through the trees at one side of the glade and in the midst of the glade was a grave that had not been made many months and a granite stone stood at the head its the grave the cockeyed man told us of exclaimed frank lets look at the stone they approached the grave and frank bent down to look at the stone as the cockeyed man had said on it were the words sacred to the memory of rawson denning as merry was looking at the headstone it seemed that a voice in the air above them hoarsely whispered dead and buried chapter xix in the dark woods eh gasped browning amazed what was that dead and buried again that mysterious awesome uncanny whisper that seemed to float in the air they looked around they looked upward they saw nothing but the blue sky above the leaves and somber trees that surrounded them dead and buried now it seemed to come from the ground seemed to issue from the grave before them it was as if the dead man hidden away down there had uttered the words frank merriwell shrugged his shoulders while his companion shivered and felt for his revolver a cold chill swept over the big yale man as if he felt the touch of a dead hand he was awed despite the fact that there was nothing superstitious in his character they listened expecting to hear the whispers again but there was such a silence in the woods as seemed to press down on them like a crushing weight not even a breath of a breeze reached the spot to rustle the trees and no sound of the surf chafing against the distant rocky shore reached their ears it seemed at that moment that they alone were the only human living creatures on that uncanny island a sense of desolation came upon them and made them feel as if they were far far from human beings buried as in the heart of a mighty desert they did not stir they stood there listening silence once far on a western desert browning had experienced the same feeling of loneliness but then there was not the grewsome ghostly fear that now clutched at his heart and chilled its beatings so it seemed to be struggling feebly like an imprisoned bird fluttering against the cruel bars of a cage the big fellow choked there seemed to be a lack of pure air for him to breathe he longed to cry out but his tongue lay stiff and paralyzed in his mouth then came the thought that some uncanny spell was being wrought about him and that soon he would be body and soul in the power of the evil spirit of the island with a mighty effort he moved he spoke he said come frank lets get away from here his voice was husky and hoarse so that he was startled by its sound merriwell glanced toward him lifting a hand with a gesture that warned to silence while he bent his head toward the grave and listened for some moments both stood still and again browning felt that strange spell stealing upon him as if hypnotic eyes were peering out from the shadows and looking down into his soul he shook himself he even looked around in search of those eyes but he saw nothing save the dark gloomy woods and the funereal shadows frank straightened up there was a queer look on his face did you hear it he asked in a whisper of course i heard it answered browning thinking he spoke of the whisper the words came to my ears distinctly no no i did not mean the whisper then what did you mean i heard no other sound it is strange for i fancied i heard it distinctly where did the sound come from without a word merriwell pointed downward toward the grave there was a look on his face that made his companion shiver bruce swallowed down the lump in his throat i am a fool he thought i am ashamed of such childish fears then he forced himself to distinctly ask what kind of a sound did you think you heard a rustle a movement it was as if the body down there had turned restlessly in its bed of earth never did bruce forget how those words sounded in the deep silence of the black woods never did he forget the sensation of unutterable horror that they brought with a shock to his soul he stared at frank his jaw dropping while awful thoughts ran riot in his brain they had heard the whispered words dead and buried which at first seemed to float in the air and then appeared to come up from the grave before them browning fancied the dead lips down there uttering those words he fancied the murdered man turning restlessly in his cold dark bed turning twisting unable to rest till he had been avenged what thoughts fled through frank merriwells brain surely he was besieged by uncanny fancies but never in all his life was he more on the alert the very air of mystery that surrounded him was a stimulant he had solved many mysteries and now he was determined to solve this one down the slope in the shadows of the dark woods below there was a rustling sound quick as a flash merriwell wheeled rifle in hand and bounded in that direction browning did not care to be left there alone beside that grave and he followed frank in a hurry he saw merry disappear amid the trees heard a sudden chattering and then there was a flash of fire and the clear report of a rifle frank had fired at something while he was on the run the big yale man crashed into the woods and came upon his friend who was stooping to pick up a dead squirrel i rather think this fellow made the rustling that seemed to come from the grave said merry i was deceived by my ears that is all as i ran in under the trees here i could not resist the temptation to take a shot at him for he was running too now he slowly added gazing sadly at the dead squirrel i wish i had not fired oh its nothing but a squirrel said bruce if i could make such a shot as that id be proud of it i am not proud only sorry said frank as he gently placed the squirrel on a soft bed of moss look at the little fellow bruce a few moments ago he was full of life happy and free now he is dead killed by a cruel brute of a man i didnt think id hit him but that is no excuse i ought not to have tried somewhere he has a home a nest a mate perhaps little ones hell never return to his soft nest never again will he scamper through the woods leaping from bough to bough playing hideandseek through the brush and the leaves he is dead and i killed him bruce this one thoughtless hasty act of mine lies like a sore weight on my conscience ill not forget it in a week it will trouble me it will haunt me franks voice was rather husky with emotion and his handsome face betrayed his deep feeling of sorrow and bruce browning who was not cruel or hardhearted but who would have killed a squirrel and never given it a second thought now began to realize that there might be something wrong in the act oh its nothing to make a fuss over he said quickly yes it is declared frank sincerely that little squirrel never harmed me but i murdered him he was one of gods creatures and i had no right to lift my hand against him i feel like a brute a wretch a murderer then frank knelt down on the moss beside the dead squirrel oh little squirrel he said his voice breaking into a sob how much i would give could i restore your life to you but i have killed you and all my regret and sorrow over the act will not bring you back to scamper and frolic through the woods to his astonishment bruce felt a misty blur come over his eyes and there was a choking sensation in his throat come away merry come and leave it he exclaimed thickly dont be a fool no said frank i cant leave him this way he took a handkerchief from his pocket and wrapped the squirrel in it doing so with such gentleness that bruce wondered more and more then he searched about till he found a thin flat rock that was about a foot long and four inches wide with that rock merriwell scooped a grave in the ground that grave he lined with soft bits of moss and then he took the squirrel wrapped in the handkerchief shroud and placed it in the grave the earth was thrown in on the little body and heaped up in a mound till it was a tiny model of the grave in the glade above then frank thrust the flat rock into the ground as a headstone and a tear dropped silently down browning had turned away the big fellow had been taught a lesson he would not soon forget and more than ever he admired and respected frank merriwell who could be as brave as a lion or as gentle as a dove come frank had arisen bruce followed him from the spot they did not climb the rise and again enter the glade that contained the mysterious grave but frank led the way down through the woods till they came out to the rocky shore of the island along which ran the path they had left some time before now they struck into this path and followed it round the island not a word passed between them till they came to the old granite quarry there on their right the bluff of rock rose nearly a hundred feet in the air with cedars growing away up on the heights there were drill marks on the face of the rock a weedgrown railroad ran into the quarry and on the track sat a flat car loaded with granite by jingoes exclaimed browning its plain enough there was some business done here some time frank looked at the face of the broad wall of granite i wonder why they ceased quarrying it he speculated i suppose the fishermen would say it was because the island was haunted more likely because the granite was not of the best quality now that stone does not look to me as if it is first class it seems to me it is poor granite and that is why the quarry was abandoned guess you are right nodded bruce they walked along the track which led out of the quarry and down toward some sagging sheds in which they could see other flat cars when the sheds were reached they turned to the right and saw at a distance a house beyond the house was a large square building with many windows not far from the car sheds was an old wharf there is the house where the boss must have lived said merry and beyond it is the boarding house for the laborers lets go look them over said bruce who seemed remarkably energetic for him so they walked over to the house it was securely locked and the windows were fastened down near the house was a well from which they drew water and took a drink from an old dipper that hung on a rusty nail driven into the curb from the house a path led down toward the boarding house they walked down there and could look down into a beautiful little cove close at hand why didnt we run in there and anchor instead of anchoring away round back of the island said bruce simply because no one mentioned this cove and i did hear bold island harbor mentioned answered frank in the distance they could see three or four white sails far away beyond a group of islands rose a trail of smoke that told some small steamer was passing a gull was circling over the cove and a black crow cawed dismally from the top branch of a tall spruce for all that the sun was in the sky there was something oppressively lonely and deserted about devil island lets try the doors here suggested bruce the front door was fastened but they found a back door that they were able to force open as the nails that held it had rusted in the rotten wood till they readily bent before the pressure i dont know as we have any right to go in here said frank nonsense exclaimed bruce the place is deserted somebody owns it according to the yarns of the fishermen it is owned by a monster with blazing face and black holes for eyes none of them told of seeing the monster anywhere around this building he was seen in the woods or on the other side of the island i think well see him here just as quick as anywhere grinned bruce who had thrown off the uncanny feeling that had possessed him as they stood beside the grave in the woods those stories were not told for nothing declared frank why were they told i dont know not yet but you have an idea yes what is it i rather fancy somebody wishes to keep people away from this island for some reason i thought the same thing what that reason can be i do not know but frank said bruce hesitatingly you heard something as we stood beside that grave up there in the woods yes a whisper sure what did it say dead and buried then it was not imagination for we both heard the same thing now how do you explain that somebody whispered the words where was that somebody you know just as well as i do but those words were whispered for our ears to hear we heard them i do not believe in ghosts any more than you do merriwell but i will admit that there was a mighty queer feeling came over me as we stood there near that grave i felt it confessed frank had i believed in ghosts i should have been badly frightened well lets look this building over we may find something in here so they began to explore the old boarding house it was a large building and they climbed the stairs to the second story where none of the windows were boarded up up there were the rooms where the laborers had slept they looked through them all but found nothing of interest at last they stopped by a window and looked out upon the water by jove exclaimed merriwell look down there what is it a boat where beyond the land at the other side of the cove its laying close in to shore see the mast yes i see it now why it almost seems aground wonder what its there for whoever was in the boat has come ashore on the island then why didnt he run into the cove down here because the boat would be seen in the cove and where it lays it is not liable to be seen from the island why should anybody wish to come onto the island here and not be seen i dont know but ill wager something that that is the lapstreak sailboat belonging to our friend the cockeyed man if i am right he is somewhere on this island he warned us not to come here yes he told us what happened to the boston man who came here it was plain to me that he wanted us to keep away he ran down ahead of us and he is on the island why should he care to frighten us away why should he hurry to get here ahead of us i tell you old man this is a mystery worth solving bruce grunted he felt that merriwell was right but he realized it might not be an easy thing to solve the mystery of the island the big yale man stood looking out of the window and watching the boat while frank continued his investigations merriwell wandered from room to room and at last descended the stairs again if he gets an idea that there is really a wonderful mystery here muttered bruce he will stay till he has solved it if he spends the remainder of the summer in this vicinity never saw a fellow who took such an interest in anything mysterious the wind was rising again it rattled a window and somewhere about the building it made a loose board clap clap clap in a way that made browning think of clods falling on a coffin all at once somewhere down below in the old building a shriek rang out startling shrill wild and awful it froze the blood in brownings veins and seemed to cause his hair to stand upon his head following the shriek came silence chapter xx frank sees the monster instantly browning thought how the fisherman had told of the awful screams that came from the lips of the monster of the island had that monster uttered this cry where was merriwell frank browning shouted the name of his friend and the empty rooms echoed with the sound frank merriwell from room to room rushed the big fellow there was no answer to his cries quickly satisfying himself that merriwell was nowhere in the upper story of the boarding house bruce bounded down the stairs four at a time frank where are you no sound save his own voice and the echoes a sickening sensation seized upon browning he began to feel that a calamity a tragedy had taken place from room to room he rushed but he saw nothing of the one he sought was it possible frank had left the building without saying anything to him he could not think so all at once he stood before an open door and he dimly saw a flight of stairs leading downward into the darkness a cold dank smell came up from the depths below browning quickly decided that there must be some sort of a cellar or basement down there the door was open frank had gone down to investigate but the cry that had rung through the building what had happened below for a moment bruce hesitated then he quickly felt in his pocket and drew forth a match safe a moment later with lighted match in his fingers he was descending the stairs into the dank and moldy basement at the bottom of the stairs was another door it was open bruce stepped through it and stumbled over something dropping his match so that he was in the densest darkness at that moment the wild shriek rang out again so near that it seemed uttered in his very ear he had his revolver in his hand and he whirled his heart having sprung into his mouth ready to use the weapon in the darkness he saw nothing bruce was shaking as he crouched there he heard his teeth rattle together and he realized that he was completely unnerved he was tempted to leap up and bound up the stairs indeed the desire to do so was almost irresistible he listened thinking he might hear something like a moving person but after that bloodchilling scream there was no other sound at last he put out his hand and touched the object over which he had fallen that it was a human body he instantly realized the thought that frank merriwell lay there dead in the darkness nearly overcame him he feared to light another match that touch had told him that the body was not that of a person stiff and cold as it must be had it lain there some time it was still warm as if with life but still how still brownings fingers shook as he got out a match he prayed that he might not look on the face of his dead friend the horrible fear of what he might see completely unmanned him scratch splutter flare he lighted the match and it blazed up at once its light showed him the sight he had dreaded to behold frank merriwell lay before him his face ghastly pale his eyes closed the match dropped from the nerveless fingers of the big yale man and went out a low groan escaped his lips then came the thought that merriwell might not be dead quickly he caught up the body flung it over his shoulders and then he literally leaped up the creaking stairs bruce did not pause till he had carried frank outside the building then he took a look at merrys pale face saw blood trickling down out of his hair and rushed with him to the well near the house placing frank on the ground the big fellow fell to bathing his head upon which was a slight wound that cut through the scalp it was not twenty seconds before frank opened his eyes bruce gave an exclamation of joy by heaven i thought you were dead he cried merriwell looked dazed for a moment and then murmured i saw it eh saw what the monster what you did sure where down in the basement of the boarding house yes what did it look like just as described fiery face and hands yes black holes for eyes yes browning gasped what did it do shrieked i heard it and then it seemed that the whole building fell on me there was a bright glare of light and the next i knew was when i opened my eyes just now something struck you down i think you are right know i am i found you down there in the basement brought you out oh but i did think you were dead when i first saw your white face by the light of the match i held i havent recovered from the shock of it yet it was awful in a few moments frank was able to sit up the cut on his head was not serious but his head was throbbing with a shooting pain and he was dizzy and weak well ive seen the monster all right he said with a grim smile theres some satisfaction in that and i have heard it put in bruce i dont know that i care about seeing the thing it did look something like the old boy himself said frank dont wonder these fishermen are scared by it well i suppose you are satisfied now oh no no what will you do oh id like to know what the monster is made of this investigating seems to be rather dangerous and that makes it all the more fascinating however i think it will be well enough to give it a rest for the present well go back to the yacht yes and have some dinner after dinner we can take another whirl at the monster we must not stay away too long this time or the people on the yacht will worry about us what shall we tell them nothing it will not do to tell of this adventure but this handkerchief about your head said bruce who was tying it in place how will you explain that fell and struck my head i did fall you know and my head must have struck the ground down there in that basement we mustnt let them press us too closely if they get inquisitive we must change the subject thus it was arranged when frank first arose to his feet he was so weak that he found it necessary to lean on the arm of his companion but his strength came to him swiftly so that he was like himself before he had returned more than a third of the way to the white wings then of a sudden he remembered that he had dropped his rifle when he was struck down in the basement and he wanted to return for it at once bruce objected at first but frank was determined and he finally won they retraced their steps and boldly entered the building bruce followed merriwell down the stairs into the basement holding his revolver ready for use while frank lighted matches then they searched for the rifle which frank knew he held in his hand at the moment when he was struck down they could not find it for it was not in the basement nor was it anywhere in the building the boys quickly decided that the rifle had been removed by human hands but the mystery was just as deep leaving the building they did not immediately return to the white wings but made their way past the little cove through the stunted cedars and over the rocks to a position where they could look down upon the boat that was lying close to the island shore as frank had surmised it was the lapstreak sailboat belonging to the cockeyed man there was no one in or around it bruce said merry i have a proposal to make make it grunted browning i have an idea that the person who owns that boat is concerned in the mysterious doings on this island well i am going to watch for him when now you mean that you are not going back to the yacht not right away then i shall stay with you that will interfere with my plan how if we stay away from the yacht very long it is certain to alarm the girls it might i want you to go back and tell them i have discovered signs of game here and have stayed to see if i cant bag it you need not say what sort of game then i want you to get hodge and bring him with you taking three of the guns and sufficient ammunition as you will be going out for game that will create no alarm leave diamond and dunnerwust to guard the girls and miss gale i will remain here till you return and you might bring me something for lunch tell them it is likely to take some time to bag our game and caution them not to be alarmed if we do not return before nightfall but i dont like the idea of leaving you here alone protested the big yale man there is no telling what may happen frank laughed softly dont worry about me he said i shall not venture into the old boarding house alone and it is not likely ill not be able to defend myself here on open ground bruce hesitated how are you feeling now he asked all right strong as ever that crack on the head oh i am all over that now go on old man and dont worry about me you know that as a rule frank merriwell is able to take care of himself that is a fact nodded browning but you are not armed here you must take this revolver he held the weapon out to merry but then you will not have a weapon i am all right declared bruce i can handle two or three ordinary fellows without a gun fully aware of the giants extraordinary strength frank knew he spoke the truth and so he accepted the revolver now i have an idea said merriwell that you had better not return to the yacht by the path why not it is likely that path is watched and it may be well enough not to let the watchers know one of us has remained here if they think we are gone they may betray themselves by their movements how am i to go back then go round the island the other way you can keep in this fringe of woods the most of the time so that you will not be seen it may be a bit harder traveling but i fancy it is the best thing to do all right take care of yourself merriwell keep your eyes open and do not get another crack on the head dont worry about that take your time so bruce started off leaving frank there where he could watch the boat not until browning had disappeared and frank was quite alone did he realize the loneliness of the place the water washing against the rocky shore made the only sound to be heard unless it was the occasional cry of a wheeling gull the tide was going out and already the black ledges were rising out of the water in the distance those were called halftide ledges by the fishermen there were other black rocks which rose barren and bleak above the highest tides near those ledges at certain seasons of the year sportsmen set their tollers or decoys and crouching in nooks of the rocks fired hundreds of shots at the sea birds lured to their doom by the wooden representations of their mates merriwell found a place where he could sit in a sheltered spot and watch the sailboat at the same time having a good view of the bay and the islands and ledges as he sat there frank meditated on the mystery of the island he was fully convinced that there was some reason why certain human beings desired to frighten all others away from the place that the man from boston had been murdered and buried on that island was quite probable perhaps he had been murdered for booty perhaps he had discovered the secret of the island and his death had been accomplished in order to seal his lips in the latter case there must be some powerful reason why the desperadoes who slew him did not wish the secret revealed to the world these thoughts led merry to the conclusion that some criminal business was carried on upon that island he was well aware that he was taking desperate chances in trying to find out what sort of business it was but the mystery lured him on and the very fact that there was danger lent a fascination to the adventure how long he sat there thinking thus he did not know but at last he was startled by a sound near at hand he turned quickly and what he saw brought him to his feet with a bound peering from the bushes was the most horrible face he had ever looked upon it was twisted and contorted in a frightful manner the lips were drawn back from long yellow fangs the eyes seemed to glare like coals of fire and about these frightful features tumbled a mass of tangled hair the monster that thought flashed into franks mind he had no doubt but he was face to face with the creature that had frightened the simple fishermen from the island for some moments frank stood there staring at that horrible face then a clawlike hand came out through the bushes and seemed to reach toward him while a howl that was bloodcurdling came from the creatures lips that sound was the same that had frightened the fishermen into running for their lives but instead of running frank made a dash for the creature brownings revolver grasped in his hand it was a most astonishing move on the part of the boy for a moment the monster of the island remained motionless and then that horrible face disappeared with a leap frank plunged straight into the bushes ready to grapple with the thing he found nothing it had vanished swaying bushes close at hand guided him and he scarcely paused an instant straight forward he rushed ready for the encounter at any instant he caught a glimpse of something plunging through the bushes and he followed fearlessly a moment later he came out to open ground and ahead of him he saw a misshapen figure running with wonderful speed toward the head of the cove perhaps for the first time since the creature had been seen on the island the order of things had changed and it was the pursued instead of the pursuer stop shouted frank the monster looked back over a twisted shoulder and snarled like a wild animal but ran faster than ever stop or i shall shoot frank flourished the revolver running as hard as he could in pursuit the command was not obeyed in an attempt to frighten the creature into obeying frank fired two shots into the air still the thing ran on well i see i must catch him muttered merriwell he set his teeth and made wonderful speed over the uneven ground never in any college sprinting match had he made such speed he was determined to overtake that hideous thing and solve the mystery of the island frank soon saw he was gaining the creature looked back and saw the same whereupon it seemed to increase its efforts but although the monster was a swift runner it could not get away from merriwell the cove was passed and the race continued up the rise toward the big building above frank was drawing nearer and nearer he reached out a hand to grasp the shoulder of the hunchback for there was a large hump on the back of the fugitive at that moment the panting thing whirled and grappled with him suddenly frank was taken by surprise by the movement and in a twinkling he was flung to his knees the monster snarled with satisfaction and sought to clutch his throat with those clawlike hands summoning all his strength merriwell fought his way to his feet and obtained a better hold on the thing keeping those twisted fingers away from his throat then there was a fierce struggle for the mastery during that struggle the tushes in the mouth of the being with whom frank was battling suddenly fell out and dropped to the ground they were false teeth made to look as hideous as possible and now merry could see that the mans face was made up to appear twisted and deformed and a moment after the teeth fell out the shaggy wig of tangled hair was torn away showing that also was false and a part of the makeup now merriwell recognized the man before him it was the hunchback of greens landing put wiley really mr wiley this is quite a surprise exclaimed frank triumphantly you had a splendid makeup but the cat is out of the bag now curse ye grated the hunchback youll pay for this with your life oh i dont know i do wileys voice did not utter these two words they were spoken by another person and frank was clutched from behind strong hands closed about his neck and hard fingers crushed into his windpipe so that his breath was shut off in a moment frank could not withstand this onset he was forced to his knees being unable to breathe he tried to tear those crushing fingers away but the effort was in vain he had dropped the revolver and it was beyond his reach he knew at that moment that he was in the clutch of the ruffians who had murdered the man from boston and he had no doubt but a like fate was meant for him still he was powerless to save himself for he was given no show things turned black and began to whirl around him bombs seemed bursting in his head bells were ringing in his ears and then nothingness when frank recovered consciousness he felt as if his windpipe had been crushed and he seemed numb and helpless in every limb he realized immediately that he was being roughly handled and he heard a harsh voice say thats all right he cant git erway we cant waste any more time he opened his eyes and looked up into the face of the speaker the cockeyed man put wiley the hunchback was there too hello growled the man with the crooked eye hes come round im glad on it fer i want him ter know jest what his nosin foolishness has done fer him frank tried to speak but he could not utter more than a wheezing whisper the hunchback raised a foot as if to bring it down on the face of the helpless lad for frank was bound hands and feet but the other man thrust him aside growling whuts the use hell be dead in five minutes dont kick ther poor fool then frank realized that he was bound across the track of the old railroad that ran from the sheds to the quarry the look that came to the face of the helpless lad seemed to tell the cockeyed man that he understood the situation youve made a fool of yerself declared the man unpityingly you was too nosy inquisitive critters alwus git inter trouble the boston man was too fresh and hes planted you saw his grave strangely enough at that moment the helpless boy asked a queer question where were you when you made that ghostly whisper he managed to huskily inquire i dunno what good itll do to ye ter know was the answer youll be dead right away mebbe one of us was hid in a holler tree near ye what do you mean to do with me waal weve tied ye here acrost ther rails up there in the quarry is a car loaded with granite it wont take much ter send it scootin down the track and it will cut you clean in two youll have time enough to think whut a fool ye was and say yer prayers while we are startin ther car but youd better begin now goodby then the two murderous wretches hurried up the track and quickly disappeared frank tried to cry for aid but he could not make a sound that could be heard ten rods away he twisted and squirmed in a vain effort to free himself and then he fell to listening listening listening it was not long before he heard the sound which he dreaded there was a distant rumble a faint jarring of the rails the car had started down the incline god help me the rumbling sound grew louder and louder the car was gathering speed as it came on frank frank merriwell he heard browning call near at hand and now he made a mighty effort and answered here quick help the big yale man came rushing to the track followed by hodge just as the car loaded with granite came into view instantly bruce realized the peril of the lad who was bound to the rails and he saw there was no time to cut the ropes and set frank free with a hoarse shout he leaped forward catching up a stout stick of timber in an instant one end of the timber he thrust under the rails of the track and then he lifted on the other end with all his wonderful strength the track was old the ties were rotten and the spikes gave way the rail was pried aside in a moment then bruce went at the other and tore that up the car was upon him he made a great leap backward and got off the track barely in time then an instant later the car loaded with granite left the rails and shot down the bank spilling the slabs of rock and plunged with a splash into the water disappearing from view frank was saved it was an hour later when merriwell browning and hodge returned to the white wings with the exception of a slight hoarseness frank could speak as well as ever although his throat was sore and lame the boys had not returned to the yacht till they were certain the hunchback and the cockeyed man had left the island for the lapstreak boat was seen bound up the bay under full sail browning was fierce for revenge merriwell did not say much but deep down in his heart he was determined to punish the ruffians who had so nearly ended his existence he cautioned the boys not to let the girls or miss gale know anything of the adventures on the island we will land them at greens landing he said and then i am coming back to this island the mystery of this place is not yet solved why are those two men trying to frighten everybody away from here i want to know that and i mean to know it on reaching the yacht jack diamond was found paying every attention to paula benjamin and it was plain that there was no longer a misunderstanding between them the virginian shot browning a glance of triumph in which was also a warning but bruce scarce gave jack or paula a thought for other matters were on his mind then he was eager and anxious to get rid of the girls and their chaperon in order that the party might return to devil island and seek to solve the deep mystery of the place and punish the wretches who had tried to end franks life chapter xxi settling a point now fellows said frank merriwell as he faced his four shipmates in the cabin of his yacht white wings which was riding at anchor in the harbor at greens landing i have called you together for a council of war im tired grunted bruce browning cant i rest in my bunk while the powwow is going on no came firmly from frank this is a matter of business and it wont hurt you to sit up a while oh get a brace on exclaimed diamond flinging the words at the big yale man act as if you had some life in you old fellow the manner in which the words were spoken made the usually polite virginian seem quite unlike himself but bruce simply grinned observing you shouldnt hold a grudge because i flirted a little with miss benjamin diamond you got a lead on me while merriwell and i were investigating on devil island and won her back all right dont be sour over it the southerner sprang up his eyes flashing mr browning he said hotly i warn you not to speak lightly of miss benjamin you seem to take delight in mentioning her in connection with every little occurrence and it is getting tiresome there is a limit huah grunted the giant touchy mighty touchy first thing i know hell be challenging me to a duel it would be useless to challenge you flashed jack you northerners are too cold blooded to fight well now this will do cut in merry promptly rising to his feet i wont have it on board my yacht then i suppose we can go on shore and fight it out said jack sourly if you want to make fools of yourselves yes you are very plain spoken mr merriwell it is necessary at times diamond hold your temper in check old man and dont talk about northerners and southerners there is no north no south the time is past when you came to yale you were full of freakish notions about the north and the south but i fancied you had been pretty well cured of that i see it will crop out occasionally though to this diamond made no retort but he looked thoroughly angry with another fellow frank would have laughed him out of the mood but he knew it would not do to try that on the virginian for jack could not endure a bit of ridicule however merry talked quietly and soon he could see he was pouring oil on the troubled waters for the look of anger was leaving diamonds face and browning had assumed a lounging attitude this is no time for hard feelings between any of us said frank as i said a few minutes ago i have called you together for a council of war vot did i mean ven you said dot asked hans dunnerwust berhaps you dond understood me as vell as i might vot for haf dot gouncil uf var peen caldt yes said bart hodge just what are you driving at merriwell fellows we have struck a mystery i thought you had solved the mystery of the monster of devil island i solved the mystery of the monsters identity and discovered the creature was the hunchback put wiley in disguise but he came near ending your career with the aid of the cockeyed man whose name i have learned since returning to greens landing is dan hicks i could have handled wiley alone but hicks came to his aid and caught me by the throat grasping me from behind together they knocked me out and tied me to the old railroad on the island but for brownings wonderful efforts in ripping up the rails they would have succeeded in their attempt to send a flat car loaded with granite down the track and i must have been cut in two i tell you fellows it was a wonderful sight to see bruce pry up those rails and send that car granite and all into the water ah browning exclaimed merriwell his voice betraying his feeling despite his effort to keep it under control it prolonged my life when you were born strong oh it wasnt much work to rip up those rails said the big fellow with an air of modesty you see the spikes that held them were planted in rotten wood for the ties are very old you never moved half as fast before in your life browning said hodge you did get a hustle on then i had to grunted bruce saw there wasnt any time to loaf you saved my life declared frank the identity of the monster is solved but the mystery of the island is as deep as ever shust vot do i mean ven you said dot asked hans why should the hunchback rig himself up in that horrible manner and try to frighten persons away from the island there is a mystery confessed diamond certainly it is nodded merriwell discovering the identity of the monster has not seemed to clear things up much it has added to my curiosity berhaps id peen a healthy thing to stayed avay dot islands from observed hans sagely whatever the secret of the island may be said frank those men are ready to commit murder in order to guard it they came near succeeding said hodge it looks as if they have succeeded eh how you remember the story of the boston man who was landed on the island and never seen afterward the cockeyed man told that story yes perhaps that was a part of his plan to scare us away from the island to keep us from going there perhaps so but you remember he told us there was a grave on the island and the headstone was marked sacred to the memory of rawson denning yes more of his plan to scare us away the grave is there what sure you you found it bruce was with me we came out into a dismal glade in the heart of the black woods and there was the grave and the headstone with the words upon it jingoes hodge stared at frank a few moments and then asked do you really believe the boston man was murdered and buried in that grave rawson was the name he gave and the grave was found on the island after his strange disappearance it seems probable enough that he is planted there by chorch exclaimed the dutch boy turning pale i dond vant to monkey aroundt dot island all alone by yourself do you have any idea what the mystery of the island can be merriwell asked hodge eagerly of course i do not know any better than yourself but i have a suspicion what do you think yaw cried hans vat do i think i believe some kind of unlawful business is carried on there and for that reason the criminals are using every means to frighten away anybody who might prove troublesome or inquisitive then will it pay us to be troublesome and inquisitive said diamond that is the very matter we are here to discuss the girls and miss gale are comfortably located here at greens landing and they will be able to amuse themselves for a day or two if we wish we can run down to devil island every morning and return here every night i am willing to confess that my curiosity is aroused and i would give something to solve the mystery of the place but i do not wish to drag any of my friends into danger where they do not wish to go i hardly think there is one in this party who will not stand by you wherever you go merriwell said bart quickly you can count on me i knew it and me grunted browning i thought so und i vos anodder exclaimed hans that is good dont think for a moment that i will go back on you said diamond i started on this cruise with the intention of staying with you and i shall good that part of it is settled i have said that the mystery of that island belongs to me and i will solve it i mean to keep my word vale said hans i never knowed yourseluf ven you didnd keep your vord vrankie but maype you dond vant to took some more chances uf peing runned ofer a railroat on hardly we have a fair breeze shall we run down to the island this forenoon come on said diamond suddenly if we have a mystery to solve the sooner we get after it the better there was a thump against the side of the yacht and a voice called ahoy on board there i want to see the captain of this craft chapter xxii the man in gray when frank reached the deck he saw a jollylooking little man in gray clothes coming over the rail beside the yacht lay a dory in which sat a fisherman who had rowed the old man off to the white wings dang a dory exclaimed the little man in gray with a chuckle she may be all right to row round in on a troubled sea but shell tip quickern scat if you step up on the side of her this one near spilt me into the drink after i was alongside here what i want is a flatbottomed scow or raft i hope this yacht is good and steady for im going to take a cruise in her you are gasped frank smiling well that is cool of course nodded the little man brightly everything around me is cool even to my name and that is cooler caleb cooler i like your nerve i thought you would though i have seen people who didnt like it some folks are fussy here my man turning to the boatman here is the fifty cents i promised you if you would set me on board here i shant want you any more you may go hold on came firmly from frank who also spoke to the man in the dory i think mr cooler is mistaken he will want you to take him ashore again oh no no indeed chuckled mr cooler pleasantly you are quite wrong young man i am going to devil island with you the the dickens you are exclaimed frank he came near using another word in the place of dickens for now he was literally astounded oh yes nodded the queer old man still laughing i wont be a bit of bother in fact you will find me mighty jolly company tickle me gently and i am more fun than a variety show i have been paid in my day to travel around with folks just to amuse them im sure death to the blues and i am better than all the doctors medicine you ever took well i havent the blues and i am not in need of medicine say you so youre in luck you do look cheerful and healthy thats a fact but i have some curiosity glad to know you are troubled by something yes i am curious to know how you happened to come aboard this yacht in order to get to devil island why arent you going there perhaps so but how do you know it feller told me so when little while ago where up at jobbins store what kind of a fellow how did he look looked as if some chap had swatted him with a brick right on the bridge of his proboscis for it had a strong list to starboard and one of his eyes was keeping watch at the end of it while the other eye was on guard to see that no more bricks were coming in that direction the man with the cockeye exclaimed merriwell sure as you live cried hodge who had followed frank to the deck its hicks so that scoundrel has dared venture into greens landing so soon said frank grimly and he knows he did not succeed in his foul attempt to murder me eh exclaimed the little man in surprise whats that murder did he never mind interrupted frank eying the man in gray as if seeking to read his thoughts i have a little affair to settle with mr hicks and the worst recommendation you could have is the fact that he sent you here he simply surmised that i contemplated returning to devil island but dont you that is my affair mr cooler in no case do i propose to carry passengers i am not passengers i am simply a passenger i wont bother you a bit even if you are not going to the island ill pay you to land me there you seem very anxious to reach the place i am i am in a bigger hurry than a dog with a package of firecrackers tied to his tail its a matter of business no time is to be lost you will have to seek another mode of conveyance what now you are not in earnest ha ha he he i see that you are something of a joker its all right all right i tumble to your game and i think i tumble to your game mr cooler said merry sternly you can have the information you want the information repeated the queer old man in apparent consternation why it cant be that you are connected with the eastern bay land syndicate i do not know anything about the eastern bay land syndicate what a relief sighed mr cooler really you gave me quite a start but i am ahead of them if the island is as represented i will secure it this part of the bay is bound to become famous with summer people i do not know what you are trying to give me but i tell you i am onto your little game go back to mr dave hicks and tell him i am going to devil island i have met him there once tell him i shall be pleased to meet him there again but i do not want to go back to mr hicks protested the little man i want to go to devil island with you you cant go i must young man i will pay you any i do not want your pay you came aboard by that boat get into it and return ashore if you are so anxious to get to devil island you will find plenty of fishermen who will set you on there if you pay them for it you are wrong all the fishermen seem afraid to go near it i tried several of them this morning and then the man with the broken nose and the bent eye told me you were going down that way that is why i am here the little man in gray seemed very much in earnest now but frank had made up his mind and was not to be turned get into that boat sir he commanded we cant take you to devil island youll have to said mr cooler stubbornly i am here and i am going with you i rather think not drawled bruce browning who had been brought to the deck at last by the sound of talk the big fellow picked the little man up by the collar carried him to the rail and dropped him into the dory saying to the boatman take him ashore immediately or he will have to swim ashore for i shall throw him overboard if he boards the white wings again the queer little man in gray looked astounded and then amused he reached up and pulled his coat collar round into place and stared at bruce beginning to chuckle as if the whole thing was a very entertaining joke he he he laughed excuse me cant help it very funny you chaps act like you thought id bite i wont bite never bit a man in all my life however i see you are determined to go away without me and ill not try to force myself upon you if there is anything i detest it is a man who makes himself obnoxious by forcing himself on others he he ha ha laughed hans i vos der funniest man you efer seen aind id vale vale vale der next dime you come aproad der vite vings you hat petter stayed ashore now that is more than i can stand cried the little man trying to look fierce no irishman can talk to me like that vat shouted hans who vos i callin an irishman you petter peen gareful ur you vill got me indo drouple i vant you to understood i nefer peen an irishman in mein life i dont wonder you deny your nationality said mr cooler but you cannot deceive anyone that mug and that brogue will betray anywhere that you are irish to the bone hans began to jump up and down excitedly shaking his fist at the little man you shust safed my life py geddin off this yotch vrom he yelled i murdered der last man vat caldt you irish uf i efer seen you again you vill punch mein face off und dond you vorgot id oh keep cool patsey advised the man in gray now a wild howl issued from dunnerwusts throat and he rushed to the rail leaning over to shake

someding to murter him mit shrieked hans like a maniac gif me a gun i vill shot him on der spot or somevere near id gif me a gun then he made a wild rush for the cabin still howling for a gun and fell with a great clatter down the companion way take my advice mr cooler said frank who was laughing now get as far away from this yacht as possible before hans comes on deck again he has gone for a gun and there are several below all of them loaded as i do not care to be filled full of lead i will take your advice said the man in gray calmly irishmen are very quicktempered and i see i have ruffled this one somewhat however he proved very amusing for a short time goodday mr merriwell i hope to see you later in fact i think i shall bill you may set me ashore bill the boatman was somewhat nervous and he rowed away from the yacht as hastily as possible the dory was not many lengths away before hans came howling to the deck wildly flourishing one of merrys shotguns shown me to him yelled hans almost frothing at the mouth vere vos der man vot caldt you an irishmans he vill shoot me in a minute uf i see heem vere he vos then as he saw the dory pulling away he rushed to the side of the yacht and prepared to shoot but frank seized him and took the gun away in a twinkling saying sternly are you crazy hans do you want to be hanged for murder i never saw you this way before dot man caldt me an irishmans well he caldt me batsey a very natural mistake considering that you have a face that is strongly irish in its general appearance and you have associated with barney mulloy so much that you have acquired his brogue hans gasped and staggered vot do you hear he faintly said uf dot peen a fact i vos retty to shuffle off der mortal pucket und kick der coil i dond vant to lif no longer ven i got to lookin an irishman like und dalkin so i mistook volks for von my heart vos proken then sobbing violently he again staggered toward the cabin and once more fell down the companion way laughing heartily frank followed him and found hans lying where he had fallen below are you hurt asked merry anxiously yaw sobbed hans bad yaw where all ofer cant you get up i dont vant to got ub i vant to die id vos my heart dot vos hurt oh shust to vancy dot my vace looks like an irishmans mein gott id vos awful perhaps you can have your face changed so do not take it so much to heart now you peen shoking no in new york there is a man who advertises to make over faces to change them completely it is possible that he might be able to remove the irish look from your face hans sat up py chorch he cried uf dot peen a vact i vos goin to had a new vace shust as soon as you can id peen der only thing vot vill kept me a brison oudt uf i shall murder der next man dot caldt me irish well you can have your face built over when you get back to new york so dont take it so much to heart hans got up after a while and dragged himself to a seat while frank replaced the gun in the strap from which the dutch lad had taken it browning came loafing down into the cabin followed by hodge what do you make of that queer little man merriwell asked bruce flinging himself down lazily i sized him up as a spy said frank he was sent off to find out if we intended to return to devil island he found out he certainly is an odd character as queer as anything i have seen down this way somehow he did not seem like a native no native to him said bart as if that point was settled in his mind he did have a crust said bruce a crust cried frank laughing as he remembered what had taken place why i never saw anything like it came on board and calmly informed me he was going to devil island with us and he would not think of leaving when i told him we did not want him and he was not even ruffled when i dropped him over into the dory he is well named for a cooler customer i never saw and he said he would see you again merry i noticed that but he didnt seem much of a desperado yawned bruce appearances are deceptive yaw muttered hans don peen a vact somepody took me an irishman vor dot vos der plow dot gif me der lifer gomblaint mit my heart in i dont suppose merry said bart that you will defer your visit to devil island because of what lately happened i should say not exclaimed frank i am beginning to get warmed up if they but knew it somebody is doing the very things to spur me on to solve the mystery hadnt we better leave diamond here at the landing to look after the girls said bruce its plain he does not wish to waste the time to go down to devil island it is plain you do not know anything about it sir said jack sharply as he stepped into the cabin i am ready to go and the sooner we start the better i shall like it if we are to investigate i am in favor of getting at the investigation without delay we will get away as soon as possible said frank all hands on deck in a very short time the white wings was running out of the harbor headed for devil island from the shore more than one pair of eyes were watching her with looks that boded no good to her inquisitive and daring owner chapter xxiii the clambake as bold island harbor was sheltered and the yacht could lay close in to the shore of devil island and be so hidden that she would escape observation to a large extent frank ran in there choosing that anchorage in preference to the one in the cove on the other side of the island of mystery it was near low tide when merry ran in there and he did not stop till the keel of the white wings stuck fast in the mud at the bottom i thought you were getting in too near said hodge not getting in near enough to suit me declared frank the bottom is soft here and the yacht would sit up straight in the mud if the tide ran out so that she was left high and dry it is low water now at high water she will float all right and have any amount of water under her keel as soon as everything was attended to on the yacht frank cried come on fellows lets row over to bold island and see if we can find some of her famous clams we may not get another opportunity like this oh whats the use yawned browning sleepily too much trouble im going below and turn in i will stay to look after the yacht while browning gets his nap said hodge diamond was ready to go with frank and merry asked hans to come along they had purchased a clam hoe at the landing so they were prepared to hunt the shy and retiring clam vale said hans sadly i vill go mit you poys but i dond peen aple to took no bleasure mit der shob since i vos caldt an irishman i dond pelief you vill efer got ofer dot he looked very sad and downcast as if he were nearly heartbroken causing merry to laugh softly the three got into the boat and pulled over to bold island where they began searching for the clams that have made the island famous throughout penobscot bay it was some time before they could find any clams for the beach had been dug over and over till it did not seem there was a place left untouched at last frank turned over a large flat rock and down in the sand beneath it they struck their first clam that clam measured in its shell was exactly seven inches long and a little more than five inches wide while the shell itself was almost as white as the shell of an egg when merry turned up this clam hans staggered and sat down on the sand with great violence and there he sat staring and muttering vot der tyrful vos dot uf dot dond peen der varter uf all glams you vos a liar i dond pelief i efer seen anyding like dot pefore in all your porn tays hurrah cried merry heres proof the fishermen down this way are not all liars or do not lie about everything they told me this was the kind of game we should find here but this must be unusual said diamond cant all of them be like this they say so well they cannot be very good to eat they must be too tough on the contrary i have heard they are splendid eating here is another by jove its fully as large as the first hans sat still on the sand and stared straight at the first clam turned out frank looked at him and saw the dutch boy appeared on the verge of bursting into tears whats the matter dunnerwust he asked i vos peginnin to seen things queer replied hans vot do i think vale uf dot glam dond look like der mug an irishman of you vos a liar uf i kept on seein things like dot to remindt me vot dot man in gray said id vill drife me to trink ur to sluicide they had brought along a bucket and it did not take long to fill it with these large clams then they emptied it into the bottom of the boat and found another bucketful before stopping with those they returned to the boat we will go ashore on devil island where there are plenty of rocks of all kinds and seaweed and there well have a clambake said merry there is wood enough on devil island too and it is nearer to the yacht the sound of their oars brought hodge on deck what luck he asked as they approached great luck answered frank get in and we will take you ashore over yonder where we are going to have a clam roast the clam hoe was passed up to bart and then he swung down into the boat and soon all were ashore on the island of mystery frank began constructing an oven amid the rocks sending the others for fuel and seaweed it did not take long to make preparations for the bake and soon a roaring fire was blazing as a lot of dry wood had been found near the deserted camps on that side of the island frank took the clams down to the water and washed them carefully a bucketful at a time turning them all into the hollow of a large rock near the fire as the fire grew hotter merry threw stones into it and kept it roaring none of the stones were smaller than a mans fist and some were larger than a mans head why are you doing that asked hodge you will see when the time comes smiled frank hans sat on a rock and stared into the fire his air of dejection being extremely ludicrous to behold come come forget it exclaimed merry cheer up and be like yourself i can nefer peen like yourseluf again so long as i had this face onto me sighed hans id peen a vrightful thing to think dot i might peen misdooken any dime an irishmans vor dunder und blitzens i vos all proken ub in peesness ofer dot it was useless to try to cheer him up the more they talked to him the sadder and more downcast he looked after a while frank had burned out nearly all the wood and nothing was left but a dying fire he did not wait for it to die down but raked away everything but the redhot coals and some of the stones in the fireplace of stone then he took the wet seaweed and threw it into the fireplace where it began to sizzle and steam in with the clams boys he cried as he began to toss the big fellows in upon the seaweed they helped him and soon all the clams were scattered on the steaming seaweed then he covered them with more seaweed and aided by the others piled the hot rocks he had drawn out of the fireplace on top of this mass of seaweed what a sizzling and steaming there was and what a delightful odor came to their nostrils quickly frank had another fire going and by this he kept hot a mass of rocks he had heated in the first fire but had not piled upon the seaweed in this way by the time the rocks on the weed were cooled off more rocks were ready to take their place and the clams were kept steaming after a time merriwell announced that the clams must be nearly done he sent hans off to the yacht to bring browning ashore the dutch boy found it difficult to arouse the big yale man but browning was fond of clams and he came along quickly enough once he was fully awake and understood what awaited him as the boat reached shore merriwell began to rake the rocks off the seaweed ye gods grunted bruce sniffing the air as he approached what heavenly aroma is this that greets my nostrils when the clams were uncovered and he saw them with their huge shells yawning and the meat within looking white and tempting he declared he was very happy to be living gather round fellows said frank capture your clams and devour them there will be no ceremony in this case then as browning fished out a clam and held it triumphantly aloft a man came whistling softly down the bank joined the group without a word raked out a clam and extracted it from the shell being the first to taste the feast frank had prepared it was the man in gray mr caleb cooler yum exclaimed the man in gray that clam is hot well you are cool enough said frank merriwell oh im cooler chuckled the queer old fellow told you so some time ago howdy boys fine day isnt it think we will have some more weather or dont you know weather we will or not bruce browning arose to his feet and removed his coat thats one way to keep cool at a clambake grinned the man in gray what are you going to do mop up the beach with you answered browning quietly i am going to teach you a lesson teach is correct as you applied it said mr cooler down this way i find people say learn for teach just think how bad it would have sounded had you said you were going to learn me a lesson he raked out another clam but dropped it shaking his hand and blowing on his fingers even though i am cooler i find some things are warm enough he murmured that clam must have been near a fire i dote on clams baked boiled fried or frizzled it dont make a dern bit of difference whenever i get an opportunity i go gunning for clams myself i think it is great sport to shoot a clam on the wing with a good bird gun and a dog i presume it is an easy thing to bag clams around here he was not paying the least attention to the big yale man and brownings threat to wipe up the beach with him seemed forgotten hans was glaring at the man in gray while strange gurgling sounds came from his throat all at once he gave a yell rolled over backward and scrambled to his feet dont touch him pruce warned the dutch boy i peen goin to smash dot veller myseluf ah there irish chirped mr cooler you will catch cold in your liver if you let the wind blow down your throat that way have a clam and let it stop that orifice in your countenance this made hans so angry that he danced wildly and began to choke and gurgle in his endeavor to shriek forth something but the man in gray did not even look at him there was something extremely ludicrous about it all and frank was forced to laugh when he saw merry laughing hans seemed to lose all his strength and he dropped down on a rock completely knocked out even though he had not been touched browning was grinning now for he saw the humor of the situation and he could not help admiring the nerve of the queer old fellow look here mr cooler said frank who invited you to help yourself eh oh why i didnt need an invitation to join old friends like you chaps i knew you would be glad to see me we are grunted browning tickled to death then sit right up and take hold boys chuckled mr cooler catch your clam and peel him well have a real jolly time he raked another one off the seaweed how did you get here asked merry i didnt walk because i couldnt had to hire a fellow to bring me down and then he didnt want to get near enough to the island to set me ashore wanted me to swim charged me five dollars too never mind the company will have to pay it what company why the company i represent but what company do you represent the greatest land improvement and development company on earth you must know the one i mean for it is the only one it is the bay islands land company the eastern bay land company has sprouted in competition to us but we purpose to nip the rival concern in the bud i am here to investigate such islands as may eventually become summer resorts and obtain options on them when i can get at the real owners thats one great difficulty to find the real owners some of them do not seem to have any owners and yet sheep are pastured on them summer and winter some of them are owned by the government down at vinal haven i heard about devil island they said there was some sort of a mystery here an island with a mystery is certain to be a great attraction for summer visitors i made a skip for devil island to see if it had any attractions beside the mystery had hard work getting here nobody at greens landing seemed to feel like dropping me here you refused to do so i couldnt walk but i didnt get excited the more difficulties beset my path the cooler i became i am here gentlemen and im glad i came i admire clams they are fine i think these clams are the finest i ever tasted have some boys mr cooler seemed to regret the time he had spent in talk for he made a fierce dive at the clams and raked out two of them merriwells friends all looked at him to see what he would do under the circumstances frank was smiling but there was a look of doubt on his face for once in his life he seemed in a quandary there was something about this little chuckling jolly old man that seemed to forbid anyone to do him personal violence bruce browning felt that he realized that he would feel ashamed of himself if he should give the old fellow a shaking and it was plain that cooler could not be frightened away in any ordinary manner nothing seemed to alarm him sit up and eat some clams fellows said frank quietly let him fill up and then well tie a big bowlder to his neck and sink him out here in the harbor hum coughed the man in gray thats right young man let me fill my sack with these clams before you put me to soak perhaps you had better let me rest a while after that too for i never like to take a bath after a full meal it isnt healthy the best physicians condemn the practice so with the exception of hans they again gathered around the clams and started to enjoy the feast hans retired by himself and sat on a flat rock muttering and looking savage at times he would shake his fist at the back of the man in gray mr cooler seemed to have a remarkable ability to talk and devour clams at the same time as browning afterward expressed it he talked a blue streak he told them he was a great traveler he had been all over the united states all over the world why he said in berlin i appeared at court how much was the fine asked frank with a twinkle in his eye young man exclaimed cooler you astonish me to look at you i would not suppose you could be frivolous i am slightly that way myself cant help it born that way always see something humorous in everything its better than medicine it keeps the liver in a healthy condition now clams are hard to digest but taken in connection with laughter and jollity they digest much better there is enough sadness in the world if we do not go around with our faces drawn down be jolly thats my motto there was something infectious in his light spirits and careless air despite themselves the boys found they were growing interested in this queer old fellow frank studied mr cooler carefully had he not felt certain that the man was playing a part he would have enjoyed the old fellows chatter but frank could see beneath the surface and he was absolutely satisfied that mr cooler was not what he represented himself to be frank had never heard of the bay islands land company he did not believe there was such a company in existence if cooler was lying why was he doing so what was his object in attempting to force himself upon them why had he come to the island in such a manner frank had decided that cooler was a spy and he had been set upon them by the very ones who were so determined to drive them away from that island in that case this lighthearted careless old fellow was connected with a gang of criminals who did not hesitate to do murder in order to conceal their crimes mr cooler did not stop eating clams till the last one was devoured and he disposed of that himself ah he sighed drawing back and finding a comfortable position where he could sit with his back resting against a bowlder now i do feel good young gentlemen i am glad you came accept my congratulations on this remarkably successful clambake you have done a good job i have done another my stomach has not been in the best possible condition lately ive been living at home my wife cooks six months ago she was a magnificent a celestial cook oh how beautifully she could broil a beefsteak but alas also alack she got the bicycle craze she bought a wheel now she is an inveterate scorcher he took a pipe out of his pocket and began to fill it chattering away in a jolly manner as he did so he seemed inclined to do all the talking doesnt your jaw get tired at times inquired frank eh came in surprise from the little man why i should think it would you talk so much he he ho ho wait a minute ha ha knew there was another way to laugh if i could think of it jaw get tired my dear young gentleman if you had a wife like mine you would consider it a privilege to talk occasionally i do not get an opportunity when i am at home when i get away from home i make up for lost time haw haw came near forgetting that method of laughing dont mind me i know i am something of a chinning machine but i am harmless why i wouldnt harm a a a lion he lighted the pipe and puffed away a few moments talking a streak while he smoked frank was considering the advisability of pinning him down and demanding to know his real reason for being there when of a sudden the little fellow jumped up spryly as a boy exclaiming this wont do i must complete my tour of investigation i must attend to business i must look the entire island over and be ready to leave when that man comes back for me young gentlemen i thank you for your hospitality i wish i might stop longer but unfortunately i cannot so long so ling so lung browning made a move as if to stop the man but frank gave a sign to let him go mr cooler scrambled nimbly up the bank turned and waved his hand with a flirting motion and then vanished into the bushes fellows spoke frank quickly im going to follow him i must do it alone im armed i can take care of myself but if i do not return in an hour look for me then he sprang up the bank after the mysterious man in gray chapter xxiv the whispering glade frank had learned the art of trailing from indian guides in the west and for a white person he was an expert as a shadower he had the skill of one who had been all his life in the business he did not let the man in gray get far away before approaching near enough so mr cooler could be seen occasionally as he slipped through the bushes but it was not difficult to follow the queer old man for cooler did not seem to imagine for a moment that he was shadowed he walked swiftly puffing away at his pipe and the smell of burning tobacco came back to the nostrils of the pursuing lad after a little time the man struck the path that runs round the island and through the old granite quarry then he walked still more swiftly but frank also found less trouble in following soon the quarry was reached cooler passed straight through this and struck the track which led down the incline to the sheds near the wharf now frank was not able to pursue him so closely he was forced to linger far behind for to keep close meant certain discovery should the man look back still he followed the track ran through a cut and wound slowly along a bank to one side of which lay the water frank reached the cut and saw the man in gray disappear beyond some bowlders a moment later merry was at the bowlders peering down the track toward the still retreating form of the little man over whose shoulders at regular intervals curled blue puffs of smoke frank had expected that the man would be suspicious and would look round frequently he was astonished when the man did not look round at all he doesnt act like a criminal frank decided he hasnt the air of a criminal he walks along as if he had not a care in all the wide world and did not fear to have all his actions watched it is strange very strange already merry had learned that men who commit crimes betray themselves by certain peculiar movements the thief unconsciously assumes the pose of a man picking a pocket or taking what does not belong to him the burglar crouches in his walk and steals along catlike the guilty man often casts sly backward glances over his shoulder it is rare for him to have the air and manner of innocence but this little man in gray when without doubt he believed himself to be alone was still the same carefree careless old fellow he disappeared into one of the sheds at the end of the railroad frank had slipped yet a little nearer and watched from a place of hiding five minutes passed and then the man in gray and another man came out of that shed and took the path that led toward the old boarding house frank uttered a low exclamation is it possible he muttered i believe i know that fellow with him he watched the companion of the man in gray as they passed from view he again muttered i do know him he is dan hicks the cockeyed man that settles it mr caleb cooler is just what i thought he is one of the gang and he came here to spy upon us frank ran lightly down the track hidden by the bank beyond which the men had disappeared he stooped as he ran ahead of him he saw the point where browning had pried up the rails and sent a flat car loaded with granite into the water thus saving franks life he shuddered as he thought of his sensations during those terrible moments of peril while he was bound to the track and could hear the car rumbling toward him the bank grew lower till at last he could not keep hidden behind it if he ran farther down the track then he flung himself flat on the bank and crawled up till he could peer over the two men were walking toward the distant boarding house hicks was talking excitedly while cooler still smoked hicks looked back suspiciously but the man in gray did not turn his head they passed the house where the overseer had lived when he was on the island with the crew of men who worked in the quarry they were again hidden from view over the bank scrambled frank keeping the house between him and the men he ran swiftly forward in a short time he reached the house he paused to listen his heart thumping loudly he could hear nothing then he slipped round the house he carefully peered round each corner before advancing at the second corner he halted for again he could see the men he was shadowing they were near the old building in which frank had been struck down the man in gray seemed to be asking questions he was surveying the surroundings as if he had never inspected them before for fifteen minutes they stood there talking and then they went into the building frank decided to return to his friends he quickly darted up an incline toward some cedars which he saw grew thicker and thicker higher up the slope soon he was hidden by the bushes then frank went forward more slowly taking pains to keep in the bushes up above was a ledgy height he came to it after a time he found a position where he could look down into the old quarry from that position he could see the overturned car and the granite which lay in the water at the foot of the bank down which it had jumped he could also look far out over the islanddotted bay he could see small boats in the distance he could see white sails he could see the sunshine reflected on the blue water in the midst of this mass of water and islands lay devil island shrouded by mystery lonely and desolate shunned by man once before he had strongly felt the air of desolation that seemed to hang about the place and now the same uncanny sensation was creeping over him again somehow it seemed that he was far from men far from life lost in a lonely waste of water cast on an uncanny island he shook himself trying to throw off the feeling he wondered why it should come upon him at that time and then he began to remember how he had first felt it once before when near that very spot the glade the grave in the woods he muttered the words realizing that the woods were close at hand they lay there dark and gloomy he must pass through them in order to reach the white wings or he must retrace his steps and take the path to do the latter would be sure to expose him to the men he had watched but frank did not wish to turn back there was something fascinating as well as repellent about the woods down there was a grave at the head of the grave was a stone on that stone was chiseled sacred to the memory of rawson denning denning like frank merriwell had been inquisitive he had attempted to solve the mystery of the island and he had disappeared afterward the grave had been found on the island no one had dared open that grave to see if the body of the missing man from boston lay within frank felt a desire to look at that grave again he went down toward it entering the thick woods every step that he advanced seemed to cause the feeling to grow stronger upon him the woods were silent and deserted it did not seem possible that there could be a thing of life other than frank anywhere within them all at once with astonishing suddenness he came out into the opening and there before him was the grave the headstone gleaming gray in the dim light frank paused involuntarily he listened he had not forgotten how on his other visit to the spot both he and browning had seemed to hear a mysterious whisper in the air had seemed to hear a rustle down in that grave as if the murdered man turned restlessly without knowing why he did so frank listened again look he started for it seemed that he had heard that whisper he glanced all around silence in the woods not even the rustle of a leaf how lonely it was look again that word coming from he knew not where at what should he look what did it mean then he told himself that it was all his imagination he had heard no whispered word he advanced toward the grave he stood beside it look was it imagination this time the whisper sounded amazingly clear and distinct look at what in spite of himself he spoke the words aloud he did not expect an answer and he gasped for breath when it came the stone a quiver ran over frank merriwells body of all the mysteries on this island the mystery of this black whispering glade in the woods was the greatest he bent forward and looked at the stone there were fresh chips on the mound and at a glance he saw that the name rawson denning had been chiseled out below it another name had been cut into the stone so that the inscription now read sacred to the memory of frank merriwell chapter xxv searching for frank as time passed and frank did not return the boys began to grow restless and anxious i dont like it declared diamond pacing the beach upon which the tide was washing higher and higher as it came in i did not think much of letting him go away alone we all know what happened to him once when he was alone on this island he knows it himself said hodge and it is mighty hard work to catch him twice in the same trap oh hes shrewd enough but he can be overpowered by numbers what do you think about it browning bruce was stretched on the sand his head pillowed on his coat which lay on a rock im not going to think for an hour he grunted too much trouble oh your laziness makes me disgusted snapped diamond huah came in a puff from the big fellow something seems to be gnawing you still poys broke in hans who still looked sad and weary of living i made der biggest mistook uf your life ven i let vrankie go avay alone all py himseluf to chase dot liddle defil mit der saucy mouth you heard me vawble if he had fallen into trouble he would have done some shooting to let us know but should we have heard it hodge asked diamond the island is not very large i think it is pretty large and i do not believe we could hear a gun fired on the other side even under favorable circumstances and the circumstances are not favorable now why not wind is blowing the wrong way didnt think of that the boys soon concluded that the shooting on the farther side of the island would not be heard by them and straightway their anxiety increased diamond was for starting out at once to look for frank he did not believe in waiting till the hour was up but hodge who in his heart was the most anxious man of the party objected to disobeying merrys plain command he told us to stay here an hour and i shall stay here said bart i suppose you would stay if you heard him shouting for help said the virginian hotly bart flushed for he did not fancy being spoken to in that tone of voice i have always found it best to do just as merriwell directs said hodge stiffly if you wish to go search for him you may go i remain here twenty minutes longer browning grunted his approval of the stand taken by bart and jack gave them both a savage look hans who had refused to partake of the clams while the man in gray was present was feeling very hungry and that made him still more miserable oxcuse me poys he said i must made a raid der ships brovisions ubon i vill peen pack britty soon if nod before then he took the boat and rowed off to the yacht where he lost no time in satisfying the cravings of his inner man as the dutch lad appeared on deck to row ashore again browning suddenly straightened up from his recumbent position he had his watch in his hand and the dutch lad heard him say the hour is up hodge immediately bart turned toward the yacht and shouted to hans bring two of those guns ashore and plenty of cartridges for them be lively about it we are in a howling hurry all righd shouted hans in return as he plunged down the companion way he was not long in getting the guns and placing them in the boat but when he reached the shore it was discovered that he had brought the wrong cartridges then hodge leaped into the boat and rowed out to the yacht for what was needed returning in a few minutes browning however usually careless and lazy was fretting at the delay for the big fellow remembered how but a short time before he had saved franks life by a hairs breadth a delay of one minute in that case would have been fatal bruce had some imagination and he was beginning to picture frank in all sorts of peril look here came fiercely from diamond what are you chaps up to do not think for a moment that you are going to leave me behind im going with you i am going to help find merriwell of course you can come if you insist began bruce i do cut in jack but i scarcely think it advisable the big fellow continued at least two of our party should remain and watch the yacht hans is enough for that dont you pelief i vos goin to stayed here alone squawked the dutch boy you dond plaid dot tricks on me jack tried to argue with him tried to convince him that there could be no danger in remaining on board the yacht but hans was obstinate and the effort failed you dond fool me dot vay he fiercely exclaimed i dond stayed alone here dot vos all it became plain that one of the boys would have to remain with him hodge had returned with the proper ammunition and jack was not supplied with a gun well he said fiercely i was the first one who wanted to go after merriwell but i seem to be left out of it all right i may come later perhaps you will need me perhaps so confessed bart grimly give us plenty of time to make a circuit of the island and return here then if we have not appeared you will have a reason for coming und i vill come mit him put in hans dont leave the white wings unless you feel it is for the best we are going prepared for trouble and it will be a warm crowd that gets the best of us come on away went bart and the big yale man scrambling up the bank with their guns and quickly disappearing into the bushes bart took the lead but browning was at his heels swinging along with a stride that covered ground swiftly there was a look of intense anxiety on the face of the giant round the island to the quarry they went down the railroad they hurried and soon they were in sight of the spot where not many hours before frank had nearly lost his life browning drew a breath of relief when they did not find the mangled body of merriwell stretched on the track somehow he had felt it was possible the wretches had captured frank and completed their work at last and he was dreading to walk down that railroad fearing he should find the friend he loved and admired dead upon the rails he is not here the words came from hodge and they were exactly what bruce was thinking no where shall we go now to the old boarding house away they went toward the building it looked before them the sunshine glinting on its windows apparently utterly deserted there was something forbidding in its appearance we shall not find him there hodge spoke the words in full conviction that time would be wasted in looking through the building perhaps not admitted bruce but i know of no other place to look this was a confession that the big fellow would be stumped if no trace of frank was found in the building they reached it passed round to the back door by which admission had been obtained when frank and bruce visited it the first time and there they hesitated the door was standing open just exactly as we left it exclaimed browning no one has closed the door this seemed to surprise him hodge pushed forward and went in bruce followed the empty rooms echoed to their steps everywhere were cobwebs dust decay some of the windows were broken some were boarded up from room to room they went they ascended the stairs they spoke in whispers the sun shone in upon the floor but it brought nothing of cheer to the deserted building it seemed like a mocking attempt to make the place look pleasant an attempt that served to show its dreary desolation all the more plainly he is not here whispered bart the basement came from bruce it was there that i found him when he disappeared the other time down the creaking stairs they went browning taking the lead now the door at the head of the stairs leading into the dark basement was open just as we left it declared the big fellow it was fastened in the first place so merry said he had to force it open they lighted matches as they went down the stairs into the basement the place was dismal enough filled with old boxes and barrels frank browning called causing hodge to start and drop his match then they stood still and listened squeak squeak a rat scampered across the ground beneath their feet that was all there was no answer to brownings call he is not here no they lost little time in hastening up the stairs and getting out of the old building as soon as they were in the open air they drew deep breaths for they had been stifled and oppressed where next asked bart the house said bruce we must not go away without looking through that can we get in we will find a way or make it chapter xxvi again at the grave the door of the house would not open for them bruce threatened to burst it in with his shoulders but bart advised him not to do so unless as a last resort then a window was found that would open and soon they had clambered in there was some furniture in the house but still the place had the same dreary deserted air of the big building they had just left browning began by shouting franks name to which cry there was no answer the rising wind rattled a loose window it did not take them long to go through the house to which there was no cellar and they found nothing to indicate that a human being had entered the place for months as they stood outside after getting out of the window and closing it behind them they looked at each other in a helpless manner what has become of him asked bart huskily that is what i would like to know confessed bruce he seems to have disappeared completely and the man in gray is gone too browning i am afraid merry was lured into some sort of a trap so am i why should they take him in particular and not harm any of the rest of us perhaps their motto is one at a time no i believe frank was selected out of our party as the one to get out of the way he was determined to solve the mystery of this wretched island and he was the leader of our party the ruffians fancied that they would put an end to all trouble by getting him out of the way for they fancied we would run at once browning grunted and hodge went on swiftly and fiercely by the eternal skies they made a big mistake ill not leave this island till i know what has happened to frank merriwell or i am dead nor i nodded bruce im with you old man if he has been harmed bart went on the wretches who did the dirty work shall suffer i swear it im another we will bring them to justice or kick the bucket trying they shook hands on it and they were in deadly earnest they decided not to return to the yacht by the path but to go over the island and through the woods thus by chance they followed almost directly in franks footsteps as they drew near to the dark woods browning felt a tightening at his heart a sensation similar to that he had once before experienced as he stood beside the lonely grave in the dark glade he sought to throw it off but could not do so come he said which way asked bart this way he seemed to feel something drawing him toward the grave in the glade and bart followed without another word unconsciously the big yale man stepped softly as if he feared to alarm somebody or something the moss beneath his feet gave no sound not even a twig snapped without knowing that he did so hodge imitated brownings stealthy manner the wind soughed through the pines and cedars in a fitful manner there seemed to be strange rustlings in the air at the edge of the glade bruce halted there was the grave with the gray headstone he stood there staring at it somehow he was possessed by a feeling that the grave had something to do with the vanishing of frank merriwell although his reason told him that such a thing was folly what is the matter hodge almost whispered the question for he was beginning to feel the uncanny air that overshadowed the place there is the grave said bruce what grave why the one we told you about the grave of the boston man who disappeared in such a mysterious manner it is supposed that he was murdered on this island and buried there bart shivered you act as if you half expected to see another grave beside that one he muttered not so soon but tomorrow if frank has been foully dealt with the villains have not been given time to make another grave his body is hidden somewhere but i will not believe anything of the kind has happened we shall find him somewhere alive and well we must bruce remembered the strange whispering they had heard there when he and frank visited the place and now he listened half expecting to hear it again the silence was unbroken save by the mournful sound of the wind in the trees bruce went forward quickly and stood by the grave bart came up and together they looked down at the gray headstone what is that asked hodge pointing somebody has been doing something to the stone since it was placed here they bent down and looked at the stone why cried bruce the first name has been chiseled off another name has been put on that name is frank merriwell astounded they stared at the headstone what did it mean why was that name upon it the tightening sensation grew around brownings heart all at once it seemed that the mystery of the island was deeper and darker than ever before now what do you think of that cried bart huskily bruce shook his head for the moment feeling that he was not able to speak it did not seem that he could govern his voice all sorts of wild fancies were rushing through his head he looked at the mound and a feeling of relief came to him when he saw that it seemed undisturbed hodge was shaking he reached out and grasped the big fellows arm with a savage clutch was it was it meant for a warning he asked yes said bruce quickly grasping at that explanation it must have been you have struck it hodge then it is not likely frank saw it perhaps not and yet he may have come here then they stood there a long time silently staring at that stone on which was chiseled the name of the friend they held dearest in all the world at last bruce hoarsely said come lets get away from here but it may be that somehow we may strike a clew here this may be a clew this may explain what has happened if this explains it there is but one construction to be placed on franks remarkable disappearance and that is that he is dead in the treetops the wind seemed to repeat the word in a whisper but neither bart nor bruce were willing to believe that frank merriwell was dead for all that his name was there before them on the gray stone at the head of the lonely grave dead or living ill never rest till i know the truth came passionately from barts lips if he is dead the murderers shall suffer we must throw off the feeling that anything so awful has happened even now he may be with the others at the yacht while we have been searching for him he may have returned hodge caught at this eagerly you are right he said come on we will hurry back there they left the glade turning to look back as they passed on into the gloomy woods they were glad to get away at first they hurried on their hearts buoyant with the thought that they should find him waiting for them at the yacht he would laugh at them would jolly them because of their foolish fears the placing of his name on the headstone of the grave was a ghastly joke and nothing more in his mind browning was thinking how he would growl at merry for causing them so much trouble he even thought of the words he would use but as they came nearer and nearer to the side of the island near which the yacht was anchored their spirits fell again and they were beset by doubts and fears what if they should not find frank waiting for them when they arrived these doubts caused them to walk slower and slower for they dreaded to hear that frank was still missing it seems to me said bart that it is very probable merriwell will not be with jack and hans he may not be confessed bruce if he had returned they would have fired guns and done things to let us know it we might not have heard them we should the wind is right we are near the yacht now bruce felt like turning back and making another search he dreaded to return and report that they had discovered nothing save the name of the missing lad on the headstone of a grave all at once they came out of the woods upon the high bank from which position they could look down into the cove where the yacht lay there she was swinging idly with the incoming tide and on her deck they could see dunnerwust and diamond merriwell was not in sight almost as soon as they came out of the thick woods they were seen by diamond and he called to them what have you found nothing answered hodge gloomily hasnt frank returned no chapter xxvii slippery mr cooler immediately diamond and dunnerwust got into the boat which floated beside the yacht they took guns and hans soon rowed the boat ashore bart and bruce came down the bank and told them where they had been and what they had seen on hearing about the name on the headstone diamond became greatly excited my god he cried can it be that frank has been killed if so ill never forgive myself for letting him follow that man alone oh that treacherous little devil i could strangle him i wish i had him here now so do i py chorch shouted hans it would not be healthy for mr cooler said browning were you speaking of me young gentlemen chirped a familiar voice and down the bank came the man in gray calmly walking up to the astonished lads i hope you were not saying anything behind my back that you do not care to repeat before my face no rang out the clear voice of the virginian i called you a treacherous little devil and i repeat it thats complimentary to say the least grinned the man in gray in his provokingly careless manner but id like to know what i have done to lead you to speak thus disparagingly of me wouldst tell me browning reached out and collared the queer old fellow lifting him off his feet and swinging him around so he was in the midst of them there grunted the big yale man with satisfaction now we have you you cant run so dont try it if you try it by the lord harry ill fill you full of lead came hoarsely from hodge who was fingering the gun in his hands as if he longed to shoot cooler anyhow ah me sighed the little man how rude you are young gentlemen is it possible you are in your right minds or have i fallen in with a lot of lunatics why i wouldnt run for anything its not necessary to threaten me i wish you would tell me what i have done to arouse your ire where is frank merriwell hey where is he snarled diamond showing his white teeth dont lie man dont try it if you do we will put you where you will lure no other person into a trap goodness me said mr cooler somewhat mockingly you are very much excited young man i do not know what you are driving at dont lie i tell you it is dangerous we are desperate you really seem so where is he how do i know you do know he followed you and you trapped him some way what have you done with him he he chuckled the little man followed me did he why did he do that it seems to me he should have been more careful there it is burst from hodge that is the same as a boast now we know you have done something to him you are a very knowing young man now the manner of the man in gray aroused the anger and resentment of the boys he seemed to be taunting them shall we shoot the snake bruce asked diamond his face purple with passion shall we avenge frank not just yet said browning we will give him a chance for his life you are very kind murmured mr cooler if he will tell us what has become of frank if he will lead us to frank we will spare his life what if i dont know where he is you do know you dare not deny it you are very much mistaken for i do deny it i give you my word of honor that i do not know where mr merriwell is at this moment i do know he followed me he thought he was doing a very shrewd thing and i must confess that i rather admired his skill at it but i knew all the time that he was behind me ha exclaimed hodge then you know what became of him no he followed me over to the other side of the island and then he started to return by coming straight back through the woods that is all i know i am here to learn if he returned safely if he did i intended to warn him that his life was in danger if he should go about the island alone you must see that i am serious now oh yes we see came scornfully from diamond it is too thin it will not work mr cooler you know too much not to know more if you wish to keep your skin whole just lead us straight to frank merriwell thats all i cant i would do it if i could but i give you my word to do my best to save him if he is in trouble that is the best i can do diamonds anger caused him to lose his head so that he threatened the old man with his fist he quickly realized what he was doing however and with an air of apology he cried if you keep it up you will lead me to do something of which i shall be ashamed you cant fool us old man we have you foul and well never let up on you till you lead us to frank merriwell we are young but you will find we can keep a pledge like men in truth cooler seemed in earnest as he said young gentleman you wrong me very much i am ready to go with you and do what i can to help find mr merriwell but that is all i can do it will be better if you will let me go alone i shall be able to work alone far better oh yes sneered hodge you think we are fools no we go with you all right i am ready it did not seem that anything further could be forced from his lips they warned him that they would not hesitate to shoot if he tried to run away and then they climbed the bank if you want me to lead you said mr cooler come on he did not take the path but plunged into the woods they kept close to him watching him if you try to lead us into a trap said hodge you will be sorry if we are ambushed here in these woods my first shot will be at you ill fix you if i never do another thing there was nothing like bluster in the words and mr caleb cooler knew bart meant exactly what he said that is all right nodded the little man shoot away he led them toward the glade in which was the mysterious grave at last they stood around the grave and he said here is something i discovered since coming to the island that name was on the stone before i joined you at the clambake i forgot to tell you about it yesterday there was another name on that stone said browning the new name must have been cut there after we left the island yesterday afternoon i do not know when it was cut there declared cooler but everything shows it must have been very recently i do know it was there when i landed on this island today and you know who cut it there accused diamond if you think so it is useless to deny it now take us to frank merriwell all i can do is aid you in the search i am willing to go anywhere with you they passed on from the dark glade leaving the mysterious grave behind them cooler seemed inclined to keep to the left although the woods were thicker there they pushed forward as if passing through a jungle branches whipped them in the face and beneath their feet the underbrush crackled all at once diamond shouted stop stop where is cooler why grunted browning hes right here thunder he was at my elbow a moment ago i scarcely took my eyes off him he isnt here now rang out jacks voice he has disappeared he is trying to hide in these thick bushes scatter and search for him if you see him running shoot at his legs stop him somehow chapter xxviii the voice in the night the excited lads beat the bushes in vain caleb cooler had disappeared in a moment as if the ground had opened and swallowed him it seemed impossible that he could give them the slip in such a manner but he had at last four very disgusted and angry boys stopped in a little opening and looked at each other we are a set of chumps declared hodge thats so grunted browning ought to have held onto the snake all the time came savagely from diamond oh if we had him here now yaw gurgled hans uf we had him here now he vouldnt done a thing to us i feel like crawling into a hole growled the big yale man so do i nodded hodge but i dont know where to find a hole small enough what fools we are yaw again gurgled hans vot fools you vos but im hanged if i can understand it said bruce how did he do it that is what i want to know he was within reach at one moment and gone the next lets search again they did so but the time was spent in vain they were close to the rocks which rose above the ground in the vicinity of the quarry but it seemed an utter impossibility for anyone to hide amid those rocks they decided to remain in the vicinity and watch for mr cooler thinking he was in a place of hiding near at hand and he would be forced to show himself sooner or later having decided on this they scattered somewhat but were within call of each other then they settled down to watch for the man in gray it became ominously silent there amid the cedars and pines save when the fitful wind made a rustling once a squirrel was heard chattering in the distance an hour passed and then diamond could stand it no longer he called them together and said fellows while we remain idle here those villains may be completing the work of putting merriwell out of the way i think we are wasting our time so do i said hodge und i vos some more put in hans then they decided to scour the island if hidden near at hand cooler knew they were watching for him and it was not likely he would make a move two hours were spent in wandering over the island calling to the missing lad they awoke the echoes in the dark woods but the echoes were the only answers to their cries disheartened and desperate they returned to the cove in which the yacht lay they were troubled by fears that something had happened to her while they were away but when they obtained a view of her she was seen riding peacefully at anchor the small boat was there and bart was the first to reach it suddenly he uttered an exclamation and then called the attention of the others to a slip of paper that lay beneath a stone that had been placed on one of the seats a moment later he secured the paper there is writing upon it he declared read it exclaimed the others pressing nearer on the paper which seemed to be a leaf torn from a pocket account book were scrawled the following words you fellers haid better git erway frum devul irelan in a blame big hurry or you will git used the saim as frank merryfull did you wunt naver se no moar of him that settles it said diamond bitterly frank is done for this time they have finished him the devils well theyll never drive me away from this island till i have found out how they did it and who they are vowed hodge right here i swear i will spend the rest of my life in avenging merry if it is necessary i am with you and i yaw me too they shook hands on it with bared heads never were four lads in more deadly earnest the sun was low in the western sky tinting the rippling waters with golden light the scene was a peaceful one and it did not seem possible that an awesome and appalling tragedy had taken place on that quiet little island that day despite their determination the boys were stunned and at a loss to know what was to be done they entered the boat and rowed off to the yacht it was plain no one had visited the white wings while they were away for nothing on board was molested hans was hungry but he was the only one of them all who seemed to have any appetite they did not talk much but all were thinking and the dutch boy cried softly over the food he ate little had they dreamed when they started out on the cruise that anything so terrible could happen and that they would be so completely dazed and bewildered their hearts were full of sorrow but on their faces were looks of resolution that told they did not mean to be driven away till they had fulfilled their oath the sun went down redly in the west and tinted twilight crept over the water in the woods on shore darkness gathered swiftly they stared away toward those woods as if watching for the appearance of their missing friend all at once jack caught hold of hodge hissing look there where down toward the point see back in the shadows beyond the two pines can you see them there i see something two figures yes i saw them move saw them come out of the woods they are men and they are watching us thats right and one of them is that snake the little man in gray i believe it i know it get a rifle hodge what would you do shoot him panted the hotblooded virginian get a rifle i will put a bullet through the villain although hotblooded and reckless himself bart realized that diamond must not do anything of the kind but he did not find it necessary to reason with jack for the two men turned and disappeared into the woods theyre gone exclaimed the virginian regretfully but they may come back again we must keep a close watch tonight there is no telling what desperate deed they may attempt so the night was divided into watches and each lad took his turn on deck the sky became overcast so there was little light the black shadow of the shore seemed potent with dangers bart had his second watch on deck and it was not far from midnight when he was startled to hear a voice hailing from the shore ahoy the yacht what do you want asked bart gripping a revolver and staring toward the point from which the voice had seemed to come who are you caleb cooler at your service came back the answer i thought id tell you something that may relieve your minds somewhat frank merriwell is alive and unharmed bart gasped why do you come to tell us that he asked because i know you are worrying about him dont worry he will be with you tomorrow this angered bart so that he lifted his revolver being tempted to send a random shot toward the point from which the voice seemed to come but he changed his mind and lowered the weapon so long called the voice of the queer old man turn in and sleep you wont be troubled that is what they want us to do thought bart it is a trick but they cant fool us that way no further sound was heard from the shore cooler did not answer although bart called to him several times jack had heard hodge speaking and he came on deck when bart told diamond what had happened the latter was furious if i had been here i would have fired six shots in his direction he declared diamond took his turn on deck and it was about two oclock when he fancied he heard the sound of oars the sound came nearer and nearer till at last it seemed that the boat reached the island and then the sound was heard no more morning dawned and browning arose in a strangely agitated state of mind never had his companions seen him in such a condition when asked about it he said boys i had a queer dream im going to tell you what it was i dreamed that frank merriwell is buried in the grave on the island i thought him buried alive we dug him out and restored him to life it cant be that merry is buried there for the mound has not been disturbed lately said diamond all the same declared browning i am going to open that grave i am going to know the secret it holds chapter xxix the secret of the grave browning was determined and it was not long before he had worked the others into a state of excitement over it without waiting for breakfast they sprang into the boat and rowed ashore i saw some tools in the sheds at the end of the railroad said bruce we will secure them the path was taken and they passed through the old quarry and down the track to the sheds there they found a pick and spade with those in their possession they hastened to the black glade in which lay the grave for once in his life bruce browning was filled with energy he was aroused but even as he reached the grave he halted suddenly his hand uplifted hoarsely gasping listen the boys were silent help it was a smothered cry and it seemed to come from the ground at their feet it made the hair of the dutch boy stand and his teeth chatter it astonished and amazed them all help again that smothered cry seemed to come from the grave what did it mean use the pick hodge hoarsely commanded browning we will soon open it up go at it lively bart obeyed and the ground gave back a strange hollow sound as he struck his pick into it browning shoveled away the dirt having torn off his coat to work with greater ease soon something of a hole had been made in the mound all at once with a cry of horror bart started back pointing down into the hole they had made look he gasped that ring that hand it is frank merriwells hand and there before them they saw a human hand that seemed to be thrust up through the ground hans began to pray the hand moved it clawed desperately at the ground it is frank diamond almost screamed he is down there he has been buried alive dig fellows dig but be careful not to hurt him at that moment the ground caved in at their feet and up out of it rose the dirtcovered head of frank merriwell he rubbed the dirt out of his eyes and then he cheerfully observed goodmorning fellows it seems to be a pleasant morning outside but its a trifle close inside if you will take hold and pull me out ill be much obliged they clutched him they dragged him to the surface behind him lay a deep dark hole that was not filled by the earth that had caved in well of all things wonderful grunted browning never knew anything like this before never heard of anything like this i believe i am still dreaming frank are you hurt asked diamond not much answered merry they trapped me without much trouble i didnt have a chance to get hurt but to be buried under the ground to be in a grave eh a grave why great scott it is the grave and the stone with my name on it this is the spot where i was caught i was standing right here a man dropped down out of this tree and struck on my shoulders he laid me out and it wasnt hard to tie me up then i was towed away under ground and a guard was placed over me its a close little hole down there but the guard left me after he had watched till he was tired and then i finally managed to get free and i tried to dig out where they had closed up what once was the mouth of the cave whats that asked hodge a cave exactly and there was an opening into it here at one time they closed it up and made this fake grave over the spot thats just what they did but your voice we could hear it look at this headstone there is a hole straight down through it below there is a tube that runs down into the cave anyone at the lower end of the tube can speak so they can be heard here that is how those mysterious whispers reached our ears oh it is a great scheme it made the place seem haunted but where is the other opening to the cave it must be near here though i was blindfolded when i was taken in mr cooler was in the game he came up suddenly a long long time ago talked with the chap who was guarding me said he had been forced to dodge you chaps thats when he gave us the slip said diamond id like to see the little whelp again your wish shall be gratified said a familiar voice and mr cooler walked into the glade followed by three other men all dressed in black i am here its the gang cried diamond well have to fight for it fellows dont fight advised the man in gray laughing it isnt necessary we are not the gang but we have the gang nicely corralled you have known me as caleb cooler but i am in fact dustin douglass of the secret service these gentlemen with me are deputies and we have just captured a gang of counterfeiters who have been making all sorts of trouble for the government if you think i am lying young gentlemen i will show you my credentials i managed to get in with the gang myself by pretending to be a skillful shover of the queer and that is why i have been seen with some of them last night my deputies came onto the island in a boat and this morning we raked in all of the gang we have them nicely ironed over at the old boarding house where one of my men is watching over them among them mr merriwell are your friends hicks and wiley somehow they think you were concerned in their undoing and they have expressed sincere regrets that they did not do you up instead of capturing you and stowing you here in the old cave the chap who was watching you came over to get his breakfast this morning and now he is ironed with the others there are four in all i trust you will pardon me for the deception young gentlemen smiled the little secret service officer had to do it you know just came over to set mr merriwell at liberty but i see you are here ahead of me bruce browning leaned against a tree looking tired and unnerved this is too much for me he muttered im sure to go into brain fever i cant comprehend it all nor could the others just then but every word the little man had spoken proved true he showed them the skillfully concealed entrance to the cave which was sometimes used in which to hide the bogus money they understood how he had been able to give them the slip in such a remarkable manner then all went over to the old boarding house where the boys inspected the prisoners dan hicks glared at frank and cursed him snarling all i regret is that i didnt cut your throat beneath the building was a room the boys had not discovered and there the queer had been made at last the mystery of the island was solved and frank merriwell was satisfied but the boys had been furnished with a topic for conversation and discussion that would be interesting for a long time to come and frank was well satisfied to leave devil island at last the end
