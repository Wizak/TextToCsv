 ray bradburyone night in your life he came into green river iowa on a really fine late spring morning driving swiftly his convertible cadillac was hot in the direct sun outside the town but then the green overhanging forests the abundances of soft shade and whispering coolness slowed his car as he moved toward the town thirty miles an hour he thought is fast enough leaving los angeles he had rocketed his car across burning country between stone canyons and meteor rocks places where you had to go fast because everything seemed fast and hard and clean but here the very greenness of the air made a river through which no car could rush you could only idle on the tide of leafy shadow drifting on the sunlightspeckled concrete like a river barge on its way to a summer sea looking up through the great trees was like lying at the bottom of a deep pool letting the tide drift you he stopped for a hotdog at an outdoor stand on the edge of town lord he whispered to himself i havent been back through here in fifteen years you forget how fast trees can grow he turned back to his car a tall man with a sunburned wry thin face and thinning dark hair why am i driving to new york he wondered why dont i just stay and drown myself here in the grass he drove slowly through the old town he saw a rusty train abandoned on old sidespur track its whistle long silent its steam long gone he watched the people moving in and out of stores and houses so slowly they were under a great sea of clean warm water moss was everywhere so every motion came to rest on softness and silence it was a barefoot mark twain town a town where childhood lingered without anticipation and old age came without regret he snorted gently at himself or so it seemed im glad helen didnt come on this trip he thought he could hear her now my god this place is small good grief look at those hicks hit the gas where in hell is new york he shook his head closed his eyes and helen was in reno he had phoned her last night getting divorceds not bad shed said a thousand miles back in the heat its reno thats awful thank god for the swimming pool well what are you up to driving east in slow stages that was a lie he was rushing east like a shot bullet to lose the past to tear away as many things behind him as he could leave drivings fun fun helen protested when you could fly cars are so boring goodbye helen he drove out of town he was supposed to be in new york in five days to talk over the play he didnt want to write for broadway in order to rush back to hollywood in time to not enjoy finishing a screenplay so that he could rush to mexico city for a quick vacation next december sometimes he mused i resemble those mexican rockets bashing between the town buildings on a hot wire bashing my head on one wall turning and zooming back to crash against another he found himself going seventy miles an hour suddenly and cautioned it down to thirtyfive through rolling green noon country he took deep breaths of the clear air and pulled over to the side of the road far away between immense trees on the top of a meadow hill he thought he saw walking but motionless in the strange heat a young woman and then she was gone and he wasnt certain she had been there at all it was one oclock and the land was full of a great powerhouse humming darning needles flashed by the car windows like prickles of heat before his eyes bees swarmed and the grass bent under a tender wind he opened the car door and stepped out into the straight heat here was a lonely path that sang beetle sounds at late noon to itself and there was a cool shadowed forest waiting fifty yards from the road from which blew a good tunnelmoist air on all sides were rolling clover hills and an open sky standing there he could feel the stone dissolve in his arms and his neck and the iron go out of his cold stomach and the tremor cease in his fingers and then suddenly still further away going over a forest hill through a small rift in the brush he saw the young woman again walking and walking into the warm distances gone he locked the car door slowly he struck off into the forest idly drawn steadily by a sound that was large enough to fill the universethe sound of a river going somewhere and not caring the most beautiful sound of all when he found the river it was dark and light and dark and light flowing and he undressed and swam in it and then lay out on the pebbled bank drying feeling relaxed he put his clothes back on leisurely and then it came to him the old desire the old dream when he was seventeen years old he had often confided and repeated it to a friend id like to go walking some spring nightyou know one of those nights that are warm all night long id like to walk with a girl walk for an hour to a place where you can barely hear or see anything climb a hill and sit look at the stars id like to hold the girls hand id like to smell the grass and the wheat growing in the fields and know i was in the centre of the entire country in the very centre of the united states and towns all around and highways away off but nobody knowing were right there on top of that hill in the grass watching the night and just holding her hand would be good can you understand that do you know that holding someones hand can be the thing such a thing that your hands move while not moving you can remember a thing like that rather than any other thing about a night all your life just holding hands can mean more i believe it when everything is repeated and over and familiar its the first things rather than the last that count so for a long time he had continued id like to just sit there not saying a word there arent any words for a night like that we wouldnt even look at each other wed see the lights of the town far off and know that other people had climbed other hills before us and that there was nothing better in the world nothing could be made better all of the houses and ceremonies and guarantees in the world are nothing compared to a night like this the cities and the people in the rooms in the houses in those cities at night are one thing the hills and the open air and the stars and holding hands are something else and then finally without speaking the two of you will turn your heads in the moonlight and look at each other and so youre on the hill all night long is there anything really wrong with this can you honestly say there is anything wrong no said a voice the only thing wrong on a night like that is that there is a world and you must come back to it that was his friend joseph speaking fifteen years ago dear joseph with whom he had talked so many days through their adolescent philosophisings their problems of great import now joseph was married and swallowed by the black streets of chicago and himself taken west by time and all of their philosophy for nothing he remembered the month after he had married helen they had driven across country the first and last time she had consented to the brutal as she called it journey by automobile in the moonlit evenings they had gone through the wheat country and the corn country of the middle west and once at twilight looking straight ahead thomas had said what do you say would you like to spend the night out out helen said here he said with a great appearance of casualness he motioned his hand to the side of the road look at all that land the hills its a warm night itd be nice to sleep out my god helen had cried youre not serious i just thought the damn countrys running with snakes and bugs what a way to spend the night getting burrs in my stockings tramping around some farmers property noone would ever know but id know my dear said helen it was just a suggestion dear tom you were only joking werent you forget i ever said anything he said they had driven on in the moonlight to a boiling little night motel where moths fluttered about the raw electric lights there had been an iron bed in a paintsmelling tiny room where you could hear the beer tunes from the roadhouse all night and hear the continental vans pounding by late late toward dawn he walked through the green forest and listened to the various silences there not one silence but several the silence that the moss made underfoot the silence the shadows made descending from the trees the silence of small streams exploring tiny countries on all sides as he came into a clearing he found some wild strawberries and ate them to hell with the car he thought i dont care if someone takes it apart wheel by wheel and carries it off i dont care if the sun melts it into slag on the spot he lay down and cradled his head on his arms and went to sleep the first thing he saw when he wakened was his wristwatch six fortyfive he had slept most of the day away cool shadows had crept up all about him he shivered and moved to sit up and then did not move again but lay there with his face upon his arm looking ahead the girl who sat a few yards away from him with her hands in her lap smiled i didnt hear you come up he said she had been very quiet for no reason at all in the world except a secret reason thomas felt his heart pounding silently and swiftly she remained silent he rolled over on his back and closed his eyes do you live near here she lived not far away born and raised here she had never been anywhere else its a beautiful country he said a bird flew into a tree arent you afraid he waited but there was no answer you dont know me he said but on the other hand neither did he know her thats different he said why was it different oh you know it just is after what seemed half an hour of waiting he opened his eyes and looked at her for a long while you are real arent you im not dreaming this she wanted to know where he was going somewhere i dont want to go yes that was what so many people said so many passed through on their way to somewhere they didnt like thats me he said he raised himself slowly do you know ive just realised i havent eaten since early today she offered him the bread and cheese and cookies she was carrying from town they didnt speak while he ate and he ate very slowly afraid that some motion some gesture some word might make her run away the sun was down the sky and the air was even fresher now and he examined everything very carefully he looked at her and she was beautiful twentyone fair healthy pinkcheeked and selfcontained the sun was gone the sky lingered its colours for a time while they sat in the clearing at last he heard a whispering she was getting up she put out her hand to take his he stood beside her and they looked at the woods around them and the distant hills they began to walk away from the path and the car away from the highway and the town a spring moon rose over the land while they were walking the breath of nightfall was rising up out of the separate blades of grass a warm sighing of air quiet and endless they reached the top of the hill and without a word sat there watching the sky he thought to himself that this was impossible that such things did not happen he wondered who she was and what she was doing here ten miles away a train whistled in the spring night and went on its way over the dark evening earth flashing a brief fire and then again he remembered the old story the old dream the thing he and his friend had discussed so many years ago there must be one night in your life that you will remember forever there must be one night for everyone and if you know that the night is coming on and that this night will be that particular night then take it and dond train and town and distance were balanced upon the trembling of a finger he thought of helen and he thought of joseph joseph did it ever work out for you joseph were you ever at the right place at the right time and did all go well with you there was no way of knowing the brick city had taken joseph and lost him in the tiled subways and black elevateds and noise as for helen not only had she never known a night like this but she had never dreamed of such a thing there was no place in her mind for this so here i am he thought quietly thousands of miles from everything and everyone across the soft black country now came the sound of a courthouse clock ringing the hour one two three one of those great stone courthouses that stood in the green square of every small american town at the turn of the centurycool stone in the summertime high in the night sky with round dial faces glowing in four directions five six he counted the bronze announcements of the hour stopping at nine nine oclock on a late spring night on a breathing warm moonlit hill in the interior of a great continent his hand touching another hand thinking this year ill be thirtythree but it didnt come too late and i didnt let it pass and this is the night slowly now carefully like a statue coming to life turning and turning still more he saw her head move about so her eyes could look upon him he felt his own head turning also as it had done so many times in his imagination they gazed at each other for a long time he woke during the night she was awake near him who are you he whispered she said nothing i could stay another night he said but he knew that one can never stay another night one night is the night and only one after that the gods turn their backs i could come back in a year or so her eyes were closed but she was awake but i dont know who you are he said you could come with me he said to new york but he knew that she could never be there or anywhere but here on this night and i cant stay here he said knowing that this was the truest and most empty part of all he waited for a time and then said again are you real are you really real they slept the moon went down the sky toward morning he walked out of the hills and the forest at dawn to find the car covered with dew he unlocked it and climbed in behind the wheel and sat for a moment looking back at the path he had made in the wet grass he moved over preparatory to getting out of the car again he put his hand on the inside of the door and gazed steadily out the forest was empty and still the path was deserted the highway was motionless and serene there was no movement anywhere in a thousand miles he started the car motor and let it idle the car was pointed east where the orange sun was now rising slowly all right he said quietly everyone here i come what a shame youre all still alive what a shame the world isnt just hills and hills and nothing else to drive over but hills and never coming to a town he drove away east without looking back
