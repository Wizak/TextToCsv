chapter one going south it was early spring and the sun was pouring through the window of a small flat on the first floor of an elegant threestorey house out of the window a pair of swans could be seen flying over the river which passed through the westcountry market town of pilton a woman jane honeywell stood at the window watching the swans flight dressed in her nightclothes a few days ago from her flat in the middle of manchester she had seen the sun rise between the rows of smokeblackened redbrick houses up into the polluted city sky here the sunlight was dancing on the water and the air was clean pilton was a small town of some inhabitants in the southwest of england there were a few factories which made things like clothes shoes chemicals and electrical parts but more importantly pilton was a market town where the farmers from the surrounding areas brought their cows and sheep to sell every thursday however these days there was not much money in farming especially on the small lonely hill farms fortunately for the local economy pilton was a popular part of the world for holidays in the summer thousands of people would bring their money and their families to the local beaches and villages which with their old cottages and pretty gardens seemed to belong to times past compared to the cities of the north and centre of the country here it was peaceful and quiet and beautiful the visitors would return home and dream of escaping to a rural life of changing seasons of digging the soil planting and harvesting at the moment though the woman was missing alan her exboyfriend and his morning cheerfulness what was he doing right now she could feel his absence in the weight of the silence around her she wondered how long it would take before her new environment would no longer feel like a foreign country professionally she had done the right thing there was no question about that but the memory of alans expressionless face as she had packed her suitcases filled her with a sharp sadness youre mad jane darling her mother had complained why dont you just marry him have some kids and settle down like everyone else my cats quite enough for me at the moment she had joked curiously unable to explain to her longsuffering mother that the relationship was going nowhere that she enjoyed her work too much to give it up for domesticity anyway alan had refused to leave his own work and go with her so that was that suddenly she became aware of a loud hissing sound and she looked round alarmed the milk for her coffee had boiled over and there was a steaming pool of sticky white liquid on the cooker she swore loudly simultaneously noticing the time it was nearly am oh my god im going to be late help julian you useless animal where are my tights jane addressed this question to her cat which was asleep on a chair by the window julian the cat was disgusted by his new home and had already fought with the large black cat next door working fast jane picked up a piece of toast and held it in her teeth she rescued what was left of the milk and poured it into a mug she looked briefly at the burnt mess on the cooker she would clean it up later with one hand she drank the mudcoloured coffee and ate her toast while with the other she searched through several open suitcases on the floor trying to find a pair of tights julian i must get organised she told the cat as piles of clothes fell out onto the floor julian took no notice in fifteen minutes she was ready she locked up the flat and went rapidly down the stairs outside it was chilly despite the spring sun there was a strong wind coming in off the sea from the southwest and she wished she had managed to find her winter coat when she finally spotted her silvergrey mazda sports car which she had left in a public car park round the corner she was unpleasantly surprised to see that around the door handle there were scratch marks and the door was unlocked someone had clearly forced it open oh no i dont believe it the bastards she groaned inside the car there was a black hole near the steering wheel and some wires were hanging loose from where the radio cassette player had once been i thought id left this kind of thing behind obviously not she muttered angrily getting in and starting the engine it took her more than twenty minutes to drive the four kilometres to her new place of work the town in which she had come to live apparently had serious traffic problems she sat in the long queue of cars nose to tail as they approached a roundabout and a wave of nerves began in her stomach made worse by the fact that she knew she would have to watch out for what her former boss had termed the dinosaurs the people to whom a woman in a senior management position was a foreign unwelcome creature the dinosaurs would be watching every move she made and would lose no time in putting her to the test arriving finally at her destination she glanced at her watch it was almost hurriedly she parked her car and then walked as calmly as she could manage up to the main entrance to the dull grey stone building that was pilton police station she pushed her hair back out of her eyes pulled her jacket down and opened the door well here goes good luck jane honeywell said to herself as she stepped inside chapter two nothing exciting ever happens good morning madam can i help you said the police constable at the reception desk looking at jane carefully who was this woman he did not remember having seen her before she was tall and her face was pretty with short dark hair neatly cut the sharp lines of her dark suit together with the white silk blouse and lowheeled black shoes gave her a businesslike appearance was she a lawyer new to the area come to visit one of the bad boys arrested in the night for stealing a car the policeman guessed accurately that she was in her early thirties good morning constable yes jane said holding up an identification card im detective chief inspector jane honeywell and as i expect you know im beginning work here today as head of the criminal investigation department and your name is oh er yes maam im police constable dick plumb maam pc plumb stammered looking confused he had heard a rumour that the new head of cid was going to be a woman but as he had not taken it all that seriously he had forgotten about it whats the matter constable plumb is there a problem jane thought she knew what the problem was have you never seen a dci wearing a skirt before yes er no maam no problem no problem at all said constable plumb hurriedly in that case jane said do you think you could tell the superintendent that im here please yes maam of course said pc plumb if youd like to go through that door and sit down ill ask him to come down unsure whether to open the door for her maybe she wouldnt like it he remained behind his desk and picked up the internal phone strange that pc plumb didnt seem to be expecting me she reflected as she waited didnt they communicate with each other properly in this place all things considered jane honeywell was glad she had come here it had all happened very quickly she had seen the dci job in pilton advertised a new type of place from what she was used to but it would be useful experience especially if she wanted to reach the very top her boss had encouraged her to go for the necessary promotion even though she was perhaps a little too young to be a detective chief inspector come on jane he had persuaded her we need some more bright women at the top in the police force and youve got what it takes i know it and the boys respect you oh yeah ha ha she had been doubtful go on theyll love you go for it unconvinced she nevertheless prepared for the interview discovering that the area for which pilton police station served as the divisional headquarters was huge as it included the surrounding countryside and several other market towns besides pilton much of the police work she guessed would probably involve a lot of time driving from village to village afterwards she had joked with superintendent george ferguson the pilton divisional head no doubt the guys make sure they go past a nice country pub in the middle of nowhere at lunchtime oh yes george had agreed with a smile clearly liking her blunt sense of humour they can certainly fill up the hours doing very little if they put their minds to it then to her surprise her promotion had gone through and she had been offered the pilton job and now finally here she was in a place she imagined which was light years away from the northern city ways with which she had grown up hello there a tall greyhaired man in his fifties appeared at the foot of a flight of stairs and held out a hand welcome to pilton jane thank you sir jane replied with a smile giving george fergusons hand a firm shake come on then come and meet the gang ill show you round and then leave you to get settled youll find several reports on your desk waiting for your attention they set off up the stairs and george opened the door into a room full of computers and strange faces mostly though not quite all male everyone stopped work and turned to look at jane as she came in all of a sudden the room was quiet except for the sound of the computers id like you all to meet dci jane honeywell george announced as you know she will be taking over the running of this department as from today good morning everyone jane addressed her new colleagues well im delighted to be here i hope well all get along together as the day goes on ill be talking to each of you im a handson kind of manager so i dont stay in my office with the door always closed there was silence and nobody moved after a short pause a womans voice murmured nice to meet you maam welcome to pilton from somewhere in the room jane could just hear a soft laugh she thought she caught the words hands on what though she could not be sure all right she smiled ill be seeing you all later as she and george went out behind her several people started talking at once theyre a good crowd really superintendent ferguson told her dont take them too seriously no sir said jane i wont once they see they can trust you youll have no trouble george continued youve come to us from a big city but life moves slowly down here people are used to the way things are and they dont like change as im sure youll appreciate after a tour of the building they were back where they had started in the corridor outside the cid office which could be observed through some internal windows some of the occupants had noticed her presence and stared unsmiling as she and george went into her new office well this is where youll be george said ill come back a little later and well go through a few bits and pieces i expect youll find we do things differently down here george disappeared and with a sense of relief jane sat down at her desk she was still in a sweat from having to hurry to arrive on time she needed to try to relax she turned and looked behind her through the external windows beyond the houses there were rolling hills and green fields and between the hills and the town the river wound its way out to the atlantic ocean only a few kilometres in the distance away from the coast the land rose sharply up to the hills which formed a national park here sheep fed on the rough grass of open moorland and hill farmers worked hard for a living could be worse i suppose she said to herself she had just begun to read through a long report on the recent wave of small crimes when she was interrupted by a knock at the door and a young woman in her twenties came in with a tray of coffee jane remembered her face from the cid office hello she said you are detective constable maggie pincombe maam pleased to meet you maggie jane smiled then after a moment she asked just out of interest how many women are there in this station well maggie thought for a moment let me see not many really theres one or two new constables who have just started on the beat which makes half a dozen there plus a few in traffic only men in special operations and dogs but theres me and detective sergeant penny kingdom in cid she finished cheerfully oh said jane was that penny i saw over by the window in the office talking to someone yes that was her said maggie with di pete fish hes been in charge till you got here he applied for promotion to dci you know didnt get it though really jane said yes maggie went on if you can get pete fish on your side you wont have any trouble thanks for the tip jane smiled with more confidence than she felt oh maggie ive just remembered someone broke into my car last night and stole my radio cassette player ill need an incident report form oh no thats bad luck maggie was sympathetic theres a lot of car crime round here its been on the increase for the last six months so i see from this report jane said thats what we spend most of our time on maggie told her plus the occasional house breaking nothing really exciting ever happens later back in her flat jane stared hopelessly at the chaos on the floor in the sitting room she was too exhausted to do anything about it tonight she picked up a cloth and started to rub at the burnt milk on the cooker what if she had made a dreadful mistake would she really be able to win the trust of her new colleagues should she just pick up her suitcases and go back to manchester just then the phone rang hello love well how was your first day did you get on all right the northern accent was unmistakable oh hello mum jane said weakly yes thanks fine everythings fine it was comforting after all to talk to a familiar voice after speaking to her mother for a while she felt more cheerful tomorrow was another day and she had to continue her chats with each of the members of her team especially pete fish who had somehow managed to avoid her today chapter three time to wake up a week later on monday evening at about pm jane was sitting in her flat a glass of wine in her hand and julian the cat curled up on the sofa next to her the suitcases had gone from the sitting room and were piled in her bedroom and most though not quite all of them contents were now in cupboards and drawers it had been the first flat she had looked at when she had come down for her interview and she had liked it immediately because of its river view unfortunately she had been in such a rush that she had not really noticed that the yellow flowery wallpaper was not to her taste never mind redecorating would give her something to do outside work it had become clear after a few days that the department needed a shakeup unlike manchester where the police force struggled hard to contain violent crimes and drugrelated offences her new colleagues seemed to take a more relaxed approach when she enquired about the steadily increasing number of car thefts and house breakins jane was informed that these crimes were probably being carried out by just one or two people most likely incomers to the area from the north they had said pointedly you know its five per cent of the population that commits ninetyfive per cent of the crime dc tony reilly told her well round here its one per cent its just a matter of working through the usual suspects easy despite the apparent simplicity of the action needed the crimes had remained unsolved for too long jane thought so while mindful of george fergusons warning about making changes she decided that her department needed to try a different approach earlier today she had asked detective inspector pete fish to come into her office she knew she ought to discuss her ideas with him despite the fact that in their first meeting he had not been especially communicative yes maam what can i do for you he had asked this morning as he leant against the door of her office a large man with broad shoulders and a slightly overweight stomach he said maam in an american accent for a joke and he was grinning in a way that was annoying he had looked pleased with himself as if he knew something that she didnt just then the phone by her elbow rang bringing her back to the present yes she said sorry to disturb you maam said a voice she thought was pc plumb but a body has been found what good grief who said nothing ever happened around here ok im on my way give me the details jane felt herself switching into a familiar routine one that she had imagined she would not have to use very often in this rural location its at chittleham farm up on the moor you take the main road out of pilton and first left after yarde gate cross if youve got a map youll see it pc plumb told her dont worry ill find it tell the rest of them to get out there will you the fi i mean di fish is already out there he was on duty this evening he said to call you nice of him jane thought she could just imagine his grinning face outside the usual southwest wind was whistling through the quiet streets and rain hammered on the roofs of the houses and parked cars jane found her car and with her map open on the seat next to her she set off a little anxiously for the moor she would not have chosen this particular night to go driving around in the dark in an unknown part of the countryside while she tried to concentrate on the task of finding her way her thoughts kept slipping back to her earlier conversation with pete fish ok pete she had said come in and shut the door standing in front of her desk she had noticed that she was as tall as he was all these stolen cars she had begun looking him straight in the eyes we really should do something about them i think were doing all we can maam pete fish replied he stopped talking in his american accent and yawned slightly im afraid i dont agree pete jane told him bluntly lets see what do you usually do you find someone who you know has committed one of the crimes then you persuade him to admit that he has done another fifteen similar jobs which is fine it makes life easy for everyone but then how do you explain the fact that the rate for these crimes is increasing well pete fish explained the word on the street is that its criminals from up north they come in on our nice new motorway take a car and drive it out of the area as fast as they can then it goes onto the national computer and theres nothing more for us to do oh come on thats pathetic do you just sit here and wait for it happen jane said how about setting up a few road checkpoints or some observation posts there are not enough people to do all that pete said and why not well pete said as youll know weve got a zero tolerance scheme on street crime operating at the moment all the drunks thieves and undesirables that get arrested well they have to be transported to prison to court that uses up a lot of vehicles and staff zero tolerance schemes dont work jane pointed out the bad guys just move elsewhere possibly petes reply had been short almost rude lets get things straight right from the beginning pete jane had said realising that she had to get tough you may not like the fact that im your boss but im here to stay so youll have to get used to it ill discuss zero tolerance with superintendent ferguson in the meantime im going to draw up plans for a major crackdown on car crime and burglaries it seems to me that life is a bit quiet round here in fact its so quiet i think youre all asleep well its time to wake up now yes maam pete had not looked happy but quite honestly i think itll be a waste of time well ill be the judge of that thank you jane turned away to continue working pete went out shutting the door loudly jane could see through the internal windows that he was talking to some of the other men in the cid office from time to time they looked towards her room laughing now thinking about this incident as she was driving along in the dark and the rain jane would have preferred not to have to face pete and the others tonight she had not particularly wanted to come into conflict with the men she would have to work with so soon after starting her job and now there was a serious crime to deal with she could not afford to make any mistakes oh hell was that yarde cross gate she would have to walk back to the signpost she stopped the car and taking a torch walked back to where she thought she had seen a signpost she reached the crossroads and found that the signpost no longer gave any useful information one arm had fallen off and the other pointed back to where she had come from annoyed she went back to her car and studied her map though she could make no sense of it she would just have to carry on until there was another sign about three kilometres further on there was a left turn and a small house on the corner where there was a light in an upstairs window she decided to knock at the door im sorry to bother you she said to the elderly man who looked nervously round the halfopen door but im looking for chittleham farm she showed him her police identity card he looked carefully at it seemed satisfied and mumbled something in a strong local accent but with the high wind and his strange accent jane could hardly make out what he was saying she understood however that she was going in the right direction thanks im sorry to have got you out of bed she said and set off again to her relief the old man was right after a couple of minutes there were blue flashing lights ahead and drawing nearer she could see several police cars their yellow stripes glowing in the dark a black and white sheepdog appeared barking loudly as she drove down a narrow lane leading to a large farmhouse she parked and walked towards a uniformed officer behind whom a group of people were talking excitedly one of the figures moved away from the group and approached her it was detective inspector pete fish chapter four not a pretty sight evening maam nice night to be out isnt it pete remarked got your boots on its a bit wet dont worry ill be all right she followed pete into a field and they climbed a slight hill the wind and rain and wet grass at her feet were cold she held her coat tight around her and shivered you found the place all right then pete asked pleasantly making conversation oh yes no problem i knocked at a house a mile or two back and woke up an old man couldnt understand a word he said but i got the general idea jane replied equally polite the local accents strong isnt it youll get used to it pete was obviously smiling in the dark they approached a large tent at the top of the hill the tent was brightly lit by powerful lamps and they could see shadows of people moving around the scene of the crime pete gave jane some plastic slippers to put over her shoes and they went into the tent and through a circle of red tape inside several sceneofcrime officers socos dressed in white coverall suits were moving around an old pickup truck busily collecting fingerprints filming the scene with a video camera and looking with great care through the covered area for hairs fibres blood anything which might provide vital clues pete introduced jane to a woman holding a torch this is dr pat james the pathologist how do you do jane said shaking hands vaguely aware that she was pleased to find another woman in a largely male world want to have a look its not a pretty sight pat james said pointing her powerful torch into the back of the pickup truck where a woman in her early forties lay on her back as if she had just fallen asleep behind the womans head some bags of animal feed were piled on top of each other halfcovered by a rubber sheet she was wearing boots thick trousers and a heavy jacket as if she had been out walking perhaps across the moor in death her face had collapsed inwards like a balloon from which the air had escaped but there was not much blood just some on the top of her head where someone had made an ugly wound and probably broken her skull who is she jane turned to pete rose carter from south heasley thats a village just outside pilton he explained we got an id from the cards in her wallet so who found her jane asked a local lad apparently pete answered brian millman he helps the farmer during lambing time as i expect you know lambs are born at all times of the day or night and the sheep have to be checked regularly thank you for that explanation jane murmured not at all anyway brians a bit simple according to the farmer the farmers mervin peck by the way he farms the place on his own apart from the help that brian gives him look at that pete pointed at a large wooden box on the ground close to the pickup but jane had already started to walk towards the box which had legs and a sloping roof what is it she asked er its a beehive pete said with some amusement havent you ever seen one before not like that jane said sharply whats it doing there it was on top of the rubber sheet that covered the body pete replied he grinned with boyish enthusiasm its like something out of a detective novel the beekeeper murderer you know the murderers signature well perhaps jane replied a little stiffly more likely the beehive was the nearest heavy object to hold the sheet down its very windy you know come on we need to talk tо the farmer and this boy in the farmhouse kitchen the farmer mervin peck was sitting in a brown armchair that was so old the insides were falling out two uniformed police constables were standing with their backs to a large oldfashioned cooker a young man of around seventeen or eighteen was seated on a wooden chair resting an elbow on a big square table on which stood several empty mugs half a bottle of milk and a bag of sugar nobody was speaking although it was warm enough inside the impression was оf a house given the minimum of attention there were no curtains at the windows and the ancient worn carpet was caked with mud spiders webs hung in dark corners the oncewhite walls and ceiling were dusty and yellow with the stain of tobacco smoke obviously the need of the farm and its animals came before those of housework and home decoration good evening sir jane said to the farmer im dci jane honeywell im afraid we have to ask you a few questions yes said mervin peck in a dull voice go ahead well can you tell us what happened please she asked quietly i was asleep mervin began as if he was unaccustomed to speaking gone to bed early lambing time see next thing i know is the boy there brian hes pulling at me shouting some nonsense about the police couldnt understand what he was on about anyway i had to get up go outside with him took me up into the field with the truck in it is your pickup truck then sir pete interrupted is that where you normally keep it often leave it in the field overnight if its got feed in the back saves time in the morning what time was this jane asked about couldnt understand what he wanted so i started to shout at him hes not quite all there you know never know what hell do next sometimes mervin touched the side of his head with his forefinger we got to the pickup and he pointed at the back at the beehive first i thought he just wanted to show me the beehive and i thought terrific wakes me up just for this then i realised he wanted me to look under the sheet pulled it back and there was a pair of feet sticking out i tell you it gave me a fright aint never seen a dead body before i mean i seen plenty of dead animals but not a human being tried pushing the feet just in case it was an old tramp or someone having a sleep but they didnt move they looked like a womans feet quite small you know neatlooking anyway brian said hed wanted another bucket and came out here to get one from the pickup i said wed better get the police and he said could he dial like they do on tv did you have a look at the womans face jane asked him youre right it is a woman no didnt want to mervin said flatly do you have any idea who she might be none at all he replied dont know who she is or how she got there theres only me lives here and noone comes up here except brian and my brother he keeps his bees out in one of the fields her names rose carter pete said never heard of her said mervin will i be on tv asked brian maybe son you did well pete told him well done brian looked pleased did you see anyone here today brian jane asked yes i saw mr peck brian seemed surprised by the question no i mean anyone else jane said brian seemed to become suddenly shy he looked at the floor what time did you come to work today brian jane tried again brian looked at mervin hes no good at telling the time mervin explained he starts work at about five in the afternoon does pm to am lives just up the road with his grandfather old mr millman he must have been the old man i spoke to jane thought outside a vehicle could be heard arriving jane stood up and went out of the house to watch the body now contained in a body bag being loaded into the back of the undertakers car and taken away to the mortuary for a postmortem from behind her pete murmured well this is your first major incident maam im aware of that thank you fish jane said sharply i want an incident room set up immediately with everyone in the department involved we may need to call in some help from the other departments i want everyone there at am on the door chapter five the investigation begins the next morning the cid office was electric with excitement when jane arrived just before am people were gathered together in small groups or else rushing all around with pieces of paper and answering endlessly rinnging phones youd think there had never been a good lider before jane thought to herself as pete walked in through the open office door good morning maam he said all smiles despite his and her tired appearance he needed a shave and there were dark shadows below his eyes id appreciate it if you would knock before you come in pete jane said even if you have been up all night sorry maam he said can you come into cid now weve had to book a news conference for as the local media have somehow got hold of the story already ok well talk to the team first then ill deal with the press jane said lets go in the crowded cid office people had found seats wherever they could on chairs and tables everyone wached jane expectantly as she walked over to a large whiteboard at one end of the untidy room talk us through what weve got so far will you pete she instructed him ok well besides the id on the body not a lot as yet ieo postmortem results should be in around midday mr peck says he left his pickup in the field at about pm yesterday before the lad arrived and he gave us his brothers name and address a mr jack peck lives at llford terrace pilton married no children works at hunter products in pilton what about the socos they get anything detective sergeant penny kingdom spoke up some fingerprints off the pickup truck and the beehive which theyre running a computer check on now pete said plus quite a lot of bits and pieces we can run dna checks on right then jane said we need to get as much background as we can did rose carter work who were her friends what do the neighbours know about her when was the last time she was seen and where what was she doing before she died and why you know the stuff i hope jane watched as pete wrote on the whiteboard all the questions that she had just listed just so we dont forget anything he said she looked at him with raised eyebrows its a while since any of us have had to do this you know he said defensively mm i can see that jane said anyway when ive spoken to the journalists im off to chittleham farm again id like to look around in daylight shall i come along too pete asked no id like you to stay and look after things here jane replied didnt he think she could handle mr peck or what would you like a driver just in case in case what oh all right i suppose i might get lost in the depths of the countryside and you might never see me again jane said acidly in fact it would probably be quicker to have someone with her who knew the way tony you come with me please dont forget your boots pete added with a grin a wave of laughter sounded in the room chittleham farm dc tony reilly parked the police car while jane got out and walked up to the uniformed policeman standing guard outside the farmhouse there was no sign of the black and white sheepdog today mr pecks out in the fields maam the policeman told jane inside the house was deathly quiet and the large farm kitchen did not look any better in daylight than it had at midnight if anything it was even more dirty and untidy on the shelf above the cooker there were some photos in dusty frames of sheepdogs and prize sheep among them was a photo of a small group of people mervin looking about ten years younger and the others were presumably his mother and father and brother as jane was studying the photos the door opened suddenly and mervin came in can i help you he said in an unfriendly voice oh hello i was here last night jane said perhaps you dont remember me what do you want id like to look round a bit if you dont mind jane said do i have a choice mervin growled why did that woman have to lie down and die in my truck i tell you its not funny got enough to do im afraid somebody killed her jane said oh he said did they can you tell me what you did during the day yesterday jane asked him no different from any other day went into buxton for a few bits and pieces from the agricultural supplies shop in the morning spent the afternoon cleaning sheeps feet feeding the animals checking the lambs as usual was anyone else here no i havent got an alibi if thats what you mean mervin stared out of the dusty window jane watched his large workroughened hands which were playing with a piece of yellow string and some small rubber bands his face was reddened by the wind and rain his hair greying and untidy he was probably in his forties but he could have been fifty she thought she had not understood before that farming was such a hard life she became aware that he was uncomfortable in her presence but then he must have realised he was a suspect is that your brother jack jane asked pointing to the family photo on the shelf yes replied mervin how often do you see him couple of times a month usually he comes out at weekends to see to his bees its his hobby whats his job exactly jane asked oh the company makes agricultural products but to tell you the truth im not exactly sure what it is jack does would you mind showing me around jane asked leaving tony reilly at the house jane and mervin walked down the muddy lane to the farmyard this is the sheep shed where the lambs and ewes are mervin said leading jane into a large ugly metalroofed building on one side of a concrete yard inside the sound of the sheep bleating became suddenly deafening as they caught sight of mervin who usually brought their food all jane could see was an army of woolly coats pushing and fighting to be the first to reach what they must have hoped was a food bucket in one inner she noticed five or six sheep separated from the rest by a large sheet of metal they seemed to have open wounds on their faces and their heads hung low unlike the others they showed no interest in the appearance of the humans whats wrong with them jane shouted above the noise iveii to her city eyes these animals looked a little sick ah just got some sort of infection mervin replied he raplied unconcerned jane pointed outside to a small building on the other side of the yard whats in there she enquired a few orphan lambs was the blunt response jane wanted to go back to the murder site so they walked up the hill to the pickup from this high point there was a good view over the whole farm and in several miles jane could see lambs running and jumping while their mothers fed peacefully on the rich grass every now hid again one lamb would bleat anxiously a ewe would hii her head and answer and the lamb would go running inwards her looking around jane noticed in the distance a field miuaining twenty or so of the same wooden beehives she had seen the night before by the pickup those must be your brothers bees she said yes mervin said he rents that field off me but its not worth it as far as im concerned those bloody bees of his are dangerous go near them and theyll come after you quick as anything he rubbed his arm something about the place made jane uncomfortable perhaps it was the idea that somewhere in this beautiful picturepostcard scene a killer was hiding perhaps it was something about mervin himself she could not decide if he was telling the truth on the way back to the house she said therell be a team coming out shortly to search the area for evidence just as long as they shut the gates mervin growled that photo i was looking at id like to borrow it please for our records all right said mervin in an unfriendly voice if you must chapter six an ordinary respectable woman back at the police station jane was eating a cheese sandwich in her office when pete walked in holding some papers ah youre here he said get anything useful ive already asked you once to knock before you come in jane said shortly sorry there was a brief silence then jane said well have to go and see the brother of mervin but she frowned what got some ideas already no no its just that farm gave me the creeps that mervin never looks me in the eyes when he talks i dont trust him he might just be shy a lot of farmers are they spend all the days with their animals so they forget how to talk properly they lose the power of speech pete explained he grinned suddenly especially when theyre talking to live young woman jane glared at him you dont need to make comments like that thank you she said maybe not but its a fact she had just opened her mouth to make a suitable response when there was a knock at the office door and ds penny kingdom came in with the postmortem results thank you penny jane said glancing through the report well cause of death was a severe blow to the head with some kind of blunt instrument pure and simple no suggestion of any kind of sexual attack nothing in the blood nothing else at all an otherwise healthy individual time of death was sometime during the afternoon between six and twelve hours before mervins call a recent insect bite around the same sort of time on the left hand probably a bee or wasp sting why cant they ever be more specific must have been a bee pete said its too early in the year for wasps i meant the time of death actually jane said was the guy being deliberately simple what else aha they found some bits of skin under the fingernails well need a dna test done on those thats about it anyway do you have some more information pete well he began as we know rose carter lived in south heasley he paused looking through his notes yes and jane said impatiently just a minute hold on ah here we are she taught maths and statistics parttime at the secondary school in buxton ill visit the school this afternoon and ill also go out to south heasley take some people to look round her house see what else we can find at the moment it looks as if she was an ordinary respectable sort of woman but who knows maybe she had a secret life maybe pete anything more from forensics penny only that so far theres no match on the national database for the fingerprints penny replied so noone we know then ok off you go and take this photo with you as well as all this ive got to write an operational order for a crackdown on car and house thefts as i believe i mentioned to you before pete groaned oh that yes that how about calling it operation wasp very amusing maam pete said as he and penny went out of janes office hows it going superintendent george ferguson asked jane a little while later as they carried their trays of tea and biscuits to a seat in the police canteen ok but its early days yet sir jane replied shall we be here it seems rose carter was killed by a single blow to the head with something like a hammer or an iron bar i dont think its the work of a mentally disturbed killer more likely someone with a more rational motive shed also recently been stung by a bee as far as i know bees sting people who make them angry george said and what makes a bee angry is being disturbed which rather suggests that she was walking around mervins farm jane said his brother keeps bees there according to mervin theyre particularly badtempered but the question is what was she doing there mervin insists that rose was a complete stranger to him is mervin a suspect george asked he has to be jane replied by his own admission he has no alibi he was on his own all afternoon on the other side theres no obvious motive anyway ill go and see his lumber later and pete fish should be back soon from rose carters cottage plus the team looking over the farm may find something hopefully a murder weapon at least well and how is fish then behaving himself oh well hes a bit of a dinosaur but hes all right really anyway now that hes got a real murder to deal with he hasnt got time to annoy me jane grinned but theyre a bit laidback down here arent they youre out in the country now dont forget george reminded her im not allowed to forget it either jane laughed oops talk of the devil pete fish came into the restaurant and walked straight to their table he seemed to be in a hurry im sorry to interrupt maam he said ive got something you should see immediately do you mind not at all excuse me sir jane said to george getting up with her mouth full of biscuit they went to the cid office where dc tony reilly and ds penny kingdom were sitting at a desk piled high with papers i think were really beginning to get somewhere maam pete began looking pleased with himself good lets hear it then jane said well we went to roses school in buxton she was well liked by the staff and pupils there and theyre very upset penny spoke to a teacher called freda sweeney who said she was quite close to rose apparently rose was very keen on animals and she that is freda thought that she rose get on with it pete get your pronouns sorted out said jane my what oh i see what you mean said pete slightly embarrassed rose had joined some kind of local animal rights group do we have a name jane asked no unfortunately also penny broke in freda came out with the fact that rose had been having an affair with a married man only no ones supposed to know about it i asked her if she knew the name and she said that rose once called him mervins brothers name is jack observed jane pete raised his eyebrows you wait he said theres more at south heasley tony and i spoke to the couple in u house next door to roses like everyone else they are shoked by whats happened cant believe it they said rose was a wonderful woman who did a lot of work in the community obviously very respectable anyway i asked them if theyd noticed if shed had many visitors anyone regular in small villages you know everyone knows what everyone else is doing do they really how useful jane remarked where would we be without your expert knowledge of rural habits he looked offended im trying to be helpful here go on well i said she probably had a secret life didnt i the neighbours said that a man used to come to visit her regularly about once a week sometimes more usually in the afternoons they didnt know who he was but he was well dressed usually wore a suit middleaged drove a white ford escort estate with а к registration number plate sometimes theyd wave to him but he always acted as he didnt notice we showed them the photo with jack in it and they said they thought it was the same man time to pay a visit to mr jack peck then jane said yes maam sure is pete said doing his texan accent god i hate it when he does that jane thought penny said we also got this from roses house she held up a diary well done jane said id like to look at that right then its nearly now jack peckll be finishing work soon i imagine wed better go straight to his home oh yes so he will good idea pete said thanks said jane acidly just then dc maggie pincombe joined the group thought you might like to know theyve found a bike she announced where several people said at once on mervin pecks farm some way from the house any sign of a murder weapon maggie jane asked no said maggie not yet chapter seven the beekeeper at about pm a police car pulled up outside the suburban house in ilford terrace pilton in the driveway of which a white к registration ford escort estate car was parked jane and pete walked up to the front door through the tidy garden planted out with sweetsmelling roses and soft grass the door opened almost before they had knocked and a tall man in his middle forties stood looking at them he was dressed formally in a suit and tie and his dark hair greyin at the sides framed a face that was coldly handsome good evening sir cid jane said as she and pete displayed their identity cards yes the man did not move are you mr jack peck brother of mervin peck of chittleham farm i am the voice was cautious and not very welcoming we have a few questions to ask you as you may know hunman was found dead on your brothers farm yesterday may we come in for a bit jane asked lts a little inconvenient i have to go out soon jack peck said but well all right but i dont know what help i can give you he showed them into a wellfurnished comfortable room filled with objects from foreign coutinies persian carpets arabic coffee pots chinese vases and paintings the contrast with his brothers house was striking the furniture was polished the cushions smoothed there was no dust to be seen and a sweet smell of flowers filled the air you have some lovely things here jane remarked looking around oh collected on my travels jack peck replied does your work take you abroad then it used to not any more unfortunately do you mind me asking what you do jane enquired i work at hunter products in the research department jack told her we make agricultural chemicals and animal vaccines not very exciting im afraid nice painting pete said pointing to a large watercolour of an attractive woman on the wall is that your wife well it is as a matter of fact but i dont know what it has to do with you do you have something particular to ask me jack sounded impatient yes sir jane frowned at pete do you keep bees on your brothers farm yes its a hobby of mine i cant keep them here as we dont have a big enough garden do i understand that you think mervins connected with this horrible business jane ignored his question how often do you visit chittleham farm she asked it depends depends on the time of year and what the bees are doing not a lot in the winter but theyre waking up now so about once or twice a month i suppose at the moment that is your car outside i imagine sir pete said indicating the white ford escort it is look whats all this about i hope you dont think i had anything to do with it we have to check everything sir jane said would you mind telling me where you were yesterday afternoon i was at work you can confirm that at the factory you didnt leave the building no i was there all the time i told you you can check because all arrivals and departures of staff and visitors are recorded did you know the dead woman rose carter pete enquired for a moment jack appeared about to lose control of his emotionless exterior yes he said quietly how well jane asked through my work she does i mean she did a bit of parttime statistical work for us so i used to see her from time to time to give her the material data analysis stuff im sorry she died in suchunfortunate circumstances he spoke with difficulty when did you see her last sir jane asked last thursday actually i went to collect some figures from her but she hadnt quite finished the work just then a dark green mg sports car drew up outside the house as the driver got out jack said thats my wife susan peck came into the front room carrying some large bags from local department stores like her husband she was elegantly dressed giving an impression not of wealth exactly but certainly of being very comfortable definitely a member of the towns privileged classes jane thought darling these are the police from the cid jack explained oh good evening susan peck said i suppose youre here because of that poor woman on my brotherinlaws farm i heard about it on the local news how terrible yes madam jane said were just going just for the record where were you yesterday afternoon excuse me a look of alarm appeared on susan pecks face you were out shopping werent you jack peck addressed his wife he seemed to want the interview to be concluded as rapidly as possible well yes i was but susan stammered if youll excuse us inspector jack turned to jane were due to meet some friends at the theatre very soon of course thank you for your help jane said jane and pete walked down the garden path while behind them the raised voices of jack and his wife could be heard apparently having an argument shes been out spending all his hardearned money i reckon pete said possibly jane replied unable to stop herself being annoyed by petes typically male remark but i dont think we know all there is to know about mr and mrs jack peck yet chapter eight a head full of bees perhaps it was a crime of passion jane thought to herself perhaps mervin was jealous of his brother jack jane stepped out of the shower wrapped a towel round her and went into the kitchen to make some coffee it was a beautiful morning the spring sunshine filled the flat breakfast julian she asked her cat pouring him some milk while he miaowed with pleasure what do you think julian she said out loud julian drank his milk of course theres susan his wife as well if she knows about the affair she would have a motive does she have an alibi she asked the cat jane had spent part of the previous evening looking through rose carters diary in among the shopping lists appointments reminders to go to the dentist doctor and so on were some entries which needed further investigation jane had noticed for example that once a month since last november the name of a farm appeared in the diary such as ladywell farm upcott farm beare farm chittleham farm had been the farm for february the previous month did this mean that rose had visited all these farms on the day rose had died the diary entry was again chittleham farm why was chittleham farm written down twice was rose in fact a regular visitor there some of the other entries were also interesting but probably explained by roses working relationship with jack peck at least once a week the initials jp and a time such as or had been written on the thursday before rose died the entry read jp there was also the question of the relationship between rose carter and jack peck it was school gossip that rose had been having an affair presumably with jack peck sitting in the daily traffic jam she planned the day she would go to jacks workplace herself to check out his alibi and send pete or one of the others out to south heasley again although roses neighbours had seen his car regularly or a car like his had jack actually been there on monday afternoon after giving instructions in the cid office jane set off for hunter products it was situated on an industrial estate on the other side of the river as usual the queue of traffic proceeded slowly over the bridge and jane looked with annoyance again at the black hole by the steering wheel of her car must get that fixed sometime she thought since her arrival in pilton there didnt seem to have been a spare minute to attend to the little things that were necessary to run her life outside work she promised herself that when this case was over she would celebrate by going out and buying the best car stereo system she could find at the automatic barrier at the entrance to hunter products car park jane spoke into a microphone detective chief inspector jane honeywell pilton cid the word chief still felt a little strange to her but obviously not to anyone else as a faint voice replied all right madam and the barrier lifted driving in she noticed that several closedcircuit tv cameras were positioned around the car park and high up on the factory building inside the factory the reception area was spotlessly clean and there was a hint of chemical in the air a foxyfaced female half hidden behind a high reception counter asked jane can i help you jane showed her id and asked to speak to the person in charge this is a murder enquiry she added quickly in case the woman had any idea of putting her off ill see what i can do the receptionist said and picked up a phone she talked quietly into it for a minute or two and then told jane mrs keane will be down in a minute please have a seat she gestured in the direction of a large red leather sofa after about five minutes a tall woman dressed in a white silk suit came through the only door leading from the reception area jo keane managing director what can i do for you she smiled her clear blue eyes were set a little close together in an otherwise attractive face framed by soft dark curls jane thought they must be around the same age she shook the extended hand dci jane honeywell she said im looking into the murder incident out at chittleham farm which you may have heard about i believe chittleham farm belongs to the brother of one of your employees i wonder if you could spare me a minute or two jo keane looked briefly at her rolex watch ive got a couple of minutes but thats all im afraid how can i help thank you said jane can you confirm that mr jack peck works here he does replied jo keane hes one of our key people hes a research scientist in the animal vaccine department has he worked here long oh im not sure exactly without checking a few years before he came to us he was with a chemical company based in africa i believe they were working on a vaccine for malaria was mr peck at work last monday jane asked as far as i know if he went out itll be in the record ill have it brought down for you jo keane turned to the receptionist and asked her to fetch a copy of mondays records would it be possible for someone to leave the building without anyone knowing say for an hour or two jane asked while they waited for the receptionist to return no i dont think so were a small company here we all more or less know what each other is doing the receptionist reappeared and handed jane several sheets of computer paper you keep very careful records remarked jane looking through the papers there was no indication that she could see of jacks having left the factory after his arrival at work at am on monday well we like to know who comes in and out explained mrs keane would you mind if i borrowed the videos from the closed circuit system jane asked welljo keane hesitated im just interested in the car park and the entrances and exits to the building jane said ill only need them for hours or so well ok ill have them sent round to the police station jo keane said finally with a stiff smile later as jane sat at her desk staring at the computer printouts from hunter products on one side of her desk and a halfwritten operational order for operation wasp on the other there was a knock at the door and pete came in you knocked which is an improvement but youre also supposed to wait until i say come in you know jane remarked sorry said pete not really listening ive just got back irom south heasley that family photo i showed it to another of roses neighbours mary brady who wasnt at home the first time we went not only did she recognise jack but she also saw a white escort estate outside roses house early monday afternoon she didnt see the driver but she was positive it was jacks car so hes been lying to us that means he has something to hide i think weve got a prime suspect here erm unfortunately for us he has a perfect alibi jane said he was at work all afternoon its all in there she indicated the papers on her desk petes grin changed to a look of some disappointment anyway why would he want to kill rose easy said pete they had an argument maybe she said he should leave his wife he lost his temper he hit her on the head with i dont know a hammer then he got rid of her body on his brothers farm why there i dont know people do odd things perhaps he had to go there anyway to check his bees pete sounded unconvinced himself but i told you he didnt leave the factory all afternoon jane said are we sure pete asked more or less but im going to check the closed circuit tv videos at home tonight just to be absolutely certain want any help pete offered jane looked at him noticing that his resistance towards her had softened she wondered why i dont think so thanks she valued her privacy in any case there was a large pile of washingup in the sink and the bathroom needed cleaning and last nights dinner things were still on the sitting room table but if you need something to do you could see if you can get some names of animal rights groups operating in the area yes maam pete said with an ironic smile back at her flat jane went straight to the fridge as she had thought there was nothing to eat for dinner she tried the freezer a frozen lasagne that would do she put it in the microwave poured herself a large glass of red rioja wine and settled down in front of the tv to watch several hours of video film of the car parks and exits and entrances at hunter products ltd the film ran silently on and on for what felt like a lifetime jane found herself thinking that hunter products seemed to be very security conscious what were they worried about industrial spies she was beginning to feel sleepy when suddenly she thought she could see a figure who looked like jack peck walking across the car park the person was getting into a p registration mg sports car she played the film again to be sure there was no doubt about it it was definitely him the time on the video said of course why hadnt she thought of that before the pecks had two cars so if jack peck had used his wifes car last monday to go to work his wife could have taken his car the escort estate and the car had been seen outside koses cottage on monday afternoon that night jane slept badly once she woke sweating and realised she had been dreaming she had been running and running through fields and streams climbing over gates and hedges on a road a motorist stopped and she got into the car it was pete are you all right he asked no she answered i have to get away from the swans she looked out of the back window and saw following the car a small black cloud which seemed to be getting larger and larger as it caught up with them the cloud turned out tо be a swarm of bees she woke up when bees started appearing inside the car chapter nine the good news and the bad news at the next morning jane was sitting in superintendent george fergusons office of the two things she needed to discuss with him reporting on the rose carter case would be she thought a fairly easy task i think we have three possible suspects jane told george theres the farmer mervin peck who lives on chittleham farm and had plenty of opportunity but no obvious motive then theres jack peck his brother and his wife susan they both have alibis but i have the feeling one of them is hiding something what about forensic evidence george asked well that would provide the key i think if we could get some dna samples some hair or skin if none of the suspects will give samples willingly well either have to make some arrests or do something a bit clever ill leave it in your hands jane george smiled at her the second matter was a little more tricky in order to have sufficient staff and money for operation wasp jane needed to get georges agreement to a reduction in the zero tolerance activities the thing is sir jane explained a lot of car crime and burglaries are committed by people from out of town id like to try an experiment for a month or two with some road blocks and observation teams just to see what happens see if we can reduce the car crime and burglaries well ok then give it a try for two months george said reluctantly but remember the public like zero tolerance it gets the drunks off the streets for one thing after her meeting with george jane set off for ilford terrасе the green mg sports car was outside the house susan peck came to the front door and frowned slightly when she saw who her visitor was im sorry to disturb you madam but i need to speak to you for a moment jane said can i come in please susan peck turned wordlessly and walked back into her kitchen she switched off the radio and looked at jane expectantly on tuesday you told us you were out shopping the previous afternoon jane began thats right where did you go gо the supermarket and maybe one or two other places where exactly jane insisted i dont remember i had one or two calls to make why did you use your husbands car to do these things jane asked her yes i always use it when i go to the supermarket you cant get much in the mg jane took a breath mrs peck why did you visit rose carter last monday theres no point denying it she added as susan peck seemed about to protest you were seen by the neighbours this was not completely true but it was worth trying it worked susan peck sat down suddenly her head in her hands and her shoulders shaking she appeared to be weeping soundlessly ok she looked up tears welling up in her eyes i suppose i have to tell you i went to see rose carter because i was sure that my husband was having an affair with her theyve known each other for years and shortly after she moved down here a couple of years ago jack became very i dont know distant towards me he seemed to be spending a lot of time at her house working or so he said but her perfume was on his clothes at this point the tears started to run freely down her reddened cheeks im sorry susan peck said after a little managing to recover her selfcontrol look i didnt kill rose we just talked for a bit she told me that she had lately made a decision to stop the relationship then she rode off on her bike saying she had something to do she used to cycle everywhere i believe what time was this jane enquired about pm i think did rose give a reason for breaking off the relationship with your husband jane asked no susan peck said she wouldnt say after a pause she said nervously does this make me a suspect well mrs peck so far it looks as if you were the last person to see rose alive jane pointed out however if you agree to provide a dna sample we could take you off the list oh susan peck looked alarmed we just take a sample of your saliva its not painful ill send someone round then susan peck nodded all right she murmured jane honeywells team of detectives was all present when she walked into the cid office a little while later well would you like the good news she asked them mrs peck has agreed to give us a dna sample whats the bad news then tony reilly asked the bad news is that we still have nothing thats really any use jane said nothing that adds up to anything jack peeks alibi seems to stand up and i dont really think susan pecks a likely suspect jane sat down heavily at one of the desks ok whos going to go and get a dna sample from mervin peck they were saved from having to volunteer by the telephone detective chief inspector honeywell jane said into the phone what can i do for you oh a female voice said there was a short pause um my name is elisa scott i knew rose carter i dont know whether its important but i think i may know why she was out on that farm where they found her yes jane said please go on well rose belonged to our organisation paw project or animal welfare elisa scott explained her voice was quiet and gentle and without the local accent and whats that exactly jane asked well came the reply mainly we go around looking for cases of animals being badly treated and reporting them we do a lot of the legwork for the rspca and er its a little complicated the pleasant voice hesitated just tell me about rose then jane said ok elisa continued each member in the branch is responsible for a particular area what you do is you go round the farms in your area checking up that the farmer is looking after his animals properly chittleham farm was in roses area and she went there about a month ago she reported after her visit that she was worried about some of the sheep there and that perhaps she should go back again sometime then i saw her last friday and she said she was going to go out to chittleham farm for another look maybe the farmer found her and again the voice paused ms scott said jane i have to go out to chittleham farm in about half an hour anyway would you like to come with me you could show me exactly why your group is so concerned about the animals on mervin pecks farm of course whatever you want elisa scott replied jane put the phone down and turned to her team ok she said ill have a go at persuading mervin peck to supply a dna sample while im at the farm and pete can you organise the dna test for mrs peck please chapter ten the suspects got a gun how long had rose been a member of your group jane asked elisa as they drove towards chittleham farm well not long actually since about last october i think i met her at a party and we got talking then one day she just walked in and said she wanted to be involved tell me more about paw jane said well elisa began a little hesitantly are you one of these groups which employ what i would call doubtful methods you mean illegal sometimes i suppose were a little aggressive elisa said you wouldnt believe some of the things that go on there are puppy farms where they keep little dogs in cages in buildings far away from anywhere with no food or drink or daylight we dont warn anyone were coming so we can catch them doing things to animals which they shouldnt jane looked quickly from the road to elisa with some surprise the soft voice had suddenly filled with the passion felt by someone for whom the end completely justified the means you mean that you break in jane asked er well i shouldnt say so to you i suppose but yes we do if we think we have to i didnt hear that jane told her so is it possible that the farmer at chittleham farm had never seen rose carter before the afternoon she was killed yes its quite likely we prefer to go in and out without being seen jane wondered how elisa had learnt her skills in this kind of work i was in the army elisa said answering janes thoughts briefly at chittleham farm there was no sign of the sheepdog jane decided mervin must be out in the fields somewhere all right she said to elisa lets see if we can find out what was bothering rose about the sheep well we wont miss it if theres anything wrong elisa said the sheepll look terrible thin wool hanging off they may have wounds on them or they may be lying down and not get up when you go near them they passed the small wooden building in which mervin had said there were orphan lambs lets have a quick look in here while were passing jane said opening the door um i think this might be what rose was after she declared elisa looked over janes shoulder and drew her breath in sharply oh my goodness she said pushing past jane the five or six sheep inside did not move or raise their heads as she approached them they were lying on the floor still breathing but almost lifeless the air was thick with an evil mix of smells chemicals and diseased flesh these are seriously sick animals i dont know whats wrong with them but they shouldnt be here they could have a disease which should be reported to the authorities elisas voice died away as she suddenly glanced at a point behind jane jane turned and found herself looking into the barrel of a shotgun it was aimed directly at her and mervin peck was the one aiming it he did not look as if he was just out for an afternoons game shooting you have no right to be in here get out i know my rights you should have a search warrant to come in here nosing around he growled im afraid youre wrong there mr peck jane said firmly this is a crime scene and you are obstructing a police officer she felt in her bag found her mobile phone and started to call mervin turned and ran outside towards an old car parked in the yard jane followed but stopped when mervin pointed the gun at her again dont move or ill shoot he shouted she had no option but to watch as he climbed into the ancient vehicle surprisingly the engine burst into life and he drove quickly away up the lane elisa who had been examining the sick animals more closely reappeared in the yard come on jane shouted im going after him they ran to janes car and jumped in at the top of the lane they saw mervin turn left down a road that led towards buxton i know a short cut elisa said go down this lane we can cut him off we need some help jane said holding the steering wheel with one hand while trying to operate her mobile phone with the other the car was moving rapidly towardsai ditch watch out elisa cried give me that thing ill do it you watch the road while elisa held the mobile phone jane screamed into it above the noise of the car engine i need assistance urgently dont ask me to explain just get some armed cars out here fast the suspects got a gun she told them where they were and switched off the phone the lane was just wide enough for one car on each side was a high bank with a thick hedge on top and at its base a ditch the lane twisted and turned up and down hills and it was impossible to know whether or not there was a vehicle coming in the other direction jane could not see further than a few metres ahead and was able to drive at only kph at every bend in the road she just hoped for the best without warning the lane suddenly opened out onto a crossroads before jane realised what was happening mervins car shot across the road just in front of them to avoid hitting mervins vehicle she had to brake sharply the wheels of the mazda hit the stony edge of the lane and the car turned through ninety degrees slid sideways and came to a complete stop with one front wheel in the ditch the bottom of the engine was resting on the road surface while the other front wheel spun uselessly in the air are you all right jane asked elisa elisa nodded jane then turned off the engine and cursed bloody hell she got out to examine the car as she stared in frustration at the river of oil flowing out from underneath the car the sound of police sirens suddenly filled the air they seemed to be approaching from all directions including buxton where mervin was now headed jane realised that there was a strong likelihood that at least one car would meet mervin head on coming the other way just then a police car appeared on the road that mervin had come along its blue light flashing and the siren sounding jane waved it down and jumped in as it slowed quick she shouted hes gone down there a little further down the road they turned a corner and came across mervins car it was positioned at an angle across the narrow lane its nose buried in the high bank well well jane remarked to her driver looks like theyve got him black marks on the surface of the road showed where the car had slid to a stop by the side of a parked police car a uniformed police gunman was holding a gun aimed at mervins car as jane watched mervin got out his shaking hands held high chapter eleven the confession detective chief inspector jane honeywell walked into the interview room and felt suddenly certain that the man sitting at the table was the one responsible for the death of rose carter there was something about the look of the muscular shoulders the way the large rough hands played on the table and the deadness in the unfocussed eyes which stared blankly towards the floor pete followed her in and stood behind her as she took a chair and faced mervin peck who was accompanied by a lawyer this interview is being tape recorded jane repeated the required words as she had done so many times before i am interviewing would you please say your full name she looked at mervin and waited eventually mervin muttered at the floor mervin donald peck then jane stated the time and date and finished by saying this interview may be given in evidence if your case is brought to trial you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court anything which you do say may be given in evidence as she spoke jane was watching mervin closely he looked pale and sweat appeared on his nose and forehead she began her questions mr peck when you were arrested earlier you refused to explain why you threatened mе with a gun would you care to tell me now mervin did not respond jane tried again mr peck i think you may have some information concerning the death of rose carter again there was no answer instead mervin suddenly gripped his arm as if in pain mr peck youre in serious trouble you will be charged with threatening a police officer we will then be in a position to collect a dna sample from you which we can compare with samples we have taken from the scene of the crime if there is a positive match then you will also be charged with her murder it would save everyone a lot of time and trouble if you would tell us what we need to know now mervin looked at his solicitor who nodded all right ill tell you what you want mervins voice sounded rough like boots walking over moorland stones i have this temper sometimes it gets the better of me it was about in the afternoon i was in the shed doing the sheep as usual you know feeding and watering and chat came outside and thought i heard someone shout went round the side of the building and she was there looking at her hand and rubbing it she mustve been stung by a bee or something i dont know she said she was going to report me for not looking after my sheep properly told her to get off my land she just laughed at me i went towards her and she picked up an old axe that was lying around she mustve thought i was going to do something to her i tried to pull the axe away from her she was screaming at me and i went wild my arm was bad see the next thing i knew id got the axe from her and hit her with the side of it she fell immediately and was quiet hadnt meant to hit her just seemed to lose control somehow it was an accident really it was didnt mean to do it the words died away go on mr peck jane told him dont remember too clearly mervin continued i knew the boy was coming soon so id have to hide her thought of the pickup truck which id left in the top field earlier carried her up there and covered her with a tarpaulin and i put an old beehive on the top that was lying about in the field to stop the tarpaulin blowing off see was going to take her up to where theres an old tin mine on the moor later after dark sweat was by this time pouring down mervins ashcoloured face he asked for some water and drank it rapidly jane became aware of a strange unpleasant smell coming from him and what did you do after that she asked him the boy arrived and we had a lot to do with the ewes lambing and all later i went back in the house for something to eat and a bit of a sitdown but i must have fallen asleep the next thing i know is the boy is pulling at my arm saying i had to go outside with him mr peck would you please speak up now are you certain you had never seen rose carter before jane asked no mervin said but i know who she is now he laughed in a cracked broken fashion shes my brothers fancy woman thats what he phoned me the day after they took her away and it was on the local news he was upset because it was his girlfriend that had been found on my farm told him he should be grateful what do you mean mr peck grateful mervin looked confused for a moment i mean i mean my brothers got a wife its not right to carry on with other women is it he stammered i guess youre right mr peck jane said tell me if it was an accident why didnt you call the police dont know i panicked couldnt think straight my arm was giving me trouble see and id been up all the night before with the sheep spose i thought that noone had seen me noone would know seemed easier to get rid of the body less trouble where is the axe now at the bottom of the hole where i throw dead lambs and that kind of thing mervin fell silent he gripped his arm and gave a groan of pain jane realised suddenly that the man was probably quite ill his eyes were overbright and he was plainly feverish he stared up at her and she saw in his eyes the same expression as she had seen in his sick sheep she didnt know if it was the look of a troubled conscience or of fever or both mr peck are you feeling all right no as it happens cant stand this pain in my arm much longer he whispered mervins lawyer glanced at jane and opened his mouth but she spoke first all right then wed better stop for a bit so a doctor can take a look at you she said well that was all rather strange jane remarked to pete a little while later after the police doctor had examined mr peck the doctor confirmed that he was indeed not well enough to be questioned and arranged for him to be admitted to the local hospital what do you mean pete asked well hes obviously quite ill for one thing but thats not what i mean really jane said from what he says he has an uncontrollable temper and hell use violence and hes quite prepared to throw a dead person into a hole like one of his sheep yet he disapproves of his brother having an affair the man has a rather twisted sense of right and wrong listen pete said farmers work with animals theyre used to violence nature is violent up on the moor on his own all the time only talking from time to time with a boy whos simple not seeing another human being for days its not surprising that things get out of proportion i suppose youre right jane said slowly but i still think theres something not quite right about all this it seems odd that he hit her on the head simply because he lost his temper we dont need to worry about that pete said weve got the confession on tape hes told us where to find the murder weapon as soon as hes recovered we can charge him and itll go to court with no problem thats it come on lets go and celebrate in the pub ill buy you whatever you want well thats some offer jane laughed i mean whatever you want to drink pete said going a little red we havent charged him yet isnt it a little too early to start celebrating she remarked never mind about that come on lets go and relax now we deserve it ive got to get my car fixed jane said you dont need to worry about that either its already in the garage for our mechanics to look at pete smiled jane looked at him in some surprise how thoughtful of him to have arranged that for her it was well after oclock when jane ordered a red wine in the pub and found a table pete followed behind her with a large glass of beer er pete began as they sat down this case maam its kind of hard for me to say this but im impressed with the way youve handled it you know i was hoping for your job myself so i wasnt too pleased when they gave it to someone else especially especially what jane said knowing what he would say she could read him like a book well you know were a bit oldfashioned around here and and well i guess i shouldnt say this kind of thing these jays but i really didnt think it was a womans job but um i can see i was wrong prejudiced there was a pause in the conversation wheres a good place to get a car stereo jane said suddenly he smiled at her showing a row of even white teeth well as it happens i know someone with a shop if you need advice on stereos you can rely on me he was clearly relieved to be talking about a familiar subject jane looked at him closely for the first time since they had had their difference of opinion last monday morning he was quite attractive really he had a nice smile and a pleasant face though he somehow reminded her of a reptile perhaps it was the slightly heavy eyelids also he could do with losing a bit of weight you must be joking she exclaimed rely on you id as soon rely on a maneating crocodile dont you mean personeating oh ha ha very amusing jane pulled a face at him anyway now this is over you lot are going to be starting on operation wasp road checkpoints watching car parks the lot ill tell you about it tomorrow jane gave a half smile just then her mobile phone rang it was maggie pincombe the hospitals just phoned she said apparently mervin pecks quite poorly his condition has worsened ill go and see him before i go home said jane ive got a bad feeling about this ill come with you pete offered dont worry jane said you go on home and relax ok but ill drive you to the hospital first dont forget youre without a car again pete flashed his charming smile all right then thanks jane replied chapter twelve a nasty open wound oh come on jane said to pete after they had they pulled up outside the main entrance to pilton hospital a large heavy unattractive building on the northern edge of the town you might as well come in now youre here they waited at the reception desk inside while the receptionist tried to find mervin both agreeing that they hated hospitals and especially their smell apparently mervin was in an observation ward they took the lift to the top floor and went through swing doors into a ward used for patients whose illnesses were still being investigated tonight there were only a few occupants and pete and jane passed several empty bays of half a dozen beds each as they walked down the silent corridor some way beyond the nurses desk a young uniformed policewoman was reading a newspaper in a space just off the corridor mr peck jane asked in there the wpc pointed to a door jane opened the door to the single room and looked in mervin peck seemed to be asleep a long tube was attached to his good arm and the other was resting on the bedclothes heavily bandaged jane closed the door again quietly from the other end of the corridor a young man in a white coat appeared the sound of his shoes on the polished floors exaggerated by the silence hello im dr fahid can i help you whats the matter with him pete enquired nodding his head towards mervin pecks door were not sure yet replied the doctor he has a nasty open wound on his arm he told us a bee stung him originally and the wound never healed it simply got worse and worse were a bit concerned that he might have blood poisoning hes running a high fever no wonder he looked a bit sick earlier jane remarked yes its a long time since ive seen a wound quite like this dr fahid went on the last time was when i was in west africa just after i qualified as a doctor and i got caught up in the middle of a war my own opinion is that he might have gas gangrene whats that asked jane well gangrene basically means that part of the body dies dr fahid explained first there is pain and then the part of the body turns black and theres often a bad smell in the case of gas gangrene its caused by a particular type of bacteria quite nasty oh jane said surprised so whats the cure well usually you have to treat the affected part by cutting it off which means he might lose his arm im afraid mr peck was rather upset when we told him about that anyway dr fahid went on weve done some blood tests well have the results in a day or two meanwhile hopefully we can keep him stable on their way out of the hospital jane and pete were met by a familiar figure good evening inspector jack peck smiled stiffly i hear youre holding my brother where is he please id like to see him chief inspector actually jane responded im afraid thats not possible mr peck we still need to question him and at present hes too ill to see anyone anyway jack peck looked thoughtful after a moment he said well as his brother surely i have a right to enquire about his health who should i talk to hes in the care of dr fahid ask at reception they should be able to find him for you jane told him jane spent friday dealing with routine matters at the station and completing her plans and briefing the cid department for operation wasp the other departments involved would be informed of the plans on monday so that the operation could begin the following week as far as mervin was concerned they could do nothing more until he recovered and could be charged so she put the case to lie back of her mind and went home for the weekend on saturday the weather was grey and wet a good day to do some decorating she put on her oldest jeans in order to do some serious cleaning and painting together with cooking this was one of the few ways in which she was able to relax later she would go to the supermarket and buy the ingredients for one of her favourite meals thai spinach soup followed by a hot prawn curry she stood by her sitting room window looking out across the river the gently flowing water reflected the iron grey of the clouds above it and its smooth surface was broken by small splashes of rain the swans had long gone probably guarding their nests somewhere jane thought instead seagulls floated and dived their sad cries echoing in the damp air as they fought over pieces of rubbish on the water the evening was one of those times that jane treasured she was happy with her own company and alone was able to arrange her time as she wanted she put some music on prepared her food and settled down on the sofa with julian the cat for a saturday evenings tv entertainment she didnt often watch tv tonight however she felt like simply sitting and looking at whatever was on whatever would take her into a different world from the one in which she spent most of her waking hours as it happened the first programme she saw was a game show in which young men and women had to answer questions and were rewarded with the holiday of their dreams after that there was a popular detective series this she could not bear it was too much like work and anyway the tv writers never got everyday life in a police station exactly right so she changed channels and found herself looking at a serious documentary programme about sudden outbreaks of previously unknown diseases the screen showed pictures of an unnamed country somewhere in the developing world there were scenes typical of remote places in africa women making flour and small fascinated children staring up at the cameras in the voice told her ebola fever suddenly appeared in the sudan and in zaire this disease is a killer having a death rate of around eighty per cent the victim suffers from headaches fever and internal bleeding and usually dies after about eight days the picture changed to a closeup of a mosquito injecting its long needlelike tongue into human skin rift valley fever the voice cheerfully continued is another unpleasant disease which causes bleeding and brain fever it is carried by mosquitoes at one time it was found in areas around the sahara desert and was mainly limited to domestic animals such as cattle sheep and goats but in people died of this disease in egypt it seems iikely that there is now a new variety of the original disease which affects humans and which threatens to spread to other areas in the middle east and even beyond the voice went on and jane found herself becoming sleepy she reached for the tv remote control bedtime she told julian she looked again at the screen briefly now the film showed scientists in white coats examining tubes of liquid we dont know how or why these diseases suddenly appear with such fatal consequences one of the scientists was explaining but at present there are noone hundred per cent effective cures then came loud music and pictures of war planes for this reason the scientist went on these illnesses are ideally suited for biological warfare jane pressed the remote control she had enough to think about without worrying about the possible destruction of the world by biological warfare she would leave that to someone else to deal with chapter thirteen another call in the night at around three oclock on sunday morning the telephone rang next to janes bed at first she thought it was her alarm clock going off and she threw out an arm in order to switch it off then she realised that it was the phone and picked up the receiver yes she mumbled half asleep sorry to wake you maam its pete here and weve just had a call from the hospital mervin peck is dead what oh my god jane was wide awake now ok ill be there as soon as i can theres no need no ill come immediately ill see you in around half an hour send a car for me will you when jane arrived at the hospital she found pete talking to the young woman police constable who had been on guard outside mervins room the wpc seemed close to tears im sorry im so sorry she kept on repeating this is wpc morgan pete explained shes just recently joined the police only just finished college he rolled his eyes towards the ceiling tell the dci what happened pete asked the constable well maam wpc morgan began everything was line it was just a little after midnight the nurse had just been in to see mr peck and i was reading a book outside his room and then this doctor came along and told me there was a phone call for me at the desk i stood up and started to walk towards the nurses desk and the next thing i know is someone has grabbed me from behind and put something which smelled like a chemical over my face i passed out and didnt wake up till a nurse shook me awake a little while ago what did the doctor look like pete asked hm shoulderlength blonde hair and glasses about thirty id say quite tall but i was sitting down how do you know she was a doctor jane asked her well she looked like one she was wearing a white coat and all wpc morgan looked miserable had you seen her before no maam i dont think so at this point dr fahid and a couple of nurses appeared this is terrible dr fahid said he was plainly very upset just tell me anything you can think of even if you cant think of a reason why it might be important jane told him well i saw mr peck at about three oclock yesterday afternoon he was stable and quite comfortable and he seemed to have calmed down a lot thats all dr fahid turned to the nurses at his side one of the nurses spoke someone came to the desk to ask about him at about five oclock a man tall smartlooking i thought they might be related or something probably his brother dr fahid interrupted i spoke to him downstairs on thursday night anyway the nurse went on i told him mr peck was a little better and then he went any other visitors jane asked only his lawyer on friday the nurse said so who was the last to see mr peck alive jane enquired the other nurse spoke i gave him his medicine at around ten oclock when i came on duty he seemed ok then he was quiet anyway i looked in at about midnight and he was asleep and was it you who discovered that mervin was dead she nodded unhappily yes i came along to take his temperature and blood pressure at around half past two and i noticed that the wpc here seemed to be asleep so i tried to wake her up she was sitting on the chair but she looked like she was about to fall off she wouldnt wake up at first so i started to think that something might be wrong after a bit she came round but she was very shaky and confused and she started mumbling something about a doctor and a phone call i left her there while i went in to check mr peck but he was dead i got dr fahid up here immediately and we called the police have you had a look at him dr fahid jane asked yes dr fahid replied i did a quick examination i noticed that he was blue around the mouth which can often mean that someone has been suffocated but there were no signs of a struggle which is a little odd ok jane said turning to pete i want the postmortem done as soon as possible tell them to phone the results through to us as a matter of urgency and get on to personnel here and find out who this blonde female doctor is chapter fourteen an undesirable situation this is all rather unfortunate jane george ferguson was saying looking serious as she stood in his office on monday morning though mildly expressed georges disapproval stung and jane tried to offer a defence i agree sir its an extremely undesirable situation and im desperately sorry that its happened the trouble is the securitys not very good at the hospital it turns out that there is a service lift right next to mr pecks room for example also im afraid the wpc on duty was rather inexperienced but well do our best to sort it out sir im sure you will jane george responded jane went down to cid where she found her staff looking depressed what the hells going on maam dc tony reilly asked is someone trying to make us look like idiots looks like it jane replied bluntly drawing a plan of the top floor of the hospital on the whiteboard ok now listen up everyone she began whoever murdered mervin peck in his hospital bed knew exactly what they were doing this was a very carefully planned operation wpc morgan was attacked from behind here just by the passage leading to mr pecks room as she started to walk down the corridor towards the nurses desk notice that there is a service lift which opens immediately onto the corridor just beyond the side room where mr peck was its likely that the attacker escaped that way excuse me maam dc maggie pincombe spoke up but did the blonde doctor come from that direction also from the lift wpc morgan doesnt think so she thinks the woman came down the corridor from the nurses desk jane replied she continued im also fairly sure that mervins death is somehow connected with the death of rose carter though i dont know how meanwhile were dealing with a coldblooded killer here someone nasty enough to kill a sick man and someone smart enough to get in and out of the hospital in the middle of the night without being noticed as she finished speaking a call came through from the hospital pete listened briefly and then told the team they have no blonde women doctors on their staff at the moment i thought they might not somehow jane said right lets brainstorm this she wrote on the board the names of all the people who had had any connection with the rose carter case the detectives stared hopelessly at the list of people wondering which of them had the opportunity means or motive or whether in fact any of them had anything to do with mervins murder at all come on then jane urged her staff what about possible motives revenge ds penny kingdom suggested a little wildly for roses death who did you have in mind penny jane said well i dont know jack peck we know rose and he were lovers penny replied but would jack kill his brother dc tony reilly asked well it does seem rather unlikely jane agreed and myway as far as we know the killer is female what about paw perhaps one of them wanted revenge dc maggie pincombe suggested that woman lisa scott well i suppose thats just possible they would certainly have the necessary skills to carry it out from all i counts jane replied it could also have been done for no reason at all by an insane person but the chances of that are very slim i think the killer probably had very good reasons there was a long silence ok jane said finally i want everyone to go through the paperwork all the statements weve got everything check and double check look for anything which might he worth following up the team set to work with renewed enthusiasm they had now had two mysterious deaths in just over a week and compared to the usual business of trying to catch car thieves and burglars this was exciting jane went to her own office to do some thinking getting a plastic mug of watery coffee from a machine on the way maybe pennys suggestion had not been so fantastic jack peck was certainly an odd character and sometimes extremes of emotion could be hidden under the surface in people who disguised their feelings as he did but was jack peck really so desperate that he would arrange the murder of his own brother after all he had visited the hospital at least twice apparently concerned about his brothers welfare on the other hand he must have known roughly where mervin was which might possibly indicate his involvement in the crime a call came through from the pathologist would you like some early results of the postmortem on mr peck dr pat james enquired oh hello pat find anything jane said hopefully well yes as a matter of fact pat james said one cause of death was certainly suffocation as they thought at the hospital what do you mean one cause is there another cause the infection on his arm well that was certainly very serious but it had nothing to do with his death no but we did find a rather unusual substance in his blood ketamine hydrochloride pat james told her whats that ketamine hydrochloride is a powerful drug which is usually used by vets for animals either as an anaesthetic or to kill them pat james replied if you wanted to murder someone you could give them an injection of this stuff if mr peck was asleep anyway an injection wouldnt have woken him but why the suffocation jane asked probably to make sure he really was dead thanks pat youve done a great job jane put the phone down thoughts were buzzing round her head like flies she went back into the cid office and stared at the list of names on the whiteboard whats going on pete asked as he studied a display on a computer screen jane repeated the information the pathologist had given her well he said thoughtfully hunter products make animal vaccines dont they perhaps they use animals in their research of course pete youre brilliant jane gave him a broad smile they might need to use a drug like ketamine hydrochloride in their research laboratories so anyone who worked there would be able to get hold of some such as jo keane pete said or jack peck jane suggested or even susan peck pete finished her sentence just as i he phone rang it was dr fahid what can i do for you dr fahid jane said ah i thought that you may be interested to know that we have now got the results of mr pecks blood tests back from the laboratory the doctor said you remember we sent them off last week when he first came in yes i do and well i was right dr fahid sounded pleased with himself it seems that somehow mr peck had managed to get himself infected with clostridium septicam and clostridium welchii what do they mean asked jane almost apologetic that she didnt know these technical terms well these are two of the bacteria which cause gas gangrene explained dr fahid however its a little strange an infection of this sort in a place like this normally gangrene is associated with war areas you know where people may have untreated wounds in very dirty places so how could he have picked it up jane asked quietly for some reason as she had listened to him his words had sent a chill down her spine he hasnt been near a war as far as i know we dont know dr fahid replied it is quite mysterious he has no other cuts or damage to his skin where the disease could have entered apart from his bee sting so we have to assume it has something to do with that on the other hand although farms are not clean places this seems a very unlikely explanation so to put it simply i have absolutely no idea how he could have become infected thanks dr fahid jane said and put the phone down thoughtfully whats the matter asked pete who had been listening closely to this conversation you look as if youve seen a ghost i dont know jane answered slowly just something he said made me go quite cold pete would you order me a car i need to go out to chittleham farm again id like you to keep an eye on things here someone needs to contact mervins lawyer and find out what he and mervin talked about last friday and also go and see elisa scott at the paw office ask her what she was doing on saturday night chapter fifteen something odd out at chittleham farm the sun was shining on the yellow daffodils and other spring flowers that lined the lanes and fields in the distance jane could hear the familiar sound of sheep bleating and nearby birds were singing with enthusiasm spring she had never really seen spring so close up you could almost feel everything growing see the grass moving up towards the light watch as the sticky brown buds on trees and hedges opened out into fresh green leaves this astonishing sense of bursting out was quite unknown in the city no wonder it was called spring it was such a sudden and large movement into life it was breathtaking inside mervin pecks farmhouse nothing had changed since the last time jane had been in there she didnt know precisely what she was looking for just that she would know it when she found it she wandered from room to room noticing yet again the faded fabrics the mess and dirt upstairs it felt strange looking into mervins bedroom the bed was unmade the sheets piled in an untidy heap it was almost as if he had only just got out of it in another room upstairs jane spotted a large desk covered in papers mervin did not seem to have been a person who was organised about his personal affairs there were bills paid and unpaid mixed up with letters on the open desk she had plenty of time she went to the window and found that the room overlooked the lane where her driver pc dick plumb had parked the car dick she called out opening the window im going to be a while right you are maam he shouted back and settled down with his newspaper she closed the window again and set to work after about half an hour she had sorted the papers into categories for no particular reason she examined the letters first there was nothing of any obvious interest offers from insurance companies and building societies to take out savings plans next she looked through the bills which were mainly for animal food fence materials car tyres oil and petrol no vets bills she noticed surprising herself she was beginning to think like a real countrywoman if the man had sick animals why didnt he call a vet in finally jane looked at the bank statements at first she noticed nothing it was only on checking through a second time that she saw it mervin appeared to have in his current account which these days was a little odd most people put amounts of that size into savings accounts she studied the sheets carefully they went back only two months but during that period there had been two payments of into mervin pecks account perhaps there were more statements somewhere else she tried a rusty old filing cabinet and was rewarded by a large brown envelope containing what looked like all mervins bank statements for the last five years she took the sheets of paper from the envelope and began to sort them into the correct order it didnt take long to find out that during the previous october november and december mervin had received three more payments of making a total of these were large payments for a struggling hill farmer she would have to ask mervins bank for the source of these payments suddenly jane became aware of a loud insistent buzzing sound the kind made by a large flying insect looking around anxiously she saw that a bee had somehow found its way into the room and was now trying to get out in its desperation it threw itself against the glass of the closed window and then turning came flying towards her like a military jet on a bombing mission shivers went up and down her spine and the hair on the back of her neck stood up where on earth had the monstrous thing come from she jumped sideways as the bee buzzed angrily past her head and turned to fly at her again she gathered up the bank statements and ran from the room shutting the door behind her with a bang as she did so she wondered why such small creatures always made her panic then she remembered mervins recent words about his brothers bees those bloody bees of his are dangerous and felt less ashamed of herself then it came to her in a flash why hadnt she seen it before bee stings both of the murder victims had been stung of course it could just be a coincidence but equally perhaps not seen a ghost maam dick plumb cheerily remarked as she arrived breathless at the car this was the second time today that someone had said this to her she must look more tired than she realised yes i think i just did she replied lets go ive got what i came for i think back at the office jane rang mervins bank and requested the source of the large payments the woman at the bank said they would get back later in the day with the information she put down the receiver and drummed her fingers on the desk why in these hitech days of computers and electronics couldnt they find the answer to a simple question quickly there was a knock at the door and pete came in jane had by now given up trying to get him to wait for her permission to enter weve been busy here maam he announced grandly im glad to hear it lets have it then right well the first thing is that when mervins lawyer saw him on friday mervin asked the solicitor to give jack a letter he posted it through jacks letter box on friday night on his way home he doesnt know what the letter said the second thing is that weve got a few alibis confirmed elisa scott stayed with a friend on saturday night and the friend confirmed so shes off the suspect list jack and susan peck say they were both at home all the time so either they were in it together or neither of them was jack admits going to the hospital at about five oclock on saturday however jo keane says she was at a restaurant with friends on saturday evening and got home around midnight the restaurant has confirmed she was there interesting jane said thoughtfully listen if you were a farmer and you had a lot of very sick sheep would you call in a vet of course you would have to you can only treat relatively minor problems yourself most farmers have large vets bills anyway animals get sick all the time why pete looked puzzled hm what are you thinking about pete asked again just as the phone started to ring detective chief inspector honeywell jane said into the receiver yes oh really oh i see right thanks very much youve been very helpful i wonder if you could put that in writing for me thanks a lot goodbye jane smiled with satisfaction that was mervins bank she informed pete they have just confirmed that he received five payments of from a company called hunter products ltd not only that but the arrangements were made by a mr jack peck wow pete looked impressed then frowned slightly yes but so what jane laughed im not sure exactly but i think theres something very odd going on what do you mean i dont know i dont know jane answered but its something so important that people are being killed because of it petes eyes widened you mean its not a simple case of a dark family secret or a lover seeking revenge that kind of thing no i dont buy the revenge idea jane found herself saying she hadnt realised she was so sure about that no im sure theres something else much bigger more serious you mean round here in sleepy old pilton maybe jane said anyway wed better pay another visit to hunter products dont you think oh by the way whos looking after mervins sheep at the moment old mr millman and the boy as far as i know well could you ask the rspca to go up there i cant imagine how the old man and his simple grandson can possibly manage to deal with all mr pecks animals on their own i also think it might be safer for them if they didnt chapter sixteen gotcha jane woke earlier than usual she had had another wakeful night her mind in a state of chaos and confusion she knew that probably what she needed to know was there already like looking for shells among stones on a beach it was doubtless lying right under her nose the previous evening for example she had spent some time studying rose carters diary again somewhere in it she was positive there must be something she had missed something that might point to a connection between elements which had not until now seemed to be connected again she found the thursday before rose had died and stared at the entry jp suddenly it struck her that the letters and numbers had been written in blue biro but the exclamation marks were in heavy pencil as if they had been added later a tiny subtle point perhaps but could it be significant anyway why had rose stopped her relationship with jack as susan peck had said jane wondered what sort of a person rose was what kind of woman would have an affair with jack peck a married man a man who seemed so cold and distant she had been once to rose carters cottage maybe she should go back and take a closer look she called the station to ask them to send a car round constable dick plumb appeared soon after and they set off for south heasley rose carters house was typical of the area a picturepostcard cottage with roses growing up the white walls and around the front door in front a wellcaredfor garden was filled with a sea of plants looking at the pretty house with its dark windows and curtains drawn back jane fancied that it looked sad and lifeless somehow it was odd how buildings could sometimes give off a sense that something unpleasant had happened to the people connected with them a black cat appeared and wound itself round janes legs miaowing with pleasure to see someone hello puss youre a friendly cat arent you jane stroked the shiny black fur hes missing his owner im afraid a womans voice came from behind jane and she turned round does did he belong to miss carter jane asked im afraid so though weve been looking after him ever since you know said the woman i should introduce myself jane said showing her police identification ive come to have a look round miss carters house pleased to meet you ill show you round if you like by the way im mary brady inside the house it smelt stale and a little damp the atmosphere was still nothing had moved in there for a while to disturb the air not since the socos had been in a week ago nevertheless mary brady seemed to take some pleasure in guiding jane round the house it seemed to be the house of an educated intelligent woman in the sitting room which was painted a rich deep pink crowded bookshelves covered three of the walls and chinese carpets in bright colours lay on the highly polished wooden floor the welldesigned kitchen contained a large square cooker typical of the houses in the region the cooker was cold now but when warm it would have heated the whole house its a lovely house isnt it this was where she worked mary brady said opening the door to a small room with more bookshelves a workbench on one side and a desk against the opposite wall there was a computer on the workbench and next to it were some files neatly arranged and some boxes containing discs on top of the desk which was piled high with notebooks and papers jane noticed a photograph and bent tо study it rose it must have been a young rose was smiling at the camera around her shoulders was the arm of her companion a tall seriouslooking man jack peck also much younger perhaps jack hadnt always been such a cold fish turning to mary brady jane said has anyone been here that you know of since rose died you mean apart from the police well as it happens that man came a day or two ago yes sunday she pointed to the photo on the desk he used to visit her a lot as i told your colleagues the other day i said hello to him and he said he had to collect something of his from roses house he was quite quick so he must have got what he wanted look jane said im going to have to check the files on roses computer so i may be a few minutes oh fine ill leave you in peace then mary brady replied and went back to her garden jane switched on the computer and stared at the list of files displayed on the screen there was nothing that seemed worth looking at had jack come to collect roses unfinished work if so where was it she remembered an old detectives trick always check dustbins quickly she found the recycle bin where deleted files were stored listed there were two files called hpsamsonxls and hpriftvalleyxls something about the words in the filenames struck her as familiar though she could not for the moment think why hp though surely that must stand for hunter products they had been deleted two days before she tried riftvalley gotcha she exclaimed hpriftvalley turned out to contain pages and pages of numbers and mathematical signs and nothing else she tried hpsamson and found a similar set of data taking a clean floppy disc she copied both the files and put the disc in her bag grinning to herself if jack peck had been trying to destroy those two files he had not done it properly she shut down the computer went out of the house and found mary brady attending to her plants in her garden thanks for showing me the house jane said ill be off now not at all mary brady said i do hope the person who did this awful thing to rose goes to prison for a long time she was much loved around here you know we were all so shocked to hear about it as jane sat in the car on the way back to pilton she remembered where she had seen the word samson before in roses diary written a week before she had seen jack peck for the last time had been the words what exactly is samson ask j how strange could it be that rose didnt really know what it was she was working on for hunter products and what about rift valley why was that name familiar she thought hard for a bit and finally gave up it would come to her later then something pete had said last night started floating around in her mind as soon as she arrived in her office jane dialled the number for paw dci honeywell here is that elisa scott she said to the friendly familiar voice on the other end yes its elisa here how can i help any more car chases elisa laughed softly no sorry to disappoint you jane grinned into the phone but can you tell me exactly what happened when rose came in to the paw office the friday before she died sure she just came in and told me she was going to go out to chittleham farm again in the next few days did she say why jane asked just that she was quite concerned about the animals there nothing else no although she did seem a bit depressed when i think about it elisa said thoughtfully thanks elisa jane said thats very helpful is it elisa sounded surprised i hope so you know i got the rspca out to look at those sheep they were in a terrible yes said jane vaguely thinking about the pieces of the puzzle that now seemed to be falling into place thats great she said goodbye and hung up what had really been going on at chittleham farm there must have been something odd why else would mervin have been paid those large amounts of money by hunter products jane wondered how much rose had known rose must have broken off her relationship with jack on the thursday before she died had they had an argument of some sort was that why she had added those exclamation marks to her diary entry perhaps it had gone like this she had wanted to know what samson meant and then she had asked the question whose answer she dreaded but which she probably already knew did hunter products test their products on animals if the answer had been positive how torn she would have felt she was involved with the animal rights protesters movement while simultaneously not only working for a company that used animals in their research but also having an affair with one of its employees rose had been planning to go back to chittleham farm anyway to check the animals again did she know that it belonged to jacks brother perhaps the animals at chittleham farm were somehow involved in jacks companys work had rose put two and two together last thursday and made four chapter seventeen the bee at hunter products the receptionist welcomed jane and pete with her usual humourless expression she would try tо get mrs keane but as far as she knew mrs keane was busy all day jane had to lean on the counter and bark an order so that the receptionist jumped slightly and did as she was asked what a cheerful helpful person she is pete remarked isnt she jane agreed the receptionist stared at them furiously after a few moments jo keane arrived through the door into the reception area today the elegant business suit was an eggshell blue matching the arctic eyes what can i do for you she enquired politely well wed like to have a look around the factory if you dont mind jane informed her a curious expression moved rapidly across jo keanes perfectly madeup face and there was a brief pause im afraid thats out of the question she announced finally visitors are not allowed into the factory area for health reasons we have to maintain the strictest standards of cleanliness or we would lose our licence unless of course you have a search warrant the iceblue eyes seemed to harden as they met janes and the words contained an unmistakable challenge after the smallest hesitation jane said you produce animal vaccines here dont you thats correct jo keane replied i suppose then you must carry out experiments on animals yes thats true jo keane said in fact thats the reason why we have such tight security other companies similar to ours have had a lot of trouble with animal rights protesters we dont want anyone to break in and free all the animals the mice rabbits and so on it would be disastrous oh well no of course you cant be too careful can you pete commented cheerfully would it be possible to have a quick word with jack peck before we leave jane asked im terribly sorry but hes out of the office at the moment hell be in tomorrow if youd like to call back not to worry then well try again jane said might i just use the ladies on my way out of course jo keane said and showed her where to go inside the ladies toilet like everywhere else in the factory it was spotlessly clean jane glanced up at the security camera fixed high up in one corner as she did so she suddenly noticed a bee crawling sleepily up the wall for the second time in twentyfour hours the hair on the back of her neck felt electric and she had to work to control her fear why did there seem to be bees everywhere she went looking up again at the camera which had moved its watchful stare across to the other side of the room jane quickly found a handkerchief and trapped the bee inside it it buzzed pathetically too sleepy to protest much as she placed it carefully inside her bag she would send the bee oil to one of the governments forensic laboratories together with the floppy discs from roses cottage perhaps someone would be able to make sense of it all the camera was beginning to swing back again towards jane quickly she looked in the mirror made as if to adjust her hair and then left the room outside pete said well that wasnt very productive was it no it wasnt we really need to get inside that factory and see what theyre up to were going to have to get a warrant but im not sure theres time now jane paused anyway look what i found in the ladies loo she showed pete her handkerchief from inside which a weak buzzing sound was coming what on earth pete began ive no idea jane said back at the station jane shut herself in her office she needed to make a phone call in private hello elisa jane here again she said im hoping youll be able to help me with another little job tonight when she told elisa what she had in mind there was a long silence but as jane had guessed elisa was more than willing to help out no sooner had she put the phone down than another call came through it was susan peck wanting to talk to her confidentially jane arranged a meeting in a pub not far from susans house for that evening and didnt get back to her flat until after ten as soon as she opened the door the phone rang it was pete guess what maam he announced theres been an animal rights breakin at hunter products they somehow got through the security system tied up the night watchman and let out all the animals did they really good heavens jane said yes pete went on we had an anonymous phone call there was a pause then he stammered you d d didnt didnt what jane asked didnt what oh er nothing its time we got operation wasp going isnt it all these breakins there was a noticeable groan at the other end of the line come and pick me up in about ten minutes will you jane told him outside the southwest wind had stopped blowing for once and the clear night sky was as black as coal and dotted with silvery stars as jane and pete set off for hunter products life has not exactly been quiet since you arrived down here has it maam pete remarked two murders inside a week and now a major breakin here i suppose its just a coincidence the question hung in the air jane smiled its good to keep busy dont you think come on lets go in and see what this place is all about said jane thinking that at last they were able to look around the inside of the factory the first room they tried was full of tvs wires video recorders red and green flashing lights pete gave a low whistle the equipment was the best that money could buy for the purpose of spying on visitors factory employees and their activities anything and everything inside and outside the building jane and pete stood in front of the bank of screens and stared in silence in some of the rooms the pictures showed what looked like large metal containers similar to those used for making beer as pete said afterwards connected to each other by a network of large pipes in one or two of the rooms boxes that looked like small animal cages were piled from floor to ceiling though it was impossible to see what was inside them they left the security control room and found themselves next in the animal vaccine research section where the rooms were filled with microscopes bottles white gloves and other pieces of equipment jane examined the lines of bottles carefully after a few minutes her eyes fell on a large bottle labelled ketalar contents ketamine hydrochloride go and tell the socos to check this for fingerprints would you she told pete looking further round the room she saw a filing cabinet and rapidly opened the drawers she was in luck at the front of one of the drawers there was a file named samson she pulled out the file and glanced though the papers among them was a letter from an african colonel it read we look forward to receiving the samson supplies in the next month million has been paid into your account in switzerland as agreed the balance is to be paid on receipt of the goods jane put the letter in her pocket suddenly she became aware of a soft movement behind her and almost screamed when she turned round the room was full of creatures rabbits mice and rats jumping and unning around exploring their newfound freedom behind the animals pete was grinning in the doorway where the hell did they come from jane yelled animal liberation said pete laughing the socos are still trying to round them all up poor things come and see what ive found jane followed him down to a room they had seen on the security cameras the one lined with small cages jane peered into a cage from which an odd buzzing sound seemed to be coming mosquitoes she queried i reckon so pete replied in his dreadful texan accent which jane tried unsuccessfully to ignore then she remembered rift valley that had been the name of that virus disease on the tv the other night the one carried by mosquitoes in a strange kind of slow motion the true nature of the work being done at hunter products began to dawn on her and she realised with sickening horror that she needed to act very fast chapter eighteen operation wasp ok pete jane said urgently listen very carefully i vitally important that we get this right i dont have time explain right now youll just have to trust me ill explain on the way back to the station pete looked at her surprise impressed by the sudden note of seriousness in her voice yes maam he said dropping his texan accent now they walked back to the car first the factory has to be sealed off noone repeat noone is to be allowed in we need to set up road block on all the roads out of pilton what we have to do is find jo keane and jack peck before they have a chance to leave pilton we can get operation wasp up and running right now with whatever staff weve got available you arrange that then i want you to go to jack pecks house and if he there arrest him what for pete asked his eyes wide with astonishment the murder of his brother jane replied but i thought it was supposed to be a woman who did it it was in a way keanes house to bring her in as well well just have to hope that they havent decided to disappear already but wouldnt they want to come here to look at the damage to their factory pete asked well if im right they wont bother theyll want to get right away as fast as they possibly can jane replied as soon as they arrived back at pilton police station jane placed an urgent call to mi in london she had just finished when pete came back to say that he had set up some road blocks and that he was now going to pick up jack peck tony reilly and maggie were going to get jo keane a few moments after pete had disappeared a police constable on duty at the factory rang oh no now what jane asked herself pessimistically what could have gone wrong so quickly the constable informed her that two people a man and a woman had arrived and demanded to go inside he had told them noone was to be allowed into the factory and they had become rather angry what did they do jane asked him have they gone yes maam they went off in something of a hurry did you get the car registration yes maam an mg sports car p registration good lad jane told him she went quickly to the radio room to send out an order to all the road blocks to stop the mg if it appeared and arrest the occupants on sight no sooner had she had finished than another message came in pc dick plumb speaking maam im on the south heasley road out of pilton im afraid weve got a slightly awkward situation here pc plumbs voice sounded nervous what situation dick er well we stopped a man who then pulled out a gun hes taken wpc morgan the new officer he says hes going to shoot her if we dont let him through i presume its mr peck ok im on my way try and keep him talking will you whatever happens dont let him drive off you hear she picked up the microphone to send out another message instructing all the road block units to head for the south heasley road then having phoned pete tony and maggie and told them to cover the road from south heasley to buxton she ran down to the garage found a car and drove as fast as she could out to where pc plumb and wpc morgan had been stationed arriving at the road block halfway between south heasley and pilton jane was horrified to see in the lights of her car that pc plumb was sitting on the ground leaning against his car holding his head blood seemed to be pouring down his face dick jane shouted from her open window where are they are you all right im ok maam its just a surface wound but hes got wpc morgan maam mr peck dragged her into his car and attacked me when i tried to stop him theyve gone off that way dick plumb pointed towards south heasley in the dark jane made out the glow of car headlights moving towards the sleeping village of south heasley she might just be able to catch them the powerful police volvo roared along the country road its siren screaming somehow jane did not care about anything that might be in her path the only thought in her head was to reach the disappearing mg as the lights of the village drew nearer she thought she was gaining ground she remembered that the village streets were extremely narrow coming in from this side and there was a tight corner just before the village square jack peck would have to slow down through the village she called pete on her mobile phone pete where are you jack pecks making a run for it hes got wpc morgan im between buxton and south heasley petes voice sounded faint in the speaker ok i can see the tail lights now im catching them up he knows im after him and hes going much too fast through the village oh my god hes just braked jane broke off as she could see the mg begin to slide it came to a sudden stop crashing against a stone wall pete get here as fast as you can and turn your siren off around the square in the middle of south heasley lights came on in several upstairs windows and astonished faces of villagers appeared staring at the scene below them in the dim glow of the streetlights jane noticed a small black shape lying still on the ground near jack pecks car a cat he must have hit a cat she hoped irrelevantly that it was not roses cat as she moved cautiously towards the mg the door opened and jack got out holding a gun pointed at someone inside the car then wpc morgan climbed out jack grabbed her and holding her in front of him with his hand over her mouth shouted she gets it if you come any closer ok ill stop here jane said wheres jo i dont know i dont care he said desperately i need your car you let me go or ill shoot this young lady here jane could see that wpc morgan was rigid with fear and near to collapse but jane needed to play for time all right mr peck you win but before i make the call just tell me this why did you murder your own brother move away from your car jack peck screamed jane moved away from her car peck approached holding the young wpc in front of him adopted brother he corrected her as if this somehow made it better mervin was a fool anyway ok but why kill him jane insisted jack adjusted his hold on wpc morgan he was beginning to get nervous now mervin sent me a letter from hospital he was threatening to tell the authorities what had been going on at his farm unless i did something to get him out of the mess he was in did jo tell you to do it no noone tells me what to do jack peck sounded annoyed we did it together jack was beside the police car now together i had a feeling jo was the blonde doctor jack peck didnt answer arent you lovers asked jane to stall for time you and ms keane just then she saw a movement on the other side of the square behind jack it was pete edging quietly closer jack peck walked around the car and saw the keys werent in the ignition where are the keys he screamed answer my question first we were once upon a time now no just business partners now the keys what kind of business is it mr peck which means that two people rose and your brother have to die chief inspector honeywell youre not stupid if you stood to make several million dollars youd do the same ok maybe i would jane said a few more seconds and pete would be close enough so thats why the sheep were sick then because you were testing out the rift valley virus on them youre smart chief inspector ill give you that now would you give me those keys please he said in a low voice the gun still pointed at wpc morgans head keep going keep going jane told herself she held up the keys so mervin was in it too then she continued no he didnt know what it was we were really doing he was just supposed to keep visitors away he did it for the money unfortunately he always had a terrible temper so what was the samson project wed perfected a way of using bees to deliver stings that go gangrenous jack peck said he added proudly it was my own invention then everything happened at once jane threw the keys on the ground in front of jack and jack turned the gun away from wpc morgan for a split second which gave pete fish enough time to make his move he came up rapidly behind jack grabbed his arms and held them up behind his back the gun fell from his hands and as it hit the ground a bullet was fired harmlessly into the air jack uttered a cry of anger and frustration jack peck you are under arrest jane announced going quickly up to him and putting a pair of handcuffs on him you dont have to say anything but it may harm your defence if as she finished reading him his rights tony reilly and maggie pincombe drove up in a police car with jo keane in the back seat we found her driving out of town with her bags packed and a plane ticket to argentina said tony reilly well said jane grinning with satisfaction operation wasp has stung chapter nineteen astonishing evil it was one of those magical days people imagine when they think of springtime one of those days which people wait for all winter only good things can happen on days like this jane thought as she stood outside hunter products the sun was rising into a clear blue sky promising a day so sunny and warm that the early morning mist would soon lift like steam off the fields in the beauty of the early morning all human cruelty and horror and evil seemed somehow impossible just a stupid joke a bad dream chief superintendent george ferguson was standing beside her having just arrived they were watching several men in white suits an army special unit from london removing the contents of the hunter products factory and putting them into white vans i didnt like to wake you up last night to explain see those boxes jane said to george with a slightly secretive air theyre insect cages with mosquitoes in them so you ever heard of ebola fever rift valley fever no george said what on earth are you talking about by pure coincidence jane answered i saw something about them on tv the other night theyre especially unpleasant viruses which have caused epidemics in africa last night when we were called out to the breakin here well i suddenly realised what hunter products were up to i contacted mi in london and they said they had been watching this company for some time until now theyve had no firm evidence to go on so what are they up to george asked looking extremely confused well although hunter products do make agricultural chemicals and animal vaccines thats just a cover their main business is biological warfare and in particular the use of insects as carriers of deadly diseases whats more they were about to export their products illegally to a country which has a rather violent ruler in control anyway mi will now have all the proof they need i suppose george said that none of this is to be made public mi would like it to remain top secret yes the general public cannot possibly be allowed to get the slightest whisper of what this company was doing anyway its more than likely that noone except the managing director and the scientific director jo keane and jack peck that is knew what the company really did the other employees probably thought they were making vaccines jane im proud of you george said if youll excuse me sir ive got a murder case to wrap up she smiled we need to ensure that the people in charge of this business go to prison for a long while well come on then maam pete said after jane and he had interviewed jack peck and jo keane and then charged them with murder and conspiracy however did you work it all out how did you know it was jack that murdered mervin female intuition no pete jane replied with gentle irony in her voice it was actually something you said the other night about either jack and susan peck both being in it together or not at all i realised that there could have been two people at the hospital wpc morgan was attacked from behind so someone else could have come from out of the service lift while the socalled doctor kept her occupied then i saw susan peck last night it seems jack had made her promise not to tell anyone that he was out of the house until well after midnight on saturday night she didnt know what hed been doing but when he came in she noticed that he smelt he probably just smelt of some chemical but she was convinced hed been with another woman she wasnt going to provide him with an alibi just so he could be with someone else that she told me was mad she withdrew the alibi and shes going to divorce him shes had enough i feel sorry for that woman pete remarked she wasnt the only one to suffer jane pointed out he seems to have had no conscience at all he exploited rose carter quite heartlessly and mervin became an unknowing guinea pig for his evil experiments theres something i dont understand pete said jack must have known about roses interest in animal rights wasnt it rather dangerous to involve her in his research youre right jane replied he admitted it was a stupid mistake he and rose knew each other from college days so he helped her out a bit when she first moved here by giving her some work after a while they started to have an affair and then when they needed someone to do the statistical work on rift valley someone outside the factory he gave it to her he thought she would just accept it if he told her that they werent using animals for experiments rose seems to have trusted him for a while apparently she believed he was developing vaccines for diseases in africa then on the thursday before she died she got him to admit that he did test some of his products on animals they had a big argument about it and she said she wanted nothing more to do with him anyway she must have guessed that some of the experimental animals were kept at chittleham farm the team listened in shocked silence despite her delight at the successful outcome jane now began to feel sickened sometimes her work revealed aspects of human nature that she found hard to cope with people were capable of astonishing evil surprisingly this had turned out to be as true in this sleepy country place where families brought their children for holidays where people came to escape the pressures of big city life as it was in a city environment she had to remind herself that the work she did helped to uncover some of the bad things and prevent more of them occurring pete she said standing up im going home ive been up all night im exhausted ill drive you shall i he asked yes please she answered sitting in petes car outside her flat she suddenly did not want to be alone just now she needed company human company julian the cat was not sufficient and she felt like cooking she took a coin out of her bag and threw it up in the air what are you doing pete asked as she covered the coin with her hand heads she would ask him tails she wouldnt she uncovered the coin it was heads do you fancy a curry she said the end
