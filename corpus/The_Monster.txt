 the monster by stephen crane from harpers new monthly magazine i little jim was for the time engine number and he was making the run between syracuse and rochester he was fourteen minutes behind time and the throttle was wide open in consequence when he swung around the curve at the flowerbed a wheel of his cart destroyed a peony number slowed down at once and looked guiltily at his father who was mowing the lawn the doctor had his back to this accident and he continued to pace slowly to and fro pushing the mower jim dropped the tongue of the cart he looked at his father and at the broken flower finally he went to the peony and tried to stand it on its pins resuscitated but the spine of it was hurt and it would only hang limply from his hand jim could do no reparation he looked again toward his father he went on to the lawn very slowly and kicking wretchedly at the turf presently his father came along with the whirring machine while the sweet new grass blades spun from the knives in a low voice jim said pa the doctor was shaving this lawn as if it were a priests chin all during the season he had worked at it in the coolness and peace of the evenings after supper even in the shadow of the cherrytrees the grass was strong and healthy jim raised his voice a trifle pa the doctor paused and with the howl of the machine no longer occupying the sense one could hear the robins in the cherrytrees arranging their affairs jims hands were behind his back and sometimes his fingers clasped and unclasped again he said pa the childs fresh and rosy lip was lowered the doctor stared down at his son thrusting his head forward and frowning attentively what is it jimmie pa repeated the child at length then he raised his finger and pointed at the flowerbed there what said the doctor frowning more what is it jim after a period of silence during which the child may have undergone a severe mental tumult he raised his finger and repeated his former word there the father had respected this silence with perfect courtesy afterwards his glance carefully followed the direction indicated by the childs finger but he could see nothing which explained to him i dont understand what you mean jimmie he said it seemed that the importance of the whole thing had taken away the boys vocabulary he could only reiterate there the doctor mused upon the situation but he could make nothing of it at last he said come show me together they crossed the lawn toward the flowerbed at some yards from the broken peony jimmie began to lag there the word came almost breathlessly where said the doctor jimmie kicked at the grass there he replied the doctor was obliged to go forward alone after some trouble he found the subject of the incident the broken flower turning then he saw the child lurking at the rear and scanning his countenance the father reflected after a time he said jimmie come here with an infinite modesty of demeanor the child came forward jimmie how did this happen the child answered now i was playin train and now i runned over it you were doing what i was playin train the father reflected again well jimmie he said slowly i guess you had better not play train any more today do you think you had better no sir said jimmie during the delivery of the judgment the child had not faced his father and afterwards he went away with his head lowered shuffling his feet ii it was apparent from jimmies manner that he felt some kind of desire to efface himself he went down to the stable henry johnson the negro who cared for the doctors horses was sponging the buggy he grinned fraternally when he saw jimmie coming these two were pals in regard to almost everything in life they seemed to have minds precisely alike of course there were points of emphatic divergence for instance it was plain from henrys talk that he was a very handsome negro and he was known to be a light a weight and an eminence in the suburb of the town where lived the larger number of the negroes and obviously this glory was over jimmies horizon but he vaguely appreciated it and paid deference to henry for it mainly because henry appreciated it and deferred to himself however on all points of conduct as related to the doctor who was the moon they were in complete but unexpressed understanding whenever jimmie became the victim of an eclipse he went to the stable to solace himself with henrys crimes henry with the elasticity of his race could usually provide a sin to place himself on a footing with the disgraced one perhaps he would remember that he had forgotten to put the hitching strap in the back of the buggy on some recent occasion and had been reprimanded by the doctor then these two would commune subtly and without words concerning their moon holding themselves sympathetically as people who had committed similar treasons on the other hand henry would sometimes choose to absolutely repudiate this idea and when jimmie appeared in his shame would bully him most virtuously preaching with assurance the precepts of the doctors creed and pointing out to jimmie all his abominations jimmie did not discover that this was odious in his comrade he accepted it and lived in its shadow with humility merely trying to conciliate the saintly henry with acts of deference won by this attitude henry would sometimes allow the child to enjoy the felicity of squeezing the sponge over a buggywheel even when jimmie was still gory from unspeakable deeds whenever henry dwelt for a time in sackcloth jimmie did not patronize him at all this was a justice of his age his condition he did not know besides henry could drive a horse and jimmie had a full sense of this sublimity henry personally conducted the moon during the splendid journeys through the country roads where farms spread on all sides with sheep cows and other marvels abounding hello jim said henry poising his sponge water was dripping from the buggy sometimes the horses in the stalls stamped thunderingly on the pine floor there was an atmosphere of hay and of harness for a minute jimmie refused to take an interest in anything he was very downcast he could not even feel the wonders of wagonwashing henry while at his work narrowly observed him your pop done wallop yer didnt he he said at last no said jimmie defensively he didnt after this casual remark henry continued his labor with a scowl of occupation presently he said i done tol yer manys th time not to go afoolin an aprojjeckin with them flowers yer pop don like it nohow as a matter of fact henry had never mentioned flowers to the boy jimmie preserved a gloomy silence so henry began to use seductive wiles in this affair of washing a wagon it was not until he began to spin a wheel on the tree and the sprinkling water flew everywhere that the boy was visibly moved he had been seated on the sill of the carriagehouse door but at the beginning of this ceremony he arose and circled toward the buggy with an interest that slowly consumed the remembrance of a late disgrace johnson could then display all the dignity of a man whose duty it was to protect jimmie from a splashing look out boy look out you done gwi spile yer pants i raikon your mommer dont low this foolishness she know it i aint gwi have you round yere spilin yer pants an have mis trescott light on me pressenly deed i aint he spoke with an air of great irritation but he was not annoyed at all this tone was merely a part of his importance in reality he was always delighted to have the child there to witness the business of the stable for one thing jimmie was invariably overcome with reverence when he was told how beautifully a harness was polished or a horse groomed henry explained each detail of this kind with unction procuring great joy from the childs admiration iii after johnson had taken his supper in the kitchen he went to his loft in the carriagehouse and dressed himself with much care no belle of a court circle could bestow more mind on a toilet than did johnson on second thought he was more like a priest arraying himself for some parade of the church as he emerged from his room and sauntered down the carriage drive no one would have suspected him of ever having washed a buggy it was not altogether a matter of the lavender trousers nor yet the straw hat with its bright silk band the change was somewhere far in the interior of henry but there was no cakewalk hyperbole in it he was simply a quiet wellbred gentleman of position wealth and other necessary achievements out for an evening stroll and he had never washed a wagon in his life in the morning when in his workingclothes he had met a friend hello pete hello henry now in his effulgence he encountered this same friend his bow was not at all haughty if it expressed anything it expressed consummate generosity goodevenin misteh washington pete who was very dirty being at work in a potatopatch responded in a mixture of abasement and appreciation goodevenin misteh johnsing the shimmering blue of the electric arclamps was strong in the main street of the town at numerous points it was conquered by the orange glare of the outnumbering gaslights in the windows of shops through this radiant lane moved a crowd which culminated in a throng before the postoffice awaiting the distribution of the evening mails occasionally there came into it a shrill electric streetcar the motor singing like a cageful of grasshoppers and possessing a great gong that clanged forth both warnings and simple noise at the little theatre which was a varnish and redplush miniature of one of the famous new york theatres a company of strollers was to play east lynne the young men of the town were mainly gathered at the corners in distinctive groups which expressed various shades and lines of chumship and had little to do with any social gradations there they discussed everything with critical insight passing the whole town in review as it swarmed in the street when the gongs of the electric cars ceased for a moment to harry the ears there could be heard the sound of the feet of the leisurely crowd on the bluestone pavement and it was like the peaceful evening lashing at the shore of a lake at the foot of the hill where two lines of maples sentinelled the way an electric lamp glowed high among the embowering branches and made most wonderful shadowetchings on the road below it when johnson appeared amid the throng a member of one of the profane groups at a corner instantly telegraphed news of this extraordinary arrival to his companions they hailed him hello henry going to walk for a cake tonight aint he smooth why youve got that cake right in your pocket henry throw out your chest a little more henry was not ruffled in any way by these quiet admonitions and compliments in reply he laughed a supremely goodnatured chuckling laugh which nevertheless expressed an underground complacency of superior metal young griscom the lawyer was just emerging from reifsnyders barber shop rubbing his chin contentedly on the steps he dropped his hand and looked with wide eyes into the crowd suddenly he bolted back into the shop wow he cried to the parliament you ought to see the coon thats coming reifsnyder and his assistant instantly poised their razors high and turned toward the window two belathered heads reared from the chairs the electric shine in the street caused an effect like water to them who looked through the glass from the yellow glamour of reifsnyders shop in fact the people without resembled the inhabitants of a great aquarium that here had a square pane in it presently into this frame swam the graceful form of henry johnson chee said reifsnyder he and his assistant with one accord threw their obligations to the winds and leaving their lathered victims helpless advanced to the window aint he a taisy said reifsnyder marvelling but the man in the first chair with a grievance in his mind had found a weapon why thats only henry johnson you blamed idiots come on now reif and shave me what do you think i am a mummy reifsnyder turned in a great excitement i bait you any money that vas not henry johnson henry johnson rats the scorn put into this last word made it an explosion that man vas a pullmancar porter or someding how could that be henry johnson he demanded turbulently you vas crazy the man in the first chair faced the barber in a storm of indignation didnt i give him those lavender trousers he roared and young griscom who had remained attentively at the window said yes i guess that was henry it looked like him oh vell said reifsnyder returning to his business if you think so oh vell he implied that he was submitting for the sake of amiability finally the man in the second chair mumbling from a mouth made timid by adjacent lather said that was henry johnson all right why he always dresses like that when he wants to make a front hes the biggest dude in town anybody knows that chinger said reifsnyder henry was not at all oblivious of the wake of wondering ejaculation that streamed out behind him on other occasions he had reaped this same joy and he always had an eye for the demonstration with a face beaming with happiness he turned away from the scene of his victories into a narrow side street where the electric light still hung high but only to exhibit a row of tumbledown houses leaning together like paralytics the saffron miss bella farragut in a calico frock had been crouched on the front stoop gossiping at long range but she espied her approaching caller at a distance she dashed around the corner of the house galloping like a horse henry saw it all but he preserved the polite demeanor of a guest when a waiter spills claret down his cuff in this awkward situation he was simply perfect the duty of receiving mr johnson fell upon mrs farragut because bella in another room was scrambling wildly into her best gown the fat old woman met him with a great ivory smile sweeping back with the door and bowing low walk in misteh johnson walk in how is you dis ebenin misteh johnson how is you henrys face showed like a reflector as he bowed and bowed bending almost from his head to his ankles goodevenin mis fagut goodevenin how is you dis evenin is all you folks well mis fagut after a great deal of kowtow they were planted in two chairs opposite each other in the livingroom here they exchanged the most tremendous civilities until miss bella swept into the room when there was more kowtow on all sides and a smiling show of teeth that was like an illumination the cookingstove was of course in this drawingroom and on the fire was some kind of a longwinded stew mrs farragut was obliged to arise and attend to it from time to time also young sim came in and went to bed on his pallet in the corner but to all these domesticities the three maintained an absolute dumbness they bowed and smiled and ignored and imitated until a late hour and if they had been the occupants of the most gorgeous salon in the world they could not have been more like three monkeys after henry had gone bella who encouraged herself in the appropriation of phrases said oh ma isnt he divine iv a saturday evening was a sign always for a larger crowd to parade the thoroughfare in summer the band played until ten oclock in the little park most of the young men of the town affected to be superior to this band even to despise it but in the still and fragrant evenings they invariably turned out in force because the girls were sure to attend this concert strolling slowly over the grass linked closely in pairs or preferably in threes in the curious public dependence upon one another which was their inheritance there was no particular social aspect to this gathering save that group regarded group with interest but mainly in silence perhaps one girl would nudge another girl and suddenly say look there goes gertie hodgson and her sister and they would appear to regard this as an event of importance on a particular evening a rather large company of young men were gathered on the sidewalk that edged the park they remained thus beyond the borders of the festivities because of their dignity which would not exactly allow them to appear in anything which was so much fun for the younger lads these latter were careering madly through the crowd precipitating minor accidents from time to time but usually fleeing like mist swept by the wind before retribution could lay its hands upon them the band played a waltz which involved a gift of prominence to the bass horn and one of the young men on the sidewalk said that the music reminded him of the new engines on the hill pumping water into the reservoir a similarity of this kind was not inconceivable but the young man did not say it because he disliked the bands playing he said it because it was fashionable to say that manner of thing concerning the band however over in the stand billie harris who played the snaredrum was always surrounded by a throng of boys who adored his every whack after the mails from new york and rochester had been finally distributed the crowd from the postoffice added to the mass already in the park the wind waved the leaves of the maples and high in the air the blueburning globes of the arc lamps caused the wonderful traceries of leaf shadows on the ground when the light fell upon the upturned face of a girl it caused it to glow with a wonderful pallor a policeman came suddenly from the darkness and chased a gang of obstreperous little boys they hooted him from a distance the leader of the band had some of the mannerisms of the great musicians and during a period of silence the crowd smiled when they saw him raise his hand to his brow stroke it sentimentally and glance upward with a look of poetic anguish in the shivering light which gave to the park an effect like a great vaulted hall the throng swarmed with a gentle murmur of dresses switching the turf and with a steady hum of voices suddenly without preliminary bars there arose from afar the great hoarse roar of a factory whistle it raised and swelled to a sinister note and then it sang on the night wind one long call that held the crowd in the park immovable speechless the bandmaster had been about to vehemently let fall his hand to start the band on a thundering career through a popular march but smitten by this giant voice from the night his hand dropped slowly to his knee and his mouth agape he looked at his men in silence the cry died away to a wail and then to stillness it released the muscles of the company of young men on the sidewalk who had been like statues posed eagerly lithely their ears turned and then they wheeled upon each other simultaneously and in a single explosion they shouted one again the sound swelled in the night and roared its long ominous cry and as it died away the crowd of young men wheeled upon each other and in chorus yelled two there was a moment of breathless waiting then they bawled second district in a flash the company of indolent and cynical young men had vanished like a snowball disrupted by dynamite v jake rogers was the first man to reach the home of tuscarora hose company number six he had wrenched his key from his pocket as he tore down the street and he jumped at the springlock like a demon as the doors flew back before his hands he leaped and kicked the wedges from a pair of wheels loosened a tongue from its clasp and in the glare of the electric light which the town placed before each of his hosehouses the next comers beheld the spectacle of jake rogers bent like hickory in the manfulness of his pulling and the heavy cart was moving slowly towards the doors four men joined him at the time and as they swung with the cart out into the street dark figures sped towards them from the ponderous shadows back of the electric lamps some set up the inevitable question what district second was replied to them in a compact howl tuscarora hose company number six swept on a perilous wheel into niagara avenue and as the men attached to the cart by the rope which had been paid out from the windlass under the tongue pulled madly in their fervor and abandon the gong under the axle clanged incitingly and sometimes the same cry was heard what district second on a grade johnnie thorpe fell and exercising a singular muscular ability rolled out in time from the track of the oncoming wheel and arose dishevelled and aggrieved casting a look of mournful disenchantment upon the black crowd that poured after the machine the cart seemed to be the apex of a dark wave that was whirling as if it had been a broken dam back of the lad were stretches of lawn and in that direction front doors were banged by men who hoarsely shouted out into the clamorous avenue what district at one of these houses a woman came to the door bearing a lamp shielding her face from its rays with her hands across the cropped grass the avenue represented to her a kind of black torrent upon which nevertheless fled numerous miraculous figures upon bicycles she did not know that the towering light at the corner was continuing its nightly whine suddenly a little boy somersaulted around the corner of the house as if he had been projected down a flight of stairs by a catapultian boot he halted himself in front of the house by dint of a rather extraordinary evolution with his legs oh ma he gasped can i go can i ma she straightened with the coldness of the exterior motherjudgment although the hand that held the lamp trembled slightly no willie you had better come to bed instantly he began to buck and fume like a mustang oh ma he cried contorting himself oh ma cant i go please ma cant i go cant i go ma its half past nine now willie he ended by wailing out a compromise well just down to the corner ma just down to the corner from the avenue came the sound of rushing men who wildly shouted somebody had grappled the bellrope in the methodist church and now over the town rang this solemn and terrible voice speaking from the clouds moved from its peaceful business this bell gained a new spirit in the portentous night and it swung the heart to and fro up and down with each peal of it just down to the corner ma willie its half past nine now vi the outlines of the house of dr trescott had faded quietly into the evening hiding a shape such as we call queen anne against the pall of the blackened sky the neighborhood was at this time so quiet and seemed so devoid of obstructions that hannigans dog thought it a good opportunity to prowl in forbidden precincts and so came and pawed trescotts lawn growling and considering himself a formidable beast later peter washington strolled past the house and whistled but there was no dim light shining from henrys loft and presently peter went his way the rays from the street creeping in silvery waves over the grass caused the row of shrubs along the drive to throw a clear bold shade a wisp of smoke came from one of the windows at the end of the house and drifted quietly into the branches of a cherrytree its companions followed it in slowly increasing numbers and finally there was a current controlled by invisible banks which poured into the fruitladen boughs of the cherrytree it was no more to be noted than if a troop of dim and silent gray monkeys had been climbing a grapevine into the clouds after a moment the window brightened as if the four panes of it had been stained with blood and a quick ear might have been led to imagine the fireimps calling and calling clan joining clan gathering to the colors from the street however the house maintained its dark quiet insisting to a passerby that it was the safe dwelling of people who chose to retire early to tranquil dreams no one could have heard this low droning of the gathering clans suddenly the panes of the red window tinkled and crashed to the ground and at other windows there suddenly reared other flames like bloody spectres at the apertures of a haunted house this outbreak had been well planned as if by professional revolutionists a mans voice suddenly shouted fire fire fire hannigan had flung his pipe frenziedly from him because his lungs demanded room he tumbled down from his perch swung over the fence and ran shouting towards the front door of the trescotts then he hammered on the door using his fists as if they were mallets mrs trescott instantly came to one of the windows on the second floor afterwards she knew she had been about to say the doctor is not at home but if you will leave your name i will let him know as soon as he comes hannigans bawling was for a minute incoherent but she understood that it was not about croup what she said raising the window swiftly your house is on fire youre all ablaze move quick if his cries were resounding in the street as if it were a cave of echoes many feet pattered swiftly on the stones there was one man who ran with an almost fabulous speed he wore lavender trousers a straw hat with a bright silk band was held half crumpled in his hand as henry reached the front door hannigan had just broken the lock with a kick a thick cloud of smoke poured over them and henry ducking his head rushed into it from hannigans clamor he knew only one thing but it turned him blue with horror in the hall a lick of flame had found the cord that supported signing the declaration the engraving slumped suddenly down at one end and then dropped to the floor where it burst with the sound of a bomb the fire was already roaring like a winter wind among the pines at the head of the stairs mrs trescott was waving her arms as if they were two reeds jimmie save jimmie she screamed in henrys face he plunged past her and disappeared taking the longfamiliar routes among these upper chambers where he had once held office as a sort of second assistant housemaid hannigan had followed him up the stairs and grappled the arm of the maniacal woman there his face was black with rage you must come down he bellowed she would only scream at him in reply jimmie jimmie save jimmie but he dragged her forth while she babbled at him as they swung out into the open air a man ran across the lawn and seizing a shutter pulled it from its hinges and flung it far out upon the grass then he frantically attacked the other shutters one by one it was a kind of temporary insanity here you howled hannigan hold mrs trescott and stop the news had been telegraphed by a twist of the wrist of a neighbor who had gone to the firebox at the corner and the time when hannigan and his charge struggled out of the house was the time when the whistle roared its hoarse night call smiting the crowd in the park causing the leader of the band who was about to order the first triumphal clang of a military march to let his hand drop slowly to his knees vii henry pawed awkwardly through the smoke in the upper halls he had attempted to guide himself by the walls but they were too hot the paper was crimpling and he expected at any moment to have a flame burst from under his hands jimmie he did not call very loud as if in fear that the humming flames below would overhear him jimmie oh jimmie stumbling and panting he speedily reached the entrance to jimmies room and flung open the door the little chamber had no smoke in it at all it was faintly illumined by a beautiful rosy light reflected circuitously from the flames that were consuming the house the boy had apparently just been aroused by the noise he sat in his bed his lips apart his eyes wide while upon his little whiterobed figure played caressingly the light from the fire as the door flew open he had before him this apparition of his pal a terrorstricken negro all tousled and with wool scorching who leaped upon him and bore him up in a blanket as if the whole affair were a case of kidnapping by a dreadful robber chief without waiting to go through the usual short but complete process of wrinkling up his face jimmie let out a gorgeous bawl which resembled the expression of a calfs deepest terror as johnson bearing him reeled into the smoke of the hall he flung his arms about his neck and buried his face in the blanket he called twice in muffled tones mamma mamma when johnson came to the top of the stairs with his burden he took a quick step backward through the smoke that rolled to him he could see that the lower hall was all ablaze he cried out then in a howl that resembled jimmies former achievement his legs gained a frightful faculty of bending sideways swinging about precariously on these reedy legs he made his way back slowly back along the upper hall from the way of him then he had given up almost all idea of escaping from the burning house and with it the desire he was submitting submitting because of his fathers bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration he now clutched jimmie as unconsciously as when running toward the house he had clutched the hat with the bright silk band suddenly he remembered a little private staircase which led from a bedroom to an apartment which the doctor had fitted up as a laboratory and workhouse where he used some of his leisure and also hours when he might have been sleeping in devoting himself to experiments which came in the way of his study and interest when johnson recalled this stairway the submission to the blaze departed instantly he had been perfectly familiar with it but his confusion had destroyed the memory of it in his sudden momentary apathy there had been little that resembled fear but now as a way of safety came to him the old frantic terror caught him he was no longer creature to the flames and he was afraid of the battle with them it was a singular and swift set of alternations in which he feared twice without submission and submitted once without fear jimmie he wailed as he staggered on his way he wished this little inanimate body at his breast to participate in his tremblings but the child had lain limp and still during these headlong charges and countercharges and no sign came from him johnson passed through two rooms and came to the head of the stairs as he opened the door great billows of smoke poured out but gripping jimmie closer he plunged down through them all manner of odors assailed him during this flight they seemed to be alive with envy hatred and malice at the entrance to the laboratory he confronted a strange spectacle the room was like a garden in the region where might be burning flowers flames of violet crimson green blue orange and purple were blooming everywhere there was one blaze that was precisely the hue of a delicate coral in another place was a mass that lay merely in phosphorescent inaction like a pile of emeralds but all these marvels were to be seen dimly through clouds of heaving turning deadly smoke johnson halted for a moment on the threshold he cried out again in the negro wail that had in it the sadness of the swamps then he rushed across the room an orangecolored flame leaped like a panther at the lavender trousers this animal bit deeply into johnson there was an explosion at one side and suddenly before him there reared a delicate trembling sapphire shape like a fairy lady with a quiet smile she blocked his path and doomed him and jimmie johnson shrieked and then ducked in the manner of his race in fights he aimed to pass under the left guard of the sapphire lady but she was swifter than eagles and her talons caught in him as he plunged past her bowing his head as if his neck had been struck johnson lurched forward twisting this way and that way he fell on his back the still form in the blanket flung from his arms rolled to the edge of the floor and beneath the window johnson had fallen with his head at the base of an oldfashioned desk there was a row of jars upon the top of this desk for the most part they were silent amid this rioting but there was one which seemed to hold a scintillant and writhing serpent suddenly the glass splintered and a rubyred snakelike thing poured its thick length out upon the top of the old desk it coiled and hesitated and then began to swim a languorous way down the mahogany slant at the angle it waved its sizzling molten head to and fro over the closed eyes of the man beneath it then in a moment with mystic impulse it moved again and the red snake flowed directly down into johnsons upturned face afterwards the trail of this creature seemed to reek and amid flames and low explosions drops like redhot jewels pattered softly down it at leisurely intervals viii suddenly all roads led to dr trescotts the whole town flowed toward one point chippeway hose company number one toiled desperately up bridge street hill even as the tuscaroras came in an impetuous sweep down niagara avenue meanwhile the machine of the hookandladder experts from across the creek was spinning on its way the chief of the fire department had been playing poker in the rear room of whiteleys cigarstore but at the first breath of the alarm he sprang through the door like a man escaping with the kitty in whilomville on these occasions there was always a number of people who instantly turned their attention to the bells in the churches and schoolhouses the bells not only emphasized the alarm but it was the habit to send these sounds rolling across the sky in a stirring brazen uproar until the flames were practically vanquished there was also a kind of rivalry as to which bell should be made to produce the greatest din even the valley church four miles away among the farms had heard the voices of its brethren and immediately added a quaint little yelp doctor trescott had been driving homeward slowly smoking a cigar and feeling glad that this last case was now in complete obedience to him like a wild animal that he had subdued when he heard the long whistle and chirped to his horse under the unlicensed but perfectly distinct impression that a fire had broken out in oakhurst a new and rather highflying suburb of the town which was at least two miles from his own home but in the second blast and in the ensuing silence he read the designation of his own district he was then only a few blocks from his house he took out the whip and laid it lightly on the mare surprised and frightened at this extraordinary action she leaped forward and as the reins straightened like steel bands the doctor leaned backward a trifle when the mare whirled him up to the closed gate he was wondering whose house could be afire the man who had rung the signalbox yelled something at him but he already knew he left the mare to her will in front of his door was a maniacal woman in a wrapper ned she screamed at sight of him jimmie save jimmie trescott had grown hard and chill where he said where mrs trescotts voice began to bubble up up up she pointed at the secondstory windows hannigan was already shouting dont go in that way you cant go in that way trescott ran around the corner of the house and disappeared from them he knew from the view he had taken of the main hall that it would be impossible to ascend from there his hopes were fastened now to the stairway which led from the laboratory the door which opened from this room out upon the lawn was fastened with a bolt and lock but he kicked close to the lock and then close to the bolt the door with a loud crash flew back the doctor recoiled from the roll of smoke and then bending low he stepped into the garden of burning flowers on the floor his stinging eyes could make out a form in a smouldering blanket near the window then as he carried his son toward the door he saw that the whole lawn seemed now alive with men and boys the leaders in the great charge that the whole town was making they seized him and his burden and overpowered him in wet blankets and water but hannigan was howling johnson is in there yet henry johnson is in there yet he went in after the kid johnson is in there yet these cries penetrated to the sleepy senses of trescott and he struggled with his captors swearing unknown to him and to them all the deep blasphemies of his medicalstudent days he arose to his feet and went again toward the door of the laboratory they endeavored to restrain him although they were much affrighted at him but a young man who was a brakeman on the railway and lived in one of the rear streets near the trescotts had gone into the laboratory and brought forth a thing which he laid on the grass ix there were hoarse commands from in front of the house turn on your water five let er go one the gathering crowd swayed this way and that way the flames towering high cast a wild red light on their faces there came the clangor of a gong from along some adjacent street the crowd exclaimed at it here comes number three thats three acomin a panting and irregular mob dashed into view dragging a hosecart a cry of exultation arose from the little boys heres three the lads welcomed neverdie hose company number three as if it was composed of a chariot dragged by a band of gods the perspiring citizens flung themselves into the fray the boys danced in impish joy at the displays of prowess they acclaimed the approach of number two they welcomed number four with cheers they were so deeply moved by this whole affair that they bitterly guyed the late appearance of the hook and ladder company whose heavy apparatus had almost stalled them on the bridge street hill the lads hated and feared a fire of course they did not particularly want to have anybodys house burn but still it was fine to see the gathering of the companies and amid a great noise to watch their heroes perform all manner of prodigies they were divided into parties over the worth of different companies and supported their creeds with no small violence for instance in that part of the little city where number four had its home it would be most daring for a boy to contend the superiority of any other company likewise in another quarter when a strange boy was asked which fire company was the best in whilomville he was expected to answer number one feuds which the boys forgot and remembered according to chance or the importance of some recent event existed all through the town they did not care much for john shipley the chief of the department it was true that he went to a fire with the speed of a falling angel but when there he invariably lapsed into a certain still mood which was almost a preoccupation moving leisurely around the burning structure and surveying it puffing meanwhile at a cigar this quiet man who even when life was in danger seldom raised his voice was not much to their fancy now old sykes huntington when he was chief used to bellow continually like a bull and gesticulate in a sort of delirium he was much finer as a spectacle than this shipley who viewed a fire with the same steadiness that he viewed a raise in a large jackpot the greater number of the boys could never understand why the members of these companies persisted in reelecting shipley although they often pretended to understand it because my father says was a very formidable phrase in argument and the fathers seemed almost unanimous in advocating shipley at this time there was considerable discussion as to which company had gotten the first stream of water on the fire most of the boys claimed that number five owned that distinction but there was a determined minority who contended for number one boys who were the blood adherents of other companies were obliged to choose between the two on this occasion and the talk waxed warm but a great rumor went among the crowds it was told with hushed voices afterward a reverent silence fell even upon the boys jimmie trescott and henry johnson had been burned to death and dr trescott himself had been most savagely hurt the crowd did not even feel the police pushing at them they raised their eyes shining now with awe towards the high flames the man who had information was at his best in low tones he described the whole affair that was the kids room in the corner there he had measles or somethin and this coon johnson was asettin up with im and johnson got sleepy or somethin and upset the lamp and the doctor he was down in his office and he came running up and they all got burned together till they dragged em out another man always preserved for the deliverance of the final judgment was saying oh theyll die sure burned to flinders no chance hull lot of em anybody can see the crowd concentrated its gaze still more closely upon these flags of fire which waved joyfully against the black sky the bells of the town were clashing unceasingly a little procession moved across the lawn and towards the street there were three cots borne by twelve of the firemen the police moved sternly but it needed no effort of theirs to open a lane for this slow cortиge the men who bore the cots were well known to the crowd but in this solemn parade during the ringing of the bells and the shouting and with the red glare upon the sky they seemed utterly foreign and whilomville paid them a deep respect each man in this stretcher party had gained a reflected majesty they were footmen to death and the crowd made subtle obeisance to this august dignity derived from three prospective graves one woman turned away with a shriek at sight of the covered body on the first stretcher and people faced her suddenly in silent and mournful indignation otherwise there was barely a sound as these twelve important men with measured tread carried their burdens through the throng the little boys no longer discussed the merits of the different fire companies for the greater part they had been routed only the more courageous viewed closely the three figures veiled in yellow blankets x old judge denning hagenthorpe who lived nearly opposite the trescotts had thrown his door wide open to receive the afflicted family when it was publicly learned that the doctor and his son and the negro were still alive it required a specially detailed policeman to prevent people from scaling the front porch and interviewing these sorely wounded one old lady appeared with a miraculous poultice and she quoted most damning scripture to the officer when he said that she could not pass him throughout the night some lads old enough to be given privileges or to compel them from their mothers remained vigilantly upon the kerb in anticipation of a death or some such event the reporter of the morning tribune rode thither on his bicycle every hour until three oclock six of the ten doctors in whilomville attended at judge hagenthorpes house almost at once they were able to know that trescotts burns were not vitally important the child would possibly be scarred badly but his life was undoubtedly safe as for the negro henry johnson he could not live his body was frightfully seared but more than that he now had no face his face had simply been burned away trescott was always asking news of the two other patients in the morning he seemed fresh and strong so they told him that johnson was doomed they then saw him stir on the bed and sprang quickly to see if the bandages needed readjusting in the sudden glance he threw from one to another he impressed them as being both leonine and impracticable the morning paper announced the death of henry johnson it contained a long interview with edward j hannigan in which the latter described in full the performance of johnson at the fire there was also an editorial built from all the best words in the vocabulary of the staff the town halted in its accustomed road of thought and turned a reverent attention to the memory of this hostler in the breasts of many people was the regret that they had not known enough to give him a hand and a lift when he was alive and they judged themselves stupid and ungenerous for this failure the name of henry johnson became suddenly the title of a saint to the little boys the one who thought of it first could by quoting it in an argument at once overthrow his antagonist whether it applied to the subject or whether it did not nigger nigger never die black face and shiny eye boys who had called this odious couplet in the rear of johnsons march buried the fact at the bottom of their hearts later in the day miss bella farragut of no watermelon alley announced that she had been engaged to marry mr henry johnson xi the old judge had a cane with an ivory head he could never think at his best until he was leaning slightly on this stick and smoothing the white top with slow movements of his hands it was also to him a kind of narcotic if by any chance he mislaid it he grew at once very irritable and was likely to speak sharply to his sister whose mental incapacity he had patiently endured for thirty years in the old mansion on ontario street she was not at all aware of her brothers opinion of her endowments and so it might be said that the judge had successfully dissembled for more than a quarter of a century only risking the truth at the times when his cane was lost on a particular day the judge sat in his armchair on the porch the sunshine sprinkled through the lilacbushes and poured great coins on the boards the sparrows disputed in the trees that lined the pavements the judge mused deeply while his hands gently caressed the ivory head of his cane finally he arose and entered the house his brow still furrowed in a thoughtful frown his stick thumped solemnly in regular beats on the second floor he entered a room where dr trescott was working about the bedside of henry johnson the bandages on the negros head allowed only one thing to appear an eye which unwinkingly stared at the judge the latter spoke to trescott on the condition of the patient afterward he evidently had something further to say but he seemed to be kept from it by the scrutiny of the unwinking eye at which he furtively glanced from time to time when jimmie trescott was sufficiently recovered his mother had taken him to pay a visit to his grandparents in connecticut the doctor had remained to take care of his patients but as a matter of truth he spent most of his time at judge hagenthorpes house where lay henry johnson here he slept and ate almost every meal in the long nights and days of his vigil at dinner and away from the magic of the unwinking eye the judge said suddenly trescott do you think it is as trescott paused expectantly the judge fingered his knife he said thoughtfully no one wants to advance such ideas but somehow i think that that poor fellow ought to die there was in trescotts face at once a look of recognition as if in this tangent of the judge he saw an old problem he merely sighed and answered who knows the words were spoken in a deep tone that gave them an elusive kind of significance the judge retreated to the cold manner of the bench perhaps we may not talk with propriety of this kind of action but i am induced to say that you are performing a questionable charity in preserving this negros life as near as i can understand he will hereafter be a monster a perfect monster and probably with an affected brain no man can observe you as i have observed you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you but i am afraid my friend that it is one of the blunders of virtue the judge had delivered his views with his habitual oratory the last three words he spoke with a particular emphasis as if the phrase was his discovery the doctor made a weary gesture he saved my boys life yes said the judge swiftly yes i know and what am i to do said trescott his eyes suddenly lighting like an outburst from smouldering peat what am i to do he gave himself for for jimmie what am i to do for him the judge abased himself completely before these words he lowered his eyes for a moment he picked at his cucumbers presently he braced himself straightly in his chair he will be your creation you understand he is purely your creation nature has very evidently given him up he is dead you are restoring him to life you are making him and he will be a monster and with no mind he will be what you like judge cried trescott in sudden polite fury he will be anything but by god he saved my boy the judge interrupted in a voice trembling with emotion trescott trescott dont i know trescott had subsided to a sullen mood yes you know he answered acidly but you dont know all about your own boy being saved from death this was a perfectly childish allusion to the judges bachelorhood trescott knew that the remark was infantile but he seemed to take desperate delight in it but it passed the judge completely it was not his spot i am puzzled said he in profound thought i dont know what to say trescott had become repentant dont think i dont appreciate what you say judge but of course responded the judge quickly of course it began trescott of course said the judge in silence they resumed their dinner well said the judge ultimately it is hard for a man to know what to do it is said the doctor fervidly there was another silence it was broken by the judge look here trescott i dont want you to think no certainly not answered the doctor earnestly well i dont want you to think i would say anything to it was only that i thought that i might be able to suggest to you that perhaps the affair was a little dubious with an appearance of suddenly disclosing his real mental perturbation the doctor said well what would you do would you kill him he asked abruptly and sternly trescott you fool said the old man gently oh well i know judge but then he turned red and spoke with new violence say he saved my boy do you see he saved my boy you bet he did cried the judge with enthusiasm you bet he did and they remained for a time gazing at each other their faces illuminated with memories of a certain deed after another silence the judge said it is hard for a man to know what to do xii late one evening trescott returning from a professional call paused his buggy at the hagenthorpe gate he tied the mare to the old tincovered post and entered the house ultimately he appeared with a companion a man who walked slowly and carefully as if he were learning he was wrapped to the heels in an oldfashioned ulster they entered the buggy and drove away after a silence only broken by the swift and musical humming of the wheels on the smooth road trescott spoke henry he said ive got you a home here with old alek williams you will have everything you want to eat and a good place to sleep and i hope you will get along there all right i will pay all your expenses and come to see you as often as i can if you dont get along i want you to let me know as soon as possible and then we will do what we can to make it better the dark figure at the doctors side answered with a cheerful laugh these buggy wheels don look like i washed em yesterday docteh he said trescott hesitated for a moment and then went on insistently i am taking you to alek williams henry and i the figure chuckled again no deed no seh alek williams don know a hoss deed he dont he don know a hoss from a pig the laugh that followed was like the rattle of pebbles trescott turned and looked sternly and coldly at the dim form in the gloom from the buggytop henry he said i didnt say anything about horses i was saying hoss hoss said the quavering voice from these near shadows hoss deed i don know all erbout a hoss deed i dont there was a satirical chuckle at the end of three miles the mare slackened and the doctor leaned forward peering while holding tight reins the wheels of the buggy bumped often over outcropping bowlders a window shone forth a simple square of topaz on a great black hillside four dogs charged the buggy with ferocity and when it did not promptly retreat they circled courageously around the flanks baying a door opened near the window in the hillside and a man came and stood on a beach of yellow light yah yah you roveh you susie come yah come yah this minit trescott called across the dark sea of grass hello alek hello come down here and show me where to drive the man plunged from the beach into the surf and trescott could then only trace his course by the fervid and polite ejaculations of a host who was somewhere approaching presently williams took the mare by the head and uttering cries of welcome and scolding the swarming dogs led the equipage toward the lights when they halted at the door and trescott was climbing out williams cried will she stand docteh shell stand all right but you better hold her for a minute now henry the doctor turned and held both arms to the dark figure it crawled to him painfully like a man going down a ladder williams took the mare away to be tied to a little tree and when he returned he found them awaiting him in the gloom beyond the rays from the door he burst out then like a siphon pressed by a nervous thumb hennery hennery ma ol frien well if i ain glade if i ain glade trescott had taken the silent shape by the arm and led it forward into the full revelation of the light well now alek you can take henry and put him to bed and in the morning i will near the end of this sentence old williams had come front to front with johnson he gasped for a second and then yelled the yell of a man stabbed in the heart for a fraction of a moment trescott seemed to be looking for epithets then he roared you old black chump you old black shut up shut up do you hear williams obeyed instantly in the matter of his screams but he continued in a lowered voice ma lode amassy whod ever think ma lode amassy trescott spoke again in the manner of a commander of a battalion alek the old negro again surrendered but to himself he repeated in a whisper ma lode he was aghast and trembling as these three points of widening shadows approached the golden doorway a hale old negress appeared there bowing goodevenin docteh goodevenin come in come in she had evidently just retired from a tempestuous struggle to place the room in order but she was now bowing rapidly she made the effort of a person swimming dont trouble yourself mary said trescott entering ive brought henry for you to take care of and all youve got to do is to carry out what i tell you learning that he was not followed he faced the door and said come in henry johnson entered whee shrieked mrs williams she almost achieved a back somersault six young members of the tribe of williams made a simultaneous plunge for a position behind the stove and formed a wailing heap xiii you know very well that you and your family lived usually on less than three dollars a week and now that doctor trescott pays you five dollars a week for johnsons board you live like millionaires you havent done a stroke of work since johnson began to board with you everybody knows that and so what are you kicking about the judge sat in his chair on the porch fondling his cane and gazing down at old williams who stood under the lilacbushes yes i know jedge said the negro wagging his head in a puzzled manner taint like as if i didnt preciate what the docteh done but but well yeh see jedge he added gaining a new impetus its its hard wuk this ol man nev did wuk so hard lode no dont talk such nonsense alek spoke the judge sharply you have never really worked in your life anyhow enough to support a family of sparrows and now when you are in a more prosperous condition than ever before you come around talking like an old fool the negro began to scratch his head yeh see jedge he said at last my ol ooman she caint ceive no lady callahs nohow hang lady callers said the judge irascibly if you have flour in the barrel and meat in the pot your wife can get along without receiving lady callers cant she but they wont come ainyhow jedge replied williams with an air of still deeper stupefaction noner ma wifes friens ner noner ma friensll come near ma resdence well let them stay home if they are such silly people the old negro seemed to be seeking a way to elude this argument but evidently finding none he was about to shuffle meekly off he halted however jedge said he ma ol oomans near driv abstracted your old woman is an idiot responded the judge williams came very close and peered solemnly through a branch of lilac jedge he whispered the chillens what about them dropping his voice to funereal depths williams said they they caint eat cant eat scoffed the judge loudly cant eat you must think i am as big an old fool as you are cant eat the little rascals whats to prevent them from eating in answer williams said with mournful emphasis hennery moved with a kind of satisfaction at his tragic use of the name he remained staring at the judge for a sign of its effect the judge made a gesture of irritation come now you old scoundrel dont beat around the bush any more what are you up to what do you want speak out like a man and dont give me any more of this tiresome rigamarole i aint erbeatin round bout nuffin jedge replied williams indignantly no seh i say

i sneak an i sneak until i try th do to see if he locked in an he keep me erpuzzlin an erquakin all night long dont know how ll do in th winter cant let im out where th chillen is hell done freeze where he is now williams spoke these sentences as if he were talking to himself after a silence of deep reflection he continued folks go round sayin he aint hennery johnson at all they say hes er devil what cried the judge yesseh repeated williams in tones of injury as if his veracity had been challenged yesseh im ertellin it to yeh straight jedge plenty culd people folks up my way say it is a devil well you dont think so yourself do you no taint no devil its hennery johnson well then what is the matter with you you dont care what a lot of foolish people say go on tending to your business and pay no attention to such idle nonsense tis nonsense jedge but he looks like er devil what do you care what he looks like demanded the judge ma rent is two dollehs and er half er month said williams slowly it might just as well be ten thousand dollars a month responded the judge you never pay it anyhow then anoth thing continued williams in his reflective tone if he was all right in his

two dollehs an er half er month an him not right in his haid it seems like five dollehs er week the judges stick came down sharply and suddenly upon the floor of the porch there he said i thought that was what you were driving at williams began swinging his head from side to side in the strange racial mannerism now hol on a minnet jedge he said defensively taint like as if i didnt preciate what the docteh done taint that docteh trescott is er kind man an taint like as if i didnt preciate what he done but but but what you are getting painful alek now tell me this did you ever have five dollars a week regularly before in your life williams at once drew himself up with great dignity but in the pause after that question he drooped gradually to another attitude in the end he answered heroically no jedge i aint an taint like as if i was ersayin five dollehs wasnt er lot er money for a man like me but jedge what er man oughter git fer this kinder wuk is er salary yesseh jedge he repeated with a great impressive gesture fer this kinder wuk er man oughter git er salary he laid a terrible emphasis upon the final word the judge laughed i know dr trescotts mind concerning this affair alek and if you are dissatisfied with your boarder he is quite ready to move him to some other place so if you care to leave word with me that you are tired of the arrangement and wish it changed he will come and take johnson away williams scratched his head again in deep perplexity five dollehs is er big price fer bod but taint no big price fer the bod of er crazy man he said finally what do you think you ought to get asked the judge well answered alek in the manner of one deep in a balancing of the scales he looks like er devil an done skears erybody an ma chillens caint eat an i caint sleep an he aint right in his haid an you told me all those things after scratching his wool and beating his knee with his hat and gazing off through the trees and down at the ground williams said as he kicked nervously at the gravel well jedge i think it is wuth he stuttered worth what six dollehs answered williams in a desperate outburst the judge lay back in his great armchair and went through all the motions of a man laughing heartily but he made no sound save a slight cough williams had been watching him with apprehension well said the judge do you call six dollars a salary no seh promptly responded williams taint a salary no deed taint a salary he looked with some anger upon the man who questioned his intelligence in this way well supposing your children cant eat i and supposing he looks like a devil and supposing all those things continue would you be satisfied with six dollars a week recollections seemed to throng in williamss mind at these interrogations and he answered dubiously of cose a man who aint right in his haid an looks like er devil but six dollehs after these two attempts at a sentence williams suddenly appeared as an orator with a great shiny palm waving in the air i tell yeh jedge six dollehs is six dollehs but if i git six dollehs for boding hennery johnson i uhns it i uhns it i dont doubt that you earn six dollars for every weeks work you do said the judge well if i bod hennery johnson fer six dollehs a week i uhns it i uhns it cried williams wildly xiv reifsnyders assistant had gone to his supper and the owner of the shop was trying to placate four men who wished to be shaved at once reifsnyder was very garrulous a fact which made him rather remarkable among barbers who as a class are austerely speechless having been taught silence by the hammering reiteration of a tradition it is the customers who talk in the ordinary event as reifsnyder waved his razor down the cheek of a man in the chair he turned often to cool the impatience of the others with pleasant talk which they did not particularly heed oh he should have let him die said bainbridge a railway engineer finally replying to one of the barbers orations shut up reif and go on with your business instead reifsnyder paused shaving entirely and turned to front the speaker let him die he demanded how vas that how can you let a man die by letting him die you chump said the engineer the others laughed a little and reifsnyder turned at once to his work sullenly as a man overwhelmed by the derision of numbers how vas that he grumbled later how can you let a man die when he vas done so much for you when he vas done so much for you repeated bainbridge you better shave some people how vas that maybe this aint a barber shop a man hitherto silent now said if i had been the doctor i would have done the same thing of course said reifsnyder any man vould do it any man that vas not like you you old flinthearted fish he had sought the final words with painful care and he delivered the collection triumphantly at bainbridge the engineer laughed the man in the chair now lifted himself higher while reifsnyder began an elaborate ceremony of anointing and combing his hair now free to join comfortably in the talk the man said they say he is the most terrible thing in the world young johnnie bernard that drives the grocery wagon saw him up at alek williamss shanty and he says he couldnt eat anything for two days chee said reifsnyder well what makes him so terrible asked another because he hasnt got any face replied the barber and the engineer in duet hasnt got any face repeated the man how can he do without any face he has no face in the front of his head in the place where his face ought to grow bainbridge sang these lines pathetically as he arose and hung his hat on a hook the man in the chair was about to abdicate in his favor get a gait on you now he said to reifsnyder i go out at as the barber foamed the lather on the cheeks of the engineer he seemed to be thinking heavily then suddenly he burst out how would you like to be with no face he cried to the assemblage oh if i had to have a face like yours answered one customer bainbridges voice came from a sea of lather youre kicking because if losing faces became popular youd have to go out of business i dont think it will become so much popular said reifsnyder not if its got to be taken off in the way his was taken off said another man id rather keep mine if you dont mind i guess so cried the barber just think the shaving of bainbridge had arrived at a time of comparative liberty for him i wonder what the doctor says to himself he observed he may be sorry he made him live it was the only thing he could do replied a man the others seemed to agree with him supposing you were in his place said one and johnson had saved your kid what would you do certainly of course you would do anything on earth for him youd take all the trouble in the world for him and spend your last dollar on him well then i wonder how it feels to be without any face said reifsnyder musingly the man who had previously spoken feeling that he had expressed himself well repeated the whole thing you would do anything on earth for him youd take all the trouble in the world for him and spend your last dollar on him well then no but look said reifsnyder supposing you dont got a face xv as soon as williams was hidden from the view of the old judge he began to gesture and talk to himself an elation had evidently penetrated to his vitals and caused him to dilate as if he had been filled with gas he snapped his fingers in the air and whistled fragments of triumphal music at times in his progress towards his shanty he indulged in a shuffling movement that was really a dance it was to be learned from the intermediate monologue that he had emerged from his trials laurelled and proud he was the unconquerable alexander williams nothing could exceed the bold selfreliance of his manner his kingly stride his heroic song the derisive flourish of his hands all betokened a man who had successfully defied the world on his way he saw zeke paterson coming to town they hailed each other at a distance of fifty yards how do broth paterson how do broth williams they were both deacons is you folks well broth paterson middlin middlin hows you folks broth williams neither of them had slowed his pace in the smallest degree they had simply begun this talk when a considerable space separated them continued it as they passed and added polite questions as they drifted steadily apart williamss mind seemed to be a balloon he had been so inflated that he had not noticed that paterson had definitely shied into the dry ditch as they came to the point of ordinary contact afterward as he went a lonely way he burst out again in song and pantomimic celebration of his estate his feet moved in prancing steps when he came in sight of his cabin the fields were bathed in a blue dusk and the light in the window was pale cavorting and gesticulating he gazed joyfully for some moments upon this light then suddenly another idea seemed to attack his mind and he stopped with an air of being suddenly dampened in the end he approached his home as if it were the fortress of an enemy some dogs disputed his advance for a loud moment and then discovering their lord slunk away embarrassed his reproaches were addressed to them in muffled tones arriving at the door he pushed it open with the timidity of a new thief he thrust his head cautiously sideways and his eyes met the eyes of his wife who sat by the table the lamplight defining a half of her face sh he said uselessly his glance travelled swiftly to the inner door which shielded the one bedchamber the pickaninnies strewn upon the floor of the livingroom were softly snoring after a hearty meal they had promptly dispersed themselves about the place and gone to sleep sh said williams again to his motionless and silent wife he had allowed only his head to appear his wife with one hand upon the edge of the table and the other at her knee was regarding him with wide eyes and parted lips as if he were a spectre she looked to be one who was living in terror and even the familiar face at the door had thrilled her because it had come suddenly williams broke the tense silence is he all right he whispered waving his eyes towards the inner door following his glance timorously his wife nodded and in a low tone answered i raikon hes done gone tsleep williams then slunk noiselessly across his threshold he lifted a chair and with infinite care placed it so that it faced the dreaded inner door his wife moved slightly so as to also squarely face it a silence came upon them in which they seemed to be waiting for a calamity pealing and deadly williams finally coughed behind his hand his wife started and looked upon him in alarm pears like he done gwine keep quiet ternight he breathed they continually pointed their speech and their looks at the inner door paying it the homage due to a corpse or a phantom another long stillness followed this sentence their eyes shone white and wide a wagon rattled down the distant road from their chairs they looked at the window and the effect of the light in the cabin was a presentation of an intensely black and solemn night the old woman adopted the attitude used always in church at funerals at times she seemed to be upon the point of breaking out in prayer he mighty quiet ternight whispered williams was he good terday for answer his wife raised her eyes to the ceiling in the supplication of job williams moved restlessly finally he tiptoed to the door he knelt slowly and without a sound and placed his ear near the keyhole hearing a noise behind him he turned quickly his wife was staring at him aghast she stood in front of the stove and her arms were spread out in the natural movement to protect all her sleeping ducklings but williams arose without having touched the door i raikon he ersleep he said fingering his wool he debated with himself for some time during this interval his wife remained a great fat statue of a mother shielding her children it was plain that his mind was swept suddenly by a wave of temerity with a sounding step he moved towards the door his fingers were almost upon the knob when he swiftly ducked and dodged away clapping his hands to the back of his head it was as if the portal had threatened him there was a little tumult near the stove where mrs williamss desperate retreat had involved her feet with the prostrate children after the panic williams bore traces of a feeling of shame he returned to the charge he firmly grasped the knob with his left hand and with his other hand turned the key in the lock he pushed the door and as it swung portentously open he sprang nimbly to one side like the fearful slave liberating the lion near the stove a group had formed the terrorstricken mother with her arms stretched and the aroused children clinging frenziedly to her skirts the light streamed after the swinging door and disclosed a room six feet one way and six feet the other way it was small enough to enable the radiance to lay it plain williams peered warily around the corner made by the doorpost suddenly he advanced retired and advanced again with a howl his palsied family had expected him to spring backward and at his howl they heaped themselves wondrously but williams simply stood in the little room emitting his howls before an open window hes gone hes gone hes gone his eye and his hand had speedily proved the fact he had even thrown open a little cupboard presently he came flying out he grabbed his hat and hurled the outer door back upon its hinges then he tumbled headlong into the night he was yelling docteh trescott docteh trescott he ran wildly through the fields and galloped in the direction of town he continued to call to trescott as if the latter was within easy hearing it was as if trescott was poised in the contemplative sky over the running negro and could heed this reaching voice docteh trescott in the cabin mrs williams supported by relays from the battalion of children stood quaking watch until the truth of daylight came as a reenforcement and made them arrogant strutting swashbuckler children and a mother who proclaimed her illimitable courage xvi theresa page was giving a party it was the outcome of a long series of arguments addressed to her mother which had been overheard in part by her father he had at last said five words oh let her have it the mother had then gladly capitulated theresa had written nineteen invitations and distributed them at recess to her schoolmates later her mother had composed five large cakes and still later a vast amount of lemonade so the nine little girls and the ten little boys sat quite primly in the diningroom while theresa and her mother plied them with cake and lemonade and also with icecream this primness sat now quite strangely upon them it was owing to the presence of mrs page previously in the parlor alone with their games they had overturned a chair the boys had let more or less of their hoodlum spirit shine forth but when circumstances could be possibly magnified to warrant it the girls made the boys victims of an insufferable pride snubbing them mercilessly so in the diningroom they resembled a class at sundayschool if it were not for the subterranean smiles gestures rebuffs and poutings which stamped the affair as a childrens party two little girls of this subdued gathering were planted in a settle with their backs to the broad window they were beaming lovingly upon each other with an effect of scorning the boys hearing a noise behind her at the window one little girl turned to face it instantly she screamed and sprang away covering her face with her hands what was it what was it cried every one in a roar some slight movement of the eyes of the weeping and shuddering child informed the company that she had been frightened by an appearance at the window at once they all faced the imperturbable window and for a moment there was a silence an astute lad made an immediate census of the other lads the prank of slipping out and looming spectrally at a window was too venerable but the little boys were all present and astonished as they recovered their minds they uttered warlike cries and through a sidedoor sallied rapidly out against the terror they vied with each other in daring none wished particularly to encounter a dragon in the darkness of the garden but there could be no faltering when the fair ones in the diningroom were present calling to each other in stern voices they went dragooning over the lawn attacking the shadows with ferocity but still with the caution of reasonable beings they found however nothing new to the peace of the night of course there was a lad who told a great lie he described a grim figure bending low and slinking off along the fence he gave a number of details rendering his lie more splendid by a repetition of certain forms which he recalled from romances for instance he insisted that he had heard the creature emit a hollow laugh inside the house the little girl who had raised the alarm was still shuddering and weeping with the utmost difficulty was she brought to a state approximating calmness by mrs page then she wanted to go home at once page entered the house at this time he had exiled himself until he concluded that this childrens party was finished and gone he was obliged to escort the little girl home because she screamed again when they opened the door and she saw the night she was not coherent even to her mother was it a man she didnt know it was simply a thing a dreadful thing xvii in watermelon alley the farraguts were spending their evening as usual on the little rickety porch sometimes they howled gossip to other people on other rickety porches the thin wail of a baby arose from a near house a man had a terrific altercation with his wife to which the alley paid no attention at all there appeared suddenly before the farraguts a monster making a low and sweeping bow there was an instants pause and then occurred something that resembled the effect of an upheaval of the earths surface the old woman hurled herself backward with a dreadful cry young sim had been perched gracefully on a railing at sight of the monster he simply fell over it to the ground he made no sound his eyes stuck out his nerveless hands tried to grapple the rail to prevent a tumble and then he vanished bella blubbering and with her hair suddenly and mysteriously dishevelled was crawling on her hands and knees fearsomely up the steps standing before this wreck of a family gathering the monster continued to bow it even raised a deprecatory claw don make no botheration bout me miss fagut it said politely no deed i jes drap in ter ax if yer well this evenin miss fagut don make no botheration no deed i gwine ax you to go to er daince with me miss fagut i ax you if i can have the magnifercent gratitude of you company on that casion miss fagut the girl cast a miserable glance behind her she was still crawling away on the ground beside the porch young sim raised a strange bleat which expressed both his fright and his lack of wind presently the monster with a fashionable amble ascended the steps after the girl she grovelled in a corner of the room as the creature took a chair it seated itself very elegantly on the edge it held an old cap in both hands don make no botheration miss fagut don make no botheration no deed i jes drap in ter ax you if you won do me the proud of acceptin ma humble invitation to er daince miss fagut she shielded her eyes with her arms and tried to crawl past it but the genial monster blocked the way i jes drap in ter ax you bout er daince miss fagut i ax you if i kin have the magnifercent gratitude of you company on that casion miss fagut in a last outbreak of despair the girl shuddering and wailing threw herself face downward on the floor while the monster sat on the edge of the chair gabbling courteous invitations and holding the old hat daintily to his stomach at the back of the house mrs farragut who was of enormous weight and who for eight years had done little more than sit in an armchair and describe her various ailments had with speed and agility scaled a high board fence xviii the black mass in the middle of trescotts property was hardly allowed to cool before the builders were at work on another house it had sprung upward at a fabulous rate it was like a magical composition born of the ashes the doctors office was the first part to be completed and he had already moved in his new books and instruments and medicines trescott sat before his desk when the chief of police arrived well we found him said the latter did you cried the doctor where shambling around the streets at daylight this morning ill be blamed if i can figure on where he passed the night where is he now oh we jugged him i didnt know what else to do with him thats what i want you to tell me of course we cant keep him no charge could be made you know ill come down and get him the official grinned retrospectively must say he had a fine career while he was out first thing he did was to break up a childrens party at pages then he went to watermelon alley whoo he stampeded the whole outfit men women and children running pellmell and yelling they say one old woman broke her leg or something shinning over a fence then he went right out on the main street and an irish girl threw a fit and there was a sort of a riot he began to run and a big crowd chased him firing rocks but he gave them the slip somehow down there by the foundry and in the railroad yard we looked for him all night but couldnt find him was he hurt any did anybody hit him with a stone guess there isnt much of him to hurt any more is there guess hes been hurt up to the limit no they never touched him of course nobody really wanted to hit him but you know how a crowd gets its like its like yes i know for a moment the chief of the police looked reflectively at the floor then he spoke hesitatingly you know jake winters little girl was the one that he scared at the party she is pretty sick they say is she why they didnt call me i always attend the winter family no didnt they asked the chief slowly well you know winter is well winter has gone clean crazy over this business he wanted he wanted to have you arrested have me arrested the idiot what in the name of wonder could he have me arrested for of course he is a fool i told him to keep his trap shut but then you know how hell go all over town yapping about the thing i thought id better tip you oh he is of no consequence but then of course im obliged to you sam thats all right well youll be down tonight and take him out eh youll get a good welcome from the jailer he dont like his job for a cent he says you can have your man whenever you want him hes got no use for him but what is this business of winters about having me arrested oh its a lot of chin about your having no right to allow this this this man to be at large but i told him to tend to his own business only i thought id better let you know and i might as well say right now doctor that there is a good deal of talk about this thing if i were you id come to the jail pretty late at night because there is likely to be a crowd around the door and id bring a er mask or some kind of a veil anyhow xix martha goodwin was single and well along into the thin years she lived with her married sister in whilomville she performed nearly all the housework in exchange for the privilege of existence every one tacitly recognized her labor as a form of penance for the early end of her betrothed who had died of smallpox which he had not caught from her but despite the strenuous and unceasing workaday of her life she was a woman of great mind she had adamantine opinions upon the situation in armenia the condition of women in china the flirtation between mrs minster of niagara avenue and young griscom the conflict in the bible class of the baptist sundayschool the duty of the united states toward the cuban insurgents and many other colossal matters her fullest experience of violence was gained on an occasion when she had seen a hound clubbed but in the plan which she had made for the reform of the world she advocated drastic measures for instance she contended that all the turks should be pushed into the sea and drowned and that mrs minster and young griscom should be hanged side by side on twin gallows in fact this woman of peace who had seen only peace argued constantly for a creed of illimitable ferocity she was invulnerable on these questions because eventually she overrode all opponents with a sniff this sniff was an active force it was to her antagonists like a bang over the head and none was known to recover from this expression of exalted contempt it left them windless and conquered they never again came forward as candidates for suppression and martha walked her kitchen with a stern brow an invincible being like napoleon nevertheless her acquaintances from the pain of their defeats had been long in secret revolt it was in no wise a conspiracy because they did not care to state their open rebellion but nevertheless it was understood that any woman who could not coincide with one of marthas contentions was entitled to the support of others in the small circle it amounted to an arrangement by which all were required to disbelieve any theory for which martha fought this however did not prevent them from speaking of her mind with profound respect two people bore the brunt of her ability her sister kate was visibly afraid of her while carrie dungen sailed across from her kitchen to sit respectfully at marthas feet and learn the business of the world to be sure afterwards under another sun she always laughed at martha and pretended to deride her ideas but in the presence of the sovereign she always remained silent or admiring kate the sister was of no consequence at all her principal delusion was that she did all the work in the upstairs rooms of the house while martha did it downstairs the truth was seen only by the husband who treated martha with a kindness that was half banter half deference martha herself had no suspicion that she was the only pillar of the domestic edifice the situation was without definitions martha made definitions but she devoted them entirely to the armenians and griscom and the chinese and other subjects her dreams which in early days had been of love of meadows and the shade of trees of the face of a man were now involved otherwise and they were companioned in the kitchen curiously cuba the hotwater kettle armenia the washing of the dishes and the whole thing being jumbled in regard to social misdemeanors she who was simply the mausoleum of a dead passion was probably the most savage critic in town this unknown woman hidden in a kitchen as in a well was sure to have a considerable effect of the one kind or the other in the life of the town every time it moved a yard she had personally contributed an inch she could hammer so stoutly upon the door of a proposition that it would break from its hinges and fall upon her but at any rate it moved she was an engine and the fact that she did not know that she was an engine contributed largely to the effect one reason that she was formidable was that she did not even imagine that she was formidable she remained a weak innocent and pigheaded creature who alone would defy the universe if she thought the universe merited this proceeding one day carrie dungen came across from her kitchen with speed she had a great deal of grist oh she cried henry johnson got away from where they was keeping him and came to town last night and scared everybody almost to death martha was shining a dishpan polishing madly no reasonable person could see cause for this operation because the pan already glistened like silver well she ejaculated she imparted to the word a deep meaning this my prophecy has come to pass it was a habit the overplus of information was choking carrie before she could go on she was obliged to struggle for a moment and oh little sadie winter is awful sick and they say jake winter was around this morning trying to get doctor trescott arrested and poor old mrs farragut sprained her ankle in trying to climb a fence and theres a crowd around the jail all the time they put henry in jail because they didnt know what else to do with him i guess they say he is perfectly terrible martha finally released the dishpan and confronted the headlong speaker well she said again poising a great brown rag kate had heard the excited newcomer and drifted down from the novel in her room she was a shivery little woman her shoulderblades seemed to be two panes of ice for she was constantly shrugging and shrugging serves him right if he was to lose all his patients she said suddenly in bloodthirsty tones she snipped her words out as if her lips were scissors well hes likely to shouted carrie dungen dont a lot of people say that they wont have him any more if youre sick and nervous doctor trescott would scare the life out of you wouldnt he he would me id keep thinking martha stalking to and fro sometimes surveyed the two other women with a contemplative frown xx after the return from connecticut little jimmie was at first much afraid of the monster who lived in the room over the carriagehouse he could not identify it in any way gradually however his fear dwindled under the influence of a weird fascination he sidled into closer and closer relations with it one time the monster was seated on a box behind the stable basking in the rays of the afternoon sun a heavy crкpe veil was swathed about its head little jimmie and many companions came around the corner of the stable they were all in what was popularly known as the baby class and consequently escaped from school a halfhour before the other children they halted abruptly at sight of the figure on the box jimmie waved his hand with the air of a proprietor there he is he said ooo murmured all the little boys ooo they shrank back and grouped according to courage or experience as at the sound the monster slowly turned its head jimmie had remained in the van alone dont be afraid i wont let him hurt you he said delighted huh they replied contemptuously we aint afraid jimmie seemed to reap all the joys of the owner and exhibitor of one of the worlds marvels while his audience remained at a distance awed and entranced fearful and envious one of them addressed jimmie gloomily bet you dassent walk right up to him he was an older boy than jimmie and habitually oppressed him to a small degree this new social elevation of the smaller lad probably seemed revolutionary to him huh said jimmie with deep scorn dassent i dassent i hey dassent i the group was immensely excited it turned its eyes upon the boy that jimmie addressed no you dassent he said stolidly facing a moral defeat he could see that jimmie was resolved no you dassent he repeated doggedly ho cried jimmie you just watch you just watch amid a silence he turned and marched toward the monster but possibly the palpable wariness of his companions had an effect upon him that weighed more than his previous experience for suddenly when near to the monster he halted dubiously but his playmates immediately uttered a derisive shout and it seemed to force him forward he went to the monster and laid his hand delicately on its shoulder hello henry he said in a voice that trembled a trifle the monster was crooning a weird line of negro melody that was scarcely more than a thread of sound and it paid no heed to the boy jimmie strutted back to his companions they acclaimed him and hooted his opponent amid this clamor the larger boy with difficulty preserved a dignified attitude i dassent dassent i said jimmie to him now youre so smart lets see you do it this challenge brought forth renewed taunts from the others the larger boy puffed out his cheeks well i aint afraid he explained sullenly he had made a mistake in diplomacy and now his small enemies were tumbling his prestige all about his ears they crowed like roosters and bleated like lambs and made many other noises which were supposed to bury him in ridicule and dishonor well i aint afraid he continued to explain through the din jimmie the hero of the mob was pitiless you aint afraid hey he sneered if you aint afraid go do it then well i would if i wanted to the other retorted his eyes wore an expression of profound misery but he preserved steadily other portions of a potvaliant air he suddenly faced one of his persecutors if youre so smart why dont you go do it this persecutor sank promptly through the group to the rear the incident gave the badgered one a breathingspell and for a moment even turned the derision in another direction he took advantage of his interval ill do it if anybody else will he announced swaggering to and fro candidates for the adventure did not come forward to defend themselves from this countercharge the other boys again set up their crowing and bleating for a while they would hear nothing from him each time he opened his lips their chorus of noises made oratory impossible but at last he was able to repeat that he would volunteer to dare as much in the affair as any other boy well you go first they shouted but jimmie intervened to once more lead the populace against the large boy youre mighty brave aint you he said to him you dared me to do it and i did didnt i now whos afraid the others cheered this view loudly and they instantly resumed the baiting of the large boy he shamefacedly scratched his left shin with his right foot well i aint afraid he cast an eye at the monster well i aint afraid with a glare of hatred at his squalling tormentors he finally announced a grim intention well ill do it then since youre so fresh now the mob subsided as with a formidable countenance he turned toward the impassive figure on the box the advance was also a regular progression from high daring to craven hesitation at last when some yards from the monster the lad came to a full halt as if he had encountered a stone wall the observant little boys in the distance promptly hooted stung again by these cries the lad sneaked two yards forward he was crouched like a young cat ready for a backward spring the crowd at the rear beginning to respect this display uttered some encouraging cries suddenly the lad gathered himself together made a white and desperate rush forward touched the monsters shoulder with a faroutstretched finger and sped away while his laughter rang out wild shrill and exultant the crowd of boys reverenced him at once and began to throng into his camp and look at him and be his admirers jimmie was discomfited for a moment but he and the larger boy without agreement or word of any kind seemed to recognize a truce and they swiftly combined and began to parade before the others why its just as easy as nothing puffed the larger boy aint it jim course blew jimmie why its as eeeasy they were people of another class if they had been decorated for courage on twelve battlefields they could not have made the other boys more ashamed of the situation meanwhile they condescended to explain the emotions of the excursion expressing unqualified contempt for any one who could hang back why it aint nothin he wont do nothin to you they told the others in tones of exasperation one of the very smallest boys in the party showed signs of a wistful desire to distinguish himself and they turned their attention to him pushing at his shoulders while he swung away from them and hesitated dreamily he was eventually induced to make furtive expedition but it was only for a few yards then he paused motionless gazing with open mouth the vociferous entreaties of jimmie and the large boy had no power over him mrs hannigan had come out on her back porch with a pail of water from this coign she had a view of the secluded portion of the trescott grounds that was behind the stable she perceived the group of boys and the monster on the box she shaded her eyes with her hand to benefit her vision she screeched then as if she was being murdered eddie eddie you come home this minute her son querulously demanded aw what for you come home this minute do you hear the other boys seemed to think this visitation upon one of their number required them to preserve for a time the hangdog air of a collection of culprits and they remained in guilty silence until the little hannigan wrathfully protesting was pushed through the door of his home mrs hannigan cast a piercing glance over the group stared with a bitter face at the trescott house as if this new and handsome edifice was insulting her and then followed her son there was wavering in the party an inroad by one mother always caused them to carefully sweep the horizon to see if there were more coming this is my yard said jimmie proudly we dont have to go home the monster on the box had turned its black crкpe countenance toward the sky and was waving its arms in time to a religious chant look at him now cried a little boy they turned and were transfixed by the solemnity and mystery of the indefinable gestures the wail of the melody was mournful and slow they drew back it seemed to spellbind them with the power of a funeral they were so absorbed that they did not hear the doctors buggy drive up to the stable trescott got out tied his horse and approached the group jimmie saw him first and at his look of dismay the others wheeled whats all this jimmie asked trescott in surprise the lad advanced to the front of his companions halted and said nothing trescotts face gloomed slightly as he scanned the scene what were you doing jimmie we was playin answered jimmie huskily playing at what just playin trescott looked gravely at the other boys and asked them to please go home they proceeded to the street much in the manner of frustrated and revealed assassins the crime of trespass on another boys place was still a crime when they had only accepted the other boys cordial invitation and they were used to being sent out of all manner of gardens upon the sudden appearance of a father or a mother jimmie had wretchedly watched the departure of his companions it involved the loss of his position as a lad who controlled the privileges of his fathers grounds but then he knew that in the beginning he had no right to ask so many boys to be his guests once on the sidewalk however they speedily forgot their shame as trespassers and the large boy launched forth in a description of his success in the late trial of courage as they went rapidly up the street the little boy who had made the furtive expedition cried out confidently from the rear yes and i went almost up to him didnt i willie the large boy crushed him in a few words huh he scoffed you only went a little way i went clear up to him the pace of the other boys was so manly that the tiny thing had to trot and he remained at the rear getting entangled in their legs in his attempts to reach the front rank and become of some importance dodging this way and that way and always piping out his little claim to glory xxi bytheway grace said trescott looking into the diningroom from his office door i wish you would send jimmie to me before schooltime when jimmie came he advanced so quietly that trescott did not at first note him oh he said wheeling from a cabinet here you are young man yes sir trescott dropped into his chair and tapped the desk with a thoughtful finger jimmie what were you doing in the back garden yesterday you and the other boys to henry we werent doing anything pa trescott looked sternly into the raised eyes of his son are you sure you were not annoying him in any way now what were you doing exactly why we why we now willie dalzel said i dassent go right up to him and i did and then he did and then the other boys were fraid and then you comed trescott groaned deeply his countenance was so clouded in sorrow that the lad bewildered by the mystery of it burst suddenly forth in dismal lamentations there there dont cry jim said trescott going round the desk only he sat in a great leather readingchair and took the boy on his knee only i want to explain to you after jimmie had gone to school and as trescott was about to start on his round of morning calls a message arrived from doctor moser it set forth that the latters sister was dying in the old homestead twenty miles away up the valley and asked trescott to care for his patients for the day at least there was also in the envelope a little history of each case and of what had already been done trescott replied to the messenger that he would gladly assent to the arrangement he noted that the first name on mosers list was winter but this did not seem to strike him as an important fact when its turn came he rang the winter bell goodmorning mrs winter he said cheerfully as the door was opened doctor moser has been obliged to leave town today and he has asked me to come in his stead how is the little girl this morning mrs winter had regarded him in stony surprise at last she said come in ill see my husband she bolted into the house trescott entered the hall and turned to the left into the sittingroom presently winter shuffled through the door his eyes flashed towards trescott he did not betray any desire to advance far into the room what do you want he said what do i want what do i want repeated trescott lifting his head suddenly he had heard an utterly new challenge in the night of the jungle yes thats what i want to know snapped winter what do you want trescott was silent for a moment he consulted mosers memoranda i see that your little girls case is a trifle serious he remarked i would advise you to call a physician soon i will leave you a copy of doctor mosers record to give to any one you may call he paused to transcribe the record on a page of his notebook tearing out the leaf he extended it to winter as he moved towards the door the latter shrunk against the wall his head was hanging as he reached for the paper this caused him to grasp air and so trescott simply let the paper flutter to the feet of the other man goodmorning said trescott from the hall this placid retreat seemed to suddenly arouse winter to ferocity it was as if he had then recalled all the truths which he had formulated to hurl at trescott so he followed him into the hall and down the hall to the door and through the door to the porch barking in fiery rage from a respectful distance as trescott imperturbably turned the mares head down the road winter stood on the porch still yelping he was like a little dog xxii have you heard the news cried carrie dungen as she sped toward marthas kitchen have you heard the news her eyes were shining with delight no answered marthas sister kate bending forward eagerly what was it what was it carrie appeared triumphantly in the open door oh theres been an awful scene between doctor trescott and jake winter i never thought that jake winter had any pluck at all but this morning he told the doctor just what he thought of him well what did he think of him asked martha oh he called him everything mrs howarth heard it through her front blinds it was terrible she says its all over town now everybody knows it didnt the doctor answer back no mrs howarth she says he never said a word he just walked down to his buggy and got in and drove off as coool but jake gave him jinks by all accounts but what did he say cried kate shrill and excited she was evidently at some kind of a feast oh he told him that sadie had never been well since that night henry johnson frightened her at theresa pages party and he held him responsible and how dared he cross his threshold and and and and what said martha did he swear at him said kate in fearsome glee no not much he did swear at him a little but not more than a man does anyhow when he is real mad mrs howarth says ooh breathed kate and did he call him any names martha at her work had been for a time in deep thought she now interrupted the others it dont seem as if sadie winter had been sick since that time henry johnson got loose shes been to school almost the whole time since then hasnt she they combined upon her in immediate indignation school school i should say not dont think for a moment school martha wheeled from the sink she held an iron spoon and it seemed as if she was going to attack them sadie winter has passed here many a morning since then carrying her schoolbag where was she going to a wedding the others long accustomed to a mental tyranny speedily surrendered did she stammered kate i never saw her carrie dungen made a weak gesture if i had been doctor trescott exclaimed martha loudly id have knocked that miserable jake winters head off kate and carrie exchanging glances made an alliance in the air i dont see why you say that martha replied carrie with considerable boldness gaining support and sympathy from kates smile i dont see how anybody can be blamed for getting angry when their little girl gets almost scared to death and gets sick from it and all that besides everybody says oh i dont care what everybody says said martha well you cant go against the whole town answered carrie in sudden sharp defiance no martha you cant go against the whole town piped kate following her leader rapidly the whole town cried martha id like to know what you call the whole town do you call these silly people who are scared of henry johnson the whole town why martha said carrie in a reasoning tone you talk as if you wouldnt be scared of him no more would i retorted martha ooh martha how you talk said kate why the idea everybodys afraid of him carrie was grinning youve never seen him have you she asked seductively no admitted martha well then how do you know that you wouldnt be scared martha confronted her have you ever seen him no well then how do you know you would be scared the allied forces broke out in chorus but martha everybody says so everybody says so everybody says what everybody thats seen him say they were frightened almost to death tisnt only women but its men too its awful martha wagged her head solemnly id try not to be afraid of him but supposing you could not help it said kate yes and look here cried carrie ill tell you another thing the hannigans are going to move out of the house next door on account of him demanded martha carrie nodded mrs hannigan says so herself well of all things ejaculated martha going to move eh you dont say so where they going to move to down on orchard avenue well of all things nice house i dont know about that i havent heard but theres lots of nice houses on orchard yes but theyre all taken said kate there isnt a vacant house on orchard avenue oh yes there is said martha the old hampstead house is vacant oh of course said kate but then i dont believe mrs hannigan would like it there i wonder where they can be going to move to im sure i dont know sighed martha it must be to some place we dont know about well said carrie dungen after a general reflective silence its easy enough to find out anyhow who knows around here asked kate why mrs smith and there she is in her garden said carrie jumping to her feet as she dashed out of the door kate and martha crowded at the window carries voice rang out from near the steps mrs smith mrs smith do you know where the hannigans are going to move to xxiii the autumn smote the leaves and the trees of whilomville were panoplied in crimson and yellow the winds grew stronger and in the melancholy purple of the nights the home shine of a window became a finer thing the little boys watching the sear and sorrowful leaves drifting down from the maples dreamed of the near time when they could heap bushels in the streets and burn them during the abrupt evenings three men walked down the niagara avenue as they approached judge hagenthorpes house he came down his walk to meet them in the manner of one who has been waiting are you ready judge one said all ready he answered the four then walked to trescotts house he received them in his office where he had been reading he seemed surprised at this visit of four very active and influential citizens but he had nothing to say of it after they were all seated trescott looked expectantly from one face to another there was a little silence it was broken by john twelve the wholesale grocer who was worth and reported to be worth over a million well doctor he said with a short laugh i suppose we might as well admit at once that weve come to interfere in something which is none of our business why what is it asked trescott again looking from one face to another he seemed to appeal particularly to judge hagenthorpe but the old man had his chin lowered musingly to his cane and would not look at him its about what nobody talks of much said twelve its about henry johnson trescott squared himself in his chair yes he said having delivered himself of the title twelve seemed to become more easy yes he answered blandly we wanted to talk to you about it yes said trescott twelve abruptly advanced on the main attack now see here trescott we like you and we have come to talk right out about this business it may be none of our affairs and all that and as for me i dont mind if you tell me so but i am not going to keep quiet and see you ruin yourself and thats how we all feel i am not ruining myself answered trescott no maybe you are not exactly ruining yourself said twelve slowly but you are doing yourself a great deal of harm you have changed from being the leading doctor in town to about the last one it is mainly because there are always a large number of people who are very thoughtless fools of course but then that doesnt change the condition a man who had not heretofore spoken said solemnly its the women well what i want to say is this resumed twelve even if there are a lot of fools in the world we cant see any reason why you should ruin yourself by opposing them you cant teach them anything you know i am not trying to teach them anything trescott smiled wearily i it is a matter of well and there are a good many of us that admire you for it immensely interrupted twelve but that isnt going to change the minds of all those ninnies its the women stated the advocate of this view again well what i want to say is this said twelve we want you to get out of this trouble and strike your old gait again you are simply killing your practice through your infernal pigheadedness now this thing is out of the ordinary but there must be ways to to beat the game somehow you see so weve talked it over about a dozen of us and as i say if you want to tell us to mind our own business why go ahead but weve talked it over and weve come to the conclusion that the only way to do is to get johnson a place somewhere off up the valley and trescott wearily gestured you dont know my friend everybody is so afraid of him they cant even give him good care nobody can attend to him as i do myself but i have a little nogood farm up beyond clarence mountain that i was going to give to henry cried twelve aggrieved and if you and if you if you through your house burning down or anything why all the boys were prepared to take him right off your hands and and trescott arose and went to the window he turned his back upon them they sat waiting in silence when he returned he kept his face in the shadow no john twelve he said it cant be done there was another stillness suddenly a man stirred on his chair well then a public institution he began no said trescott public institutions are all very good but he is not going to one in the background of the group old judge hagenthorpe was thoughtfully smoothing the polished ivory head of his cane xxiv trescott loudly stamped the snow from his feet and shook the flakes from his shoulders when he entered the house he went at once to the diningroom and then to the sittingroom jimmie was there reading painfully in a large book concerning giraffes and tigers and crocodiles where is your mother jimmie asked trescott i dont know pa answered the boy i think she is upstairs trescott went to the foot of the stairs and called but there came no answer seeing that the door of the little drawingroom was open he entered the room was bathed in the halflight that came from the four dull panes of mica in the front of the great stove as his eyes grew used to the shadows he saw his wife curled in an armchair he went to her why grace he said didnt you hear me calling you she made no answer and as he bent over the chair he heard her trying to smother a sob in the cushion grace he cried youre crying she raised her face ive got a headache a dreadful headache ned a headache he repeated in surprise and incredulity he pulled a chair close to hers later as he cast his eye over the zone of light shed by the dull red panes he saw that a low table had been drawn close to the stove and that it was burdened with many small cups and plates of uncut teacake he remembered that the day was wednesday and that his wife received on wednesdays who was here today gracie he asked from his shoulder there came a mumble mrs twelve was she um he said why didnt anna hagenthorpe come over the mumble from his shoulder continued she wasnt well enough glancing down at the cups trescott mechanically counted them there were fifteen of them there there he said dont cry grace dont cry the wind was whining round the house and the snow beat aslant upon the windows sometimes the coal in the stove settled with a crumbling sound and the four panes of mica flashed a sudden new crimson as he sat holding her head on his shoulder trescott found himself occasionally trying to count the cups there were fifteen of them
