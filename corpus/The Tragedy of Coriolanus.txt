rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs first citizen we have ever your good word marcius he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ic or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland whats the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another whats their seeking menenius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stord marcius hang em they say theyll sit by th fire and presume to know whats done i the capitol whos like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say theres grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword id make a quarry with thousands of these quarterd slaves as high as i could pick my lance menenius nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop marcius they are dissolved hang em they said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answerd and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o the moon shouting their emulation menenius what is granted them marcius five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice ones junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know not sdeath the rabble should have first unroofd the city ere so prevaild with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for

people brutus markd you his lip and eyes sicinius nay but his taunts brutus being movd he will not spare to gird the gods sicinius bemock the modest moon brutus the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant sicinius such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius brutus fame at the which he aims in whom already he is well gracd cannot better be held nor more attaind than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the generals fault though he perform to th utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius o if he had borne the business sicinius besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius brutus come half all cominius honours are to marcius though marcius earnd them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not sicinius lets hence and hear how

roman these three lead on this preparation whither tis bent most likely tis for you consider of it first senator our armys in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us aufidius nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veild till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seemd appeard to rome by the discovery we shall be shortend in our aim

does the wolf love sicinius the lamb menenius ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius brutus hes a lamb indeed that baas like a bear menenius hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you both tribunes well sir menenius in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance brutus hes poor in no one fault but stored with all sicinius especially in pride brutus and topping all others in boasting menenius this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o the righthand file do you both tribunes why how are we censured menenius because you talk of pride now will you not be angry both tribunes well well sir well menenius why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud brutus we do it not alone sir menenius i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could both tribunes what then sir menenius why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome sicinius menenius you are known well enough too menenius i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too brutus come sir come we know you well enough menenius you know neither me yourselves nor anything you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones brutus come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol menenius our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss packsaddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you brutus and sicinius retire enter volumnia virgilia valeria c how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast volumnia

make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horsedrench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded virgilia o no no no volumnia o he is wounded i thank the gods fort menenius so do i too if it be not too much brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become him volumnia ons brows menenius

to the tribunes who come forward god save your good worships marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded volumnia i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i the body menenius one i the neck and two i the thigh theres nine that i know volumnia he had before this last expedition twentyfive wounds upon him menenius now its twentyseven every gash was an enemys grave a shout and flourish hark the trumpets volumnia these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears death that dark spirit ins nervy arm doth lie which being advancd declines and then men die a sennet trumpets sound enter cominius and titus lartius between them coriolanus crowned with an oaken garland with captains and soldiers and a herald herald know rome that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates where he hath won with fame a name to caius marcius these in honour follows coriolanus welcome to rome renowned coriolanus flourish all welcome to rome renowned coriolanus coriolanus no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more cominius look sir your mother coriolanus o you have i know petitiond all the gods for my prosperity kneels volumnia nay my good soldier up my gentle marcius worthy caius and by deedachieving honour newly namd what is it coriolanus must i call thee but o thy wife coriolanus my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laughd had i come coffind home that weepst to see me triumph ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons menenius now the gods crown thee coriolanus and live you yet to valeria o my sweet lady pardon volumnia i know not where to turn o welcome home and welcome general and you are welcome all menenius a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root ons heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crab trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly cominius ever right coriolanus menenius ever ever herald give way there and go on coriolanus to his wife and mother your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have receivd not only greetings but with them change of honours volumnia i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only theres one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee coriolanus know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs cominius on to the capitol flourish cornets exeunt in state as before the tribunes remain brutus all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram bout her reechy neck clambring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smotherd up leads filld and ridges horsd with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him seldshown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station our veild dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicely gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture sicinius on the sudden i warrant him consul brutus then our office may during his power go sleep sicinius he cannot temprately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won brutus in that theres comfort sicinius doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make as little question as he is proud to dot brutus i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i the marketplace nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths sicinius tis right brutus it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles sicinius i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution brutus tis most like he will sicinius it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction brutus so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that tos power he would have made them mules silencd their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in their war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them sicinius this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people which time shall not want if it be put upont and thats as easy as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever enter a messenger brutus whats the matter messenger you are sent for to the capitol tis thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he passd the nobles bended as to joves statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like brutus lets to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for the time but hearts for the event sicinius have with you exeunt scene ii rome the capitol enter two officers to lay cushions first officer come come they are almost here how many stand for consulships second officer three they say but tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it first officer thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people second officer faith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonnetted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it first officer no more of him he is a worthy man make way they are coming a sennet enter with lictors before them cominius the consul menenius coriolanus senators sicinius and brutus the senators take their places the tribunes take theirs also by themselves menenius having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our aftermeeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our wellfound successes to report a little of that worthy work performd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself first senator speak good cominius leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our states defective for requital than we to stretch it out masters o the people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here sicinius we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly brutus which the rather we shall be blessd to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prizd them at menenius thats off thats off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak brutus most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it menenius he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow worthy cominius speak coriolanus rises and offers to go away nay keep your place first senator sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done coriolanus your honours pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them brutus sir i hope my words disbenchd you not coriolanus no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothd not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh menenius pray now sit down coriolanus i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monsterd exit menenius masters o the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter thats thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utterd feebly it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoisd at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him he bestrid an oerpressd roman and i the consuls view slew three opposers tarquins self he met and struck him on his knee in that days feats when he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man i the field and for his meed was browbound with the oak his pupil age manenterd thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurchd all swords of the garland for this last before and in corioli let me say i cannot speak him home he stoppd the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obeyd and fell below his stem his sword deaths stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enterd the mortal gate of the city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden reenforcement struck corioli like a planet now alls his when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit requickned what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking oer the lives of men as if twere a perpetual spoil and till we calld both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting menenius worthy man first senator he cannot but with measure fit the honours which we devise him cominius our spoils he kickd at and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it menenius hes right noble let him be calld for first senator call coriolanus officer he doth appear reenter coriolanus menenius the senate coriolanus are well pleasd to make thee consul coriolanus i do owe them still my life and services menenius it then remains that you do speak to the people coriolanus i do beseech you let me oerleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing sicinius sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony menenius put them not tot pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form coriolanus it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people brutus mark you that coriolanus to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had receivd them for the hire of their breath only menenius do not stand upont we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour senators to coriolanus come all joy and honour flourish exeunt all but sicinius and brutus brutus you see how he intends to use the people sicinius may they perceives intent he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give brutus come well inform them of our proceedings here on the marketplace i know they do attend us exeunt scene iii rome the forum enter several citizens first citizen once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him second citizen we may sir if we will third citizen we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members first citizen and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude third citizen we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o the compass second citizen think you so which way do you judge my wit would fly third citizen nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans will tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but if it were at liberty twould sure southward second citizen why that way third citizen to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife second citizen you are never without your tricks you may you may third citizen are you all resolved to give your voices but thats no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behaviour we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes hes to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and ill direct you how you shall go by him all content content exeunt enter coriolanus and menenius menenius o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have donet coriolanus what must i say i pray sir plague upont i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace look sir my wounds i got them in my countrys service when some certain of your brethren roard and ran from the noise of our own drums menenius o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you coriolanus think upon me hang em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by em menenius youll mar all ill leave you pray you speak to em i pray you in wholesome manner coriolanus bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean exit menenius so here comes a brace reenter two citizens you know the cause sirs of my standing here first citizen we do sir tell us what hath brought you tot coriolanus mine own desert second citizen your own desert coriolanus ay not mine own desire first citizen how not your own desire coriolanus no sir twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging first citizen you must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you coriolanus well then i pray your price o the consulship first citizen the price is to ask it kindly coriolanus kindly sir i pray let me hat i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you second citizen you shall ha it worthy sir coriolanus a match sir theres in all two worthy voices beggd i have your alms adieu first citizen but this is something odd second citizen an twere to give again but tis no matter exeunt two citizens reenter other two citizens coriolanus pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown third citizen you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly coriolanus your enigma third citizen you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people coriolanus you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountifully to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul fourth citizen we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily third citizen you have received many wounds for your country coriolanus i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further both citizens the gods give you joy sir heartily exeunt citizens coriolanus most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this wolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches custom calls me tot what custom wills in all things should we dot the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heapd for truth to oerpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part sufferd the other will i do here come more voices reenter other three citizens your voices for your voices i have fought watchd for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul fifth citizen he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voice sixth citizen therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people all three citizens amen amen god save thee noble consul exeunt coriolanus worthy voices reenter menenius with brutus and sicinius menenius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the peoples voice remains that in the official marks invested you anon do meet the senate coriolanus is this done sicinius the custom of request you have dischargd the people do admit you and are summond to meet anon upon your approbation coriolanus where at the senatehouse sicinius there coriolanus coriolanus may i change these garments sicinius you may sir coriolanus that ill straight do and knowing myself again repair to the senatehouse menenius ill keep you company will you along brutus we stay here for the people sicinius fare you well exeunt coriolanus and menenius he has it now and by his looks methinks tis warm at his heart brutus with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds will you dismiss the people reenter citizens sicinius how now my masters have you chose this man first citizen he has our voices sir brutus we pray the gods he may deserve your loves second citizen amen sir to my poor unworthy notice he mocked us when he beggd our voices third citizen certainly he flouted us downright first citizen no tis his kind of speech he did not mock us second citizen not one amongst us save yourself but says he usd us scornfully he should have showd us his marks of merit wounds received fors country sicinius why so he did i am sure citizens no no no man saw em third citizen he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn i would be consul says he aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore when we granted that here was i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices i have no further with you was not this mockery sicinius why either were you ignorant to seet or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices brutus could you not have told him as you were lessond when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i the body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o the state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord sicinius thus to have said as you were foreadvisd had touchd his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluckd either his gracious promise which you might as cause had calld you up have held him to or else it would have galld his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have taen the advantage of his choler and passd him unelected brutus did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment sicinius have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your sudfor tongues third citizen hes not confirmd we may deny him yet second citizen and will deny him ill have five hundred voices of that sound first citizen i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em brutus get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so sicinius let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scornd you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you th apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you brutus lay a fault on us your tribunes that we labourd no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him sicinius say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us brutus ay spare us not say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o the marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numas daughters son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our best water brought by conduits hither and censorinus darling of the people and nobly namd so twice being censor was his great ancestor sicinius one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that hes your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation brutus say you neer had donet harp on that still but by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to the capitol citizens we will so almost all repent in their election exeunt brutus let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger sicinius to the capitol come we will be there before the stream o the people and this shall seem as partly tis their own which we have goaded onward exeunt act iii scene i rome a street cornets enter coriolanus menenius cominius titus lartius senators and patricians coriolanus tullus aufidius then had made new head lartius he had my

cominius hath he not passd the noble and the commons brutus cominius no coriolanus have i had childrens voices first senator tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace brutus the people are incensd against him sicinius stop or all will fall in broil coriolanus are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on menenius be calm be calm coriolanus it is a purposd thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffert and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruld brutus callt not a plot the people cry you mockd them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repind scandald the suppliants for the people calld them timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness coriolanus why this was known before brutus not to them all coriolanus have you informd them sithence brutus how i inform them cominius you are like to do such business brutus not unlike each way to better yours coriolanus why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune sicinius you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune menenius lets be calm cominius the people are abusd set on this paltring becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deservd this so dishonourd rub laid falsely i the plain way of his merit coriolanus tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speakt again menenius not now not now first senator not in this heat sir now coriolanus now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rankscented many let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have ploughd for sowd and scatterd by mingling them with us the honourd number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars menenius well no more first senator no more words we beseech you coriolanus how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them brutus you speak o the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity sicinius twere well we let the people knowt

coriolanus shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall cominius twas from the canon coriolanus shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra leave to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o the monster wants not spirit to say hell turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learnd be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the greatst taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frownd in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other cominius well on to the marketplace coriolanus whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas usd sometime in

that speaks thus their voice coriolanus ill give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assurd they neer did service fort being pressd to the war even when the navel of the state was touchd they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i the war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showd most valour spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the motive of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bisson multitude digest the senates courtesy let deeds express whats like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles menenius come enough brutus enough with overmeasure coriolanus no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barrd it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change ont that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic thats sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and

consent of all we were establishd the peoples magistrates citizens you so remain menenius and so are like to do cominius that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and

ill try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patchd with cloth of any colour cominius nay come away exeunt coriolanus cominius and others first patrician this man has marrd his fortune menenius his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove fors power to thunder his hearts his mouth what his breast forges that his

vengeance could he not speak em fair reenter brutus and sicinius with the rabble sicinius where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself menenius you worthy tribunes sicinius he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at

turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time sicinius speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies tonight menenius now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enrolld in joves own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own sicinius hes a disease that must be cut away menenius o hes a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome thats worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce he dropt it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that dot and suffer it a brand to the end o the world sicinius this is clean kam brutus merely awry when he did love his country it honourd him menenius the service of the foot being once gangrend

cannot do it to the gods must i then dot to them volumnia you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unseverd friends i the war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by th other lose that they combine not there coriolanus tush tush menenius a good demand volumnia if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request coriolanus why force you this volumnia because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosoms truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake requird i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin menenius noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past volumnia i prythee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretchd it here be with them thy knee bussing the stones for in such busines action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the ears waving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person menenius this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being askd as free as words to little purpose volumnia prythee now go and be ruld although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower enter cominius here is cominius cominius i have been i the marketplace and sir tis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence alls in

unbarbd sconce must i with my base tongue give to my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will dot yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throwt against the wind to the marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life cominius come come well prompt you volumnia i prythee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before coriolanus well i must dot away my disposition and possess me some harlots spirit my throat of war be turnd which quired with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggars tongue make motion through my lips and my armd knees who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his that hath receivd an alms i will not dot lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my bodys action teach my mind a most inherent baseness volumnia at thy choice then to beg of thee it is my more dishonour than thou of them come all to ruin let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me but owe thy pride thyself coriolanus pray be content mother i am going to the marketplace chide me no more ill mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home belovd of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife ill return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i the way of flattery further volumnia do your will exit cominius away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepard with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet coriolanus the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour menenius ay but

the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i the holy churchyard coriolanus scratches with briers scars to move laughter only menenius consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you cominius well well no more coriolanus what is the matter that being passd for consul with full voice i am so dishonourd that the very hour you take it off again sicinius answer to us coriolanus say

pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to havet with saying goodmorrow sicinius for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it in the name o the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in

save my life for if i had feard death of all the men i the world i would have voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cankerd country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou darst not this and that to prove more fortunes thart tird then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followd thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service aufidius o marcius marcius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say tis true id not believe them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scard the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i lovd the maid i married never man sighed truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each others throat and wakd half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no other quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banishd we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood oerbear o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepard against your territories though not for rome itself coriolanus you bless me gods aufidius therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take th one half of my commission and set down as best thou art experiencd since thou knowst thy countrys strength and weakness thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than eer an enemy yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome exeunt coriolanus and aufidius first servant heres a strange alteration second servant by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him first servant what an arm he has he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top second servant nay i knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought i cannot tell how to term it first servant he had so looking as it were would i were hanged but i thought there was more in him than i could think second servant so did i ill be sworn he is simply the rarest man i the world first servant i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on second servant who my master first servant nay its no matter for that second servant worth six on him first servant nay not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier second servant faith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent first servant ay and for an assault too reenter third servant third servant o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals first and second servant what what what lets partake third servant i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lief be a condemned man first and second servant wherefore wherefore third servant why heres he that was wont to thwack our general caius marcius first servant why do you say thwack our general third servant i do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him second servant come we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself first servant he was too hard for him directly to say the troth ont before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbonado second servant an he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too first servant but more of thy news third servant why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself withs hand and turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but the bottom of the news is our general is cut i the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table hell go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled second servant and hes as like to dot as any man i can imagine third servant dot he will dot for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst hes in dejectitude first servant dejectitude whats that third servant but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel all with him first servant but when goes this forward third servant tomorrow today presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips second servant why then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed balladmakers first servant let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night its spritely waking audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than wars a destroyer of men second servant tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds first servant ay and it makes men hate one another third servant reason because they then less need one another the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians they are rising they are rising all in in in in exeunt scene vi rome a public place enter sicinius and brutus sicinius we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer byt behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen singing in their shops and going about their functions friendly brutus we stood tot in good time is this menenius sicinius tis he tis he o he is grown most kind of late enter menenius brutus hail sir menenius hail to you both sicinius your coriolanus is not much missd but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were

him enter three or four citizens citizens the gods preserve you both sicinius godden our neighbours brutus godden to you all godden to you all first citizen ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both sicinius live and thrive brutus farewell kind neighbours we wishd coriolanus had lovd you as we did citizens now the gods keep you both tribunes farewell farewell exeunt citizens sicinius this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion brutus caius marcius was a worthy officer i the war but insolent oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking selfloving sicinius and affecting one sole throne without assistance menenius i think not so sicinius we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so brutus the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him enter an aedile aedile worthy tribunes there is a slave whom we have put in prison reports the volsces with several powers are enterd in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before em menenius tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out sicinius come what talk you of marcius brutus go see this rumourer whippd it cannot be the volsces dare break with us menenius cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like hath been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded sicinius tell not me i know this cannot be brutus not possible enter a messenger messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senatehouse some news is come that turns their countenances sicinius tis this slave go whip him fore the peoples eyes his raising nothing but his report messenger yes worthy sir the slaves report is seconded and more more fearful is deliverd sicinius what more fearful messenger it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not know that marcius joind with aufidius leads a power gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngst and oldest thing sicinius this is most likely brutus raisd only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again sicinius the very trick on t menenius this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety enter a second messenger second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already oerborne their way consumd with fire and took what lay before them enter cominius cominius o you have made good work menenius what news what news cominius you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonourd to your noses menenius whats the news whats the news cominius your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confind into an augers bore menenius pray now your news you have made fair work i fear me pray your news if marcius should be joind wi the volscians cominius if he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies menenius you have made good work you and your apron men you that stood so much upon the voice of occupation and the breath of garliceaters cominius hell shake your rome about your ears menenius as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work brutus but is this true sir cominius ay and youll look pale before you find it other all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resists are mockd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools who ist can blame him your enemies and his find something in him menenius we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy cominius who shall ask it the tribunes cannot dot for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say be good to rome they chargd him even as those should do that had deservd his hate and therein showd like enemies menenius tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair cominius you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never so incapable of help both tribunes say not we brought it menenius how was it we we lovd him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o the city cominius but i fear theyll roar him in again tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them enter a troop of citizens menenius here comes the clusters and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus exile now hes coming and not a hair upon a soldiers head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deservd it citizens faith we hear fearful news first citizen for mine own part when i said banish him i said twas pity second citizen and so did i third citizen and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will cominius you are goodly things you voices menenius you have made good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol cominius o ay what else exeunt cominius and menenius sicinius go masters get you home be not dismayd these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear first citizen the gods be good to us come masters lets home i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished him second citizen so did we all but come lets home exeunt citizens brutus i do not like this news sicinius nor i brutus lets to the capitol would half my wealth would buy this for a lie sicinius pray lets go exeunt scene vii a camp at a short distance from rome enter aufidius and his lieutenant aufidius do they still fly to the roman lieutenant i do not know what witchcrafts in him but your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat their talk at table and their thanks at end and you are darkend in this action sir even by your own aufidius i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in thats no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended lieutenant yet i wish sir i mean for your particular you had not joind in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself or else to him had left it solely aufidius i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine wheneer we come to our account lieutenant sir i beseech you think you hell carry rome aufidius all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think hell be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even whether twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controlld the war but one of these as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free him made him feard so hated and so banishd but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a cheer to extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come lets away when caius rome is thine thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine exeunt act v scene i rome a public place enter menenius cominius sicinius and brutus and others menenius no ill not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who lovd him in a most dear particular he calld me father but what o that go you that banishd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyd to hear cominius speak ill keep at home cominius he would not seem to know me menenius do you hear cominius yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forgd himself a name i the fire of burning rome menenius why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have rackd for rome to make coals cheap a noble memory cominius i minded him how royal twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punishd menenius very well could he say less cominius i offerd to awaken his regard fors private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose the offence menenius for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you sicinius nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so neverneeded help yet do not upbraids with our distress but sure if you would be your countrys pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman menenius no ill not meddle sicinius pray you go to him menenius what should i do brutus only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius menenius well and say that marcius return me as cominius is returnd unheard what then but as a discontented friend griefshot with his unkindness sayt be so sicinius yet your goodwill must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well menenius ill undertaket i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dind the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffd these pipes and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore ill watch him till he be dieted to my request and then ill set upon him brutus you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way menenius good faith ill prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success exit cominius hell never hear him sicinius not cominius i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him twas very faintly he said rise dismissed me thus with his speechless hand what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country therefore lets hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on exeunt scene ii an advanced post of the volscian camp before rome the guards at their station enter to them menenius first guard stay whence are you second guard stand and go back menenius you guard like men tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus first guard from whence menenius from rome first guard you may not pass you must return our general will no more hear from thence second guard youll see your rome embracd with fire before youll speak with coriolanus menenius good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touchd your ears it is menenius first guard be it so go back the virtue of your name is not here passable menenius i tell thee fellow thy general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his fame unparalleld haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom hes chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stampd the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass first guard faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely therefore go back menenius prythee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general second guard howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have i am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass therefore go back menenius has he dined canst thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner first guard you are a roman are you menenius i am as thy general is first guard then you should hate rome as he does can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this no you are deceived therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon menenius sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation second guard come my captain knows you not menenius i mean thy general first guard my general cares not for you back i say go lest i let forth your half pint of blood back thats the utmost of your having back menenius nay but fellow fellow enter coriolanus with aufidius coriolanus whats the matter menenius now you companion ill say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee coriolanus away menenius how away coriolanus wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore be gone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i lovd thee take this along i writ it for thy sake gives a letter and would have sent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my beloved in rome yet thou beholdst aufidius you keep a constant temper exeunt coriolanus and aufidius first guard now sir is your name menenius second guard tis a spell you see of much power you know the way home again first guard do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back second guard what cause do you think i have to swoon menenius i neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think theres any yare so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away exit first guard a noble fellow i warrant him second guard the worthy fellow is our general he is the rock the oak not to be windshaken exeunt scene iii the tent of coriolanus enter coriolanus aufidius and others coriolanus we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to the volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business aufidius only their ends you have respected stopped your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper no not with such friends that thought them sure of you coriolanus this last old man whom with crackd heart i have sent to rome lovd me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have though i showd sourly to him once more offerd the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to shout within ha what shout is this shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time tis made i will not enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia leading young marcius valeria and attendants my wife comes foremost then the honourd mould wherein this trunk was framd and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy ill never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin virgilia my lord and husband coriolanus these eyes are not the same i wore in rome virgilia the sorrow that delivers us thus changd makes you think so coriolanus like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgind it eer since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i the earth kneels of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons volumnia o stand up blessd whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent kneels coriolanus what is this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun murdering impossibility to make what cannot be slight work volumnia thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee do you know this lady coriolanus the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle thats curded by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dians temple dear valeria volumnia this is a poor epitome of yours which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself coriolanus the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars like a great seamark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee volumnia your knee sirrah coriolanus thats my brave boy volumnia even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you coriolanus i beseech you peace or if youd ask remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with romes mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons volumnia o no more no more you have said you will not grant us anything for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us coriolanus aufidius and you volsces mark for well hear nought from rome in private your request volumnia should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his countrys bowels out and to poor we thine enmitys most capital thou barrst us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles through our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and childrens blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i can not persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread trust tot thou shalt not on thy mothers womb that brought thee to this world virgilia ay and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time boy a shall not tread on me ill run away till i am bigger but then ill fight coriolanus not of a womans tenderness to be requires nor child nor womans face to see i have sat too long rising volumnia nay go not from us thus if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honour no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say this mercy we have showd the romans this we receivd and each in either side give the allhail to thee and cry be blessd for making up this peace thou knowst great son the end of wars uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be doggd with curses whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble but with his last attempt he wipd it out destroyd his country and his name remains to the ensuing age abhorrd speak to me son thou hast affected the fine strains of honour to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak why dost not speak thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons theres no man in the world more bound tos mother yet here he lets me prate like one i the stocks thou hast never in thy life showd thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen fond of no second brood has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home loaden with honour say my requests unjust and spurn me back

execution sicinius ist possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man menenius there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings hes more than a creeping thing sicinius he loved his mother dearly menenius so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eightyearold horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in sicinius yes mercy if you report him truly menenius i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you sicinius the gods be good unto us menenius no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they
