 prologue death with all its cruel beauty lived in the bayou its shadows ran deep cloaked by them a whisper in the marsh grass or rushes in the tangled trap of the kudzu meant life or fresh death its breath was thick and green and its eyes gleamed yellow in the dark silent as a snake its river swam a sinuous line black water under a fat white moon where the cypress knees broke the surface like bones piercing skin through the dark moondappled water the long knobby length of an alligator carved with barely a ripple like a secret its threat was silent when it struck its tail whipping a triumphant slice through the water when it clamped the unwary muskrat in its killing jaws the bayou echoed with a single short scream and the gator sank deep to the muddy bottom with its prey others had known the cruel silent depths of that river knew even in the vicious summer heat it was cold cold vast with secrets the bayou was never quite still in the night under a high hunters moon death was busy mosquitoes voracious vampires of the swamp whined in a jubilant cloud of greed players of the marsh music they blended with the buzzes hums and drips that were punctuated by the shocked squeals of the hunted in the high limbs of a live oak shadowed by moss and leaves an owl hooted its two mournful notes alerted a marsh rabbit ran for his life a breeze stirred the air then was gone like the single sigh of a ghost the owl swooped from its perch with a swift spread of wings near the river while the owl dived and the rabbit died an old gray house with a swaying dock slept in shadows beyond rising over a long lush spread of grass a great white manor stood watchful in the moonlight between them teeming with life vigorous with death the bayou laid its line manet hall louisiana december the baby was crying abigail heard it in dreams the soft unsettled whimper the stirring of tiny limbs under soft blankets she felt the first pangs of hunger a yearning in the belly almost as if the child were still inside her her milk came down before she was fully awake she rose quickly and without fuss it gave her such pleasure that overfull sensation in her breasts the tenderness of them the purpose of them her baby needed and she would provide she crossed to the recamier lifted the white robe draped over its back she drew in the scent of the hothouse lilies her favorite spearing out of a crystal vase that had been a wedding present before lucian shed been content to tuck wildflowers into bottles if lucian had been home he would have woken as well though she would have smiled have stroked a hand over his silky blond hair as she told him to stay to sleep he would have wandered up to the nursery before shed finished marie roses midnight feeding she missed him another ache in the belly but as she slipped into her night wrapper she remembered he would be back the next day she would start watching for him in the morning waiting to see him come galloping down the allée of oaks no matter what anyone thought or said she would run out to meet him her heart would leap oh it always leaped when he sprang down from his horse and lifted her off her feet into his arms and at the new years ball they would dance she hummed to herself as she lit a candle shielding it with her hand as she moved to the bedroom door out into the corridor of the great house where she had once been servant and was now well if not daughter of the house at least the wife of its son the nursery was on the third floor of the family wing that was a battle shed fought with lucians mother and lost josephine manet had definite rules about behavior domestic arrangements traditions madame josephine abigail thought as she moved quickly and quietly past the other bedroom doors had definite ideas on everything certainly that a threemonthold baby belonged in the nursery under the care of a nursemaid and not in a cradle tucked into the corner of her parents bedroom candlelight flickered and flew against the walls as abigail climbed the narrowing stairs at least shed managed to keep marie rose with her for six weeks and had used the cradle that was part of her own familys traditions it had been carved by her grandpère her own mother had slept in it then had tucked abigail in it seventeen years later marie rose had spent her first nights in that old cradle a tiny angel with her doting and nervous parents close at hand her daughter would respect her fathers family and their ways but abigail was determined that her child would also respect her mothers family and learn their ways josephine had complained about the baby about the homemade cradle so constantly that she and lucian had given in it was lucian said the way water wears at rock it never ceases so the rock gives way or wears down the baby spent her nights in the nursery now in the crib made in france where manet babies had slept for a century it was a proper if not cozy arrangement abby comforted herself her petite rose was a manet she would be a lady and as madame josephine had pointed out again and again other members of the household were not to have their sleep disturbed by fretful cries however such matters were done in the bayou here in manet hall children were tended in the nursery how her lips curled when she said it bayou as if it were a word to be spoken only in brothels and bars it didnt matter that madame josephine hated her that monsieur henri ignored her it didnt matter that julian looked at her the way no man should look at his brothers wife lucian loved her nor did it matter that marie rose slept in the nursery whether they were separated by a floor or a continent she felt marie roses needs as she felt her own the bond was so strong so true it could never be broken madame josephine may win battles but abigail knew she herself had won the war she had lucian and marie rose there were candles glowing in the nursery claudine the nursemaid didnt trust the gaslight she already held marie rose and was trying to quiet her with a sugar tit but the babys fists were shaking little balls of rage such a temper she has abigail set the candle down and was laughing as she crossed the room her arms already outstretched knows what she wants and when she wants it claudine a pretty cajun with sleepy dark eyes gave the baby a quick cuddle then passed her off she hardly made a fuss yet dont know how you hear her way off downstairs i hear her in my heart there now bébé mamans here diapers wet ill change her abigail rubbed her cheek on the babys and smiled claudine was a friend a battle won having her established in the nursery in the household gave abigail comfort and the companionship none of lucians family would offer her go on back to bed once shes nursed shell sleep till morning good as gold she is claudine brushed fingertips over marie roses curly hair if you dont need me maybe ill take a walk down to the river jasper hes gonna be there her dark eyes lit i told him maybe if i can get away i come down around midnight you oughta make that boy marry you chère oh im gonna maybe i run down for an hour or two if you dont mind abby i dont mind but you be careful you dont catch nothing more than some crawfish anything more she corrected as she prepared to change marie roses soiled linen dont you worry ill be back before two she started out through the connecting door and glanced back abby you ever think when we were kids that youd be mistress of this house one day im not mistress here she tickled the babys toes and had marie rose gurgling and the one who isll probably live to a hundred and ten off of spite just to make sure i never am if anybody could itd be that one but you will be one day you fell into the luck abby and it looks real fine on you alone with the baby abby tickled and cooed she powdered and smoothed then tidily fastened the fresh diaper when marie rose was tucked into a fresh gown and swaddled abby settled in the rocker bared her breast for that tiny hungry mouth those first greedy tugs the answering pull in her womb made her sigh yes shed fallen into the luck because lucian manet the heir of manet hall the shining knight of every fairy tale had looked at her and loved she bent her head to watch the baby nurse marie roses eyes were wide open fixed on her mothers face a tiny crease of concentration formed between her eyebrows oh she had such hope those eyes would stay blue like lucians the babys hair was dark like her own dark and curling but her skin was milk white again like her papas rather than the deeper tone the dusky gold of her cajun mamas she would have the best of both of them abby thought she would have the best of everything it wasnt only the money the grand house the social position though she wanted that for her children now that she had tasted it herself it was the acceptance the learning the knowing you belonged in such a place her daughter and all the children who came after would read and write would speak proper english proper french in fine voices no one would ever look down on them youll be a lady abigail murmured stroking the babys cheek as marie roses hand kneaded her breast as if to hurry the milk along an educated lady with your papas sweet heart and your mamas good sense papall be home tomorrow its the very last day of a whole century and you have your whole life to live in it her voice was quiet a singsong rhythm to lull both of them its so exciting rosie my rosie were going to have a grand ball tomorrow night i have a new gown its blue like your eyes like your papas eyes did i tell you i fell in love with his eyes first so beautiful so kind when he came back to manet hall from the university he looked like a prince coming home to his castle oh my heart just pounded so she leaned back rocking in the fluttering light of the candles she thought of the new years celebration the next evening and how she would dance with lucian how her gown would sweep and swirl as they waltzed how she would make him proud and she remembered the first time they had waltzed in the spring with the air heavy with perfume from the flowers and the house alight like a palace shed sneaked into the garden away from her duties because shed wanted to see it so much the way the gleaming white hall with its balusters like black lace stood against the starry sky the way the windows flamed music had spilled out of those windows out of the gallery doors where guests had stepped out for air shed imagined herself inside the ballroom whirling whirling to the music and so had whirled in the shadows of the garden and whirling had seen lucian watching her on the path her own fairy tale abby thought the prince taking cinderellas hand and drawing her into a dance moments before midnight struck shed had no glass slipper no pumpkin coach but the night had turned into magic she could still hear the way the music had floated out through the balcony doors over the air into the garden after the ball is over after the break of morn she sang the refrain quietly shifting the baby to her other breast after the dancers leaving after the stars are gone they had danced to that lovely sad song in the moonlit garden with the house a regal white and gold shadow behind them her in her simple cotton dress and lucian in his handsome evening clothes and as such things were possible in fairy tales they fell in love during that lovely sad song oh she knew it had started before that night for her it had begun with her first glimpse of him astride the chestnut mare hed ridden from new orleans to the plantation the way the sun had beamed through the leaves and the moss on the live oaks along the allée surrounding him like angel wings his twin had ridden beside him julian but shed seen only lucian shed been in the house only a few weeks then taken on as an undermaid and doing her best to please monsieur and madame manet so she might keep her position and the wages earned hed spoken to her kindly correctly if they passed each other in the house but shed sensed him watching her not the way julian watched not with hot eyes and a smirk twisting his lips but she liked to think now with a kind of longing in the weeks that went by she would come upon him often hed sought her out she knew that now prized that now as hed confessed it to her on their wedding night but it had really begun the evening of the ball after the song had ended hed held her just a moment longer then he bowed as a gentleman bows to a lady he kissed her hand then just as she thought it was over that the magic would dim he tucked the hand hed kissed into the crook of his arm began to walk with her to talk with her the weather the flowers the gossip of the household as if they were friends abby thought now with a smile as if it were the most natural thing in the world for lucian manet to take a turn in the garden with abigail rouse theyd walked in the garden many nights after that inside the house where others could see they remained master and servant but all through that heady spring they walked the garden paths as young lovers telling each other of hopes of dreams of sorrows and joys on her seventeenth birthday he brought her a gift wrapped in silver paper with a bright blue bow the enameled watch was a pretty circle dangling from the golden wings of a brooch time flew he told her as he pinned the watch to the faded cotton of her dress when they were together and he would rather have his life wing by than spend it apart from her hed gotten down on one knee and asked her to be his wife it could never be oh shed tried to tell him through the tears he was beyond her reach and he could have anyone she remembered now how hed laughed how the joy had burst over his beautiful face how could he be beyond her reach when she had his hand in hers even now and if he could have anyone then he would have her so now we have each other and you abby whispered and shifted the drowsing baby to her shoulder and if his family hates me for it what does it matter i make him happy she turned her face into the soft curve of the babys neck im learning to speak as they speak to dress as they dress i will never think as they think but for lucian i behave as they behave at least when it shows content she rubbed the babys back and continued to rock but when she heard the heavy footsteps on the stairs the stumbling climb she rose quickly her arms tightened in a circle of protection around the baby as she turned toward the crib she heard julian come through the door and knew without seeing he would be drunk he was nearly always drunk or on his way to becoming so abby didnt speak she lay the baby in the crib and when marie rose whimpered restlessly stroked her quiet again wheres the nursemaid he demanded still abby didnt turn i dont want you in here when youve been drinking giving orders now his voice was slurred his balance impaired but he was thinking clearly enough liquor hed always believed helped clarify the mind and his was clarified when it came to his brothers wife if lucian had a thing and what was a woman but a thing julian wanted it she was small almost delicate of build but she had good strong legs he could see the shape of them where the firelight in the nursery grate shimmered through her thin nightclothes those legs would wrap around him as easily as they did his brother her breasts were high and full fuller now since shed had the whelp hed gotten his hands on them once and shed slapped him for it as if she had a say in who touched her he closed the door at his back the whore hed bought that night had only whetted his appetite it was time to sate it wheres the other bayou slut abbys hand fisted at her side she turned now guarding the crib with her body he looked so like lucian but there was a hardness in him lucian lacked a darkness she wondered if it was true what her grandmère said that with twins sometimes traits get divvied up in the womb one gets the good the other the bad she didnt know if julian had come into the world already spoiled but she knew he was dangerous when drunk it was time he learned she was dangerous as well claudine is my friend and you have no right to speak of her that way get out you have no right to come in here and insult me this time lucian will hear of it she saw his gaze slide down from her face watched lust come into his eyes quickly she tugged her wrapper over the breast still partially exposed from nursing youre disgusting cochon to come in a childs room with your wicked thoughts for your brothers wife brothers whore he thought he could smell her anger and her fear now a heady perfume youd have spread your legs for me if id been born fifteen minutes sooner but you wouldnt have stolen my name the way you stole his her chin came up i dont even see you no one does youre nothing beside him a shadow and one that stinks of whiskey and the brothel she wanted to run he frightened her had always frightened her on a deep primal level but she wouldnt risk leaving him with the baby when i tell lucian of this hell send you away he has no power here and we all know it he came closer easing his way like a hunter through the woods my mother holds the power in this house im her favorite timing at birth doesnt change that he will send you away tears stung the back of her throat because she knew julian was right it was josephine who reigned in manet hall lucian did me a favor marrying you his voice was a lazy drawl now almost conversational he knew she had nowhere to run shes already cut him out of her will oh hell get the house she cant change that but ill get her money and its her money that runs this place take the money take the house she flung out her hands dismissing them and him take it all and go to hell with it hes weak my sainted brother saints always are under all the piety hes a man so much more a man than you shed hoped to make him angry angry enough to strike her and storm out instead he laughed low and quiet and edged closer when she saw the intent in his eyes she opened her mouth to scream his hand whipped out gripped a hank of the dark hair that curled to her waist and yanking had her scream gurgling into a gasp his free hand circled her throat squeezed i always take whats lucians even his whores she beat at him slapped bit and when she could draw in air screamed he tore at her wrapper pawed at her breasts in the crib the baby began to wail fueled by the sound of her childs distress abby clawed her way free she spun stumbled over the torn hem of her nightgown her hand closed over the fireplace poker she swung wildly ramming it hard against julians shoulder howling in pain he fell back against the hearth and she flew toward the crib she had to get the baby to get the baby and run he caught her sleeve and she screamed again as the material ripped even as she reached down to snatch her daughter from the crib he dragged her back he struck her slicing the back of his hand over her cheek and knocking her back into a table a candle fell to the floor and guttered out in its own wax bitch whore he was mad she could see it now in the feral gleam in his eyes the drunken flush on his cheeks in that instant fear turned to terror hell kill you for this my lucian will kill you she tried to gain her feet but he hit her again using his fist this time so the pain radiated from her face through her body dazed she began to crawl toward the crib there was blood in her mouth sweet and warm my baby sweet god dont let him hurt my baby his weight was on her and the stench of him she bucked called for help the sound of the babys furious screams merged with hers dont dont you damn yourself but as he yanked up the skirt of her nightgown she knew no amount of pleading no amount of struggle would stop him he would debase her soil her because of who she was because she was lucians this is what you want he drove himself into her and the thrill of power spurted through him like black wine her face was white with fear and shock and raw from the blows of his hands helpless he thought as he pounded out his raging envy this is what all of you want cajun whores thrust after violent thrust he raped her the thrill of forcing himself into her spumed through him until his breathing turned to short bursts grunted between clenched teeth she was weeping now huge choking sobs but screaming too somehow screaming as he hammered his fury his jealousy his disgust into her as the great clock began to chime midnight he closed his hands around her throat shut up damn you he rammed her head against the floor squeezed harder and still the screaming pierced his brain abby heard it too dimly the babys frantic cries pealed through her head along with the slow formal bongs of the midnight hour she slapped weak protests against the hands that cut off her air tried to shut her body off from the unspeakable invasion help me mother of jesus help me help my baby her vision dimmed her heels drummed wildly on the floor as she convulsed the last thing she heard was her crying daughter the last thing she thought was lucian the door of the nursery burst open josephine manet stood just inside the nursery she summed up the scene quickly coldly julian his hands still vised around abbys throat he looked up if his mother saw madness in his eyes she chose to ignore it with her gilt hair neatly braided for the night her robe sternly buttoned to the neck she stepped over stared down abbys eyes were wide and staring there was a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth and bruises blooming along her cheeks dispassionately she leaned down laid her fingers against abbys throat shes dead josephine announced and moved quickly to the connecting door she opened it glanced into the maids room then closed it locked it she stood for a moment her back against it her hand at her own throat as she thought of what could come disgrace ruin scandal it was an accident his hands began to shake as they slid away from abbys throat the whiskey was whirling in his head now clouding it it churned in his belly sickening it he could see the marks on her skin dark and deep and damning she tried to seduce me then she attacked she crossed the room again her slippers clicking on wood crouching down josephine slapped him one hard crack of flesh on flesh quiet be quiet and do exactly as i say i wont lose another son to this creature take her down to her bedroom go out through the gallery and stay there until i come it was her fault yes now shes paid for it take her down julian and be quick theyll a single tear gathered in the corner of his eye and spilled over theyll hang me i have to get away no no they wont hang you she brought his head to her shoulder stroking his hair over the body of her daughterinlaw no my sweet they wont hang you do what mama says now carry her to the bedroom and wait for me everythings going to be all right everythings going to be as it should be i promise i dont want to touch her julian the crooning tone snapped into icy command do as i say immediately she rose walked over to the crib where the babys wails had turned to miserable whimpers in the heat of the moment she considered simply laying her hand over the childs mouth and nose hardly different than drowning a bag of kittens and yet the child had her sons blood in her and therefore her own she could despise it but she couldnt destroy it go to sleep she said well decide what to do about you later as her son carried the girl hed raped and murdered from the room josephine began to set the nursery to rights again she picked up the candle scrubbed at the cooling wax until she could see no trace she replaced the fireplace poker and using the ruin of abbys robe wiped up the splatters of blood she did it all efficiently turning her mind away from what had caused the damage to the room keeping it firmly fixed on what needed to be done to save her son when she was certain all was as it should be she unlocked the door again left her nowsleeping grandchild alone in the morning she would fire the nursemaid for dereliction of duty she would have her out of manet hall before lucian returned to find his wife missing the girl had brought it on herself josephine thought no good ever came from trying to rise above your station in life there was an order to things and a reason for that order if the girl hadnt bewitched lucian for surely there was some local witchery involved she would still be alive the family had suffered enough scandal the elopement oh the embarrassment of it of having to hold your head high when your firstborn son ran off with a penniless barefoot female whod grown up in a shack in the swamp then the sour taste of the pretense that followed it was essential to save face even after such a blow and hadnt she done all that could be done to see that creature was dressed as befitted the family manet silk purses sows ears she thought what good were paris fashions when the girl had only to open her mouth and sound of the swamp for pitys sake shed been a servant josephine stepped into the bedroom shut the door at her back and stared at the bed where her sons dead wife lay staring up at the blue silk canopy now she thought abigail rouse was simply a problem to be solved julian huddled in a chair his head in his hands stop screaming he muttered stop the screaming josephine marched to him clamped her hands on his shoulders do you want them to come for you she demanded do you want to drag the family through disgrace to be hanged like a common thief it wasnt my fault she enticed me then she attacked me look look he turned his head see how she clawed my face yes for a moment just for a moment josephine wavered the heart inside the symbol shed become reared up in protest against the horror of the act all women fear whatever she was shed loved lucian whatever she was shed been raped and murdered within feet of her own childs crib julian forced her struck her defiled her killed her drunk and mad hed killed his brothers wife gods pity then she shoved it viciously aside the girl was dead her son was not you bought a prostitute tonight dont turn away from me she snapped im not ignorant of the things men do did you buy a woman yes mama she nodded briskly then it was the whore who scratched you should anyone have the temerity to ask you were never in the nursery tonight she cupped his face in her hands to keep his eyes level with hers and her fingers dug into his cheeks as she spoke in low clear tones what reason would you have to go there you went out for drink and women and having your fill of both came home and went to bed is that clear but how will we explain was well have nothing to explain ive told you what you did tonight repeat it i i went into town he licked his lips swallowed i drank then i went to a brothel i came home and went to bed thats right thats right she stroked his scored cheek now were going to pack some of her things some clothes some jewelry well do it quickly as she did it quickly when she decided to run off with a man shed been seeing in secret a man who might very well be the father of that child upstairs what man josephine let out a long sigh he was the child of her heart but she often despaired of his brain never mind julian you know nothing of it here she went to the chifforobe chose a long black velvet cloak wrap her in this hurry do it she said in a tone that had him getting to his feet his stomach pitched and his hands trembled but he wrapped the body in velvet as best he could while his mother stuffed things in a hatbox and a train case in her rush she dropped a brooch of gold wings with a small enameled watch dangling from it the toe of her slipper struck it so that it skittered into a corner well take her into the swamp well have to go on foot and quickly there are some old paving bricks in the garden shed we can weigh her down with them and the gators she thought the gators and fish would do the rest even if shes found its away from here the man she ran away with killed her she dabbed her face with the handkerchief in the pocket of her robe smoothed a hand over her long gilded braid thats what people will believe if shes found we need to get her away from here away from manet hall quickly she was beginning to feel a little mad herself there was moonlight she told herself there was moonlight because fate understood what she was doing and why she could hear her sons rapid breathing and the sounds of the night the frogs the insects the night birds all merging together into one thick note it was the end of a century the beginning of the new she would rid herself of this aberration to her world and start this new century this new era clean and strong there was a chill in the air made raw with wet but she felt hot almost burning hot as she trudged away from the house laden with the bags shed packed and weighed down the muscles of her arms of her legs protested but she marched like a soldier once just once she thought she felt a brush against her cheek like the breath of a ghost the spirit of a dead girl who trailed beside her accusing damning cursing her for eternity fear only made her stronger here she stopped and peered out over the water lay her down julian obeyed then rose quickly turned his back covered his face with his hands i cant do this mama i cant im sick sick he tumbled toward the water retching weeping useless boy she thought mildly annoyed men could never handle a crisis it took a woman the cold blood and clear mind of a female josephine opened the cloak laid bricks over the body sweat began to pour down her face but she approached the grisly task as she would any other with ruthless efficiency she took the rope out of the hatbox carefully tied hanks around the cloaked body top bottom middle using another she looped the line through the handles of the luggage knotted it tight she glanced over now to see julian watching her his face white as bone youll have to help i cant get her into the water alone shes too heavy now i was drunk thats correct julian you were drunk now youre sober enough to deal with the consequences help me get her into the water he felt his legs buckle and give with each step like a puppets the body slid into the water almost soundlessly there was a quiet plop a kind of gurgle then it was gone ripples spread on the surface shimmered in the moonlight then smoothed away again shes out of our lives josephine stated calmly soon shell be like those ripples like she never was see that you clean your boots thoroughly julian dont give them to a servant she slid her arm through his smiled though her smile was just a little wild we need to get back get some rest tomorrows a very busy day manet hall louisiana january his mother was right as always declan fitzgerald stared through the mud splattered windshield into the driving winter rain and was glad she wasnt there to gloat not that colleen sullivan fitzgerald ever stooped to a gloat she merely raised one perfect eyebrow into one perfect arch and let her silence do the gloating for her shed told him very succinctly when hed stopped by before driving out of boston that hed lost his mind and would rue the day yes he was pretty sure shed said rue the day he hadnt sunk as low as ruing yet but studying the jungle of weeds the sagging galleries the peeling paint and broken gutters of the old plantation house he was no longer confident of his mental health what had made him think he could restore this rambling old derelict into its former splendor or more to the point that he should for gods sake he was a lawyer a fitzgerald of the boston fitzgeralds and more tuned to swinging a nineiron than a hammer rehabbing a town house in his spare time over a twoyear period was a far cry from relocating to new orleans and pretending he was a contractor had the place looked this bad the last time hed been down here could it have of course that was five no six years before certainly it couldnt have looked this bad the first time hed seen it hed been twenty and spending a crazed mardi gras interlude with his college roommate eleven years he thought dragging his fingers through his dark blond hair the old manet hall had been a niggling germ in his brain for eleven years as obsessions went it was longer than most relationships certainly longer than any of his own now the house was his for better or for worse he already had a feeling there was going to be plenty of worse his eyes as gray and at the moment as bleak as the rain scanned the structure the graceful twin arches of the double stairs leading to the second floor gallery had charmed him on that longago february and all those tall arched windows the whimsy of the belvedere on the roof the elegance of the white columns and strangely ornate iron balusters the fanciful mix of italianate and greek revival had all seemed so incredibly lush and old world and southern even then hed felt displaced in a way hed never been able to explain in new england the house had pulled him in some deep chamber like a hook through memory he thought now hed been able to visualize the interior even before he and remy had broken in to ramble through it or the gallon or two of beer theyd sucked down had caused him to think he could a drunk boy barely out of his teens couldnt be trusted and neither declan admitted ruefully could a stonesober thirtyoneyear old man the minute remy had mentioned that manet hall was on the block again hed put in a bid sight unseen or unseen for more than half a decade hed had to have it as if hed been waiting all his life to call it his own he could deem the price reasonable if he didnt consider what hed have to pour into it to make it habitable so he wouldnt consider it just now it was his whether he was crazy or whether he was right no matter what hed turned in his briefcase for a tool belt that alone lightened his mood he pulled out his cell phone you could take the lawyer out of boston but still studying the house he put in a call to remy payne he went through a secretary and imagined remy sitting at a desk cluttered with files and briefs it made him smile a quick crooked grin that shifted the planes and angles of his face hollowed the cheeks softened the sometimes grim line of his mouth yes he thought life could be worse he could be the one at the desk well hey dec remys lazy drawl streamed into the packed mercedes suv like a mist over a slowmoving river where are you boy im sitting in my car looking at this white elephant i was crazy enough to buy why the hell didnt you talk me out of it or have me committed youre here son of a bitch i didnt think youd make it until tomorrow got antsy he rubbed his chin heard the scratch of stubble drove through most of last night and got an early start again this morning remy what was i thinking damned if i know listen you give me a couple hours to clear some business and ill drive out bring us some libation well toast that rattrap and catch up good thatd be good you been inside yet no im working up to it jesus dec go on in out of the rain yeah all right declan passed a hand over his face see you in a couple hours ill bring food for christs sake dont try to cook anything no point burning the place down before youve spent a night in it fuck you he heard remy laugh before he hung up he started the engine again drove all the way to the base of what was left of those double stairs that framed the entranceway he popped the glove compartment took out the keys that had been mailed to him after settlement he climbed out and was immediately drenched deciding hed leave the boxes for later he jogged to the shelter of the entrance gallery felt a few of the bricks that formed the floor give ominously under his weight and shook himself like a dog there should be vines climbing up the corner columns he thought something with cool blue blossoms he could see it if he concentrated hard enough something open almost like a cup with leaves shaped like hearts m ve seen that somewhere he mused and turned to the door it was a double with carvings and long arched panels of glass on either side and a halfmoon glass topper and tracing his fingers over the doors he felt some of the thrill sneak into him welcome home dec he said aloud and unlocked the door the foyer was as he remembered it the wide loblolly pine floor the soaring ceiling the plaster medallion overhead was a double ring of some sort of flowers it had probably boasted a fabulous crystal chandelier in its heyday the best it could offer now was a single bare bulb dangling from a long wire but when he hit the wall switch it blinked on that was something in any event the staircase was the focal point it rose up wide and straight to the second level where it curved right and left to lead to each wing what a single man with no current prospects or intentions of being otherwise needed with two wings was a question he didnt want to ask himself at the moment the banister was coated with gray dust but when he rubbed a finger over it he felt the smooth wood beneath how many hands had gripped there how many fingers had trailed along it he wondered these were the sort of questions that fascinated him that drew him in the kind of questions that had him climbing the stairs with the door open to the rain behind him and his possessions still waiting in the car the stairs might have been carpeted once there probably had been runners in the long center hallway some rich pattern on deep red floors woodwork tabletops would have been polished religiously with beeswax until they gleamed like the crystal in the chandeliers at parties women in spectacular dresses would glide up and down the stairs confident stylish some of the men would gather in the billiard room using the game as an excuse to puff on cigars and pontificate about politics and finance and servants would scurry along efficiently invisible stoking fires clearing glasses answering demands on the landing he opened a panel the hidden door was skillfully worked into the wall the faded wallpaper the dulled wainscoting he wasnt certain how hed known it was there someone must have mentioned it he peered into the dim dank corridor part of the rabbit warren of servants quarters and accesses he believed family and guests didnt care to have underfoot those who served a good servant left no trace of his work but saw to his duties discreetly silently and well frowning declan strained his eyes to see where had that come from his mother as tightassed as she could be from time to time shed never say something that pompous with a shrug he closed the door again hed explore that area another time when he had a flashlight and a bag of bread crumbs he walked along the corridor glancing in doorways empty rooms full of dust and the smell of damp gray light from the rain some walls were papered some were down to the skeletal studs sitting room study bath and surely the billiard room hed imagined as its old mahogany bar was still in place he walked in to circle around it to touch the wood to crouch down and examine the workmanship hed started a love affair with wood in high school to date it was his most lasting relationship hed taken a summer job as a laborer even though his family had objected hed objected to the idea of spending those long summer days cooped up in a law office as a clerk and had wanted to work outdoors to polish his tan and his build it had been one of the rare times his father had overruled his mother and sided with him hed gotten sunburn splinters blisters calluses an aching back and had fallen in love with building not building so much declan thought now rebuilding the taking of something already formed and enhancing repairing restoring nothing had given him as big a kick or half as much satisfaction hed had a knack for it a natural the irish pug of a foreman had told him good hands good eyes good brain declan had never forgotten that summer high and had never matched it since maybe now he thought maybe he would now there had to be more for him than just getting from one day to the next doing what was expected and acceptable with pleasure and anticipation growing he went back to exploring his house at the door to the ballroom he stopped and grinned wow cool his voice echoed and all but bounced back to slap him in the face delighted he walked in the floors were scarred and stained and spotted there were sections damaged where it appeared someone had put up partitions to bisect the room then someone else had knocked them out again but he could fix that some moron had thrown up drywall and yellow paint over the original plaster walls hed fix that too at least theyd left the ceiling alone the plasterwork was gorgeous complicated wreaths of flowers and fruit it would need repairing and a master to do it hed find one he threw open the gallery doors to the rain the neglected tumbled jungle of gardens spread out snaked through with overgrown and broken bricked paths there was likely a treasure of plantings out there hed need a landscaper but he hoped to do some of it himself most of the outbuildings were only ruins now he could see a portion of a chimney stack part of a vinesmothered wall of a derelict workers cabin the pocked bricks and rusted roof of an old pigeonnier creole planters had often raised pigeons hed only gotten three acres with the house so it was likely other structures that had belonged to the plantation were now tumbling down on someone elses land but he had trees he thought amazing trees the ancient live oaks that formed the allée dripped with water and moss and the thick limbs of a sycamore spread and twisted like some prehistoric beast a wash of color caught his attention had him stepping out into the rain something was blooming a tall fat bush with dark red flowers what the hell bloomed in january he wondered and made a mental note to ask remy closing his eyes a moment he listened he could hear nothing but rain the whoosh and splash of it on roof on ground on tree hed done the right thing he told himself he wasnt crazy after all hed found his place it felt like his and if it wasnt what did it matter hed find another at least finally hed stirred up the energy to look he stepped back in and humming walked back across the ballroom toward the family wing to check out each of the five bedrooms he caught himself singing under his breath as he wandered through the first of them after the ball is over after the break of morn after the dancers leaving after the stars are gone he stopped examining baseboard and looked over his shoulder as if expecting to see someone standing behind him where had that come from he wondered the tune the lyrics with a shake of his head he straightened from the ballroom idiot he mumbled ballroom on the mind so you start singing about a ball weird but not crazy talking to yourself isnt crazy either lots of people do it the door to the room across the hall was closed though he expected the creak of hinges the sound still danced a chill up his spine that sensation was immediately followed by bafflement he could have sworn he smelled perfume flowers lilies weddings and funerals and for an instant he imagined them pure and white and somehow feral in a tall crystal vase his next feeling was irritation hed only sent a few pieces ahead including his bedroom furniture the movers had dumped it in the wrong room and hed been very specific his room would be the master at the corner overlooking the garden and pond at the rear and the avenue of oaks from the side now hed have to settle for this room or haul the damn stuff himself the scent of lilies was overpowering when he shoved the door all the way open almost dizzying confused he realized it wasnt even his furniture the bed was a full tester draped in deep blue silk there was a carved chifforobe a tall chest of drawers all gleaming he caught the scent of beeswax under the floral saw the lilies in that tall crystal vase on a womans vanity table its legs curved like the necks of swans the chair was delicate its seat an intricate needlepoint pattern of blue and rose silverbacked brushes a brooch of gold wings with an enameled watch long blue draperies ornate gaslight sconces set on a low shimmering light a womans white robe tossed over the back of a blue chaise candlesticks on the mantel and a picture in a silver frame he saw it all snapshot clear before his brain could process the how of it he was staring into an empty room where rain streamed outside uncurtained windows jesus christ he gripped the doorjamb for balance what the hell he drew in a breath there was nothing in the air but must and dust projecting he told himself just projecting what the room might have looked like he hadnt seen anything or smelled anything hed just gotten caught up in the charm of the place in the spirit of it but he couldnt make himself step over the threshold he closed the door again walked directly down to the corner room his furniture was there as ordered and the sight of it both relieved and steadied him the good solid chippendale bed with its headboard and footboard unadorned the one point of agreement hed had always with his mother was a love of antiques the respect for the workmanship the history hed bought the bed after he and jessica had called off the wedding okay after hed called it off he admitted with the usual tug of guilt hed wanted to start fresh and had searched out and purchased the pieces for his bedroom hed chosen the bachelors chest not only because it appeared he was going to remain one but also because hed liked the style of it the double herringbone inlay the secret compartments the short turned legs hed selected the armoire to conceal his television and stereo and the sleek deco lamps because hed liked the mix of styles seeing his things here in the spacious room with its handsome granite fireplace in dark green the arched gallery doors the gently faded wallpaper the pitifully scarred floors clicked him back into place again the adjoining dressing area made him smile all he needed was a valet and white tie and tails the connecting bath modernized from the look of it sometime in the woeful seventies had him wincing at the avocadogreen decor and yearning for a hot shower hed take a quick walk through the third floor he decided do the same on the main level then take the ugly green tub for a spin he headed up the tune was playing in his head again around and around like a waltz he let it come it was company of sorts until remy showed up many the hopes that have vanished after the ball the staircase was narrower here this level was for children and staff neither of whom required fancy touches hed save the servants wing for later he decided and circled around toward what he assumed were nursery storage attics he reached for a doorknob the brass dull with time and neglect a draft cold enough to pierce bone swept down the corridor he saw his breath puff out in surprise watched it condense into a thin cloud as his hand closed over the knob nausea rose up so fast so sharp it stole his breath again cold sweat pearled on his brow his head spun in an instant he knew a fear so huge so great he wanted to run screaming instead he stumbled back braced himself against the wall while terror and dread choked him like murderous hands dont go in there dont go in wherever the voice in his head came from he was inclined to listen to it he knew the house was rumored to be haunted he didnt mind such things or thought he didnt mind them but the idea of opening that door to whatever was behind it to whatever waited on the other side was more than he cared to face alone on an empty stomach after a tenhour drive just wasting time anyway he said for the comfort of his own voice i should be unloading the car so im going to unload the car who you talking to cher declan jumped like a basketball center at the tipoff and barely managed to turn a scream into a more acceptable masculine yelp god damn it remy you scared the shit out of me youre the one up here talking to a door i gave a few shouts on my way up guess you didnt hear guess i didnt declan leaned back against the wall sucked in air and studied his friend remy payne had the cocky good looks of a con artist he was tailormade for the law declan thought slick sharp with cheerful blue eyes and a wide mouth that could as it was now stretch like rubber into a disarming smile that made you want to believe everything he said even as you caught the distinctive whiff of bullshit he was on the skinny side never had been able to bulk up despite owning the appetite of an elephant in college hed worn his deepbrown hair in a sleek mane over his collar hed shortened it now so it was almost caesarean in style i thought you said a couple hours been that damn near two and a half you okay there dec look a little peaky long drive i guess god its good to see you bout time you mentioned that with a laugh he caught declan in a bear hug whoo boy you been working out turn around lemme see your ass you idiot they slapped backs tell me one thing declan remarked as he took a step back am i out of my fucking mind course you are always have been lets go on down and have ourselves a drink they settled in what had once been the gentlemens parlor on the floor with a pepperoni pizza and a bottle of jim beam the first shot of bourbon went down like liquid silk and untied all the knots in declans belly the pizza was good and greasy and made him decide the strangeness hed experienced had been a result of fatigue and hunger you planning on living like this for long or buying yourself a chair or two dont need a chair or two declan took the bottle back from remy swigged down bourbon not for now anyway i wanted to cut things down to the bone for a while i got the bedroom stuff might toss a table up in the kitchen i start buying furniture itll just be in the way while im working on this place remy looked around the room shape this place is in youll need a fucking wheelchair before youre finished its mostly cosmetic people who bought it last got a good start on the big work from what i hear seems they had an idea about turning it into a fancy hotel or some such thing gave it nearly six months before they turned tail probably they ran out of money lifting his eyebrows remy ran a finger over the floor studied the layer of dust he picked up too bad you cant sell this dirt youd be filthy rich ha oh yeah i forgot you already are filthy rich hows your family about the same as always and they think our boy dec il est fou remy circled a finger by his ear hes gone round the bend oh yeah maybe theyre right but at

remy licked sauce from his fingers you shouldve tried criminal like me keeps the blood moving you say the word well hang out a shingle together tomorrow thanks for the thought you still love it i do i

jacket rolled up the sleeves of his lawyerly blue shirt except for the hair declan thought he didnt look that different than he did when theyd been at harvard sucking down pizza and bourbon youre really doing it getting married remy let out a sigh twelfth of may come hell or high water im settling my bad ass down dec shes just what i want a librarian it was a wonder to declan you and a librarian research specialist remy corrected and hooted out a laugh damn prettiest bookworm i ever did see shes a smart one too im crazy in love with her dec out of my mind crazy for her im happy for you you still got the guilts over what was her name jennifer jessica wincing declan took another swig to cut the taste her name brought to his tongue calling off a wedding three weeks before youre due to walk down the aisle ought to give you the guilts remy acknowledged this with a quick shrug maybe so feel worse if youd gone through with it tell me still his gray eyes remained broody as he stared at the bottle but i think shed have handled it better if wed done the thing then gone for a divorce the next day it still gave him a twinge couldnt have handled it any worse anyway shes seeing my cousin james now james james that the one who squeals like a girl or the one with the dracula hair neither declans lips twitched jesus hed missed this james is the perfect one plastic surgeon polo player collects stamps short guy receding chin broad yankee accent thats him but the chin doesnt recede anymore implant according to my sister its starting to look serious between them which just serves me right im told well hell let your sister marry jennifer jessica and thats what i told her he said gesturing with the bottle for emphasis she didnt speak to me for two weeks which was a relief im not very popular with the fitzgeralds right now well you know dec id have to say given the circumstances and such screw em with a laugh declan handed remy the bottle lets drink to it he took another slice of pizza from the box let me ask you something else about this place ive researched the history did a chunk of it way back after we came here the first time stumbling around like drunken fools yeah which we may do again if we keep hitting this bourbon anyway i know it was built in after the original structure burned down in an unexplained fire which was very likely set due to politics reconstruction and other post civil war messiness thats the war of northern aggression son remy pointed a warning finger remember which side of the masondixon line youre plopping your yankee ass down on now right sorry anyway the manets scooped up the land cheap according to the old records and built the current structure they farmed sugar and cotton primarily and divvied off plots to sharecroppers lived well for about twenty years there were two sons both died young then the old man died and the wife held on until she apparently stroked out in her sleep no heirs there was a granddaughter on record but she was cut out of the will place went to auction and has passed from hand to hand ever since sitting empty more than not and declan leaned forward do you believe its haunted remy pursed his lips copped the last piece of pizza that whole history lesson was your way of working around to asking that one question boy you got the makings for a fine southern lawyer sure its haunted his eyes danced as he bit into the pizza house been here this long and isnt itd have no self respect whatsoever the granddaughter you mentioned she was a rouse on her mamas side i know that as im fourth or fifth cousins with the simones and the simones come down from that line girl was raised i believe by her maternal grandparents after her mama took off with some man so its said dont know if i recollect what happened to her daddy but others will if you want to know i do know that henri manet his wife josephine and the one son damned if i know what his name was all died in this house one of them doesnt have the gumption to haunt it thats a crying shame natural causes the people who died here curious remy frowned far as i know why i dont know declan had to fight off a shudder vibes you want someone to come through here little grisgris little voodoo chase off your ghost or maybe summon the spirit for a little conversation you can find yourself a witch or psychic every second corner in town no thanks you let me know if you decide different remy winked ill put you onto somebody wholl give you a fine show he didnt want a show declan decided later but he did want that shower and bed with jim beam buzzing pleasantly in his blood he hauled in boxes pawed through them to find sheets and towels he carted what he figured hed need for the night upstairs it was good old catholic guilt rather than any need for order that had him making the bed he treated himself to a tenminute shower then climbed into the fresh sheets to the sound of the incessant rain he was asleep in thirty seconds there was a baby crying it didnt strike him as odd at all babies tended to cry in the middle of the night or whenever they damn well pleased it sounded fretful and annoyed more than alarmed someone ought to go pick it up do whatever people did with crying babies feed it change it rock it when hed waked from nightmares as a child his mother or his nanny sometimes his father had come in to stroke his head and sit with him until the fear faded away again the baby wasnt frightened the baby was hungry it didnt strike him as odd that he thought that that he knew that but it did strike him as odd very odd to wake bathed in sweat and find himself standing outside the door with the dull brass knob on the third floor sleepwalking that was something he hadnt done since childhood but in the watery light of day it was simple enough to see how it had happened jim beam pepperoni pizza and talk of ghosts a little harder to accept was the gutclenching terror hed felt when hed surfaced and found himself outside that thirdlevel door hed snapped out of the fugue and into a nightmare of panic one where hed been certain hed heard the fading echoes of a babys restless crying hed run he couldnt have opened that door if hed had a gun to his head so hed run with his own bright fear chasing him to lock himself back in the bedroom like a mental patient he thought now over a lukewarm cup of instant coffee at least thered been no one around to see it but if you thought about it it was a rather auspicious first night cold spots baby ghosts fugues it sure beat sitting in his empty town house in boston sucking on a beer and watching espn maybe he would spend some time digging deeper into the history of the house his house he corrected and with his coffee he leaned on the damp iron rail of the gallery outside his bedroom his view and it was a beaut once you skimmed over the wreck of the gardens leaves dripped from the rain in steady musical plops and the air shimmered with the weight the storm had left behind mists crawled over the ground smoky fingers that trailed and curled around the trees to turn them into romantic and mysterious silhouettes if the sun broke through the glittery light would be spectacular but it was nothing to sneeze at now there was a pond a small one choked with lily pads and fields some fallow some already planted for a spring that came so much sooner here he could see the thin curve of the river that ribboned its way through the deep shadows of the bayou a rickety little bridge crossed the water in a hump then a dirt road pushed into the trees toward a house mostly hidden by them he could just make out a puff of smoke that rose up to mix with the hazy air hed already been up on the belvedere that morning and had been relieved to find it the roof the chimneys all in good repair the last owners had seen to that and this secondfloor gallery before theyd thrown in the towel it looked as if theyd started on the rear gallery as well had started preliminary work on closing it into a screened porch which might not be a bad idea hed think about it declan wasnt certain if theyd run out of money or energy or both but he considered it his good fortune he had plenty of money and just now watching the steam rising over the weeds and water plenty of energy he lifted the cup to his lips then lowered it again as he saw a woman a girl slip through the trees toward the curve of the river a huge black dog lumbered along beside her she was too far away from him to make out features he saw she wore a red checked shirt and jeans that her hair was long and dark and madly curling was she old he wondered young pretty or plain he decided on young and pretty it was after all his option she tossed a ball in the air fielded it smartly when the dog gave a leap she tossed it twice more while the dog jumped and ran in circles then she reared back like a pitcher in the stretch and bulleted it through the air the dog gave chase and didnt hesitate but leaped toward the pond shagging the ball with a snap of teeth an instant before he hit the water hell of a trick declan thought and grinning watched the girl applaud he wished he could hear her he was sure she was laughing a low throaty laugh when the dog swam to the edge scrambled out he spit the ball at her feet then shook himself it had to have drenched her but she didnt dance away or brush fussily at her jeans they repeated the routine with declan a captive audience he imagined her walking with the dog closer to the hall close enough that he could wave from the gallery invite her in for a cup of bad coffee his first shot at southern hospitality or better yet he could wander down and shed be wrestling with the dog shed slip on the wet grass tumble into the pond hed be right at hand to pull her out no to dive in after her and save her because she couldnt swim then one thing would lead to another and theyd have sex on that damp grass in the watery sunlight her body wet and sleek would rise over his hed fill his hands with her breasts and jeez he blinked saw her disappearing into the trees again he wasnt sure if he was embarrassed or relieved to find himself hard hed had sex only once in the six months since hed broken things off with jessica and that had been more a reflex than real desire so if he could find himself fully aroused over some ridiculous fantasy of a woman whose face he hadnt seen that area was coming back to normal he could check worry over his manhood off his list of concerns he tossed the last swallows of cold coffee away he didnt mind starting the day with a stray erotic fantasy but he did mind starting it with bad coffee it was time to get down to practicalities he went back in grabbed his wallet and keys and headed into town for supplies it took him most of the day not just to get the supplies but to reacquaint himself with the city he was going to call his own if boston was a respectable wife with a few seamy secrets new orleans was a sensual mistress who celebrated her darker sides he treated himself to an enormous breakfast so loaded with cholesterol he imagined his heart simply keeling over from the shock he bought coffee beans and a grinder bagels and beignets he loaded up on the singlemale cuisine of packaged dinners frozen pizza dry cereal hit the liquor store for beer bourbon and some good wine he loaded it into his car then struck out again as much for the joy of wandering the streets as the recollection he needed something to eat on and with he settled for paper plates and plastic ware and stopped to watch a street musician set out his trumpet case prime it with a few coins then fill the air with a stream of magic declan gave him his first dollar of the day he avoided the temptation of the antique shops and the lure of the quarter lunchtime music was already pumping out of clubs and exotic scents wafted from restaurants he bought himself a muffuletta that marvel of meat and cheese and oil on italian bread to take back home for later as he walked to his car again he noted the tourists with their bags from café du monde or the riverwalk shops the card readers sitting at folding tables around the perimeter of jackson square who would tell your fortune for ten dollars a pop he caught the faint drift of marijuana under the ripening stench of garbage as he walked by an alleyway and saw an enormous black woman smoking in indolent puffs on the plant jammed gallery above a shop that advertised erotic candles he bought one for remy of a naked woman with breasts like torpedoes and grinned over it all the way back to his car he drove home energized he hauled in supplies stuffed them wherever seemed logical at the time then began a serious roombyroom inspection of the main level he made notes on problems on potentials on plans and on priorities the kitchen was a definite first he had experience there from his own house in boston and from two remodels where hed assisted friends he couldnt claim to cook more than the occasional omelette or toasted sandwich but he thought of the kitchen as the heart of any home the latest transition of the manet hall kitchen was early eighties stark white and chrome with a slablike island work counter and blinding white flooring the good points were the generous windows the old and serviceable brick hearth and the pretty coffered ceiling he liked the enormous pantry but thought it would serve better as a mudroom hed hack down to the original wood flooring strip off the overly sweet teapotthemed wallpaper yank out the island in favor of an antique bakers table or some such thing decorating wasnt his strong point hed left that to jessica whod favored pale colors and classic lines and now that he thought about it he preferred stronger colors and the charm of the fanciful he liked details and fuss it was his house damn it and hed do it his way top to bottom hed put in some old glassfronted cabinets where he could display antique kitchen appliances cracked mismatched dishes bottles and mason jars cluttered good solid surface countertops copper faucets he didnt care if they tarnished theyd just look more real bigass refrigerator state of the art dishwasher and range all fronted with distressed wood now were cooking he took reams of notes measured remeasured he dragged out his research books and pored over them on the floor of the empty library while he ate half his sandwich and drank enough coffee to make his ears ring he could see it so perfectly the floor toceiling shelves jammed with books the deep green walls and the soft cream of the plaster ceiling and trim thick silver candlesticks on the mantel hed have to have all the chimneys checked professionally so he could start building fires knock the chill out of the air the trim would be restored where it needed it sanded smooth as satin the pocket doors here and the massive ones separating the gentlemens and ladies parlors were in excellent shape someone along the way had refinished the library flooring he crawled around running his hands over the wood sand it down lightly slap on a couple coats of clear varnish and theyd be set the area rugs had protected it well the good thick aubussons josephine had ordered from paris he smelled brandy leather beeswax and roses but thought nothing of it his eyes were cloudy and distant when he stopped at the tiled hearth flicked his thumb over the chip at the corner that section would have to be replaced or if it couldnt be matched rounded off theyd been hand painted and glazed in italy at considerable expense julian had knocked the candlestick off the mantel and it had chipped the tile drunk again raging again the cell phone in his pocket rang and had declan sitting back on his heels blinking displaced he gazed around the empty room what had he been doing thinking he glanced down at his thumb and saw hed rubbed it raw on the jagged tile disoriented he dragged out his phone yeah hello there he is i was about to give you up remys cheerful voice jangled in his head as declan stared at the tile hed been thinking about the tile something im ah doing a room by room measuring stuff how about you get yourself out of there for a while i got me a late meeting thought you could meet me for a drink after effie too if i can drag her out what time is it declan turned his wrist to check his watch midnight its midnight not yet its not you been drinking already just coffee he frowned at his watch tapped the face battery m ve gone its just after six i should be able to wiggle loose by nine why dont you come on in ill meet you at et trois in the quarter on dauphine about a block off bourbon yeah absently he shoved at his hair found his forehead was lightly beaded with sweat yeah that sounds fine you need directions yankee boy ill find it he rubbed his throbbing thumb remy thats my name declan shook his head laughed at himself nothing see you later he drove in early he wasnt particularly interested in drinking but wanted to see the metamorphosis of new orleans from day to night the streets gleamed under the carnival of lights teemed with the crowds who streamed along looking for entertainment it was neither the tourists nor the merchants who ran the show in declans opinion it was the city itself and its wheels turned on music it pumped from doorways cool jazz hot rock melting blues overhead restaurant galleries were thick with diners who warded off the january chill with spicy sauce and alcohol the strip club hawkers promised all manner of visual delights and in the shops cash registers rang as tourists gorged on t shirts and mardi gras masks the bars served hurricanes to the yankees and beer and liquor to those who knew better but it was the music that kept the parade marching he soaked it in as he strolled down bourbon past doorways bright lights and sudden unexpected courtyards he skirted around a group of women who clutched together on the sidewalk chattering like magpies he caught the scent of them flowers and candy and felt the typical male reaction of pleasure and panic when they burst into giggles nice ass one of them commented and declan kept on walking women in packs were dangerous and mysterious entities it occurred to him that if he were going to meet effie he should take her a token some sort of engagement gift he didnt know what she liked or what she was like come to that but if there was one thing he was good at it was buying gifts wishing hed thought of it earlier he poked through a couple of shops without much hope nearly everything in this section was geared for the tourist trade and he didnt think a windup plastic penis was quite the thing for a first introduction a gift could wait he reflected or he could just fall back on the basket of girl lotions and potions then he saw it the silver frog squatted on all fours as if it was about to take a good springy hop it had a cheerfully wicked face and a big smartass grin and reminded declan instantly of remy if this effie had fallen for his old college pal she had to appreciate whimsy he had it wrapped in fancy paper with a big red bow it was still shy of nine when he turned onto dauphine he was ready to sit in a bar away from the center ring of the circus maybe listen to some music and work on a beer for the next several weeks he was going to have to tow the line spend his days tearing into the kitchen his evenings planning his next point of attack he had to track down specific craftsmen get bids get started for tonight hed spend some time with friends then go home and get a solid eight hours sleep he spotted the sign for et trois it was hard to miss as it danced cheerfully in cool blue over the scarred wooden door of a building barely two good strides from the street the second floor boasted the typical gallery and lacy iron baluster someone had decked it out with fat clay pots of hot pink geraniums and strung little white fairy lights along the eaves it made a pretty feminine picture the kind of spot where you might sit drink a glass of wine and contemplate the people strolling by below he opened the door to a blast of jumpy zydeco the scent of garlic and whiskey on the small stage was a fivepiece band washboard fiddle drums guitar accordion the little dance floor was already packed with people executing the quick fancy twostep the music cried for through the dim light he could see that none of the round wooden tables scooted to the side were free he turned toward the bar the wood was nearly black with age but it gleamed a dozen backless stools were jammed together declan copped the single one left before someone beat him to it bottles lined the mirror behind the bar and interspersed with them were salt and pepper shakers in a variety of themes an elegant couple in evening dress dogs rocky and bullwinkle porky and petunia the round naked breasts of a reclining woman carnival masks and winged fairies he contemplated them considered the sort of person who would collect and display fairies and body parts and decided it was someone who understood new orleans onstage the fiddle player began to sing in cajun she had a voice like a rusty saw that was inexplicably appealing tapping his foot declan glanced down to the end of the bar the man tending had dreadlocks down to his waist a face that might have been carved by a very skilled hand out of a polished coffee bean and hands that moved with balletic grace as he worked taps and poured shots he started to lift his hand to get the bartenders attention and then she walked out of the door behind the bar later when he could think clearly he would decide it had been like having a sledgehammer plowed into his chest not stopping his heart but jumpstarting it his heart his blood his loins his brain everything went from holding pattern to quick march in an instant there you are something in his mind shouted finally he could hear the race of his body like a hard hum that drowned out the music the voices his vision focused in on her so completely it was as if she were spotlighted on a black stage she wasnt beautiful not in any classic sense what she was was spectacular her hair was midnight black a gypsy mane that spilled wild curls over her shoulders her face was foxsharp the narrow somewhat aristocratic nose the high planed cheeks the tapered chin her eyes were long and heavylidded her mouth wide full and painted bloodlust red it didnt quite go together he thought as his brain jumbled the elements in the face shouldnt work as a whole but they were perfect striking sexy superb she was small almost delicately built and wore a tight scoopedneck shirt the color of poppies that showed off the lean muscles of her arms the firm curve of her breasts tucked into the valley of those breasts was a silver chain with a tiny silver key her skin was dusky her eyes when they flicked to his the deep rich brown of bitter chocolate those red lips curved a slow knowing smile as she strolled over leaned on the bar so their faces were close enough for him to see the tiny beauty mark just above the right curve of her top lip close enough for him to catch the scent of nightblooming jasmine and start to drown in it can i do something for you cher oh yeah he thought please but all that came out was um she gave her head a little toss then angled it as she sized him up she spoke again in that easy cajun rhythm you thirsty or just hungry tonight ah he wanted to lap his tongue over those red lips that tiny mole and slurp her right up corona he watched her as she got the bottle snagged a lime she had a walk like a dancer somewhere between ballet and exotic he could literally feel his tongue tangling into knots you want to run a tab handsome ah god fitzgerald pull yourself together yeah thanks whats it unlock when she lifted her eyebrows he picked up the bottle your key this she reached down trailed a finger over the little key and sent his blood pressure through the roof why my heart cher whatd you think he reached out a hand for hers if he didnt touch her he was afraid he might break down and sob im declan is that right she left her hand in his nice name not usual its irish uhhuh she turned his hand over leaned down as if reading the palm what do i see here you havent been in new orleans long but you hope to be got yourself out of the cold cold north did you declan yeah guess thats not hard to figure she looked up again and this time his heart did stop i can figure more rich yankee lawyer down from boston you bought manet hall do i know you he felt something like a link forged onto a chain when his hand gripped hers have we met before not in this life darling she gave his hand a little pat then moved down the bar filling more orders but she kept an eye on him he wasnt what shed expected from remys description though she was damned if she knew what shed expected still she was a woman who liked surprises the man sitting at her bar watching her out of stormgray eyes looked to be full of them she liked his eyes she was used to men looking at her with desire but thered been more in his a kind of breathless shock that was both flattering and sweet and it was appealing to have a man who looked like he could handle anything you tossed at him fumble when you smiled at him though hed barely touched his beer she worked her way back to him tapped a finger to the bottle ready for another no thanks can you take a break can i buy you a drink

to the bar with a tray wait wait he reached for her hand again i dont know your name whats your name angelina she said softly but they call me lena cause i aint no angel cher she trailed a finger down his cheek then stepped away to fill orders declan took a deep long swallow of beer to wash back the saliva that had pooled in his mouth he was trying to work out another approach when remy slapped him on the back were going to need us a table son views better from here remy followed the direction of declans gaze one of the best the city offers you meet my cousin lena cousin fourth cousins im thinking might be fifth angelina simone one of new orleanss jewels and heres another effie renault effie darling this is my good friend declan fitzgerald hello declan she wiggled between him and remy and kissed declans cheek im so happy to meet you she had a cloud of blond hair around a pretty heartshaped face and eyes of clear summer blue her lips had a deep kewpie doll curve and were a rosy pink she looked like she should be leading cheers at the local high school youre too pretty to waste yourself on this guy declan told her why dont you run away with me instead when do we leave with a chuckle declan slid off the stool and returned her kiss nice job remy best work i ever did remy pressed his lips to effies hair sit on down there darling place is packed bar might be the best we do

look at you your friends got himself a smooth way once he gets rolling remy lena took a bottle of wine from the cooler those harvard girls were putty in his hands we southern girls are too used to the heat to melt easy she poured wine topped the beers with lime wedges i do know you it bounced back in his memory i saw you this morning playing with your dog big black dog near the pond rufus it gave her a little jolt to realize hed watched her hes my grandmamas dog thats her house back the bayou i go out sometimes and stay with her if shes feeling poorly or just lonely come by the hall next time youre out ill give you the tour just might ive never been inside she set a fresh bowl of pretzels on the bar yall want something from the kitchen well think about that remy said just let us know she swung around and through the back door you gonna want to mop that drool off your chin dec remy squeezed declans shoulder its embarrassing dont tease him remy a man doesnt get a little worked up around lena hes got some essential parts missing you definitely should run away with me declan decided but meanwhile best wishes he nudged the gift bag in front of her you bought me a present arent you the sweetest thing she tore into it with an enthusiasm that made declan grin and when she held up the frog she stopped stared then threw back her head and let out a hooting laugh it looks like remy look here honey hes got your smile i dont see it i do dec did she swiveled on the stool and beamed up into declans face i like you im so glad i like you i love this moron here so much i can hardly stand it so idve pretended i liked you even if i didnt but i dont have to pretend oh now dont start watering up effie remy dug out a handkerchief as she sniffled she does that when shes happy night i asked her to marry me she cried so much it took her ten minutes to say yes he pulled her off the stool come on chère you dance with me till you dry up again declan got back on the stool picked up his beer and watched them circle the floor they look good together lena commented from behind him yeah yeah they do interested in seeing how we look together you are persistent she let out a breath what kind of car you going to buy me car you offered to buy me a drink coffee a car or a dog i can buy my own drinks and i like my own coffee i got a dog more or less a car too but i dont see why i shouldnt have two cars what car are you buying me your choice ill let you know she replied then moved down the bar once more he worked solidly for three days there was little in declans opinion more satisfying than tearing something apart even putting it back together again didnt reach into the gut with that same primal zing he gutted the kitchen ripping out the center island the counters and cabinets he steamed off wallpaper and yanked up linoleum he was left with a shell of plaster and wood and endless possibilities in the evenings he nursed his blisters and strained muscles and pored through design books every morning before he started the day he took his first cup of coffee out on the gallery and hoped for a glimpse of lena and the big black dog shed called rufus he contacted workmen and craftsmen ordered materials and in a frenzy of enthusiasm bought a fullsized pickup truck straight off the lot the first night he was able to build a fire in the downriver parlor he toasted the occasion and himself with a solitary glass of merlot thered been no more sleepwalking but there had been dreams he could remember only snatches of them upon waking music often the tune had seemed to be lodged in his brain like a tumor or raised voices once hed dreamed of sex of soft sighs in the dark of the lazy glide of flesh over flesh and the need rising up like a warm wave hed woken with his muscles quivering and the scent of lilies just fading from his senses since dreaming about sex seemed to be the best he could manage he put his energies into the work when he did take a break it was to pay a call and he went armed with a bouquet of white daisies and a rawhide bone the bayou house was a singlestory cypress shotgun style tobaccocolored water snaked around it on three sides a small white boat swayed gently at a sagging dock trees hemmed it in where the water didnt the cypress and live oak and pecan from the limbs hung clear bottles halffilled with water and nestled into the gnarled roots of a live oak stood a painted statue of the blessed virgin there were purple pansies at her feet a little porch faced the dirt drive and there were more potted flowers on it along with a rocking chair the shutters were painted a mossy green the screen door was patched in two places and through the checkerboard net came the strong bluesy voice of ethel waters he heard the deep warning barks of the dog still declan wasnt prepared for the size and speed as rufus burst out the door and charged oh jesus was all he managed he had an instant to wonder if he should dive through the window of the pickup or freeze when the black mass the size of a pony skidded to a halt at his feet rufus punctuated those earsplitting barks with rumbling growls liquid snarls and a very impressive show of teeth since he doubted he could beat the dog off with a bunch of daisies declan opted for the friendly approach hey really really big rufus hows it going rufus sniffed at his boots up his leg and dead into the crotch oh man lets not get that personal right off thinking of those teeth declan decided hed rather risk his hand than his dick and reached out slowly to give the massive head a little shove and pat rufus looked up with a pair of sparkling brown eyes and in one fast fluid move reared up on his hind legs and planted his enormous paws on declans shoulders he swiped a tongue about the size of the mississippi over declans face braced against the side of the truck declan hoped the long sloppy licks were a greeting and not some sort of tenderizing nice to meet you too get on down now rufus at the mild order from the front doorway the dog dropped down sat thumped his tail the woman standing on the porch was younger than declan had expected she couldnt have been far into her sixties she had the same small build as her granddaughter the same sharp planes to her face her hair was black liberally streaked with white and worn in a mass of curls she wore a cotton dress that hit her midcalf with a baggy red sweater over it stout brown boots covered her feet with thick red socks drooping over them he heard the jangle of her bracelets as she fisted her hands on her narrow hips he liked the smell of you and the sound of you so he gave you a welcome kiss if he didnt like me she smiled a quick flash that deepened the lines time had etched on her face what you think i think im glad i smell friendly im declan fitzgerald mrs simone i bought manet hall i know who you are come on inside and sit for a spell she stepped back opened the rickety screen door with the dog plodding along beside him declan walked to the porch its nice to meet you mrs simone she studied him a frank and cagey stare out of dark eyes you sure are a pretty one arent you thanks he held out the flowers you too she took the flowers pursed her lips you come courting me declan fitzgerald can you cook she laughed a thick foggy sound and he fell a little in love i got some fresh corn bread so you can see for yourself she led the way in down the wirestraight center hall he caught glimpses of the parlor of bedrooms one with an iron crucifix over a simple iron bed a sewing room that all managed to be cozily cluttered and pinneat he smelled furniture polish and lavender then a few steps from the kitchen caught the country scent of baking maam im thirtyone financially solvent and i got a clean bill of health my last physical i dont smoke i usually drink in moderation and im reasonably neat if you marry me ill treat you like a queen she chuckled and shook her head then waved to the kitchen table sit yourself down there and stretch those long legs under the table so they dont trip me up and since youre sparking me you can call me miss odette she uncovered a dish on the counter got plates out of a cupboard while she cut squares of corn bread declan looked out her kitchen door the bayou spread a dream of dark water and cypress knees with the shadowy reflection of trees shimmering on the surface he saw a bird with bright red wings spear through the air and vanish wow how do you get anything done when you could just sit here and look all day its a good spot she took a pitcher of dark tea from an old refrigerator that was barely taller than she was my familys been here moren a hundredfifty years my grandpapa he had him a good still out back that stand of oaks revenuers never did find it she set the glass the plate in front of him manger eat what your grandpapa do he was a lawyer actually both of them were dead now are they retired you too huh she got out a fat pale blue bottle as he took the first bite of corn bread sort of from the law anyway this is wonderful miss odette i got a hand with baking i like daisies she added as she put them in the bottle shed filled with water they got a cheerful face you gonna give rufus that bone you brought along or make him beg for it as rufus was currently sitting at his feet with one weighty paw on his thigh declan decided hed begged enough he pulled the bone out of its bag the dog took it with a surprisingly delicate bite wagged his tail from side to side twice like a whip then plopped down and began to gnaw odette put the flowers in the center of the table then sat in the chair next to declans whatre you going to do with that big old place declan fitzgerald all kinds of things put it back the way it used to be as much as i can then what i dont know live there she broke off a corner of her corn bread shed already decided she liked the look of him the untidy hair the stonegray eyes in a lean face and the sound of him yankee but not prim and his manners were polished but natural and friendly now she wanted to see what he was made of why i dont know that either except ive wanted to since the first time i saw it and hows the hall feel about you i dont think its made up its mind have you ever been inside hmm she nodded been some time ago lotta house for one young man you got you a girl back up there in boston no maam handsome boy like you past thirty not gay are you no maam he grinned as he lifted his glass of tea i like girls just havent found the right fit yet let me see your hands she took one in hers turned it over still got city on them but youre taking care of that right quick her thumb passed over healing blisters scrapes the ridge of forming callus i got some balm ill give you before you go keep these blisters from troubling you you got a strong hand declan strong enough that you changed your fate took yourself a new road you didnt love her im sorry this woman odette smoothed her fingernail over the side of his palm the one you stepped back from she wasnt for you frowning he leaned closer stared down at his own hand you see jessica on there fascinating does she end up with james what do you care she didnt love you either well ouch he said and laughed a little youve got love coming the kind thatll knock you flat on your behind itll be good for you though she continued to stroke her thumb over his palm her gaze lifted to his face her eyes seemed to deepen it seemed he could see worlds in them youve got strong ties to manet hall strong old ties life and death blood and tears joy if youre strong enough smart enough youre a clever man declan be clever enough to look front and back to find yourself youre not alone in that house his throat went dry but he didnt reach for his tea he didnt move a muscle its haunted whats theres kept others from settling in theyd say it was the money the time or some such but whats in that house frightened them away its been waiting for you the chill shot up his spine in a single icy arrow why thats for you to find out she gave his hand a squeeze then released it picked up her tea he curled his fingers into his tingling palm so youre like a psychic amused she rose to bring the pitcher of tea to the table i see what i see from time to time a little kitchen magic she said as she refilled the glasses it doesnt make me a witch just a woman she noted his glance at the silver cross she wore tangled with colored beads around her neck you think thats a contradiction where do you think power comes from cher i guess i never thought about it we dont use what the good lord gave us whatever talent that might be were wasting his gift she angled her head and he saw she wore earrings as well fat blue stones dangling from tiny lobes i hear you called jack tripadoe about maybe doing some plumbing work in that place of yours ah he struggled to shift his brain from the fantastic to the practical while his palm continued to vibrate from the skim of her fingers yes my friend remy payne recommended him that remy her face lit and any mystery that had been in it vanished hes a caution jack hes a cousin of my sisters husbands brothers wife hell do good work for you and if he doesnt give you a fair price you tell him miss odettes gonna want to know why i appreciate that you wouldnt happen to know a plasterer somebody who can handle fancy work ill get you a name itll cost you a pretty bag of pennies to put that place back to what it was and keep it that way ive got a lot of pennies i hope youll come by sometime so i can show you around i cant make corn bread but i can manage the tea you got a nice manner cher your mama she raised you right would you mind writing that down signing it i can mail it to her im going to like having you around she declared you come back to visit anytime thank you miss odette reading his cue he got to his feet im going to like having you around too the sun beamed across her face as she looked up at him the angle of it the amusement in her dark eyes the teasing curve of lips shot him back to the dim bar in the quarter she looks so much like you she does you got your eye on my lena already he was a little flustered to realize hed spoken out loud so he tried a grin well we established i like girls right she gave the table a little slap to punctuate the laugh as she rose i like you just fine declan he liked her too enough that he decided to buy a couple of chairs after all so shed have somewhere to sit when she came by hed find something on saturday he thought as he went back to prepping the kitchen walls he could hunt some down in the afternoon before he was due to have dinner with remy and effie then hed cap off the evening with a drink at et trois and if lena wasnt working that night hed just walk back out and throw himself in front of a speeding car he worked until well after dark then treated himself to a beer along with his hungryman chicken dinner he ate sitting on a sawhorse and admiring the progress of the kitchen the walls were stripped repaired and prepped for paint his pencil marks on them indicated the measurements of the cabinets he would start to build the next day hed even tried his hand at pointing up the bricks in the hearth and didnt think hed done a halfbad job of it the old pine flooring was exposed and protected now with drop cloths hed finally settled on the traffic pattern and had earmarked the spots for the range and the refrigerator if he couldnt find the right china cabinet for the long wall hed damn well build that too he was on a roll he carried a bottle of water upstairs took his nowtraditional nineminute shower then stretched out on the bed with his notes drawings and books halfway through adjusting his plans for the front parlor he conked out and woke shivering with cold in full dark the baby had wakened him the thin cries were still in his ears as he sat straight up with his heart banging like a hammer against his ribs he didnt know where he was only that he was on the floor instead of in bed and it was cold enough that he could see the white mist of his own breath pluming into the inky dark he rolled over gained his feet reaching out like a blind man he felt at the air as he took a cautious step forward lilies his body shuddered as he registered the scent he knew where he was now in the room down the hall from his own the room like the one on the third floor hed so carefully avoided over the last several days he was in it now he thought as he took another shuffling step and though it was insane he knew he wasnt alone you can scare me but you wont scare me away his fingers brushed something solid he yelped snatched them back an instant before he realized it was a wall taking several steadying breaths he felt his way along it bumped over trim tapped over glass fumbling he found the knob for the gallery doors and flung them open the january air felt warm and heavy against his chilled skin he stumbled forward gripped the rail the night was like the inside of a cave the old adage was true he decided there was no dark like country dark when his eyes adjusted to it he turned back pulled the door to the room firmly closed this is my house now he said it quietly then walked down the gallery opened the door of his bedroom and went back inside sleepwalking remy scooped up another forkful of rice yeah i went through it for about six months when i was around eleven declan shrugged but couldnt quite dismiss the weight of it he hadnt meant to bring it up at least no more than in passing the dinner effie had fixed in remys garden district apartment was welcome as was the company but somehow hed gone from telling them about the progress of the rehab to his nighttime adventures it must be terrifying effie said to wake up and find yourself somewhere else spooky anyway its funny id end up at the two rooms that make me the most uneasy or i guess its logical some subconscious deal as long as you stay inside the house remy put in i dont want to hear youve sleepwalked your way into the swamp thats a nice thought thanks remy effie slapped his hand i think you should see a doctor she told declan you could take something to help you sleep better maybe been there a week and its only happened twice anyway taking a couple of tranqs isnt going to do anything about the ghost its just drafts and old wood settling remy grinned effie doesnt believe in ghosts or in tarot cards or reading tea leaves or any such nonsense her voice was prim and just a little defensive my girl shes very grounded in the here and the now your girl just has good sense she shot back dec it just stands to reason youd have some strange feelings staying way out there in that big old house all alone and i bet youre not eating right either you ought to live here with remy for a while until you get used to things she wont remy jerked his head in effies direction ill live with you when were married and not before oh but chère mays so far away i miss you when youre not here he took her hand kissing it lavishly as he spoke tell you what effie you come out and stay with me for a few nights strictly platonic he said with a grin as remy narrowed his eyes i bet you shift your stand on ghosts after one or two nights sorry im a city girl what do you do out there all by yourself declan when youre not working read and speaking of that i need to come by the library see if you can help me dig up more about manet hall ive been taking a few whacks at the garden too take walks drove over to visit miss odette you met miss odette remy asked as he polished off his dinner something isnt she i really liked her truth is the house is keeping me so busy i usually drop off by ten at night i finally got a tv hooked up and i never think to turn it on but i did buy a table and chairs this afternoon and some other things it was always a mistake he chided himself to let him through the door of an antique shop were not going to have you locking yourself out there and working yourself to the bone effie decided i expect you to come into town and see us at least once a week from now on and remy you should start going out there on saturdays and giving dec a hand spending too much time alone she declared as she pushed back from the table thats whats wrong with you now yall ready for pie maybe she was right declan thought as he hunted up a place to park if she wasnt right effie was certainly definite hed try mixing it up a little more he could drive into town once or twice a week for a real meal maybe have remy and effie out for one a very informal one he could spend an evening reading something other than research more he thought he was going to gear himself up soon and push himself through the mental block hed erected about the thirdfloor room he had to park a block and a half from et trois but when he stepped in saw lena at the bar he thought the walk had been worth it he couldnt even snag a stool tonight but he did manage to squeeze between customers and claim a corner of the bar the music was loud and lively and so was the crowd there was a blond behind the bar tonight in addition to its owner and dreadlock guy each of them was hopping lena flicked him a glance as she served two drafts and a gin fizz corona better make it a coke she looked just as good as he remembered just exactly as good she wore blue tonight a shirt that was unbuttoned low and rolled to the elbows her lips were still red but shed scooped her hair back on the sides with silver combs he could see the glint of hoops at her ears she set a tall glass in front of him where yat ah i think im right here no she gave him that quick smoky laugh dont you speak new orleans cher when i say where yat im asking how youre doing oh fine thanks where you at there you go me im fine too busy let me know if you want anything else he had to content himself with watching her she worked her third of the bar filling orders having a quick word slipping into the kitchen and out again without ever seeming to rush he never considered going home when a stool freed up he climbed on settled in it was like being studied by a big handsome cat lena thought steady and patient and just a little dangerous he nursed his coke took a refill and was still sitting when the place began to thin out she swung by again you waiting for something handsome yeah he kept his eyes on hers im waiting she wiped up a spill with her bar rag i heard you went by to see my grandmama a couple of days ago you look like her they say lena tucked the end of the rag in her back pocket you go over there so you could lay on your yankee charm and shed put in a good word for you with me i was hoping thatd be a side benefit but no i went over because shes a neighbor i expected she was an old neighbor elderly woman living alone and thought shed like to know someone was around who could give her a hand with things then i met her and realized she doesnt need me to give her a hand with anything thats nice lena let out a breath that was nice fact is she could do with a strong back now and again dupris honey she called out with her gaze locked on declans you close up for me okay im going on home she pulled a small purse from behind the bar slung its long strap over her shoulder can i walk you home lena yeah you can do that she came out from behind the bar smiled when he opened the door for her so i hear youre working hard on that house of yours night and day he agreed i started on the kitchen ive made serious progress havent seen you near the pond in the mornings not lately the truth was shed stayed away deliberately shed been curious to see if hed come back she strolled down the sidewalk i met rufus he likes me so does my grandmama what about you oh they like me fine she turned toward the opening of a tall iron gate when he laughed they moved into a tiny paved courtyard with a single iron table and two chairs lena he took her hand this is where i live she gestured back toward the steps leading to the secondfloor gallery hed admired the first night oh well so much for seducing you with my wit and charm on the long walk home why dont we was no she tapped a finger on his chest youre not coming up not tonight but i think well get this out of the way and see whats what she rose on her toes swayed in her hand slipped around to the back of his neck as she brought his mouth down to hers he felt himself sink as if hed been walking on solid ground that had suddenly turned to water it was a long steep drop that had a thousand impressions rushing by his senses the silky slide of her lips and tongue the warm brush of her skin the drugging scent of her perfume by the time hed begun to separate them she eased back youre good at that she murmured and laid a fingertip on his lips i had a feeling night cher wait a minute he wasnt so shell shocked he couldnt function he grabbed her hand that was practice he told her and spun her stylishly into his arms he felt the amused curve of her lips against his and running his hands up her back into her hair let himself drown whoops that single thought bounced into her head as she felt herself slip his mouth was patient but she felt the quick flashes of hunger his hands were gentle but held her firmly against him the taste of him like something half remembered began to seep into her blood someone opened the door of the bar music jumped out then shut off again a car gunned by on the street behind her another blast of music through the open windows heat shimmered over her skin under it so that the hands she rested on his shoulders trailed around linked behind his neck very good at it she repeated and turned her head so her cheek rubbed his once then twice but youre not coming up tonight i have to think about you okay ill keep coming back they always come back for lena for a while she thought as she eased away go on home now declan ill just wait until you get inside her brows lifted arent you the one because it was sweet she kissed his cheek before she walked to the steps and headed up when she unlocked her door and glanced back he was still there you have sweet dreams now cher thatd be a nice change he muttered when she closed the door behind her manet hall january it was lies it had to be lies of the cruelest coldest nature he would not believe never believe that his sweet abby had run away from him had left him left their child lucian sat on the corner of the bed trapped in the daze that had gripped him since hed returned home two days before returned home to find the hall in an uproar and his wife missing another man thats what they were saying an old love shed met in secret whenever lucian had gone into new orleans on business lies he had been the only man he had taken an angel to wife a virgin to their wedding bed something had happened to her he opened and closed his hand over the watch pin hed given her when hed asked her to marry him something terrible but what what could have pushed her to leave the house in the night a sick relation he thought as he rose to pace and pace and pace but he knew that wasnt the case hadnt he ridden like a wild man into the marsh to ask to demand to beg her family her friends if they knew what had become of her even now people were searching for her on the road in the swamp in the fields but the rumors the gossip were already rushing along the river lucian manets young wife had run off with another man and he could hear the whispers behind the whispers what did he expect cajun trash likely that girlchild got started in the bayou and she passed it off as his horrible vicious lies the door opened josephine hadnt bothered with even a cursory knock manet hall was hers now and always she entered any room at her whim lucian he spun around theyve found her hed yet to change the clothes soiled from his last search and hope shone through the dirt on his face they have not she closed the door at her back with a testy snap nor will they she is gone and is probably at this moment laughing at you with her lover she could almost believe it soon she thought it would be the truth she did not run away youre a fool you were a fool to marry her and you remain a fool she strode to the armoire threw it open cant you see some of her clothes are missing hasnt her maid reported as much all he could see was the blue ball gown with the flounces and rosettes shed been so proud of the maid is mistaken but his voice shook youre mistaken what of her jewelry josephine pulled the leather box from the shelf tossed the lid up where are the pearls you gave her for christmas the diamond bracelet you bought her when she had the child someone stole them on a sound of disgust josephine upended the jewelry on the bed she took whatever sparkled the most a girl of her type knows nothing but glitter she bewitched you caused you to embarrass your family your name now she has disgraced us all no he squeezed his eyes shut as his heart ripped to pieces she wouldnt leave me she would never leave marie rose however much affection she might have had for the child i doubt either she or her lover wanted to be saddled with a baby how do you know lucian that the child is yours the red rage of fury stained his cheeks how can you ask such a question how could you have lived in the same house with her for a year and say such a thing about her the doubt josephine thought coldly had been planted she would help it bloom because i did live in the same house with her but i wasnt blinded by lust or bewitched by whatever spell she put on you this is your fault as much as hers if you had satisfied your appetites as other men paid her given her a few trinkets we would not have this new scandal on our hands paid her like a whore like julian pays his women lucian stepped forward so angry his hands trembled my wife is not a whore she used you josephine said in a vicious whisper she took your dignity and smeared ours she came into this house a servant and left it with the spoils of her deception like a thief in the night with her child crying behind her she gripped his arms and shook you tried to change what cannot be changed you expected too much of her she could never have been mistress of manet hall i am at least she had the sense to know it now shes gone we will hold our heads up until the gossip dies down we are manets and we will survive this she turned away walked to the door i expect you to make yourself presentable and join the family for dinner our lives have been disrupted long enough alone lucian sat on the bed and with the watch pin in his hand fell to weeping i gotta hand it to you boy with his hands on his hips remy turned a circle in the kitchen you made a hell of a mess here come back in a couple weeks declan called out from the adjacent dining room where hed set up what he thought of as his carpentry shop effie lifted a corner of the drop cloth the floors going to be beautiful its a blank canvas she said as she looked around the gutted kitchen he had to wipe it clean so he could paint the right picture effie ditch that moron and come live here with me you stop trying to make time with my girl remy walked to the doorway declan stood at a power saw a tool belt slung at his hips and a carpenters pencil behind his ear it looked to remy as if his friend hadnt used a razor in a good three days and damned if the scruffy handyman look didnt suit him you got something you want me to do around here or should we just stand around admiring how manly you look i could sure use one or two laborers he ran the saw through wood with a satisfying buzz and a shower of sawdust switched it off before he glanced over you really up for it sure remy slung an arm around effies shoulder well work for beer four hours later they sat on the gallery outside the freshly painted kitchen effie dwarfed in the old denim shirt declan had given her for a smock had freckles of paint on her nose the beer was cold and crisp and on declans countertop stereo foghat was taking a slow ride as he worked his latest splinter out of his thumb declan decided it didnt get much better whats that bush blooming out there he gestured toward the wreck of gardens camellia effie told him these gardens are a sin dec i know ive got to get to them you cant get to everything you ought to get someone out here to clean it up big frank and little frankie remy took a long swallow of beer theyd do the job for you do good work family business he always

thinking all kinds of interesting things you got a girl dont mean my brain stopped working dont you worry though effies all i want he let out a long sigh of a contented man besides lena and me we did our round some time back what do you mean declan set his beer back down and stared at his friend you and lena you and lena remy winked one hot sweaty summer m ve been close to fifteen years ago ouch he leaned up to rub his heart that hurts i was about yeah i was seventeen just graduated high school thatd make her fifteen seems to me we spent some memorable evenings in the backseat of my old chevy camaro he noted declans brooding look hey i saw her first too i was in a hot trance over that girl a good six months thought id die if i didnt have her you know how it is at seventeen yeah i know how it is at thirtyone too remy chuckled well i mooned over her danced around her sniffed at her heels took her to the movies for long drives to my senior prom god what a picture she was then one

here fever burned itself out and we slid into being friends we are friends dec shes one of my favorite people i know a warning when i hear one you want all the girls remy just thinking to myself that id hate to see two of my friends hurt each other the two of you boy you come with a lot of baggage i know how to store mine maybe god knows shes worked hard to keep hers locked in the attic her mother was he broke off when effie screamed beer spewed over the floor when remy kicked the bottle over as he leaped up he was through the kitchen door one stride ahead of declan and shouting effies name upstairs declan veered left and charged up the kitchen stairway shes upstairs remy remy come quick she sat on the floor hugging her arms and threw herself into remys the instant he crouched beside her baby what happened are you hurt no no i saw she turned her face into his shoulder in there on the bed in there declan looked at the open door the only bed in there was the one hed imagined slowly he pushed the door open the rest of the way he could see the layer of dust on the floor where it had been disturbed when effie had started to go in the sun beamed through the windows onto nothing but wood and faded wallpaper what did you see effie declan asked on the bed a woman her face she was dead baby staring into the room remy stroked her hair theres nothing in there look now theres nothing there but i saw tell me what you saw declan knelt down beside her what did you see in there i saw she shuddered then pressed her lips into a firm line help me up remy though her face was stark white she got to her feet and stepped to the doorway effie darling youre shaking lets get you downstairs no no wait her eyes were wide and her heart continued to beat wildly as she scanned the room i couldnt have seen anything its an empty room just an empty room i m ve imagined a tester bed blue drapes a chest of drawers and mirrored bureau a womans vanity and a blue chaise gaslight sconces candles on the mantel and a framed picture how do you know what i saw because i saw it too the first day i was here i smelled lilies white lilies in a tall vase effie continued and a tear trickled down her cheek i thought it was odd and sort of sweet that youd have flowers in there then i thought for just a minute well how did he fix this room up so beautifully why didnt he mention it and i stepped in and saw her on the bed im sorry i really need some air without a word remy scooped her off her feet my hero she murmured as he carried her toward the stairs you gave me a hell of a fright chère declan you get my girl some water for a long moment declan stared into the room then he followed them down he fetched a glass of water took it out to the gallery where remy sat with effie cradled in his lap how do you feel about ghosts now she took the water sipped while she studied declan over the rim i imagined it a white robe over the chaise a silver brush set some sort of gold and enamel pin watch pin she said quietly she let out a shuddering breath i cant explain it can you tell me about the woman her face was all bruised and bloody oh remy ssh now he stroked her hair gathered her closer you dont have to think about it let her be declan no its all right taking slow breaths effie laid her head on remys shoulder her eyes met declans and held its just so strange so awful and strange i think she was young but it was hard to tell dark hair a lot of dark curling hair her clothes nightgown it was torn there were terrible bruises on her neck like god like shed been strangled i knew she was dead i screamed and stumbled back my legs just gave out from under me i need to find out who she was declan declared theres got to be a way to find out who she was family member servant guest if a young woman died violently in there theres a record somewhere i can do some research effie lowered the water and managed a smile thats my job after all if there was a murder it seems wed have heard stories over the years remy shook his head i never have honey im going to take you home im going to let you effie reached out touched declans arm come on with us i dont know if you should be staying here ive got to stay i want to stay needed to stay he thought when he was alone and the whooshing sound of his nail gun echoed through the dining room he wasnt just restoring the house he was making it his own if a murdered girl was part of it then she was his too he wanted to know her name to know her story where had she come from why had she died maybe hed been meant to come here to find those things out if those images those feelings had driven others away they were only locking him in he could live with ghosts declan thought as he ran his hand over the side of his first completed cabinet but he wouldnt rest until he knew them but when he finally called it a day and went to bed he left the lights on for the next few days he was too busy to think about ghosts or sleepwalking or even those nights out hed promised himself the electrician and plumber hed hired were hard at work with their crews the house was too full of noise and people for ghosts frank and frankie who were as alike as their names with beefy shoulders and mudcolored hair trudged around his gardens made mouth noises that may have been approval or disgust little frankie seemed to be the brains of the operation and after an hours survey gave declan a bid for clearing out underbrush and weeds though he wondered if they intended to retire on the profit from the job declan trusted remy and hired them they came armed with shovels pickaxes and milelong clippers from the dining room where he worked on cabinets declan could hear the lazy rise and fall of their voices the occasional thump and tumble when he glanced out he noticed that the tangle was disappearing the plasterer miss odette sent him was a railthin black man whose name was tibald and his greatgrandpappy so declan was told once worked as a field hand for the manets they toured the house with tibald scribbling in a tiny dogeared notepad when they reached the ballroom tibald looked up at the ceiling with a dreamy expression i always think ive put a picture in my head that isnt there he said dont think id ever get used to seeing this kind of work youve been in here before h the rudickers took a bid for me on plasterwork theyd be the people you bought the hall from they had big fine ideas the rudickers but they never did much about them anyhow they were going to hire someone from savannah so i heard why tibald just kept smiling at the ceiling they had those big fine ideas and didnt see how locals could put a polish on them seems to me they figured the more money they spent the higher the gloss if you know what i mean yeah i get it the way i look at it you hire local youre liable to get people whore more invested in the job can you repair and duplicate this kind of work i did the plasterwork in the harvest house down on the river road i got pictures out in my truck like a reference you maybe want to take a look at them maybe go on down to harvest house and take a study they give public tours and hold fancy events there now do some work in new orleans in baton rouge and metairie can give you names lets take a look at the pictures one look at the before and after shots of various cornices walls medallions showed declan his man was an artist for form he asked for a bid and after promising to have one written up by the end of the week tibald offered his hand i admit id love to get my hands on that ballroom tibald glanced back over at the house you doing any work on the third floor eventually maybe you want to talk to my sister lucy she cleans houses im a long way from needing a housekeeper tibald laughed took out a pack of big red chewing gum no sir i dont mean that kind of clean he offered declan a stick before taking one himself folding it in half and sliding it into his mouth spirit clean you got some strong spirits in that place he chewed contemplatively specially on the third floor how do you know feel it breathing on my neck cant you when the rudickers were working on the place they lost two laborers those men just hightailed it out and kept on going never went back could be one of the reasons they looked farther afield for workers here tibald shrugged chewed his big red could be the reason they never finished up those big fine ideas do you know what happened on the third floor nope dont know of anyone who does just know a few who wouldnt go up there no matter what you paid them any plasterwork needs doing on the third floor you give my sister lucy a call first they both turned at the sound of a car coming down the drive thats miss lenas car and miss odette with her tibalds grin spread as the ancient mg stopped beside his truck afternoon ladies tibald walked to the passengers side to open the door for odette where yat oh fine and well tibald hows that family of yours nothing to complain about lena climbed out as declan opened the door her jeans were intriguingly snug worn with a shirt the color of polished turquoise my grandmama thought it was time to pay a call she scanned the drive noted the number of pickups what did you do cher hire yourself an army just a battalion she smelled of jasmine he thought she smelled of night he had to concentrate on basic manners or swallow his gum can i give you a tour mmm well get to it tibald you say hey to mazie for me wont you i will gotta be on my way ill get that bid to you mr fitzgerald declan ill be looking for it miss odette declan took her hand as tibald climbed into his truck she wore a cotton dress the color of ripe squash and a dark green sweater against the midwinter chill todays socks matched it she smelled of lavender and jingled with her chains and bracelets everything about her relaxed him welcome to manet hall such as it is odette winked at lena when declan kissed her hand well take a look at it when weve finished out here heard you hired big frank and little frankie she said nodding toward their pickup howre they working out for you they seem to be doing the job i dont know how he studied the patchy front gardens with his thumbs hooked through his belt loops i cant catch them actually doing anything but i blink and a couple truckloads of underbrush is gone would you like to walk around the grounds i would lena honey get those spirit bottles out of the trunk well hang them on these live oaks to start spirit bottles to keep the evil spirits away lena began lifting bottles half filled with water from her trunk should i be worried about evil spirits declan asked an ounce of prevention and taking two odette moved off toward the trees spirit bottles declan reported lifting one hed seen them hanging outside the shotgun house just how do they work its an old voodoo trick lena told him the clanking sound they make scares the evil spirits away testing he bumped two together it sounded pleasant enough he thought and not particularly scary you believe in voodoo i believe in that ounce of prevention she strolled off small and curvy to join her grandmother voodoo or old glass bottles he liked the way they looked hanging from his trees and when he tapped two together again he liked the sound they made it took nearly an hour to wind their way around the house and into it as there had to be conversations with the landscapers inquiries about their family speculation on the weather discussion of the garden when he finally got them into the kitchen odette fisted her hands on her hips and nodded thats a good color like a nicely baked pastry crust most men they dont know anything but white brings out these good pine floors i should have the cabinets ready to install next week he gestured toward the dining room im using pine there too with glass fronts lips pursed odette walked in ran her hand over a cabinet this is nice work declan you got a talent thanks and it makes you happy it sure does would you like to go into the parlor ive got a table in there well have some tea he glanced up as something heavy hit the floor above sorry about the noise works rarely a quiet activity lena and i will just wander along if you dont mind well find the parlor you cant miss it its the only room with a table hes a very nice young man odette commented as she and lena walked out of the dining room he is goodlooking too v got a hot eye for you chère now lena laughed he does whatre you going to do about it im still thinking lord what a place lena trailed her hands over a wall doorways wide enough to drive a car through it makes you cry to see how its been let go let go i dont know seems to me its just been waiting isnt this just like a man she said when they stepped into the parlor living with one table and two chairs bet he hasnt fixed a decent meal for himself since he got here lena cocked an eyebrow grandmama youre not going to make me feel sorry enough for him to cook his dinner amused lena wandered to the window its beautiful what you see from here imagine what it wouldve been like to stand here when the house was in its glory horses coming through the allée those funny old cars rumbling up the drive itll be beautiful again but it needs a woman just like that boy needs one lena toyed with the little key that hung around her neck i said im still thinking chilly in here yet she added needs a fire going ill build one declan told her as he came in with a pitcher of oversteeped tea and plastic cups it was a good hour declan thought and not counting remy and effie his first real company he liked having them there the female presence in his parlor with the fire hed built crackling cheerfully and the late afternoon sun fighting through the dust on the windows im going to come back odette told him to see your kitchen when its finished i hope youll come back often id be glad to show you the rest of the house you go on and show lena me im going to walk on home ill take you home grandmama no you stay awhile however casual her tone there was a sly look in her eye i want to walk then itll be time for my nap as she started to rise declan got up offered his hand and made her smile you got a pretty manner about you you come back and see me when youre not busy ill make you some sauce patate potato stew before you get so skinny your clothes fall off your bones i got the phones hooked up he dug in his pocket for a scrap of paper found a pencil in his shirt pocket and wrote down the number if you need anything just call yes indeed a very pretty way she turned her cheek up inviting his kiss when he walked her to the door she gestured for him to lean down again i approve of you sparking my lena youll have a care with her and most dont is that your way of telling me i dont have a chance with you miss odette she laughed and patted his cheek oh if i was thirty years younger shed have a run for her money go on now and show her your house he watched her walk by the trees with the spirit bottles dangling you like my grandmama lena said from the parlor doorway im lovestruck shes wonderful listen its a long walk to her place you ought to was if she wants to walk she walks theres no stopping her from doing anything she wandered to the front door to stand beside him look there its rufus come to walk her home i swear that dog has radar when it comes to her i kept hoping hed come around he turned to lena bring you with him i started out two nights this week to go to your place and talked myself out of it whys that theres persistence and theres stalking he reached up to twirl her hair around his finger i figured if i could hold out until you came by here you wouldnt consider getting a restraining order if i want a man to go away i tell him to go away do men always do what you tell them her lips curved into that cat smile that made him want to lick at the little black mole mostly you going to show me this big house of yours cher yeah he caught her chin in his hand kissed her sure by the way now he took her hand as he led her toward the staircase i have miss odettes permission to spark you seems you need my permission not hers i intend to charm you so completely well slip right by that step fabulous staircase isnt it it is she trailed a redtipped finger along the banister very grand this place of yours declan and from what ive seen of it i realize youre not a rich lawyer after all exlawyer and i dont follow you you got enough to put this place back to keep it you do mean to keep it yeah i do then youre not rich step up from rich youre wealthy is that the case well moneys not a problem it doesnt buy happiness either she stopped on the landing and laughed oh cher you think that you just dont know where to shop anytime you want to help me spend some of it maybe she looked down over the banister toward the grand foyer youll be needing furniture eventually theres some places i know you have a cousin one or two she lifted her eyebrows at the noise and cursing from the end of the long hall plumber declan explained i had him start on the master bath it was well it was an embarrassment of avocado if you know anyone who wants some really ugly bathroom fixtures let me know he started to steer her away from the door of what he now thought of as his ghost room but she turned the knob opened it declan found himself holding his breath as she stepped inside cold in here she hugged her arms but couldnt stop the shiver you ought to try to save the wallpaper its a pretty pattern violets and rosebuds she was halfway to the gallery doors when she stopped and the shiver became a shudder the feeling that poured into her was grief its a sad room isnt it it needs light and life theres a ghost a woman i think she was killed here do you she turned back to him her face was a little pale her eyes a little wide it doesnt feel violent just sad empty and sad her voice had thickened without thinking he went in went to her are you all right just cold he reached down to rub her arms and at the contact felt a quick shock with a halflaugh she stepped back i dont think thats what grandmama meant by you sparking me cher its this room theres something strange in this room ghosts dont worry me shouldnt worry you they cant hurt you but she walked to the door had to fight a need to rush her steps she wandered through the other bedrooms but experienced none of that grief the dread the dragging loneliness that had driven her out of the first at the door to declans room she smiled well not so rough in here you got taste cher she poked her head in the bathroom where workmen clanged and cursed which is more than i can say for whoever did this bathroom that you there tripadoe your mama know you eat with that mouth she leaned on the doorjamb spent a few minutes chatting with his plumbers and declan could stand back and just look at her it was pathetic he told himself this puppy dog crush hed developed and when she glanced at him over her shoulder he felt the jolt right down to the soles of his feet why dont i show you the ballroom its going to be the showcase sure id like to see that but when they started out she gestured toward the stairs whats up there more empty rooms storage some of the servants quarters lets have a look its nothing special he made a grab for her hand but she was already going up can you get to the belvedere from here she asked i used to look over at that and imagine standing up there its easier from the dont his sharp order had her hand freezing on the dull brass knob of the nursery whats wrong you got a woman chained in here all your secrets locked inside here cher no its just he could feel the panic rising burning the base of his throat theres something wrong with that room something wrong with most of them she tossed back and opened the door he was right it hit her immediately that same throbbing sense of grief and loss and loneliness she saw walls and floor and windows dust and neglect and felt as if her heart were breaking even as she started to speak the cold swept in she felt it blow over her skin like breath pass through her hair like fingers its the center she declared though she was far from sure what she meant or how she knew can you feel it can you he swayed in the doorway bearing down he dug his fingers into the jamb his fear was unreasonable spearing like knives into bones it was his house he reminded himself grimly his goddamn house he took a step inside then a second the room spun he heard a scream saw lenas face the alarm that leaped over it he thought he saw her mouth move form his name then his vision grayed white spots dancing through the mist declan here now cher here darling someone was stroking his hair his face he felt lips brush over his he opened his eyes to a blur so simply closed them again no you dont she tapped his cheeks now with fingers that trembled lightly hed gone down like a tree under the ax right after his face had drained of color and his eyes had rolled back white open your eyes what the hell happened you fainted his eyes opened now focused on her face mortification warred with a vague nausea excuse me men dont faint we do on occasion pass out or lose consciousness but we do not faint the breath she let out was a shudder of relief he may have cracked his head she thought but hed come to with his wits about him i beg your pardon you passed out cold hit the floor hard enough to bounce your head off it she leaned down again brushed her lips over the raw scrape on his forehead youre going to have a bruise bébé i couldnt catch you i guess if i had youdve taken us both down she had managed to roll him over and now stroked her fingers over his pale cheeks you do a lot of passing out usually i have to drink myself into oblivion first which i havent done since college look at the risk of embarrassing myself twice in a matter of minutes i really have to get the hell out of this room okay all right can you stand i dont think i can haul you up cher youre a pretty big guy yeah he got to his knees tried to catch his breath but it was clogging again it felt like a semi had parked on his chest and his heart was tripping to try to find a beat he staggered up stumbled lena wrapped an arm around his waist took as much of his weight as she could manage one step two steps well just get you downstairs so you can lie down its okay ill be okay his ears were ringing the minute he got out of the room he headed for the steps then just sank down and put his head between his knees jesus there now sweetheart she stroked his hair close that door would you just close it she hurried back slammed it shut you get your breath back then well get you down and into bed ive been wanting to hear you say that since the first time i laid eyes on you the clutching in her belly eased a bit youre coming back arent you better he could breathe again and the nausea was fading ill just have to go beat someone up or shoot some small mammal so i can regain my manhood let me see your face she tipped his head back studied him still a little pale but you got some color again i bet grandmamas right you dont eat whatd you eat today cher wheaties breakfast of champions he managed a wan smile doesnt seem to have worked im going to fix you a sandwich really the simple pleasure of the idea trickled through him youre going to cook for me a sandwich isnt cooking in my world it is lena that room well talk about that after you get something in your stomach the pickings were sparse one look in the secondhand refrigerator currently gracing the dining room had lena sending declan one long pitying look how old are you twelve im a guy he replied with a shrug guys grocery habits never age ive got peanut butter to go with that jelly he glanced around the room somewhere he also had one lonely slice of deli ham two eggs some anemiclooking cheese and a half bag of precut salad looks like im going to cook for you after all wheres the stove right here he tapped the top of a microwave well well make do bowl knife fork ah he rooted through the box of his current kitchen supplies and came up with the plastic ware honey this is just sad sit yourself down and lenall take care of you this one time she added he hitched onto a sawhorse and watched her beat some eggs shred in the ham the cheese sprinkle in some of the contents of the salad bag you got any herbs cher any spices i got salt and pepper that counts he muttered when she sighed explorers discovered whole continents for salt grew up with a cook didnt you yeah so what did you do when you moved out on your own takeout delivery and the microwave with those three things no man need starve she set the bowl in the microwave programmed it then turned back to him living out here youd best hire yourself another cook name your price youre a funny man declan his color was good now his eyes clear the knot that had been in her belly since hed pitched over loosened how come you dont have a woman i had one but it turned out i didnt really want her that so she opened the oven when it beeped whisked the egg mixture around then programmed it again what happened remy didnt tell you he doesnt tell me everything i was engaged i called it off three weeks before the wedding which makes me you know a cad a lot of people in boston are still cursing my name he was trying to make it a joke she thought but wasnt quite pulling it off is that why you left no its why i realized i could leave you didnt love her no i didnt love her it makes you sad to say that she drew out the bowl got a fresh plastic fork then handed it to him his eyes were stormy again she noted with regret she love you no we looked good together we were used to each other she thought we wanted the same things but you didnt we never did and the closer it got to dday the more i saw my life just narrowing down until i was squeezed into this tiny slot no room no air no light i realized i felt the same way about marrying jessica as i did about practicing corporate law and if that was going to be the rest of my life i could jump off a bridge or get out of the slot while i had the chance she brushed the hair from his forehead it was braver to get out than to jump maybe this is good he said as he scooped up more egg why dont you have a man she cocked her head who says i dont he grabbed her hand before she could turn away i need to know if you do she looked down at his hand back to his face why is that because i cant stop thinking about you i cant get you out of my head from under my skin because every time i see you my heart kicks in my chest youre good at that too at saying things that stir a woman up if it had just been that just a matter of being stirred by him she might have eased in between those long legs and satisfied them both but this wasnt a simple man she thought being with him wouldnt be simple eat your eggs she told him and slid her hand free of his why are you starting with the kitchen if you eat peanut butter and dont have a single dish to your name ive got dishes just not the kind you wash the kitchens the heart of a house the house where i grew up this big old wonderful house with big wonderful rooms we had that cook but it was the kitchen where we ended up if there was a crisis or a celebration or just something to talk over i guess i want that here thats nice she leaned back on a cabinet to study him you want to have sex with me cher his pulse lurched but he managed to hop nimbly off the sawhorse sure just let me kick the plumber out he loved the way she laughed oh you didnt mean right this minute that was what like a true or false type of question let me check he laid his fingers on his wrist yeah im still alive so the answer is true she shook her head took the empty bowl from him and dumped it in the box he was using for trash youre an interesting man declan and i like you uhoh hold on a minute he glanced around picked up the screwdriver lying on a plank here you go he said as he handed it to her whats this for so you can plunge it into my heart when you tell me you just want to be friends i bet jessicas still kicking herself for letting you slip away i do want to be friends she turned the screwdriver in her hand then set it down again i dont know yet if i just want to be friends i have to think about it okay he took her arms ran his hands up to her shoulders think about it she didnt try to pull away but lifted her face so his lips could meet hers she liked the easy glide from warmth to heat the fluid ride offered by a man who took his time she understood desire a mans her own and she knew some of those desires could be sated only in quick hot couplings in the dark from time to time shed sated hers in just that fashion there was more here and it came like a yearning yearnings even met could cause a pain desire never could still she couldnt resist laying her hands on his face letting the kiss spin out inside her deep inside her something sighed angelina he said her name a whisper of sound as he changed the angle of the kiss as he deepened it a thousand warnings jangled in her brain and were ignored she gave herself over for one reckless moment to the heat to the need to the yearning then she drew back from all of it thats something to think about all right she pressed a hand to his chest when he would have pulled her into him again settle down cher she gave him a slow sleepy smile youve got me worked up enough for one day i was just getting started i believe it she let out a breath pushed her hair back ive got to go im working the bar tonight ill come in walk you home however calm his voice his eyes had storms in them the sort she imagined that would provide a hell of a thrill before they crashed over your head i dont think so lena i want to be with you i want to spend time with you want to spend time with me you take me on a date a date the kind where you pick me up at my door and take me out to a fancy dinner she tapped a finger on his chest take me dancing after then walk me back to my door and kiss me goodnight can you handle that what time do you want me to pick you up she smiled shook her head im working tonight i got monday night off place isnt so busy monday nights you pick me up at eight monday eight oclock he grabbed her arms again jerked her against him there was no glide into heat this time but a headlong dive into it oh yeah she thought it would be quite a thrill before the crash just a reminder he told her a warning more like she thought he wasnt nearly as tame as he pretended to be i wont forget see you later cher lena we didnt talk about what happened upstairs we will she called back and kept going she didnt breathe easy until she was out of the house he wasnt going to be as simple to handle as shed assumed the good manners werent a veneer they went straight through him but so did the heat and the determination it was a package she admired and respected not that she couldnt handle him she told herself as she got into her car handling men was one of her best skills but this man was a great deal more complicated than he seemed on the surface and a great deal more intriguing than any shed met before she knew what men saw when they looked at her and she didnt mind it because there was more to her than what they saw or wanted to see she had a good brain a strong back and a willingness to use both to get what she wanted she ran her life the same way she ran her bar with an appreciation for color and a foundation of order beneath the chaos she glanced in her rearview mirror at manet hall as she drove away it worried her that declan fitzgerald could shake that foundation the way no one had before it worried her that she might not find it so easy to shore up the cracks when he walked away they always walked away unless you walked first he fell asleep thinking of lena and drifted into dreams of her strong full bodied dreams where she lay beneath him moved under him with hard quick jerks of her hips damp skin like liquid gold dark chocolate eyes and red wet lips he could hear the sound of her breath the catch and release little gulps of pleasure he smelled her that sirens dance of jasmine that made him think of harems and forbidden shadows he dropped deeper into sleep aching for her and saw her hurrying along a corridor her arms full of linens her hair all that gorgeous hair was ruthlessly pinned back and that tempting body covered from neck to ankle in a baggy dress covered with tiny faded flowers her lips were unpainted and pressed tightly together and in the dream he could hear her thoughts as if they were his own she had to hurry to get the linens put away madame manet was already up and about and she didnt care to see any of the undermaids scurrying in the hallways if she wasnt quick she could be noticed she didnt want madame to notice her servants stayed employed longer when they were invisible thats what mademoiselle larue the housekeeper said and she was never wrong she needed the work her family needed the money she could bring in and oh but she loved working in the hall it was the most beautiful house shed ever seen she was so happy and proud to have some part of tending to it how many times had she stared at it from the shadows of the bayou admiring it longing for a chance to peek in the windows at all the beauty inside and now she was inside responsible in some small way for the tending of that beauty she loved to polish the wood to sweep the floors to see the way the glass sparkled after shed scrubbed it in his dream she came out of the corridor through one of the hidden doors on the second level her eyes tracked everywhere as she hurried along the wallpaper the rugs the wood and glass she slipped into a dressing room put the linens away in a cupboard but as she turned back toward the door something caught her attention and she tiptoed to the window he saw as she saw the riders approaching through the grand oaks of the allée he felt as she felt a stumble of heart as her gaze locked on the man who rode a glossy chestnut his hair was gold and streamed as he galloped straight as a soldier in the saddle with a gray coat over his broad shoulders and his black boots shining her hand went to her throat and she thought quite clearly here is the prince come home to his castle she sighed as girls sigh when they fall foolishly in love he smiled as if smiling at her but she knew it was the house that caused that joy to fill his handsome face with her heart pounding she hurried out of the room back to the servants door and into the maze the young master was home she thought and wondered what would happen next declan woke with a jolt in the dark in the cold he smelled damp and dust and felt the hard wood of the floor under him what the hell groggy disgusted he stretched out a hand and hit wall using it for reference he got to his feet he felt along waiting to come to a corner to a door it took a moment to register that the wall wasnt papered he wasnt in his ghost room this time he was in one of the servants passageways as the girl in his dream had been somehow he thought hed walked as she had walked the idea of stumbling around in the dark until he found a way out had little appeal but slightly more than the idea of spending the next few hours in there waiting for dawn he inched along by the time he felt the seam of a door he was drenched in sweat he shoved his way out offered up a prayer of thanksgiving when he gulped in fresher air saw in the faint light the shape of the secondlevel corridor there were cobwebs in his hair his hands and feet were filthy if this kept up he told himself he was going to see a doctor and get some sleeping pills hoping the nights adventures were over he went to wash to chug down water for his burning throat and to lock himself in the bedroom declan took the load of books out of effies arms then kissed her cheek you didnt have to come all this way to bring me these idve come to you i didnt mind i had a meeting cancel and some time to spare and the fact is breathing slowly she turned a circle i had to prove to myself i wouldnt just turn tail and run when i started to come in this place doing okay yeah she let out one of those slow breaths then nodded briskly doing just fine then she frowned at the shadows dogging his eyes now you on the other hand look worn out not sleeping so well but he didnt want to talk about the dreams the sleepwalking the sounds that so often wakened him in the dead of night come on back to the kitchen so i can show off ive got some lemonade not from actual lemons but its wet and its cold all right she touched his arm in a kind of silent acknowledgment and because she understood lightened her tone ive only got about half an hour but ive got some information for you information and speculation whats going on in here she glanced into the front parlor there were papers stacked on the floor books spread open a pile of paint and fabric samples my next project i thought id start on a room where people could actually sit down when it was finished what kind of information on the manets facts were easy enough she said as they continued through the house henri manet married josephine delacroix they both came from wealthy and prominent creole families henri was active politically its rumored his father profited handsomely by running supplies during the war between the states the family became staunch republicans during reconstruction and again its rumored they used their power and influence to buy votes and politicians oh my goodness dec just look at this she stepped into the kitchen and beamed at the base cabinets hed installed why theyre beautiful he hooked his thumbs in his back pockets and his grin was crooked you sound surprised well i am but in a very complimentary sort of way remy can barely hammer a nail in the wall to hang a picture she ran her hand over the wood opened and closed a door these are really fine you must be so proud im feeling pretty pleased with myself counter guys just left im going with solid surface itll look like slate ordered this giant subzero refrigerator for reasons ive yet to explain to myself and a range a dishwasher im going to make panels so all youll see is wood he set the books down on a sheet of plywood he had over the top of the base cabinets want that lemonade thatd be nice she wandered into the dining room behind him he had two of the top cupboards finished and a third started my arent they going to be pretty you must be working night and day losing weight she thought getting a gaunt look in your face better than sleepwalking he was jittery and found himself dipping hands into his pockets again to keep them still tell me more effie all right she suppressed the urge to fuss over him and went back to the facts the original owners had lost most of their money during the war they hung on selling off parcels of land or renting it out to sharecroppers their politics and the manets were in opposition there was a fire burned the house down to the ground wiped them out the manets bought the land and had this place built they had two sons twins lucian and julian both went to tulane where lucian did very well and julian majored you could say in drinking and gambling lucian was the heir and was meant to run the family businesses most of the manet money had dwindled but josephine had a considerable inheritance both sons died before their twentythird birthday declan handed her a glass how here we have rumors and speculation she sipped the strongest speculation is they killed each other no one seems to know why family argument gone violent its said lucian went into new orleans on his mothers orders to fetch his brother back out of one of the brothels he frequented julian didnt want to be fetched they argued and one of them odds are on julian here pulled a knife they fought struggled for the knife were both wounded julian died on the spot lucian lingered about another week then somehow got out of bed wandered outside and fell into the pond where he drowned the pond he thought choked with lily pads steaming with mists at dawn that had to be rough on the parents the fathers heart gave out a few years later josephine lived several years more but had a reversal of financial fortune she had the house some land but had all but run out of money again speculation is julian had gambled a large part of it away and it was never fully recouped remy said there was a granddaughter lucians or julians theres speculation there too though the records show that lucian married an abigail rouse in and that a daughter was born the next year theres no record of abigails death after lucian was killed the manets declaimed the child legally had her written out of the will she was apparently raised by the rouses i cant find anything on abigail rouse beyond the legal records of her birth and her marriage maybe they kicked her out when lucian died maybe i talked to remy about it she wandered toward the windows stared out at the messy gardens hes a little vague but seems to recall hearing stories about how she ran off with another man she turned back stories from the rouse side differ sharply they lean toward foul play youd get a fuller picture of her and what mightve happened if you talk to someone from the rouse or simone families a clear picture about a girl who ran off or died a hundred years ago honey this is the south a hundred years ago was yesterday she was seventeen when she married lucian she was from the bayou his family could not have approved of such a match i doubt her life in this house was rosy running off mightve been just what she did on the other hand i saw something someone in that room upstairs i dont believe in that sort of thing didnt effie fought back a shiver i dont know what i think about it now but i sure would like to find out ill ask miss odette and lena ive got a date with her monday is that so the idea brightened her mood looks like well have more rumor and speculation she handed him back the glass i have to get on im sending remy out here tomorrow to give you a hand and keep him out of my hair ive got a fitting for my wedding gown and other bridal things to take care of ill keep him busy why dont you come back into town with him she said as she headed out she wanted to lock her arm around his and tug him through the door and away well have some dinner go out to the movies stop worrying about me i cant help it i think about you way out here alone in this house with that room up there she glanced uneasily up the staircase it gives me the shivers ghosts never hurt anybody he kissed her forehead theyre dead but in the night with the sound of the wind and rain and the bang of spirit bottles they didnt seem dead he gave himself sunday he slept late woke to a sky fighting to clear and spent another hour in bed with the books effie had brought him shed marked pages she felt would have the most interest for him he scanned and studied old photographs of the great plantation houses and felt a thrill race through him as he looked at the old blackand white picture of manet hall in its turnofthecentury splendor formal photographs of henri and josephine manet didnt bring the same thrill with those there was curiosity the woman had been undeniably beautiful very much in the style of her day with the deep square bodice of her ball gown edged with roses and the high feathered comb adorning her upswept hair the gown tucked into an impossibly small waist gave her a delicacy accented by the sweep of the brocade skirts the generously poofed sleeves that met the long white gloves but there was a coldness to her face one declan didnt think was a result of the rigidity of the pose or the quality of the print it overwhelmed that delicacy of build and made her formidable but it was the photograph of lucian manet that stopped him in his tracks hed seen that face in his dream the handsome young man with streaming gold hair riding a chestnut horse at a gallop through the mosslaced oaks the power of suggestion had he simply expected the face in the dream to be real and was he projecting it now onto the doomed lucian either way it gave him the creeps he decided hed drive into new orleans and treat himself to a few hours haunting the antique shops instead less than an hour later he found himself walking into et trois it did a strong sundayafternoon business he noted a mix of tourists and locals he was pleased he was learning to distinguish one from the other the jukebox carried the music now a jumpy number by beausoleil that dosidoed around the chatter from tables and bar the scent of food deeply fried reminded his stomach hed skipped breakfast recognizing the blond tending bar from his second visit declan walked up tried a smile on her hi lena around back in the office door to the right of the stage thanks anytime cutie he gave the door marked private a quick knock then poked his head in she was sitting at a desk working at a computer her hair was clipped back and made him want to nibble his way up the nape of her neck hi where yat she sat back gave a lazy stretch of her shoulders youre learning whatre you doing at my door cher i was in the neighborhood and thought id see if youd let me buy you lunch like a prelude to tomorrow night shed been thinking about him more than was comfortable now here he was all tall and rangy and male im doing my books and ive interrupted you dont you hate that he came in anyway sat on the edge of the desk bought you a present it was then that she noticed the little gift bag he carried i dont see how you couldve fit a new car in there were working up to the car she kept her eyes on his a moment longer as she took the bag from him then she dipped in for the box it was wrapped in gold paper with a formal white bow she took her time with it shed always believed the anticipation was as important as the gift the bow and ribbon she tucked neatly back into the bag and after shed picked at the top slid the box out folded the paper precisely how long does it take you to open your presents christmas morning he asked i like taking my time she opened the box felt her lips twitch but kept her expression sober as she took out the grinning crawfish salt and pepper shakers well now arent they a handsome pair i thought so they had alligators too but these guys seemed friendlier are these part of your charm campaign cher you bet howd they work not bad she traced a finger over one of the ugly grins not bad at all good since ive interrupted you and charmed you why dont you let me feed you pay you back for the eggs she eased back in her chair swiveled it as she considered why do i get the feeling every time i see you i should start walking fast in the opposite direction search me anyway my legs are longer so id just catch up with you he leaned over the desk lifted his brows she was wearing a skirt a short one his legs mightve been longer but they wouldnt look half as good in sheer stockings but you could eat up some ground with those how come youre dressed up im not dressed up church clothes ive been to mass now she smiled name like yours i figure you for a catholic boy guilty you been to mass today declan he could never explain why a question like that made him want to squirm im about halflapsed oh she pursed her lips my grandmamas going to be disappointed in you i was an altar boy for three years that ought to count whats your confirmation name ill tell you if you come to lunch he reached over for the crawfish made them dance over her desk come on lena come out and play with me its turned into a nice day all right mistake her practical mind said but she got to her feet picked up her purse you can buy me lunch but a quick one she leaned over saved her file and closed down her computer its michael he said holding out a hand declan sullivan michael fitzgerald if i was any more irish id bleed green its louisa angelina marie louisa simone very french bien súr and i want italian she put her hand in his buy me some pasta from his previous visits declan knew you had to work very hard to find a bad meal in new orleans when lena led the way to a small unpretentious restaurant he didnt worry all he had to do was take one sniff of the air to know they were going to eat very well she waved a hand at someone pointed to an empty table and apparently got the goahead this isnt a date she said to him when he held her chair he did his best to look absolutely innocent and nearly succeeded its not no she eased back crossed her legs a date is when we have a time arranged and you pick me up at my house this is a droponby so tomorrow thats our first date just in case youre thinking of that threedate rule we guys dont like to think you women know about that her lips curved theres a lot yall dont like to think we know about she kept her eyes on his but lifted up a hand to the darkhaired man who stopped at the table hey there marco lena he kissed her fingers then handed her a menu good to see you this is remys college friend from boston declan i brought him by so he can see how we do italian food here in the vieux carre you wont do better he shook declans hand gave him a menu my mamas in the kitchen today then were in for a treat lena said hows your family marco declan saw how it happened then when she shifted in her chair lifted her face looked at marco it was as if the two of them were alone on a little island of intimacy it was sexual there was no question about it but it was also attentive he decided good as gold my sophie won a spelling bee on friday thats some bright child you got they chatted for a few moments but declan entertained himself by watching her face the way her eyebrows lifted fell drew together according to the sentiment how her lips moved punctuated by that tiny mole when she turned her head he shook his sorry did you say something to me i was looking at you i get lost they got some smooth talkers up north marco said pretty too isnt he lena asked very nice our lena heres having the seafood linguini you know what you want or you need some time to decide you dont get the same lena tapped a finger on the menu declan had yet to read else its no fun for me picking off your plate you try the stuffed shells maybe mama makes them good stuffed shells then he had a feeling hed have tried crushed cardboard if shed requested it do you want wine no because youre driving and im working strict san pelligrino he glanced at marco ill bring you out a bottle so she tucked her hair behind her ear as marco left them whatre you up to today cher i thought id hit some of the antique stores im looking for a display cabinet for the kitchen and stuff to stick in it i thought i might go by and see miss odette on the way back what does she like i want to take her something you dont have to take her anything id like to lena hooked an arm over the back of her chair drummed her fingers on the table as she studied him you get her a bottle of wine then a good red tell me something cher you wouldnt be using my grandmama to get to me would you she saw the temper flash into his eyes darker hotter than shed expected from him shouldve known she thought that all that easy manner covered something sharp something jagged it was impressive but more impressive was the lightning snap from mild to fury and back to mild again a man who could rein himself in like that she decided had a will of iron that was something else to consider youve got it backwards he told her im using you to get to miss odette shes the girl of my dreams im sorry good you should be lena waited until their water and bread were served his tone had raised her hackles mostly she could admit because shed deserved the quick slap folding her arms on the table she leaned toward him i am sorry because that was nasty im going to tell you something declan nasty words have a habit of popping right out of my mouth i dont always regret saying them im not a sweet mannered eventempered sort of woman i dont have a trusting nature ive got good points but ive got just as many bad i like it that way he mimicked her posture im single minded competitive and moody ive got a mean temper it takes a lot to get it going which is a fortunate thing for the general population i dont have to have my way in the little things but when i decide i want something really want it i find a way to get it i want you so ill have you shed been wrong he hadnt snapped back to mild anger was still simmering behind his eyes as the one person she tried to be honest with at all times was herself she didnt bother to pretend it didnt excite her youre saying that to make me mad no thats just a side benefit he eased back picked up the basket of bread and offered it you want to fight feeling sulky she picked out a piece maybe later getting riled up spoils my appetite anyway she shrugged bit into the bread you dont want to go by grandmamas today shes over visiting her sister this afternoon ill stop in later this week i got the kitchen counters installed remy gave me a hand so to speak with the wall units yesterday it should be finished in a couple of weeks good for you she wanted to brood and could see by his amused expression that he knew it you been back up on the third floor yeah hed had to prime himself with a good shot of jim beam first but hed gone back didnt fall on my face this time but i had a major panic attack im not prone to panic attacks i found out more about the manet family history but there are pieces missing maybe youve got them you want to know about abigail rouse thats right how much do was he broke off because shed turned her attention away from him and back to marco who brought out their pasta he reminded himself as they fell into a lazy discussion about the food that the wheel turned more slowly in the south how much do you know about her he asked when they were alone again lena rolled up a forkful of pasta slid it between her lips she sighed deep swallowed mama realdo shes a goddess in the kitchen try yours she ordered and leaned over to sample from his plate its great best meal ive had since a microwave omelette she smiled at him one long slow smile that lodged in his belly then went back to eating i know the stories that came down in my family nobody can say for sure abigail she was a maid in the big house some of the rich families they hired cajun girls to clean for them to fetch and carry story is that lucian manet came home from tulane and fell in love with her they ran off and got married had to run off because nobodys going to approve of this his family hers she broke off a chunk of bread nibbled on it as she studied him mixing classes is an uneasy business he moved her into the hall after and that was an uneasy business too people say josephine manet was a hard woman proud and cold people started counting on their fingers but the baby she dont come for ten months that room upstairs it m ve been the nursery theyd have kept the baby there most like there was a nursemaid she married one of abigails brothers later most of the stories about the hall come from her it seems a couple days before the end of the year lucian was off in new orleans on business when he came back abigail was gone they said shed run off with some bayou boy shed been seeing on the side but that doesnt ring true the nursemaid her name was claudine she said abigail never wouldve left lucian and the baby she said something bad had to have happened something terrible and she blamed herself because she was off meeting her young man down by the river the night abigail disappeared a dead girl on the tester bed in a cold room declan thought and the pasta lodged in his throat like glue he picked up the fizzy water drank deep did they look for her her family looked everywhere its said lucian haunted the bayou until the day he died when he wasnt looking there he was in town trying to find a trace of her he never did and didnt live long himself with him gone and the twin his mother favored by all accounts dead as well miss josephine had the baby taken to abigails parents youve gone pale declan i feel pale go on this time when she broke off a hunk of bread she buttered it handed it to him her grandmama was right lena thought the man needed to eat the baby was my grandmamas grandmama the manets cast her out claiming she was a bastard and no blood of theirs they brought her to the rouses with the dress she had on a small bag of crib toys only thing she had from the hall was the watch pin claudine gave to her that had been abigails declans hand shot out to cover hers is the pin still around we hand such things down daughter to daughter my grandmama gave it to me on my sixteenth birthday why enameled watch hanging from small gold wings color stained her cheeks how do you know i saw it the chill danced up his spine sitting on the dresser in the bedroom that must have been hers an empty room he continued with phantom furniture the room where effie saw a dead girl laid out on the bed they killed her didnt they something in the way he said it so flat so cold had her stomach dropping thats what people think people in my family in the nursery i dont know youre spooking me some declan you he passed a hand over his face well i guess i know who my ghost is poor abigail wandering the hall and waiting for lucian to come home but if she did die in the hall who killed her maybe thats what im supposed to find out so she can you know rest he wasnt pale now lena thought his face had toughened hardened that core of determination again why should it be you why not it had to be one of the manets the mother the father the brother then they buried her somewhere and claimed she ran away i need to find out more about her i imagine you will youve got a mulish look about you cher dont know why that should be so appealing to me talk to my grandmama she might know more or shell know who does she nudged her empty plate back now you buy us some cappuccino want dessert no room for that she opened her purse pulled out a pack of cigarettes i didnt know you smoked i get one pack a month she tapped one out ran her fingers up and down its length one a month whats the point she put the cigarette between her lips flicked the flame on a slim silver lighter as she had with the first bite of pasta she sighed over that first deep drag pleasure cher there are twenty cigarettes in a pack thirty or thirtyone days to a month cept for february i dearly love the month of february now i can smoke up the whole pack in a day and just about lose my mind for the rest of the month or i can dole them out slow and careful and make them last because theres no buying another pack before the first of the month how many do you bum from other people during the month her eyes glittered through the haze of smoke that would be cheating i dont cheat pleasures nothing sugar unless you got the willpower to hold off until you really appreciate it she trailed a fingertip over the back of his hand and for the hell of it rubbed the side of her foot against his leg under the table how are you on willpower she asked were going to find out it was dusk when he got back to the house the back of his fourwheel was loaded with treasures hed hunted up in antique shops but the best was the kitchen cabinet hed found and had begged and bribed to have delivered the next day he carried what he could on the first trip and when he stepped inside set everything down in the foyer he closed the door behind him then stood very still abigail he said the name listened to it echo through the house and waited but he felt no rush of cold air no sudden shift in the silence and standing at the base of the grand staircase he couldnt explain how he knew he wasnt alone he woke to a crashing thunderstorm but at least he woke in his own bed lightning slashed outside the windows and burst a nova of light through the room a glance at the bedside clock showed him a minute to midnight but that had to be wrong declan thought he hadnt gone to bed until after one wondering if the storm had knocked out his power he turned the switch on the bedside lamp light speared out half blinding him damn it he rubbed his shocked eyes then grabbed the bottle of water hed set on the table next to the bed and rising went out on the gallery to watch the show it was worth the price of a ticket he decided lashing rain pitchfork lightning and a wind that was whipping through the trees in moans and howls he could hear the excited clanging of the spirit bottles and the fierce jungle war of thunder and the baby crying the water bottle slid out of his fingers bounced at his feet and soaked them he wasnt dreaming he told himself and reached out to grip the wet baluster he wasnt sleepwalking he was awake fully aware of his surroundings and he heard the baby crying he had to order himself to move but he walked back into the bedroom dragged on sweats checked his flashlight barefoot shirtless he left the security of his room and started toward the third floor he waited for the panic to come that clutching in the belly the sudden shortness of breath the pounding of his heart but it didnt come this time the steps were just steps now the door just a door with a brass knob that needed polishing and the baby wasnt crying any longer come this far he grumbled his palms were sweaty but it was nerves instead of fear he reached out turned the knob the door opened with a whine of hinges there was a low fire in the hearth its light and the light of candles danced in pretty patterns over walls of pale pale peach at the windows were deep blue drapes with lacy under curtains the floor was polished like a mirror with two area rugs in a pattern of peaches and blues there was a crib with turned rails a small iron cot made up with white linen she sat in a rocking chair a baby at her breast he could see the babys hand on it white against gold her hair was down spilling over her shoulders over the arms of the rocker her lips moved in song or story he didnt know he couldnt hear but she stared down at the child as she nursed and her face was lit with love you never left her declan said quietly you couldnt have she looked up toward the doorway where he stood so that for one heartstopping second he thought shed heard him would speak to him when she smiled when she held out a hand he took a step toward her then his knees went loose as he saw the man cross the room pass through him like air and walk to her his hair was golden blond he was tall and slim of build he wore some sort of robe in a deep burgundy when he knelt by the rocker he stroked a fingertip over the babys cheek then over the tiny fingers that kneaded at the womans breast the woman abigail lifted her hand pressed it over his and there surrounded by that soft light the three of them linked while the babys milky mouth suckled and the woman gently rocked no you never left them ill find out what they did to you to all of you as he spoke the door slammed shut behind him he jolted spun and found himself plunged back into the dark with only the lightning blasts and the beam of his flashlight the weight fell into his chest like a rock cutting off his air the room was empty freezing and the panic leaped at his throat he dragged at the doorknob his sweat slicked hands sliding off the icy brass he could feel his choked gasps wanting to rise into shouts and screams pleas and prayers dizziness drove him down to his knees where he fumbled frantically with the knob wrenched and tugged at the door when he managed to pull it open he crawled out on his hands and knees then lay facedown on the floor with his heart thundering in his chest as the storm thundered over the house okay im okay im okay goddamn it and im getting up off the floor and going back to bed he might be losing sleep declan thought as he got shakily to his feet but hed learned a couple of things if what hed seen inside the nursery was truth and not some selfgenerated fantasy abigail rouse manet hadnt left manet hall of her own free will and he had more than one ghost on his hands she was probably making a mistake lena thought as she slicked a little black dress down her body shed already made several small mistakes where declan fitzgerald was concerned it irritated her as she rarely made mistakes when it came to men if there was one thing shed learned from her mother it was how to handle the male species it was a reverse tutelage she made a habit of doing exactly the opposite of what lilibeth did and had done when it came to relationships the process had kept lena heartwhole for nearly thirty years she had no desire and no intention of putting herself into a mans hands metaphorically speaking she thought with a smirk as she painted her lips she liked being in the right mans hands well enough when she was in the mood to be handled a woman who didnt enjoy sex in her opinion just didnt know how to pick her partners cannily enough a smart woman culled out men who were willing and able to be shown how that woman wanted to be pleasured and a woman pleasured tended to give a man a good strong ride everybody ended up winning the problem was declan had the talent for putting her in the mood for sex all the damn time she was not in the habit of being guided by her hormones the wisest safest thing for a woman to do about sex was to be in control of it to decide the when the where the who and how men well they were just randy by nature she couldnt blame them for it and women who claimed not to try to stir men up were either coldblooded or liars if shed believed she and declan were headed toward a simple affair that began and ended with a mutual buzz she wouldnt have been concerned but there was more to him than that too many layers to him she thought and she couldnt seem to get through them all and figure him out more and much more worrying there was another layer to her reaction to him than simple lust that too was complicated and mysterious she liked the look of him and the yankee bedrock sound of his voice and then hed gone and hit her soft spot with his obvious affection for her grandmama got her blood heated up too she admitted the man had a very skilled pair of lips and when he wasnt paying attention a wounded look in his eyes she was a sucker for hurting hearts best to take it slow she arched her neck and ran the crystal wand of her perfume bottle over her skin slow and easy no point in getting to the end of the road unless youd enjoyed the journey she trailed the wand over the tops of her breasts and imagined his fingers there his mouth it had been a long time since shed wanted a man quite this clearly she realized and since it was too late for a quick anonymous roll in the sheets it would be wise get to know him a little better before she let him think hed talked her into bed right on time arent you cher she commented aloud at the knock on her door she gave her reflection a last check blew herself a kiss and walked to the front door he looked good in a suit very classy and gq she decided she reached out ran the stonegray lapel between her thumb and fingers mmm dont you clean up nice cher sorry all the blood just drained out of my head so the best i can come up with is wow she sent him that sassy underthelashes look and turned a slow circle on stiletto heels this work okay for you then the dress clung dipped and shimmied his glands were doing a joyful jig oh yeah its working just fine she crooked her finger come here a minute she stepped back then slid a hand through his arm and turned toward an old silverframed mirror dont we look fine she said and her reflection laughed at his where you taking me cher lets find out he picked up a wide red silk scarf draped it over her shoulders are you going to be warm enough if im not then this dress isnt working after all with this she strode out on her little gallery she started to hold out a hand for his then just stared down at the white stretch limo at the curb she was rarely speechless but it took her a good ten seconds to find her voice and her wits you buy yourself a new car darling its a rental this way i figure we can both have all the champagne we want as first dates went she thought as he led her down this one had potential it only got better when the uniformed driver opened the door and bowed her inside there were two silver buckets one held a bottle of champagne and the other a forest of purple tulips roses are obvious he said and pulled a single flower out to offer her and youre not she twirled the tulip under her nose is this how you charm the girls in boston he poured a flute of champagne held it out to her there are no other girls off balance she took a sip youre dazzling me declan thats the plan he tapped his glass to hers im really good at seeing a plan through she leaned back crossed her legs in a slow deliberate motion she knew would draw his gaze down to them youre a dangerous man you know what makes you really dangerous it doesnt show unless you take a good look under all the polish i wont hurt you lena oh hell you wont but she let out a low delightful laugh thats just part of the trip sugar just part of the trip and so far im enjoying it he went for elegant oldworld french where the waiters wore black tie the lighting was muted and the corner table was designed for intimacy another bottle of champagne arrived seconds after they were seated telling her hed prearranged it and possibly a great deal more im told the food is memorable here the house is early twentieth century he continued georgian colonial revival and belonged to an artist a private home until about thirty years ago do you always research your restaurants history ambience matters especially in new orleans so does cuisine they tell me the caneton a lorange is a house specialty then one of us should have it intrigued she set her menu aside he wasnt just fun she thought he wasnt just sexy and smart he was interesting you choose this time he ordered straight through from appetizers to chocolate souffli with the ease of a man accustomed to fine dining in exclusive restaurants you have good french at least for ordering food do you speak it otherwise yes but cajun french can still throw me have you been to paris yes she leaned forward in that way she had her arms folded on the edge of the table her gaze fastened to his is it wonderful it is one day id like to go to paris and florence to barcelona and athens they were hot colorful dreams of hers and the anticipation of them as exciting as the wish youve been to those places not athens yet my mother liked to travel so we went to europe every year when i was growing up every other to ireland we still have family there and whats your favorite she rested her elbows on the table and her chin in her laced fingers of all the places youve been hard to say the west coast of ireland the hills in tuscany a sidewalk cafi in paris but at the moment right here is my favorite place theres that silky tongue again all right then tell me about boston its a new england harbor city of great historical importance when she laughed he sat back and soaked it in oh thats not what you meant tell me about your family you have brothers sisters two brothers one sister big family are you kidding my parents were pikers in the goforthandmultiply area mom has six brothers and sisters my father comes from a family of eight none of their siblings had less than five kids we are legion you miss them i do okay i do he admitted reluctantly from this nice safe distance ive realized i actually like my family theyll come visit you eventually everyone will wait for my mother to start actually speaking to me again in our house if its not one thing its your mother she sampled the appetizer hed ordered for her she wore no rings and he wondered why she had lovely hands slim elegant delicate the silver key rested against that smooth dusky skin and there was a glint of silver at her ears but her fingers her wrists were bare beautifully bare he realized and wondered if the lack of ornamentation was some sort of female ploy to make a man notice every line every curve every sweep of her it was sure as hell working that way on him you think shes mad at you your mama he had to blink himself back to the threads of conversation not mad irritated annoyed baffled if she was really angry shed be down here in my face chipping away until i crumbled to her terrifying will does she want you to be happy yes we love each other like idiots shed just be more satisfied if my happiness aligned with her point of view her head angled and again he caught that wink of silver through the thick dark curls of her hair why dont you let her know she hurts your feelings what if you dont let her know she hurts them how is she going to stop i let them down oh you did not she replied with a kind of impatient sympathy you think your family wants you to be miserable and unfulfilled married to a woman you dont love working at a career that you dont want yes no he answered i dont honestly know then it seems to me you ought to ask them do you have any siblings no and tonight were going to talk about you well save me for another time did you find what you wanted at your antique shops and then some more comfortable talking about acquisitions than family he gave her a blowbyblow that took them into the main course how do you know what you want before you have the room done i just do he moved his shoulders i cant explain it ive got this great davenport on hold for the upriver parlor thats where im starting next and its not nearly as big a job as the kitchen walls and floors mostly i want to get a good start on the interiors so i can concentrate on the galleries the double stairs have the place painted starting in april if im lucky that way we should be able to shift back inside before the summer heat why are you pushing so hard the house isnt going anywhere remember the singleminded competitive nature i told you about doesnt mean you cant relax a bit how many hours are you putting in in a week i dont know ten twelve a day generally then he grinned and reached for her hand you worried about me ill take more time off if youll spend it with me im not that worried about you but she left her hand in his let it be held against that hard calloused palm still mardi grass coming if you dont take some time to enjoy that you might as well be in boston she looked at the double souffli their waiter set in the middle of the table oh my my my she leaned forward closed her eyes and sniffed and was laughing when she opened them again wheres yours he took her dancing hed found a club that played the slow foxtrots and jazzy swings of the thirties and surprised her by whirling her around the floor until her legs were weak youre full of surprises bet your ass he swung her into his arms had her blood pressure spiking when he ran his hands down her body and gripped her hips her body rolled against his a wave sliding under a wave while a tenor sax wailed he dipped her had her laughing even as her pulse went thick she let her head fall back her hair stream down as he lowered his face toward hers his lips skimmed over her chin just a hint of teeth then he swept her up again circled her seduced her the lights were a warm smoky blue and his movements fluid so it was like moving underwater the yearning she wasnt ready for crawled into her belly with her eyes half closed she skimmed a hand into his hair brought his face closer that last inch closer so his mouth met hers you fit lena we fit she shook her head turned it so her cheek rested against his you make love half as well as you dance you must have a trail of female smiles in your wake let me show you he nipped at her earlobe and felt her quick shiver i want to touch you i know how your skin will feel under my hands i dreamed about it she kept her eyes closed tried to lock away the yearning just dance with me its getting late and i want one more dance she rested her head on his shoulder in the limo the music the wine the soft lights were all still playing in her head she felt drenched in romance and knowing that had been his intention didnt diminish the effect it only enhanced it he was a man who would trouble himself with the details the large and the small with the house hed chosen with the woman he wanted she admired that admired him you show a girl a good time cher let me show you one tomorrow night i work tomorrow night your next night off then im going to think about that im not being coy declan she sat up so she could look at him i dont like coy im being cautious i cant say i care much for that either but where youre concerned i think its the smart thing to be and i do like being smart as the limo glided to the curb in front of her home she trailed a finger down his cheek now you walk me to my door and kiss me goodnight he carried the silver bucket with the purple tulips he set them down in front of her door then framed her face in his hands the kiss was sweeter than shed expected shed been prepared for heat the persuasive pervasive heat that might melt her resistance instead he gave her the sweet and the gentle ending the evening as hed begun it with romance how about before you go to work he lifted her hand to his lips now ill take you on a picnic undone she stared at him a picnic it should be warm enough we can spread a blanket by the pond you can bring rufus along as chaperone i like watching him jump in damn it she caught his face in her hands now damn it i want you to go on down to that big white limo okay he touched her hair ill just wait until youre inside go down to the limo she repeated and pay that driver and tell him to go on home then you come back up he closed his hands over her wrists felt the trip of her pulse five minutes dont change your mind two minutes he amended time me as he bolted down the stairs she picked up her flowers let herself inside if it was a mistake she thought it wouldnt be her first or her last she lit the candles put on some billie holiday sex should be easy she reminded herself when it was between two unattached adults with well at least some affection along with the lust it should be a celebration whether or not shed been persuaded the decision was hers there was no point in regretting it before it had even begun he knocked the idea that he would rather than just walking in made her smile good manners and hot blood it was an interesting combination irresistible she opened the door and billie holidays heartbreak streamed out declan slid his hands into his pockets and smiled at her hi hi back handsome lena reached out and grabbed his tie come on in here she tugged and pulled him in the door and walking backward would have pulled him straight into the bedroom but he laid his hands on her hips drew her to him i like your music he eased her into a dance when i can see something besides you ill tell you if i like your place did you take lessons on what to say to have women falling for you natural gift he brushed his lips at each corner of her mouth over that sexy little mole the streets of boston are littered with my conquests it was playing hell with traffic so the city council asked me to leave he skimmed his cheek over hers i smell you in my sleep and wake up wanting you her heart began to shiver like something feeling warmth after a long freeze i knew you were trouble the minute you stepped up to my bar she stretched under the hand that ran down her back i just didnt know how much trouble plenty he scooped her off her feet crushed his mouth to hers until they both moaned which way mmm ive got a number of ways in mind what blood was left in his head shot straight down to his loins ha i meant which way is your bedroom with a low laugh she chewed on his bottom lip door on the left he had a number of impressions as he carried her across the room through the doorway vibrant colors old wood but most of his senses were wrapped around the woman in his arms the weight of her the shape and scent the surprise that flickered over her face when he set her on her feet beside the bed instead of on it id like to take my time with this if its all the same to you he trailed a fingertip down her collarbone over the lovely curve of breast the dress displayed you know like unwrapping a present i cant say i mind that shed expected a rush fast hands hungry mouth to match the reckless lust shed seen in his gaze when his hands took hers linked fingers and his lips lay silky on her lips she remembered how ruthlessly hed controlled his temper the day before it seemed his control reached to other passions as well she wasnt prepared for romance hed realized it when shed seen the tulips more than surprise thered been suspicion in her eyes just as there was now as he slowed the pace lingered over the quiet pleasure of a kiss seducing her into bed was no longer enough he wanted to seduce that suspicion into helpless pleasure her lips were warm and willing it was no hardship to mate his with them to float on that lazy slide of tongues while their bodies swayed together as if they were still dancing he knew when her fingers went limp in his that she floated with him he lowered the zipper of her dress in one slow glide and traced his fingers over the newly exposed flesh she arched her back and all but purred youve got good hands cher and very sexy lips watching him now as he watched her she loosened the knot of his tie lets see about the rest of you there was something about undressing a man in a suit she thought the time it took to remove all the layers to get to skin built anticipation honed curiosity he touched her as she unbuttoned his shirt easing the dress off her shoulders so that it clung erotically to the curve of her breasts he nibbled at her mouth never hurrying never groping and when she opened his shirt ran her hands over his chest with a little hum of approval she felt the heavy beat of his heart under her palms some build youve got for a lawyer exlawyer it was like dying he thought dying by inches to have those long slender fingers with those hot red nails running over him she pinched lightly at his biceps licked her lips yes indeed youre just full of surprises i like a strong man she tapped her nails on his belt buckle and her smile was female feline lets see what other surprises youve got for me they were dancing again the oldest dance and somehow shed taken the lead his stomach muscles quivered when she whipped the belt off tossed it over her shoulder in his mind he saw himself throwing her down on the bed pounding himself and this outrageous need into her shed accept it shed expect it instead he took both her hands before she could unhook his trousers and lifted them to his lips watching her over them he saw the surprise and again the suspicion i seem to be falling behind he said playfully and since ive been wondering what youve got on under that dress id like to find out how close my speculations were to reality he laid his lips on her bare shoulder used them to nudge the material down her arm and blessed the laws of gravity when it slid down and puddled at her feet she wore black lace she was every mans fantasy dusky skin tumbled hair full high breasts barely restrained in that fancy of lace the slim torso the gently rounded hips with more midnight lace riding low shapely legs in sheer black stockings and man killer heels close the breath was already burning in his lungs very close whats this he traced a fingertip over the tattoo on her inner thigh just above the lacy edge of her stocking thats my dragon he guards the gates she was trembling and wasnt ready to tremble a lot of men think they can get past him a lot of men get burned he stroked his finger up along that sensitive valley between lace and thigh lets play with fire he yanked her against him devoured her mouth and when that wasnt enough whirled her around to scrape his teeth along her shoulder the side of her neck with his face buried in her hair he ran his hands up her body filled them with her lacecovered breasts she arched back to him hooked her arms around his neck and offered the spin from patient to urgent left her dizzy brutally aroused and ready to be taken she felt the greed from him now and felt her own rise to match it his hand slid down cupped between her legs pressed and brought her to the jagged edge of release before she could fall he trailed his fingers down her thigh and with one fast flick unhooked a garter her breath caught her body strained mon dieu when im inside you you wont be able to think about anything else he unhooked a second garter but first i need to touch you the way ive been dreaming of touching you he rubbed his lips over her shoulder nudged the strap of her bra aside angelina he turned her to face him let his fingers dive into her hair draw her head back youre mine tonight denial defiance fought their way through seduction i belong to myself he scooped her up laid her back on the bed tonight were going to belong to each other he closed his mouth over hers stopping her words drugging her brain she turned her head to take a breath to try to steady herself again but his lips trailed down to her breast over flesh over lace under it the long liquid tugs in her belly loosened her muscles melted her will she yielded telling herself she was surrendering to her own needs and not to him he felt her give the softening of her heard it in the low throaty moan that was pleasure and acceptance so he took what hed been aching for since the first moment hed seen her in the morning mist her body was a treasure scented skin female curves he fed himself on the taste of it in slow sips and long gulps then freed her breasts to his hands his mouth his blood raged like a firestorm but he let himself burn and tortured them both when he rolled the lace down her hips she arched opened he traced his fingers over her watching her face in the candlelight as her eyes closed her lips trembled on a groan and when he slid them into her into the hot wet velvet of her she bowed up cried out drove him mad pressing his face to her belly he sent her flying her body was a mass of aches of joys with the sharp edge of sensation slicing through like a bolt of light it burst in her sent her helplessly hurtling she reached for him closed her hand around him he was hard as stone she wanted him inside her as much as she wanted her next breath now i want you she felt him quiver even as she quivered saw herself in his eyes as he rose over her i want you to fill me fill me up he clung to that slippery line of control and as her legs wrapped around him slid slowly very slowly into her slid deep when she rose to meet him held there with his breath caught in his throat and everything he was lost in her sighs now and a quick rushing gasp they kept their eyes on each other and moved an almost lazy pace that spread pleasure like a warm pool their lips met and he felt hers curve against his before he lifted his head to see her smile flesh glided over flesh silky friction music the tragic sob of it from her living room a sudden celebratory burst of it from the street below merged together in his head with her quickening breaths she tensed beneath him her head going back to bare the line of her throat for his lips she tightened around him shuddered shuddered once again he buried his face in her hair and this time let himself fly with her later he lay watching the light play on the ceiling stroking his hand along her back drenched in her are you going to let me stay he asked or do i catch a cab she stared into the shadows stay he woke just after daybreak shed curved into him in sleep but he saw that she had her arm between them and a fist curled over her heart as if she were guarding it he thought the little silver key lay against the side of her hand he wanted to lift that hand gently uncurl the fingers bare her heart to him he realized hed already lost his to her had lost it he decided the moment hed seen her it was a jolt and a shock for a man whod come to believe he simply wasnt capable of love unless it was family or friendship his personal crisis over jessica who everyone including jessica had claimed was perfect for him had convinced him hed blown his one chance at a lasting content relationship with a woman it had been tough to swallow for a man who at the core believed strongly in family in home in marriage and swallowing it he realized had been largely responsible for the restless unhappiness that had trailed after him like a faithful dog for months now he was looking at the woman who was the answer and he didnt think she was going to be willing to listen to the question so hed have to persuade her one way or the other and sooner or later because hed meant what hed said the night before they were going to belong to each other he considered waking her up and reminding her how good they were together in bed he couldnt think of a better way to start the day especially since she was warm and soft and draped around him but it didnt seem quite fair to wake her when theyd barely slept her workday started a great deal later than his he slid away from her with no little regret and eased out of bed she stirred sighing in sleep and rolled into the warmth hed left behind he grabbed his trousers and headed into the shower in his opinion you could tell a lot about a person by their bathroom hers was both rigorously clean and indulgent thick towels of forest green offset the white fixtures and picked up the small diamond chip pattern scattered through the floor tile lush green plants lined the windowsill and a trio of daffodils speared out of a slim bottle of pale green there were other bottles jewel colors and covered boxes that held fragrant oils and lotions bath salts she liked fancy soaps he noted and kept them in a pretty bowl he also discovered her hot water lasted longer than his he smiled through the bliss of a fifteenminute shower that steamed up the room like a turkish bath she was still sleeping when he stepped out sprawled now over the sheets with the morning sun slanted over the lean length of her naked back he turned his mind firmly from sliding back into bed with her and focused it on finding coffee her living area had lofty ceilings and dark wood floors shed sponged the walls with a bluish paint that made them look like faded denim against one stood a fireplace framed in that same dark wood with a sunburst mantelpiece he immediately coveted its woodwork was distressed its creamcolored paint peeling he understood why shed left it that way its history and character came through to complement the faded walls shed hung colorful framed posters advertising posters he noted elegant women selling champagne sleeklooking men toting cigars a highbacked sofa in royal blue sat in the center of the room covered as women mysteriously cover sofas and beds with pillows he admired the style shed formed here old subtly battered tables and slashing colors and he liked seeing his tulips on her coffee table he wandered through to the kitchen and found himself grinning it wasnt often you found blackand white photos of nudes male and female on kitchen walls but he was happier yet to find coffee he closed the pocket door so the sound of grinding beans wouldnt carry to the bedroom and while the coffee brewed he stood at her kitchen window looking out at her section of new orleans he heard the slide of the kitchen door she wore a short red robe and her eyes were heavy with sleep her smile lazy with it sorry i thought id muffled the coffee grinder i didnt hear it she drew a deep breath but i smelled the results you making breakfast cher want toast its my best thing oh i think i had a taste of your best thing last night still smiling she sauntered toward him slid her hands around his neck gimme another she said and lifted her mouth to his shed woken lonely sure hed gone she never let men stay the night in her bed it was too easy for them to slip out the door better to send them along to sleep alone than to wake lonely then shed seen his shirt his jacket his shoes and had been delighted too delighted when a man had that much power it was time to take some back the surefire way was to cloud his mind with sex why didnt you just roll over and wake me up sugar thought about it was still thinking about it i figured since youre working tonight you need more than ten minutes sleep but since youre awake she laughed and slipped away since im awake i want coffee she opened a cupboard door sent him that knowing glance over her shoulder maybe if you ask nice ill fix you some breakfast do you want me to beg standing up on my knees or completely supine you tickle me declan ill make you some toast le pain perdu she added when his face fell french toast i got me most of a nice baguette she handed him a thick white mug filled with black coffee thanks since youre good in the kitchen we wont have to hire a cook when we get married and raise our six kids six i feel obligated to uphold the sullivanfitzgerald tradition i really like your kitchen art not the usual spot for nudes why she got out a black iron skillet cookings an art and its sexy if you do it right she got out a blue bowl he watched her crack an egg on its side slide white and yolk in onehanded i see what you mean do it again she chuckled and cracked a second egg why dont you go on out and put some music on this wont take long they ate at a little gateleg table she had tucked under one of the living room windows whered you learn to cook he asked her my grandmama she tried to teach me to sew too but that didnt stick so well im surprised you didnt open a restaurant instead of a bar i like to cook when i like to cook do it for a living do it all the time theres that how did you end up running a bar i wanted my own business you work for somebody else they say do this dont do that come here go there that doesnt set with me so i went to business school and i think what business do i want to have i dont want to sell souvenirs dont want a gift shop dont want to sell dresses i think all those things sell in new orleans but what sells even more pleasure sells a little harmless sin and a good time thats what people come to the big easy for so et trois how long have you had it lets see now shed already eaten her single slice so speared a forkful of one of the four shed piled on his plate going on six years now you opened a bar when you were twentythree hey how do you know how old i am remy she looked up at the ceiling et la gonna have to take a strip off his ass for that man oughta know better than flapping about a womans age what else he flap about declan gave his breakfast his undivided attention this is really great what do you put in this stuff she said nothing for a full ten seconds i see men just cant stop themselves from crowing about their sexual exploits uneasy for himself and his friend declan replied it wasnt like that it was nostalgic and it was sweet you meant something to him you still do its a good thing for him i know that and that i feel the same do you remember the first girl you got into the backseat declan do you remember her fondly sherry bingham a pretty little blond i loved her desperately through most of my junior year in high school she liked him for coming out with a name instantly even if hed made it up what happened she dumped me for a football player left tackle jesus a football player with no neck and the iq of a pencil im still pissed off at her but to get back to you and by the way youre really good at deflecting personal questions but i was a lawyer anyway how did you manage to pull it off twentythrees pretty young to establish a business one thats proven itself out when most go under within three years she leaned back what difference does it make counselor okay he shrugged and kept eating ill just assume you robbed a bank paid off the mob seduced then murdered the previous owner after he left you the building in his will and continue to run illegal gambling and prostitutes out of the back room why ive been so busy but i like your version better mines very dull in comparison i worked after school and summers saved my pennies im very good at saving pennies if i need to then i worked tending bar serving drinks and went to business school parttime just before i turned twentytwo my grandpapa died fell off a ladder broke his damn fool neck her eyes filled as she said it guess im still pissed off at him im sorry he covered her hand with his you were close i loved him more than any man in the world pete simone with his big laugh and his big hands he played the fiddle and always carried a red bandanna always well she blinked away the tears he had an insurance policy bigger than it ought to have been considering half for me half for grandmama in the end she made me take all of it nothing you can do to change her mind when she digs her heels in so i invested the money and a year later i opened my place theres nothing dull about that you run a good bar lena yes i do she rose picked up the plates youd best get yourself dressed cher if you want a ride home he couldnt talk her into coming inside he had to settle for a mindnumbing kiss before she pushed him out of her car and drove away arriving home at nine in the morning in a wrinkled suit gained him a grin and a wink from big frank as the man carted dead tree limbs to a burn pile you fell into some luck last night mister dec into something declan thought and rubbing his heart went into the house to get to work she wouldnt see him that night or the next he had to content himself with phone calls that made him feel like a teenager as he wandered the house with his portable phone and rattled his brains for any conversational ploy that would keep her on the line mardi gras celebrations and business were under way she told him while they were she didnt have time to come out and play he knew when he was being tested and stalled and tangled and decided hed let her string out his line until he reeled her in remy dropped by one afternoon wearing hugo boss and gold beads he took the beads off tossed them over declans head when you coming into town i thought i might join the insanity over the weekend cher its mardi gras every nights the weekend not out here come take a look he led the way into the parlor where tibald was high on a ladder patiently detailing the ceiling plasterwork hey tibald remy hooked his thumbs into his pockets and craned his neck back thats some job it surely is hows effie doing these days driving me to drink with wedding plans picked out the cake yesterday and youd think it was a matter of life and death whether it has yellow rosebuds or fullblown roses around the edges best thing a man can do in these situations is nod at whatever she likes best and just show up on the day you mightve said something of that nature before i told her i liked the big fat roses when it turned out she had her mind set on the buds he pulled a small bottle of tylenol out of his pocket you got something i can down this with dec that womans given me the mother of all headaches declan picked up a halfempty bottle of water did you come out here to hide till she cools off gulping down the pills and water remy wandered over the drop cloth you do these walls in here dec or you hire them out i did them pleased declan ran his fingers over the smooth surface of the paris green walls spent the last three days on this room and nights he thought i think this color will make the room seem cooler than a patterned paper and i like the way it looks with the trim youre a regular bob vila and martha stewart combined what do you tackle next the library still some details to deal with in here and the kitchen but the librarys on the slate for next week after that im hoping to move outside for a while give me a couple of those aspirin sure remy handed over the pills and the water you got work problems or female problems a little of both come out on the back gallery take a look at what the franks have done with the rear gardens heard you escorted our lena around in a big white limo a few nights ago remy said as they walked toward the back of the house classy stuff im a classy guy he handed the water back to remy and opened the french doors of the dining room you got romancing her in mind thats a good start ive got more than that in mind declan said as remy tipped back the bottle im going to marry her water spewed out as remy choked pretty good spit take declan commented keep the bottle jesus dec jesus christ you and lena are getting married id like to have the wedding here in the fall september maybe he scanned his gallery his gardens he wondered what kind of bird it was that was currently singing its lungs out the place wont be finished but thatd be part of the charm of course if it takes me longer to pin her down we could do it next spring thats some fast work not really its just a matter of keeping at it he smiled now as he studied remys baffled face oh you dont mean the house lena i havent asked her yet shed just say no look out there bulbs coming up daffodils tulips calla lilies the franks tell me buried under all those weeds and vines maybe blooming under it for years thats something dec i think you need something stronger than tylenol im not crazy im in love with her im starting to think i was in love with her before i even met her thats why there was never anyone else who really mattered not like this because she was here and i just hadnt found her yet maybe i need something stronger bourbons in the kitchen ice is in the cooler new frig is due to come in tomorrow im fixing us both a drink make mine short and weak dec told him absently ive got work to do yet today remy brought back two glasses and took a long sip of his as he studied declans face declan i love you like a brother i know you do so im going to talk to you like i would a brother if i had one instead of being plagued with sisters you think ive lost my mind no in some situations hell in most situations a man thinks with his dick by the time that thought process works all the way to his head he usually sees that situation more clearly i appreciate you explaining that to me dad remy only shook his head and paced up and down the gallery lenas a very sexy woman no argument there she just sort of exudes those pheromones or whatever the hell they are the way other women do the perfume they splash on to get a man stirred up she stirs you up just by breathing youre trying to tell me im infatuated or in the heavy wave of first lust exactly remy laid a supportive hand on declans shoulder not a man alive would blame you for it add to that son youve had a rough few months on the relationship train and knowing the way you cart guilt around like it was your personal treasure chest i dont imagine youve been clearing your pipes regular since you broke it off with jennifer jessica you asshole amused touched declan leaned back on the baluster its not infatuation i thought it was with a good dose of that lust tossed in but thats not it its not a matter of clogged pipes and im not thinking with my dick its my heart oh brother remy took another good gulp of whiskey dec you havent been down here a full month yet people are always saying something like that as if time is a factor and because the critical part of his brain had said the same thing he was irritated to hear the sentiment from his closest friend what is there a law somewhere that states you cant fall in love until a reasonable rational period of time has passed during which the parties will socialize communicate and if possible engage in sexual intercourse in order to assure compatibility if there is and it worked explain the divorce rate a couple of lawyers stand here debating the subject well be here till next tuesday then let me say this ive never felt like this before never in my life i didnt think i could i figured something inside me just didnt work the way it was supposed to well for christs sake dec i couldnt love jessica the guilt slid back into his voice i just couldnt and i tried to i damn near settled for affection respect and mutual backgrounds because i thought it was all id get or be able to give but its not ive never felt like this remy he said again and i like it if you want lena then i want her for you the thing is dec no matter how you feel it doesnt guarantee shes going to feel the same maybe shell break my heart but feeling too much is a hell of a lot better than feeling nothing hed been telling himself that repeatedly since hed realized he was in love with her one way or the other ive got to try he swirled the whiskey hed yet to drink she doesnt know what to make of me declan murmured its going to be fun letting her find out that night he heard weeping a mans raw and broken sobs declan tossed in sleep weighed down with the grief unable to stop it unable to give or seek comfort even when silence came the sorrow stayed bayou rouse march he didnt know why he came here to stare at the water while thick green shadows spread around him as night gathered to eat away at the day but he came time and again to wander through the marsh as if he would somehow come upon her strolling along the curve of the river where the swamp flowers blossomed she would smile at him hold out her hand and everything would be right again nothing would ever be right again he was afraid he was going mad that grief was darkening his mind as night darkened the day how else could he explain how he could hear her whispering to him in the night what could he do but shut off the sound of her the pain of her he watched a blue heron rise from the reeds like a ghost beautiful pure perfect to skim over the teacolored water and glide into the trees away from him always away from him she was gone his abby had winged away from him like the ghost bird everyone said it his family his friends hed heard the servants whispering about it how abigail rouse had run off with some noaccount and left her husband and bastard baby daughter behind though he continued to look in new orleans in baton rouge in lafayette though he continued to haunt the bayou like a ghost himself in the loneliest hours of the night he believed it shed left him and the child now he was leaving in all but body he walked through each day like a man in a trance and god help him he could not be a father to the child that image of abigail he secretly shamefully doubted carried his blood just looking at her brought him unspeakable sorrow he no longer went up to the nursery he hated himself for it but even the act of climbing the stairs to the third floor was like drowning in a sea of despair they said the child wasnt his no in the dimming light of dusk with the night coming alive around him lucian covered his face with his hands no he could not would not believe that of her they had made the child together in love in trust in desire if even that was a lie he lowered his hands stepped toward the water it would be warm as her smile had been warm soft as her skin had been soft even now the color was deepening and was almost the color of her eyes lucian he froze on the slippery edge abby she was rushing toward him pushing through the fronds of a willow with her hair spilling over her shoulders in midnight curls his heart deadened with grief woke in one wild leap then the last shimmer of sunlight fell over her face and he died again claudine gripped his hands fear made her fingers cold shed seen what had been in his eyes and it had been his death she would never want this she would never want you to damn your soul by taking your life she left me no no that isnt true they lie to you they lie lucian she loved you she loved you and marie rose above all things then where is she the rage that lived under the numbness of his grief leaped out he gripped claudines arms hauled her to her toes part of him some dark secret part wanted to pound his fists into her face erase it for its connection to abigail and his own drowning despair where is she dead she shouted it and her voice rang in the warm sticky air they killed her death is the only way she would leave you and rosie he shoved her aside staggered away to lean against the trunk of a live oak thats just another madness i tell you i know it i feel it ive had dreams so did i tears stung his eyes turned the light watery so did i have dreams lucian you must listen i was there that night she came to the nursery to tend the baby ive known abby since we were babies ourselves there was nothing in her but love for you and marie rose i should never have left the hall that night claudine crossed her hands over her breast as if to hold together the two halves of her broken heart the rest of my life ill beg her forgiveness for not being there she took clothes jewelry my mother is right he firmed his lips on what he believed was an act of strength but was only his weakened faith i have to accept your mama hated abby she kicked me out the next day shes afraid to keep me in the house afraid i might find out was he whirled around his face so contorted with fury claudine stepped away you want me to believe my mother somehow killed my wife then disguised the crime the sin the horror by making it appear abby ran away i dont know what happened but i know abby didnt leave mama rouse she went to evangeline lucian waved a hand turned away again voodoo nonsense evangelines got power she said there was blood and pain and fear and a dark dark sin death she said and a watery grave she said you got two halves and one is black as a cave in hell i killed her then i came home in the night and murdered my wife two halves lucian that shared one womb look to your brother the chill stabbed through him bringing a raw sickness to the belly a vile roaring in his head i wont listen to any more of this go home claudine keep away from the hall he dug into his pocket took out the watch pin pressed it into claudines hand take this keep it for the child he could no longer call her by name she should have something that was her mothers he stared down grieving at the symbol in her hand time had stopped for abigail you kill her again by not believing in her stay away from me he staggered away toward manet hall toward his chosen hell stay away you know claudine shouted after him you know she was true clutching the watch to her breast claudine vowed to pass it and the truth along to abigails daughter manet hall february from his gallery declan watched the day come to life dawn was a rosy blush on the eastern sky with hints of mauve like sleepy bruises just beneath the air was warming he could feel the rise of it almost every day it wasnt yet march but winter was bowing out the gardens that a month before had been a sorrowful wreck showed hints of their former grandeur strangling vines invasive weeds deadwood and broken bricks had been hauled away revealing foot by foot the wandering paths the shrubs even the bulbs and plants that had been too stubborn to die away an old iron arbor was wild with what the franks told him was wisteria and there was an island of massive azaleas that showed the beginning of hopeful buds he had magnolia crape myrtle camellia jasmine hed written down everything he could remember the franks reeled off in their lazy voices when hed described the vine he imagined on the corner columns theyd told him what he wanted was morning glory he liked the sound of it mornings here were full of glory he thought his body was adjusting to the five or six hours of disturbed sleep a night he was able to snatch or maybe it was just nervous energy that was fueling him something was pushing him driving him step by step through the transformation of the house that was his yet somehow not only his if it was abigail hovering she was a damn fickle female there were times he felt utterly comfortable totally at peace and others when cold fear prickled the back of his neck times when he felt in his gut he was being watched stalked well that was a woman for you he thought as he sipped his morning coffee all smiles one minute and slaps the next even as he thought it he saw lena and the big black dog step out of the trees he didnt think twice but set his coffee aside and started for the gallery steps shed seen him long before hed seen her from the shelter of the trees and morning mists shed stood idly rubbing rufuss head and had studied the house studied him what was it about the place and the man that pulled at her so she wondered there were any number of great old houses here along the river road on toward baton rouge god knew there were any number of goodlooking men if a woman was in the market for one but it was this house that had always snagged her interest and imagination now it seemed it was this man jogging down the thick stone stairs in a ratty shirt rattier jeans his face rough with the nights beard who had managed to do the same she didnt like to want it got in the way of things and when that want involved a man well it was just bound to mess up your life shed built her life brick by goddamn brick and she liked it just as it was a man no matter how amiable he was would at best alter the design at worst hed send those bricks tumbling down to ruin shed kept away from him since the night shed taken him into her bed just to prove she could but she had a smile ready for him now a slow catatthemousehole smile and stood her ground as the dog raced over tearing through the ground fog to meet him rufus leaped slopped his tongue over declans face then collapsed belly up for a rub it was lena knew rufuss way of showing unconditional love charms dogs too she thought as declan crouched down to rub and wrestle the man had entirely too much appeal for anybodys good especially hers rufus she called out bringing the dog to his feet in a flurry of muscle and limbs that nearly put declan on his ass and laughing she tossed the ball she carried high in the air nipped it handily on its fall rufus charged her a blur of black fur and enthusiasm she hurled the ball over the pond rufus sailed up over the water and nabbed the ball with his teeth seconds before his massive splash the bo sox could use you two as the dog paddled his way to shore declan strode up cupped his hands under lenas elbows and lifted her off her feet he had an instant to see her blink in surprise before he covered her mouth with his and took her under she gripped his shirt not for balance though her feet were dangling several inches off the ground but because he was under it all that muscle and heat and man she heard the dog bark three deep throaty rumbles then the water he shook off himself drenched her she wouldnt have been surprised if it had steamed off her skin morning declan said and dropped her back on her feet where yat woo she had to give him credit for both greetings and pushed a hand through her hair where yat she responded then reached up and rubbed a hand over his rough cheek need a shave cher if id known youd come walking my way this morning id have taken care of that i wasnt walking your way she picked up the ball rufus had dropped at her feet and sent it and the dog flying again just playing with my grandmamas dog is she all right you said you stayed over with her when she wasnt feeling well she gets the blues sometimes is all and damn it damn it his instant and genuine concern touched her missing her pete she was seventeen when they got married and fiftyeight when he died moren forty years is a long time to mesh lives would she like it if i went by later she likes your company because rufus was thumping his tail impatiently she winged the ball again you said she has a sister any other family two sisters a brother all still living children her face shut down im all shes got there you been into town for any of the partying off limits he decided he let it go for the moment not yet i figured id go in tonight are you working nothing but work till ash wednesday people do like to drink before lent comes late hours for you you look a little tired i dont much care for being up this early but grandmama shes an early bird shes up everybodys up she lifted her arms high stretched youre an early bird yourself arent you cher these days why dont you come back to the house with me have some coffee see what ive been doing with my time since i havent been able to spend any with you ive been busy so you said her brows knit forming a long shallow line of annoyance between them i say what i mean i didnt say different but im making you edgy i dont mind that lena he reached out to tug on her hair amused and delighted to see temper darken her face but i would mind if you think id settle for one night with you i sleep with you if i want when i want and id mind he continued mildly though the hand that gripped her arm before she could spin away was very firm id mind a great deal if you think all i want is to get you in the sheets men dont touch me unless i tell them they can touch me she shoved at his hand youve never dealt with me before have you there was steel in his fingers in his tone just simmer down picking a fight isnt going to shake me loose either you wanted to keep your distance this week okay im a patient man lena but im not a doormat dont think youre going to walk over me on your way out the door anger she realized wasnt the way to handle him she had no doubt she could scrape away at that control and stir him up into a good shouting match of a fight it would be interesting even entertaining but she had a fiftyfifty chance of losing it she didnt care for the odds instead she stroked a hand over his cheek aw now cher her voice was liquid silk what you getting so het up about you got me irritable thats all im not at my best so early in the day and here you being all tough and surly i dont mean to hurt your feelings she rose on her toes and kissed his cheek what do you mean to do angelina there was something about the way he used her whole name that put her back up a kind of warning now declan honey i like you i truly do and the other night why you just about swept me off my feet we had ourselves a real good time too didnt we but you dont want to be making more out of it than it was what was it she lifted her shoulders a very satisfying interlude for both of us why dont we leave it at that and be friends again we could or we could try it this way he yanked her to him dragged her up to her toes and plundered her mouth no patience this time no reason no dreamy mating of lips it was a branding and they both knew it rufus gave a warning growl as she struggled even when the growl turned to a snarl declan ignored it he fisted a hand in her hair pulled her head back and took them both deeper temper hurt and hunger all stormed inside him and flavored the kiss she couldnt resist it not when the punch of emotions slammed into her system liberating needs shed hoped to lock down on a muffled oath she wrapped her arms around his neck and met the ferocity of the kiss with a whine rufus settled down to chew at the ball were not done with each other declan ran proprietary hands down her arms maybe not ill come in tonight take you home after you close wednesday after things quiet down id like you to come out here well have dinner she managed to smile you cooking he grinned touched his lips to her brow ill surprise you you usually do she retorted when he walked away she was irritated with herself not just for losing a battle but for cowardice it was cowardice that had pushed her to start the fight in the first place she trudged through the marsh while rufus raced into the trees through the thick green undergrowth in hopes of scaring up a rabbit or a squirrel she stopped at the curve of what had been known as far back as memory stretched as bayou rouse this mysterious place with its slowmoving shadowy water its cypress bones and thick scents was as much her world as the crooked streets and lively pace of the quarter shed run in this world as a child learned the difference between a wren and a sparrow how to avoid a copperhead nest by its cucumber whiff how to drop a line and pull up a catfish for supper it was the home of her blood as the quarter had become the home of her ambition she didnt come back to it only when her grandmother was feeling blue but when she herself was she caught a glimpse of the knobby snout of an alligator sliding by it was she thought what was under the surface that could take you down one quick ugly snap if you werent alert and didnt keep your wits about you there was a great deal under the surface of declan fitzgerald shed have preferred if hed been some spoiled rich trustfund baby out on a lark she couldve enjoyed him and dismissed him when they were both bored it was a great deal more difficult to dismiss what you respected she admired his strength his purpose his humor as a friend he would give her a great deal of pleasure as a lover he worried the hell out of her he wanted too much she could already feel him sucking her in and it scared her scared her that she didnt seem able to stop the process toying with the key around her neck she started back toward the bayou house it would run its course she told herself things always did she pasted on a smile as she neared the house and saw her grandmother shaded by an old straw hat fussing in her kitchen garden i smell bread baking lena called out brown bread got a loaf in there you can take home with you odette straightened pressed a hand lightly to the small of her back got an extra you could take on by the hall for that boy he doesnt eat right hes healthy enough healthy enough to want a bite outta you she bent back to her work her sturdy work boots planted firm he try to take one this morning youve got that look about you lena walked over dropped down on the step beside the garden patch what look is that the look a woman gets when a mans had his hands on her and didnt finish the job i know how to finish the job myself if thats the only problem with a snorting laugh odette broke off a sprig of rosemary she pinched at its needle leaves waved it under her nose for the simple pleasure of its scent why scratch an itch if someonell scratch it for you i may be close to looking seventy in the eye but i know when i see a man whos willing and able sex doesnt run my life grandmama no but it sure would make it more enjoyable she straightened again youre not lilibeth t poulette the use of the childhood endearment little chicken made lena smile i know it not being her doesnt mean you have to be alone if you find somebody who lights the right spark in you she took the rosemary odette offered brushed it against her cheek i dont think hes looking for a spark i think hes looking for a whole damn bonfire she leaned back on her elbows shook back her hair ive lived this long without getting burned and im going to keep right on it always was right or left for you couldnt drive you to middle ground with a whip youre my baby even if you are a grown woman so ill say this nothing wrong with a woman walking alone as long as its for the right reasons being afraid she might trip thats a wrong one what happens if i let myself fall for him lena demanded then he has enough of swamp water and trots on back to boston or he just has his fill of dancing with me and finds himself another partner odette pushed her hat back on the crown of her head and her face was alive with exasperation what happens if it rains a flood and washes us into the mississippi pity sakes lena you cant think that way itll dry you up i was doing fine before he came along and ill do fine after he goes feeling sulky she reached down to pet rufus when he butted his head against her knee that house over there grandmama that house hes so set on bringing back its a symbol of what happens when two people dont belong in the same place im her blood and i know you dont know odette tipped back lenas chin if they hadnt loved if abby rouse and lucian manet hadnt loved and made a child together you and i wouldnt be here if theyd been meant she wouldnt have died the way she did she wouldnt be a ghost in that house oh chhre both the exasperation and all the affection colored odettes voice it isnt abby rouse who haunts that place who then i expect thats what that boys there to find out might be youre here to help him she gave a sniff of the air breads done she said an instant before the oven buzzer sounded you want to take a loaf over to the hall lena set her jaw no all right then odette walked up the steps opened the back door maybe ill take him one myself her eyes were dancing when she glanced over her shoulder and could be ill steal him right out from under your nose declan had every door and window on the first level open ry cooder blasted out of his stereo with his lunging rhythm and blues working to the beat declan spread the first thin coat of varnish on the newly sanded floor of the parlor everything ached every muscle and bone in his body sang with the same ferocity as ry cooder hed thought the sheer physical strain of the sanding would have worked off his temper now he was hoping the necessary focus and strain of the varnishing would do the job the rosy dawn hadnt lived up to its promise the woman pushed his buttons he thought and she knew it one night shed wrapped herself all over him in bed and the next she wont give him more than some conversation on the phone snaps out in temper one minute melts down to sexy teasing the next trying to turn the night theyd spent together into the classic onenight stand fuck that aw cher what you wanna get all het up about he muttered you havent seen het up baby but youre going to before this is done you look to be in the middle of a mad he spun around slopping varnish then nearly went down to his knees when he saw odette smiling at him from the doorway i didnt hear you come in not surprising with the privilege of age she leaned down and turned down the volume on his portable stereo as cooder switched pace lamenting falling teardrops like cooder myself but not that loud brought you by a loaf of the brown bread i baked this morning you go on and finish what youre doing ill put it back in the kitchen for you just give me a minute you dont have to stop on my account cher no please five minutes theres something i forget what to drink in the fridge why dont you go on back help yourself i believe i will its a bit close out already and not even march you take your time when hed finished up enough to join her odette was standing in front of his kitchen display cabinet studying the contents my mama had an old waffle iron just like this and i still got a cherry seeder like the one you got in here what do they call these dishes here i cant remember fiestaware thats it always sounds like a party you pay money for these old mason jars cher im afraid so she clucked her tongue at the wonder of it theres no accounting for things damn if they dont look pretty though you come look through my shed sometime see if theres anything in there you want she turned now nodded at the room this is fine declan you did fine itll come together when the counters are in and i finish the panels for the appliances its fine she said again and the parlor where youre working its as lovely as it can be ive already bought some of the furniture for it a little ahead of myself would you like to sit down miss odette for a minute or two ive got something from the house you might like to have maybe put on the mantel in the parlor or one of the other rooms she took a seat at the table hed moved in and pulled an old brown leather frame from a bag its a photograph a portrait of abigail rouse declan took it and gazed down on the woman who haunted his dreams it might have been lena he thought but there was too much softness too much yet unformed in this face her cheeks were rounder her longlidded eyes too gullible and far too shy so young he mused and innocent despite the grownup walking dress with its high fur trimmed collar despite the jaunty angle of the velvet toque with its saucy feathers this was a girl he reflected where lena was a woman she was lovely declan said lovely and young it breaks your heart my grandmama thought she was round about eighteen when this was taken couldntve been more as she never saw her nineteenth birthday as she spoke a door slammed upstairs as if in temper odette merely glanced toward the ceiling sounds like your ghosts got mad on too that just started happening today plumbers kid shot out of here like a bullet a couple hours ago you dont look like youre going anywhere no he sat across from her as another door slammed and looked back down at abigail rouse manets shy hopeful smile im not going anywhere there was a madness about mardi gras the music the masks the mayhem all crashing together into a desperate sort of celebration managed to create a tone that was both gleefully innocent and rawly sexual he doubted the majority of the tourists who flocked here for the event understood or cared about the purpose of it that rush to gorge on pleasures before the forty days of fasting wanting a taste of it himself declan opted to wander through the crowds even snagged some beads when they were tossed in a glitter of cheap gold from one of the galleries his ears rang with the blare of brass the wild laughter he decided the sight of naked breasts which a couple of coeds flashed as they followed tradition and jerked up their shirts would be less alarming after a couple of drinks as would being grabbed by a total stranger and being treated to a tonsildiving kiss the tongue currently invading his mouth transferred the silly sweetness of many hurricanes and happily drunken lust onto his thanks he managed when he freed himself come on back here the masked female shouted laizzez les bon temps rouler he didnt want to let the good times roll when it involved strange tongues plunged into his mouth and escaped into the teeming crowds maybe he was getting old he thought or maybe it was just the boston bedrock but he wanted to get someplace where he could sit back and observe the party rather than being mobbed by it the doors to et trois were flung open so the noise from within poured out and tangled with the noise of the streets he had to weave his way through the revelers on the sidewalk those packed inside and squeeze his way to a standing spot at the bar the place was full of smoke music and the slap of feet on wood as dancers shoehorned together on the dance floor onstage a fiddler streamed out such hot licks declan wouldnt have been surprised to see the bow burst into flame lena was pulling a draft with one hand pouring a shot of bourbon with the other the two other bartenders were equally busy and from what he could see she had four waitresses working the tables he spotted his crawfish grinning from their spot on the shelf behind the bar and was ridiculously pleased beer and a bump she said and slid the glasses into waiting hands when she spotted declan she held up a finger then served three more customers as she worked her way down to him whats your pleasure handsome you are youre packed he added in here and out on the sidewalk banquette she corrected we call them banquettes round here shed pulled her hair back wound purple and gold beads through it the little silver key dangled against skin dewed with perspiration i can give you a drink cher but i dont have time to talk right now can i give you a hand she pushed at her hair with what whatever someone elbowed in shouted out a request for a tequila sunrise and a dixie draft lena reached back for the bottle shifted to pull the draft you know how to bus tables college boy i can figure it out redheaded waitress shes marcella she nodded in the general direction of mayhem tell her youre hired shell show you what to do by midnight he figured hed carted about a half a ton of empties into the kitchen and dumped the equivalent of mount rainier in cigarette butts hed had his ass pinched rubbed ogled what was it with women and the male behind someone ought to do a study on it hed lost track of the propositions and didnt care to think about the enormous woman whod hauled him into her lap it had been like being smothered by a threehundred pound pillow soaked in whiskey by two he was beyond amazement at the human bodys capacity for vice and had revised any previous perception of the skill and endurance required in food service occupations he made sixtythree dollars and eightyfive cents in tips and vowed to burn his clothes at the first opportunity the place was still rolling at three and he decided lena hadnt been avoiding him or if she had shed had a reasonable excuse for it what time do you close he asked when he carted another load toward the kitchen when people go away she poured bottled beer into the plastic togo cups handed them off do they ever she smiled but it was quick and distracted as she scanned the crowd not so much during mardi gras why dont you go on home cher were going to be another hour or more in here i stick he carried the empties into the kitchen and came back in time to see a trio of very drunk men boys really he noted hitting on lena and hitting hard she was handling them but they werent taking the hint if yall want to last till fat tuesday you gotta pace yourself a bit she set togo cups under the taps yall arent driving now are you hell no one wearing a university of michigan tshirt under an avalanche of beads leaned in way in weve got a place right over on royal why dont you come back there with me baby get naked take a spin in the jacuzzi now thats real tempting cher but ive got my hands full ill give you a handful he said and grabbing his own crotch had his two companions howling and hooting declan stepped forward ran a proprietary hand over lenas shoulder youre hitting on my woman he felt her stiffen under his hand saw the surly challenge in the michigan boys eyes under other circumstances declan thought as he sized the kid up sixone a toned oneninety he might be the type to make his bed every morning he might visit old ladies in nursing homes he might rescue small puppies but right now the boy was drunk horny and stupid to prove it michigan bared his teeth why dont you just fuck off or maybe you want to take it outside where i can kick your ass declans voice dripped with bonhomie now why would i want to go outside and fight about it when all youre doing here is admiring my taste spectacular isnt she you didnt try to hit on her id have to figure youre too drunk to see i see just fine fuckface exactly why dont i buy you and your pals a drink honey put those drafts on my tab declan leaned conversationally on the bar nodded toward the tshirt spring break whats your major baffled and boozy michigan blinked at him whatzit to ya just curious declan slid a bowl of pretzels closer took one ive got a cousin teaching there english department eileen brennan maybe you know her professor brennans your cousin the surly tone had turned to surprised fellowship she damn near flunked me last semester shes tough always scares the hell out of me if you run into her tell her dec said hi heres your beer it was past four when lena let them into her apartment over the bar pretty smooth with those college jerks cher smooth enough i wont give you grief for the my woman comment you are my woman you just havent figured it out yet besides they were easy my cousin eileen has a rep at the u of m odds were pretty good hed heard of her some men wouldve flexed their muscles she set her keys aside gone on outside and rolled around in the street to prove who had the biggest dick weary she reached up to tug the beads loose as she studied him i guess its the lawyer in you so you just talk yourself out of a confrontation kid was maybe twentytwo twentyone last january i carded them i dont fight with kids plus i really hate having bare knuckles rammed into my face it seriously hurts he tipped her chin up she looked exhausted had a long one didnt you going to be a long time till wednesday i appreciate the help sugar you pulled your weight more than she thought the man had slid right into the rhythm of her place and worked charmed her customers tolerated the grabhands and avoided a potentially ugly situation by using his wit instead of his ego the longer she knew him she reflected the more there was to know she tugged an envelope out of her back pocket whats this your pay jesus lena i dont want your money you work i pay i dont take free rides she pushed the envelope into his hands off the books though i dont want to do the paperwork okay fine he stuffed it into his own pocket hed just buy her something with it now i guess id better give you a really good tip she wound her arms around his neck slithered her body up his eyes open she nibbled on his lip inching her way into a kiss his hands ran down her sides hooked under her hips then hitched them up until her legs wrapped around his waist you need to get off your feet mmm god yes he nuzzled her neck her ear worked his way back to her mouth as he carried her into the bedroom know what im going to do lust was a low simmer under the bright glory of being off her aching feet i think i have a pretty good notion he laid her on the bed could almost feel her sigh of relief at being horizontal he pried off one of her shoes im going to give you something women long for he tossed the shoe aside then climbing onto the bed removed the other weary or not her face went wicked a sale at saks better he skimmed a finger over her arch a foot rub a what smiling he flexed her foot rubbed her toes and saw her eyes go blurrier yet with pleasure mmmm declan you do have a good pair of hands relax and enjoy the fitzgerald reflexology treatment is world famous we also offer the fullbody massage i bet you do the worst of the aches began to evaporate when he worked his way up to her calves overworked muscles quivered with the combination of pain and pleasure do you take any time off after mardi gras shed been drifting and struggled to focus at the sound of his voice i take ash wednesday off boy what a slacker he tapped a careless kiss to her knee here lets get your clothes off he unbuttoned her jeans she lifted her hips gave a lazy stretch he doubted she realized her voice was husky her words slurring what else you got in mind to rub cher he indulged himself by cupping her breasts enjoyed her easy response the way she combed her fingers through his hair met his lips he tugged her shirt up and away snapped open the front catch of her bra kissed his way down to her breasts while she arched back to offer then he flipped her onto her stomach she jerked groaned then all but melted when he kneaded her neck just as i thought he announced carry most of your tension here me too oh god if shed had a single wish at that moment it wouldve been that he keep doing what he was doing for a full week you could make a good living out of this its always been my fallback career youve got yourself some serious knots here doctor decs going to fix you up i just love playing doctor she waited for him to change the tone for his hands to become demanding he was a sweetheart she thought sleepily but he was a man shed just take herself a little catnap and let him wake her up the next thing she knew the sun was beating through her windows a groggy glance at her bedside clock showed her it was twenty after ten morning she thought blearily how did it get to be morning and she was tucked into bed as tidily as if her grandmother had done the job tucked in alone she rolled over on her back stretched yawned and realized with a kind of mild shock that nothing ached not her neck not her feet not her back doctor dec she mused had done a very thorough job and was probably at home sulking because she hadnt paid his fee hard to blame him when hed been such a sweetie pie and shed done nothing but lie there like a corpse have to make it up to him she told herself and crawled out of bed to put coffee on before she hit the shower she walked into the kitchen stared at the full coffeepot on her counter and the note propped in front of it frowning she picked up the note switched the pot back to warm as she read had to go counter guys coming this morning didnt know when youd surface so i was afraid to leave the pot on but its fresh as of seventen am that is if you end up sleeping round the clock by the way you look pretty when you sleep ill give you a call later declan arent you the strangest thing she muttered as she tapped the note against her palm arent you just a puzzlement she needed to stop into the bar to check on her lunch shift to check on supplies then needing her curiosity satisfied she drove out to manet hall the door was open she imagined he was one of the few whod lived here who would leave that impressive front door open to whoever might wander in country living or no someone should put a bug in his ear about a security system she could hear the racket of workmen from the back of the house but took her time getting there the parlor grabbed her attention she crouched down touched her fingers to the glossy floors and found them hard and dry and stepping in just looked he took care was all she could think he took care of what was his paid attention to details and made them matter color and wood the elegant fireplace the gleam of the windows which she imagined hed washed personally just as she imagined he would furnish this room personally and with care and attention to detail shed never known a man to take so much bother she supposed with anything or anyone and maybe she was forced to admit shed spent too much time with the wrong kind of man what do you think she turned and framed by the windows by the light looked at him as he stood in the doorway i think this house is lucky to have you i think you see it as it should be and youll work to make it come to life again thats nice he crossed to her thats very nice you look rested a mans not supposed to tell a woman she looks rested hes supposed to tell her she looks gorgeous ive never seen you look otherwise today you look rested on top of it you are the smoothie she wandered away toward the fireplace she trailed a palm over the mantel stopped when she came to the brown leather frame holding the photograph of a young woman abigail she whispered and the ache went into her went deep miss odette gave it to me you look like her a little no i never looked as innocent as this compelled lena traced a fingertip over the young hopeful face shed seen the photograph before had even studied it point by point during a period in her life when shed found the story the mystery of it romantic during a period when she herself had been young enough to see romance in tragedy its odd lena said seeing her here seeing part of me here she belongs here so do you she shook that off and the sorrow those dark clear eyes coated over her heart turning she gave declan a long considering look work clothes she thought tool belt a nights stubble it was getting harder and harder to picture him wearing a pinstriped suit and carrying a fancy leather briefcase it was getting harder and harder to picture her life without him in it why did you leave my place this morning didnt you see the note counter guys he jerked a thumb back toward the kitchen i had to beg and pay extra to get them to schedule me for a saturday morning i had to be here thats not what i meant you didnt come into the city work what was it about six hours busing tables and give me a foot rub because you didnt have anything better to do on a friday night you came in for sex cher and you left without it why is that he could feel his temper prick holes in his easy mood youre a piece of work lena youve got a real talent for turning something simple into the complicated thats because things are rarely as simple as they look okay lets clear it up i came into the city because i wanted to see you i bused tables because i wanted to help you i rubbed your feet because i figured youd been on them about twelve hours straight then i let you sleep because you needed to sleep hasnt anyone ever done you a favor men dont as a rule unless theyre looking for one in return whatre you looking for declan he gave himself a moment waiting for the first lash of anger to pass you know thats insulting if youre worried about your payforwork ethic i can spare about twenty minutes now we can go up have sex even the score otherwise ive got a lot to do i didnt mean to insult you but she saw quite clearly she had i just dont understand you the men ive known on an intimate level would have been irritated by what didnt happen between us this morning i expected you to be and i wouldnt have blamed you i wouldve understood that its harder for you to understand that i could care about you enough to put sex on the back burner so you could get a few hours sleep yes maybe thats not insulting maybe thats just sad he saw the color deepen in her cheeks as the words hit her embarrassed color he realized everything doesnt boil down to sex for me it helps things percolate but its not all thats in the pot i like knowing where i stand if you dont know where you stand you cant decide if thats where you want to be or which direction youd like to go from there and im fucking up your compass you could say that good im a pretty agreeable guy lena but im not going to be lumped in with others youve dealt with in fact you wont deal with me at all well deal with each other because thats the way you want it because thats the way it is his tone was flat final nothing between us is like or going to be like anything either of us has had before you may need some time to get used to that is this how you get your way she demanded by listing off the rules in that annoyingly reasonable tone facts not rules he corrected in what he imagined she would consider that annoyingly reasonable tone and its only annoying because youd be more confident having a fight weve already eaten into the twenty minutes we couldve earmarked for sex good sex or a good fight take time im going to have to take a rain check on both she stared at him tried to formulate any number of withering remarks then just gave up and laughed well when you cash in your rain checks lets do the fight first then we can have makeup sex thats like a bonus works for me do you have to get right back or have you got a few minutes i could use a hand hauling in and unrolling the rug ive got for in here i was going to snag one of the counter guys but with what im paying them id as soon they stick with the counters pinching pennies now and you with all those big tubs of money you dont keep big tubs of money if you let yourself get hosed besides this way id get to keep you here and look at you a little while longer thats clever and the fact was she wanted to stay wanted to be with him all right ill help you with your rug before i go where is it next parlor he gestured to the connecting doors ive got most of what ive bought so far stuffed in here im working in the library next so i can clean out what goes in the front parlor and in there before i start on this one lena moved to the pocket doors he opened then just goggled aladdins cave she thought outfitted by a very rich madman with very eclectic taste tables sofas carpets lamps and what her grandmother would call doodads were spread everywhere god almighty declan when did you get all this a little here a little there i tell myself no but i dont listen anyway he began to pick his way through the narrow aisles his purchases formed its a big house it needs lots of stuff i thought about sticking with the era when the house was originally built then i decided id get bored i like to mix things up she spotted a brass hippo on what she tagged as a hepplewhite side table mission accomplished look at this lamp he ran his fingers over the shade of a tiffany that exploded with gem colors ive got a weakness for lamps cher looking round here id say youve got a weakness for every damn thing i sure have one for you heres the rug he patted the long rolled carpet leaning against the wall i think we can drag it snake it through i shouldve put it closer to the door but i wasnt sure where i was going to use it when i bought it now i am between them they managed to slide it to the floor then with declan walking bent over and backward they wove it around the islands of furniture he had to stop once to move a sofa again to shove a table aside you know lena said as they both went down on their knees panting a little in the parlor in a couple months youre going to be rolling this up again nobody leaves rugs down through the summer around here too damn hot ill worry about that in june she sat back on her heels patted his cheek cher youre going to start thinking summer before aprils over okay she pushed up her sleeves put her palms on the roll ready on their hands and knees they bumped along pushing the carpet revealing the pattern she could catch only glimpses of the colors and texture but it was enough to see why he wanted it here the greens of leaves were soft like the walls and blended with faded pink cabbage roses against a deeper green background once it was unrolled she got to her feet to study the effect while he fussed with squaring it up you bought yourself a rose garden declan i can almost smell them great huh really works in here im going to use the two american empire sofas and i think the biedermeier table start with those then see he looked up at the ceiling medallion i saw this great chandelier blown glass very dale chuhuly i shouldve bought it why dont we see how your sofas do first hmm oh theyre heavy ill get remy to give me a hand with them later hes supposed to come by im here now i dont want you to hurt yourself she merely shot him a look and started back into his makeshift storeroom theyd just set the second one in place shed only stepped back to ponder the arrangement when she heard the baby crying she glanced over at declan but he seemed lost in thought did one of your counter men bring a baby with him she asked and declan closed his eyes sank down on the sofa you hear it nobody else hears it the doors slamming yeah and water running when theres nobody in the room to turn on the taps but nobody hears the baby a chill whipped up her back had her glancing uneasily toward the hallway where is it the nursery mostly sometimes in the bedroom on the second floor abigails room but usually the nursery it stops when i get to the door remys been here twice when it started he didnt hear it but you do i have to see i cant stand hearing a baby crying that way she walked into the foyer started up the stairs and it stopped for an instant it seemed the whole house hushed then she heard the clamor from the kitchen the stream of music from a radio the hum of mens voices as they worked thats so strange she stood on the staircase one hand on the banister and her heart thumping i was thinking i wanted to pick up the baby people say you need to let babies cry but i dont know why they should i was thinking that and she stopped crying its weird isnt it that you were thinking about picking up your greatgreatgrandmother its marie rose he said when lena turned on the stairs to look down at him im sure of it maybe you can hear her because youre blood i guess i can because i own the house i have a call in to the previous owners i wanted to ask them but they havent gotten back to me they may not tell you well they cant tell me if i dont ask does it scare you she looked up the stairs again and asked herself the same question i guess it should but no it doesnt its fascinating i think was she broke off as a door slammed upstairs well no baby did that so saying she ran upstairs lena but she was already rounding the curve to the landing and gave him no choice but to bolt after her marching down the hall she flung doors open as she reached abigails room the cold swept in the shock of it had her breath huffing out mesmerized by the vapor it caused she wrapped her arms tightly over her chest this isnt like the baby she whispered no its angry when he laid his hands on her shoulders to warm her to draw her away the door slammed in their faces she jumped she couldnt help it and heard the nerves in her own strangled laugh not very hospitable this ghost of yours thats the first time ive seen it there was a hard lump at the base of his throat his heart declan thought as he took two steadying breaths whoever it is was is seriously pissed off its abigails room we cajuns can have fierce tempers if were riled it just doesnt feel like a girls anger not that pretty young thing in the photograph downstairs a lot you know about girls then cher excuse me i have a sister and she can be mean as a scalded cat i meant it feels more fullblown more vicious somebody killed me and buried my body in some unmarked grave id be feeling pretty vicious lena made herself reach out grip the icy knob it wont turn declan laid his hand over hers the cold swept out again the knob turned easily and when they opened the door there was only an empty room full of sunlight and shadows its a little scary isnt it but she stepped over the threshold yeah a little bit you know what i think cher what i think that anybody who stays in the house alone night after night who goes out and buys rugs and tables and lamps for it she turned around and slid her arms around his waist i think a man who does that has big steel balls yeah reading invitation he lowered his head and kissed her i could probably carve out another twenty minutes for that sex now she laughed and gave him a hard hug sorry sugar ive got to get on back saturday nights coming on but if you happened to be in the neighborhood say at three four in the morning i think i could stay awake long enough to she cupped her hand between his legs and stroked over denim stay awake long enough to give those big steel balls a workout he managed not to whimper but it was a close call wednesday he told her when youre clear she still had her hand between his legs could feel the hard line of him wednesday when youre clear but he did crush his mouth to hers to give her some taste of what he was feeling come out here well have dinner and stay he backed her against the wall used his teeth on her stay the night i want you in my bed wednesday tell me youll come out and be with me all right she wiggled free another few minutes of that she thought they wouldnt wait till wednesday and shed have him right here on the floor i have to get back i shouldnt have stayed so long she looked up and down the hall as she stepped out of the room i dont believe ive ever spent the night in a haunted house what time should i come by early i might do that too you dont need to see me to the door cher she sent him a wicked grin walkings got to be a little bit of a problem for you shape youre in just now you come on into the bar if you change your mind she laid a fingertip on her lips kissed it then pointed it at him like a gun before she walked away it was an apt gesture declan thought there were times a look from her was as lethal as a bullet all he had to do was hold out until wednesday then he could get shot again rain moved in saturday night and camped out like a squatter through the rest of the weekend it kept declan inside and kept him alone with blind lemon jackson playing on his stereo he started preliminary work on the library he built a fire as much for cheer as warmth then found himself sitting on the hearth running a finger over the chipped tile maybe hed leave it as it was not everything should be perfect accidents should be accepted and the character of them absorbed he wanted to bring the house to life again but did he want to put it back exactly the way it had been hed already changed things and the changes made it his if he had the tile replaced was he honoring the history of the hall or re creating it it hadnt been a happy home the thought ran through him like a chill though his back was to the snapping fire a cold cold house full of secrets and anger and envy death she wanted a book reading was a delight to her a slow and brilliant delight the sight of the library with row after row after row of books made her think of the room as reverently as she did church now with lucian closeted with his father in the study going over the business of land and crops and the rain drumming against the windows she could indulge herself in a quiet afternoon of reading she wasnt quite accustomed to the time to do as she pleased and so slipped into the room as if it were a guilty pleasure she no longer had linens to fold tables to dust dishes to carry she was no longer a servant in this place but a wife wife she hugged the word to her it was still so new so shiny as the life growing inside her was new so new she had yet to tell lucian her curse was late and it was never late shed awakened ill three days running but she would wait another week to speak of it too soon might make it untrue and oh she wanted a child how she wanted to give lucian a child she laid a hand on her belly as she wandered along the shelves and imagined the beautiful son or daughter she would bring into the world and perhaps just perhaps a child would soften lucians mother perhaps a child would bring joy into the house as the hope for one brought joy to her heart she selected austens pride and prejudice the title she thought spoke to her manet hall had so much of both she bit her lip as she flipped through the pages she was a slow painstaking reader but lucian said that only meant she savored the words stumbled over them she thought but she was getting better pleased with herself she turned and saw julian slouched in one of the winecolored chairs a snifter in his hand a bottle by his elbow watching her he frightened her repulsed her but she reminded herself she was no longer a servant she was his brothers wife and should try to be friends hello julian i didnt see you he lifted the bottle poured more brandy into his glass that book he said then drank deep has words of more than one syllable i can read her spine went arrowstraight i like to read what else do you like chhre her fingers tightened on the book when he rose then relaxed again when he strolled to the fireplace rested a boot on the hearth an elbow on the mantel im learning to ride lucians teaching me im not very good yet but i like it oh she wanted to be friends with him the house deserved warmth and laughter and love he laughed and she heard the brandy in it i bet you ride i bet you ride a man into a sweat you may work those innocent eyes on my brother hes always been a fool but i know what you are and what youre after im your brothers wife there had to be a way to take the first step beyond this hate for lucian for the child growing inside her she took it and walked toward julian i only want him to be happy i make him happy youre his blood julian his twin it isnt right that we should be at odds this way i want to try to be your sister your friend he knocked back the rest of the brandy want to be my friend do you yes for lucians sake we should was how friendly are you he lunged toward her grabbed her breasts painfully the shock of it froze her the insult flashed through the shock with a burning heat her hand cracked across his cheek with enough force to send him staggering back bastard animal put your hands on me again ill kill you im lucians im your brothers wife my brothers whore he shouted as she ran for the door cajun slut ill see you dead before you take whats mine by rights raging he shoved away from the mantel the heavy silver candlestick tumbled off smashed against the edge of the tile snapped off the corner declan hadnt moved when he came back to himself he was still sitting on the hearth his back to the snapping fire the rain was still beating on the ground streaming down the windows as it had been he thought during the vision fugue hallucination he pressed the heel of his hand between his eyes where the headache speared like a spike into his skull maybe he didnt have ghosts he thought maybe he had a goddamn fucking brain tumor it would make more sense anything would make more sense slamming doors cold spots even sleepwalking were byproducts of the house he could live with but hed seen those people inside his head heard them there the words the tone more much more disturbing hed felt them his legs were weak nearly gave way under him as he got to his feet he had to grip the mantel his fingers vising on so that he wondered the marble didnt snap if something was wrong with him physically mentally he had to deal with it fitzgeralds didnt bury their heads in the sand when things got tough figuring he was as steady as he was going to get he went into the kitchen to hunt up aspirin which he decided as he shook out four was going to be like trying to piss out a forest fire but he gulped them down then ran the cold glass over his forehead hed fly up to boston and see his uncle his mothers baby brother was a cardiologist but hed know the right neurosurgeon a couple of days some tests and hed know if he was crazy haunted or dying he started to reach for his phone then stopped and shook his head crazy he thought just got one more point if he went to uncle mick word of his potential medical problems would run through the family like an airborne virus besides what was he running back to boston for new orleans had doctors hed get the name of remys he could tell his friend he just wanted to get a doctor a dentist and so on in the area that was logical hed get himself a physical then ask the doctor to recommend a specialist simple straightforward and efficient if ghosts couldnt drive him out of manet hall damn if a brain tumor would as he set the glass down a door slammed on the second floor he simply glanced up at the ceiling and smiled grimly yeah well im in a pretty crappy mood myself by wednesday he had a handle on things again maybe it was the anticipation of seeing lena that lifted his spirits in combination with the work hed managed to get done on those last days before lent he had an appointment with remys doctor the following week and having taken that step was able to put most of the concern about the state of his brain aside there had been no more fugues at least he thought none he was aware of the rain had finally moved on to plague florida and had left him with the first tender trumpets of daffodils scattered along one of his garden paths the morning weather report had detailed a teninch snowfall in boston he immediately called his mother to rub it in sunshine and the tease of spring had him switching gears earlier than hed intended he postponed work on the library and set up outdoors to reinforce the secondfloor gallery to replace damaged boards he listened to ray charles and felt healthy as a horse he was going to have the franks do most of the early planting he decided he just didnt have time but next year hed do his own or as much as he could manage next spring hed sit out here on the gallery on sunday mornings eating beignets drinking cafi au lait with lena long lazy sundays looking out over the lawns the gardens and a few years down the road looking out at the kids in the yards in the gardens he wanted a family of his own and it was good to know it hed never had that need inside him before the need to hold onto the now and look to tomorrow at the same time so he knew it was right what he felt for her what he planned for them hed help her in the bar if she needed it but hed have his own work he turned his hands over studied the palms the calluses hed built the little nicks and scars he looked on as personal medals of valor hed use them his back and his imagination to transform other houses people in the parish would think of declan fitzgerald when they needed a contractor you shouldve seen that old house before he got ahold of it theyd say you need the job done you just call dec hell fix you up the idea made him grin as he ripped out the next rotten board by four hed finished the long front sweep of the gallery floor and stretched out on it belly down to take a break he fell asleep with b b king pleading with lucille and was sleeping still when he rose and walked down the shaky sagging curve of stairs to the front lawn the grass was thick under his feet and the heat of the sun poured over his face beat down on his head despite the hat he wore as protection the others were inside but hed wanted to look at the pond at the lilies hed wanted to sit in the shade of the willow that danced over the water and read he liked the music of the birds and didnt mind the heat so much the heat was honest the air inside the hall was cold and false it was heartbreaking to watch the house he loved rotting away from bitterness he stopped at the edge of the pond looking down at the green plates of the pads the creamy white lilies that graced them he watched a dragonfly whiz by the sun glinting off the wings so it was an iridescent blur he heard the plop of a frog and the call of a cardinal when he heard his name he turned and smiled as his beloved crossed the velvet lawn toward him as long as they were together he thought as long as they loved the hall would stand declan declan alarmed lena gripped his arms and shook shed seen him coming down those treacherous stairs as shed driven down his lane and how hed walked toward the pond in an awkward hesitant gait so unlike his usual easy stride his eyes were open but glazed in a way that made her think he was looking through her and seeing something someone else declan she kept her voice firm and her hands as she took his face in them look at me now hear me its lena lets sit under the willow where no one can see us there was no willow only the rotted stump of one fear tickled the back of her throat but she swallowed it going with instinct she rose up on her toes and laid her lips warmly on his his response was slow dreamy a kind of sliding to her against her into her so she knew the instant he snapped back by the way his body stiffened he started to sway but she held on steady now cher you just hang onto me till you get your legs under you sorry need to sit he dropped straight down on the grass laid his brow on his knees whoa youre okay now youre fine now she knelt beside him brushing at his hair and murmuring in cajun her language of comfort just get your breath back what the hells wrong with me i was on the gallery i was working on the gallery is that the last thing you remember he looked up now over the pond i dont know how i got out here you walked down the stairs the ones on the right of the house i thought you were going to go straight through them her heart still hitched when she thought of how unsteady they were they dont look safe declan you ought to block them off yeah he scrubbed his hands over his face lock myself in a padded room while im at it youre not crazy im sleepwalking in the daylight now im hallucinating im hearing voices that doesnt sound sane to me thats just the yankee talking down here that doesnt even come up to eccentric why my greataunt sissy has whole conversations with her husband joe and hes been dead for twelve years come september nobody thinks shes crazy what do they talk about oh family business current events the weather politics greatuncle joe dearly loved complaining about the government feeling better now cher i dont know what did i do what did you see me do you just came down the stairs and walked across the grass toward the pond you werent walking like you so i knew something was wrong what do you mean youve got a smooth lanky kind of gait and you werent moving like that then you stopped at the pond she didnt tell him shed had one shocked moment when shed been sure he meant to walk straight into the water i kept calling you and finally you turned around and smiled at me her stomach muscles tightened as she remembered but not at me i dont think you were seeing me and you said you wanted to sit under the willow where no one could see us theres no willow here well she pointed toward the stump there was once seems like youre having dreams where maybe you can see things that happened before thats a kind of gift declan where do i return it he shook his head i dont know because i cant remember once i wake up but im starting to think i should tie myself to the bedpost at night i can take care of that for you tonight you trying to cheer me up with bondage fantasies howd i do pretty good he let out a breath then frowned at the smudge on her forehead youve got some soot or something he began and she tipped her head back before he could rub at it those are my holy ashes oh right his brain had definitely gone on holiday ash wednesday i not only dont know where i am but when i am she couldnt bear to watch him sink into the dark again and kept her voice brisk just a little lofty i take it you didnt get to church today on this holy day of obligation he winced you sound like my mother i forgot sort of she arched an eyebrow seems to me you could use all the blessings you can get so saying she rubbed her thumb on the print of ash on her forehead then rubbed it on his it made him smile thats probably sacrilegious but thanks what time is it he looked at his watch and swore i have to get this sucker into the shop it keeps stopping on me i know its past noon and it sure isnt midnight its about five you did say to come early yeah i did why dont we go sit out back and have some wine she watched him closely for the first few minutes but he appeared to be steady again as he selected a wine got some lovely old stemware out of his new cupboards hed frightened her lena could admit and badly shed been certain hed intended to walk into the water to drown himself among the lily pads just as lucian manet had done and with the realization a whole new realm of possibilities opened in her mind declan i got steaks and i got a grill he said as he poured the wine he needed to focus on ordinary things to steep himself in the here and now all real men can grill steaks if you tell me you dont eat red meat were going to have to go for the frozen pizza if i eat meat why should i care what color it is lets go out and sit ive got an idea i want to run by you they walked to the two wooden crates he was using for chairs and sat what if its not ghosts or not only ghosts she asked him oh thats a cheering thought what else have i got vampires werewolves maybe some flesheating zombies im going to sleep much better now thanks what do you think about reincarnation past lives recycling souls he shrugged his shoulders i dont know it always seemed efficient to me and fair too everybody deserves more than one chance dont you think maybe youre remembering things that happened here because you lived here before maybe youre lucian come back after all these years for his abigail thats a romantic notion ill be lucian if youll be abby you dont get to choose and if youre going to make fun of the idea i wont say another word about it okay dont get testy he sipped his wine brooded into space so your theory is im here and these things are happening because i lived a past life as lucian manet its no more farfetched than the place being haunted which you swallowed easy enough it would explain why you bought this place needed it why youre working so hard to restore its beauty how you saw the furniture in his bedroom upstairs reincarnation he repeated sounds better than a brain tumor what he shook his head drank again nothing youre thinking you got a tumor in your brain thats nonsense declan her voice was sharper than shed intended so she continued more gently thats just nonsense cher theres not a thing wrong with your head or any other part of you of course not i was just thinking out loud but she saw it on his face and rising slid onto his lap straddling him youre really worried youve got something inside your head making you see things do things im not worried im just look im going to have some tests eliminate the possibility youre not sick cher she touched her lips to his cheek then the other thered never been another man whod so consistently so effortlessly nudged out her tender side i guarantee it but if having some fancy doctor tell you the same thing settles your mind thats fine dont mention this to remy he took her hand until she eased back to meet his eyes hes got the wedding coming up thats enough for him to think about right now so youre planning on going to have brain tests all by yourself thats not the way we do things around here cher you dont want remy to know all right but you tell me when this is set up for and ill go with you lena im a big boy youre not going by yourself so i go with you or i tell remy and we gang up on you okay ill let you know when its scheduled and you can hold my hand in the meantime im going to put my money on your reincarnation theory its weird but its a lot less messy than brain surgery they say lucian manet was a handsome man like a young golden god she trailed her fingers through declans disordered hair it was a dark blond she mused thick lush and she bet it would streak up sexily with the summer sun i think youve improved on him this time around oh yeah he hooked his arms around her waist tell me more i never much cared for the goldengod type usually too pretty for my taste she cocked her head eased forward to kiss him you suit my taste cher he brought her closer and sitting on the wooden crate rested his chin on her shoulder as he looked out over the gallery railings i love you lena if youre trying to sweettalk me into bed before you feed me was he drew her back and the grin faded from her face as she saw his i love you he repeated i never understood what that meant before and i didnt think i could he held her in place when she tried to scramble up and away you need to settle down now she told him yeah i do but i dont think you mean it the same way i need to settle down right here with you i dont care if its the first time or the fiftieth time weve gone around youre what ive been waiting for declan youre making more out of this than you should her voice wanted to shake god knew her stomach already was we went out to dinner we went to bed weve seen each other a handful of times it only took one look at you his eyes were so deep she thought so clear like the surface of a lake at twilight you dont even know me he pulled her back a second time reminding her that there was steel in him and an edge to it youre wrong i know youre smart and youre strong enough to carve out your own place from almost nothing i know you pay your debts i know youre loyal and youre loving i know somebody hurt you and it wouldnt take much to knock the scab off and i know im scaring you right now because you dont think youre ready to hear what im saying to you the beat of her heart was painful like the strike of a fist on a raw wound im not looking for love declan im sorry neither was i but there you go we dont have to rush it i wasnt going to say anything to you yet but i needed to cher people they fall in and out of love all the time its just a dazzle of chemicals he really hurt you frustrated she pushed away and this time he let her go youre wrong theres no man no ghost of some lover who broke my heart i look like a clichi to you you look like everything to me mon dieu the man made her throat fill up then snap shut deliberately she fought back the sensation and spoke clearly i like you declan and i enjoy your company i want you in bed if thats not enough for you i walk now and save us both a lot of trouble and disappointment do you always get so pissed off when somebody tells you he loves you no one ever had she nearly said no one ever had who meant it i dont like being pushed and when i am i make a point of not going in that direction i have to admire that his grin was easy as he got to his feet i like you too lena and i enjoy your company want you in bed thats enough for now are you hungry i think ill heat up the grill if it was a trick lena thought or some sort of strategy to keep her off balance it was well done she just couldnt quite puzzle the man out and his seamless shift of moods was a surefire way to push her to keep trying he cooked like a man who didnt trust himself in an actual kitchen jacketed potatoes on the grill the steaks and he sweettalked her into making the salad he didnt say another word about love he asked her about work how her business had done during the two days of rain he put on music kept it low and talked through the kitchen door as the grill smoked and she chopped vegetables they might have been casual friends or the most comfortable of lovers they ate in his pretty kitchen by candlelight even the house behaved despite it or perhaps because of it she stayed on edge throughout the meal he took a bakery cake out of the fridge lena took one look sighed i cant we can save it for later i cant for forty days i gave up chocolate for lent ive got a powerful taste for chocolate oh he stuck it back in ive probably got something else whatd you give up wearing womens underwear its tough but i think i can hold out till easter you talk like that im going to take my ashes back he was making her itchy she thought the best way to solve that was to make him itch more she stepped behind him as he searched his refrigerator then wrapped her arms around his waist pressed her body to his you need to give something up cher something youve got a powerful taste for it sure as hell isnt going to be you he let her spin him around shove him back against the refrigerator oh he knew her he thought as she used her lips to set off explosions in his bloodstream he knew she was using sex to keep one step ahead of him one step back from him if she didnt realize he could love her as much as he wanted her it was up to him to show her in your bed you said her mouth was reckless restless as it raced over his face in your bed she pulled him toward the doorway he nearly pulled her back toward the kitchen stairs but decided it might be interesting to take the long way around he pushed her against the wall in the hallway assaulted her throat with his teeth well get there he reached down yanked her shirt up over her head threw it aside wrapped together they did a quick vertical roll along the wall and finally stopped with their positions reversed with impatient hands she pulled his shirt open so that buttons danced along the floor they fought with clothes on their way to the steps shoes landed with thumps her bra fluttered over the banister his jeans plopped on the third step they were breathless before they reached the landing his hands were rough a workingmans hands now that thrilled as they streaked over her her skin came alive hurry she sank her teeth into his shoulder as need raged through her a firestorm of violent heat that burned away all caution god hurry he nearly took her where they stood but he wanted her under him bucking arching with his mouth savaging hers he wrapped his arms around her waist lifted her two inches off the floor something raw and primitive stabbed through him at the knowledge that there was no choice now no choice for either of them but to mate shadows cloaked them as they moved toward the bedroom cold from doorways seeped out made her shiver declan this is us this is ours as he spoke his voice a snarl as he held her his grip like iron the cold curled back they fell on his bed a tangle of limbs and urgency when he plunged into her her nails dug into his back pleasure dark and desperate drenched her the feral glory of it drove her up so that she twined herself around him and matched the furious pace no control nor the desire for it only the wild thirst to take and take and take and with it the gnawing hunger to give she clung to him riding through the storm of sensation sprinting up and up toward that jagged brink again dimly she heard a clock begin to strike in deep heavy bongs on the twelfth she shattered with him when he started to shift away she tightened her grip mmm dont move yet im too heavy for you he rubbed his lips at the curve of her throat i like it i like this lazily she angled her head so he could work his way up to her jaw her body felt used and bruised and wonderfully loose even better than chocolate cake he laughed and rolled over taking her with him so she sprawled over his chest there now i dont have to worry about crushing you a gentleman to the last content she settled in ive always liked a clock that chimes the hours she said but you need to set it its not midnight yet i know sounded like a big old grandfather clock whered you put it in the parlor no he stroked a hand over her hair down her back i dont have a clock that chimes cher you absolutely ring my bells but i heard a clock chime twelve yeah so did i but i dont have a clock she lifted her head let out a slow breath oh well then does it scare you no then it doesnt scare me either she said and laid her head back over his heart the best way in declans opinion to break through the obstacles and opposition to any goal was not to ram headfirst against them and risk a skull fracture but to chip away at them gradually reasonably relentlessly whether it was a lawsuit a sporting event or a love affair it was imperative to keep the end in sight in order to select the correct means he found out which mass lena and her grandmother attended and at which church research was essential in any strategy when he slipped into the pew beside them on sunday morning he got a long speculative look from lena and a conspirators wink from odette he figured god would understand and appreciate the ploy and not hold it against him for using sunday mass as a means to his end but he wouldnt mention the brainstorm to his mother she was in declans experience a lot less flexible than the almighty aiming the leading edge of his charm toward odette he talked them into brunch afterward and got another cool stare from lena when he gave his name to the hostess hed already made reservations for three sure of yourself arent you cher his eyes were the innocent gray of a former altar boy just prepared you aint no boy scout sugar she told him your granddaughters very cynical declan responded as he offered his arm to odette what she is is smart odette patted a hand on his and had her bracelets jangling a womans got to be about smoothtalking handsome men man who comes into church so he can spend a sunday morning with a woman hes pretty smart too i thought id come in and pray for a while whatd you pray for that youd run away with me to borneo with a laugh odette slipped into the chair declan held out for her arent you the one yeah he looked directly at lena im going to be the one they settled in with mimosas and the first round from the expansive buffet while a jazz quartet played dixieland declan told them about the progress on the house im going to stick with the outside work as long as the weather holds tibalds still dealing with the plastering and im trying to line up a painter for the exterior i dont want to do that myself the guy i had paint the parlor came in to take a look at the library but he left sort of abruptly declans expression was rueful as he sipped his mimosa i dont think hes coming back tile man either he got one bath half done when he packed it in i can do some asking around for you odette offered id appreciate it but i think im going to have to start looking outside the parish or try my hand at some of this stuff myself things are getting a little lively at the hall grown men running off because a couple of doors slam lena curled her lips into a sneer ought to have more spine its a little more than that now clocks bonging where there arent any clocks to bong music playing in empty rooms when the painter was there the pocket doors in the library kept opening and closing then there was the screaming what screaming tile guy declan smiled wanly said he heard somebody come in the bedroom door thought it was me hes talking away setting the tiles listening to what he assumed was me moving around in there since i wasnt answering whatever questions he had he got up walked in nobody there from what i could get out of him when he was semicoherent the bathroom door slammed behind him the logs caught fire in the fireplace then he claims he felt somebody put a hand on his shoulder i had to peel him off the ceiling when i got up there what do you think about it odette asked a couple of things seems to me the more the work progresses on the house the more overt and volatile the paranormal activity well call it especially well when i veer off from the original scheme lena scooped up a forkful of grits a particular southern culinary custom declan had yet to get his tastebuds around what do you mean for example the plasterwork the areas where that is going on things are pretty settled im restoring them replicating but in places where ive made changes bathroom setup tiles things get really interesting its like whatevers in the house gets royally ticked that were not sticking with the original plan something to think about odette commented i have been i figure josephine manet even here with dixieland bright in the air and champagne fizzing the name coated his belly with dread mistress of the hall you only have to look at her photographs to see that was a woman who didnt like to be crossed now i come along and put my fingerprints all over whats hers you resolved to living with her odette asked and watched his jaw firm im resolved to living in the hall and doing it my way she wants to kick up a fuss about it thats her problem lena sat back what do you figure grandmama brave or stubborn oh hes some of both its a good mix thanks but i dont know how brave it is its my house now and thats that still i think you cant blame a man who doesnt have any more than his time and labor invested for taking a hike anyway miss odette what do you think am i tangling with josephine i think youve got two opposing forces in that house the one that brought you there the one that wants you to go away its going to come down to whos strongest she opened her sunday purse took out a small muslin bag i made this up for you what is it oh a little kitchen magic you just keep that in your pocket may not help but it cant hurt she picked up her glass again smiled at it imagine drinking champagne for breakfast come with me to borneo you can bathe in it cher i drink enough of this i may take you up on it ill get us another round he was so sweet with her lena thought flirting with her grandmother until there was a flush of pleasure on odettes cheeks throughout the long lazy meal he troubled himself for people she mused took the time made the effort to find out what they might enjoy then saw to it he was attentive clever sexy rich toughminded and kind and he said he was in love with her she believed she understood him well enough to be sure he wouldnt have said it unless he meant it thats what unnerved her for added to those other qualities was a wide streak of honesty and sheer stubborn grit he could make her fall in love with him she was already halfway there and sliding fast every time she tried to dig her heels in she lost her balance again the tumble was as worrisome as it was thrilling but what would happen when she hit once she dropped all the way thered be no climbing back out that was something she understood about herself relationships were easy when they didnt matter or mattered only for the moment when they mattered forever they changed everything things had changed already she admitted it had started with that yearning for him inside her and now with the comfort and challenge she felt when she was with him with being able to imagine feeling it day after day year after year hed want promises she was afraid to give not afraid she corrected irritated with herself reluctant to give unwilling to give then she watched him lean over and kiss her grandmothers cheek and was afraid there was no point in pretending otherwise that shed end up giving him anything he asked for he courted her it seemed a particularly appealing southern word to declan bringing images of moonlight and porch swings tart lemonade and country dances throughout march two things occupied his mind his time and his plans lena and the house he celebrated the clear results of his neurological tests by taking the day off to antique spring had jumpstarted the flowers and had pedestrians strolling in shirtsleeves the carriage horses the tourists loved prancing with bright clip clops of hooves on pavement summer would drop her heavy hand soon enough and turn the air to molasses the thought of it reminded him he had to have the airconditioning upgraded and maybe reconsider installing paddle fans in some of the rooms he bought with his usual surrender to impulse brightening the day of several shopkeepers before he stopped in a place called simply yesterday it was a hodgepodge of statuary lamps vintage accessories and jewelry with three curtained booths on the side where patrons could buy a tarot card reading it was the ring that caught his eye first the bloodred ruby and icewhite diamond formed two halves of an interlocking heart on a platinum band the minute he held it in his hand he knew he wanted it for lena maybe it was foolish to buy an engagement ring at this point in their relationship and it was reckless to snatch at something before hed looked at other options but this was the one he wanted to put on her finger and he decided if a man could buy a house on a whim he could sure as hell buy a ring ill take it its beautiful said the shopkeeper shes a lucky woman im working on convincing her of that i have some lovely earrings that would complement this is ruby her birthstone the clerk asked as she showed him a pair of earrings with a dangle of ruby hearts and diamonds i dont know but hed gotten her birthday from odette to make sure he didnt miss it july then it is lucky guess no kidding it gave him a little tingle as he looked back at the ring some things were meant he told himself he lifted one of the earrings he could already see them on her just as he imagined the clerk could see impulse buyer stamped on his forehead he leaned on the counter and began to pit yankee bargaining skills against southern horsetrading he figured theyd come to fair terms when her smile was still in place but much less brilliant will that be all for you today yeah ive got to get going im already was he broke off when he glanced at his watch and saw it had stopped at twelve again you know i could use a watch a pocket watch mines been acting up and im doing a lot of carpentry right now probably smashed this one a few times on the job ive got some wonderful old pocket watches and chains theyre so much more imaginative than the new ones she led him over to another display cabinet pulled out a drawer and set it on the counter watches like this tell more than time she began they tell a story this one was no the edges of his vision dimmed like smoke the chatter of voices from other customers faded into a hum part of him remained aware enough to know he was sliding away from himself even as he tried to stop it to pull back he watched his own hand reach out pick up a gold watch and its loop of chain the voice of the shopkeeper hovered around the rim of his consciousness it was another voice that stabbed through clear as a bell female young excited for my husband for his birthday he broke his i want to give him something special this one is so handsome can you engrave it and he already knew what he would find exactly what he would find before he turned the watch over to read the back to lucian from his abby to mark our time together april mr fitzgerald mr fitzgerald are you all right would you like some water youre awfully pale what can i get you some water would you like to sit down no he closed his hand tightly over the watch but the sensation was already fading no thanks im okay ill take this too more than a little shaken he headed to remys office he thought some time in the sensible business district in the rational atmosphere of law might help settle him down more he wanted a few minutes with a friend who might think he was crazy but would love him anyway if youd told me you were coming by remy began as he closed his office door idve scooted some stuff around so we could maybe have lunch i didnt expect to head over this way today been shopping again remy nodded at the bag declan carried boy arent you having anything sent down from boston as a matter of fact ive got some stuff coming down next week books mostly declan said as he wandered the office his gaze skimmed over the law books the fat files the memos all of it the debris of the lawyer seemed very distant to him now a few pieces i had in my study up there that should work in the library he picked up a brass paperweight set it down slipped a hand into his pocket jiggled change you going to tell me whats on your mind or just pace until you dig a trench in my carpet with his suit jacket draped over the back of his chair his tie loosened his sleeves rolled up remy kicked back in his chair and began to swish a bright green slinky from palm to palm youre wearing me out ive told you some of the things tve been happening got a firsthand account of them myself when i dropped in on saturday id still feel better if you told me that piano music we heard was from some radio you forgot to turn off i guess ill have to get a piano for the ladies parlor since that seems to be the spot i like to play anyway when i remember to sit down at one remy shifted the slinky to vertical let the colorful spiral drip into itself so you came by to tell me youre in the market for a piano i bought a watch today and you want to show it off want me to call in my assistant some of the law clerks it was lucian manets watch no shit the slinky sloshed into a whole was tossed aside how do you know whered you get ahold of it little shop in the quarter he drew out the box set it on remys desk take a look at it obliging remy took off the lid elegant if you want something youre going to have to dig out whenever you want to know what time it is heavy he added when he picked it up you dont feel anything from it feel anything look on the back remy names and dates are right remy concluded hell of a stroke of luck you stumbling on this luck i dont think so i go into a shop buy lena a ring then was whoa whoa whoa just back up there a minute a ring i told you i was going to marry her declan shrugged i found the ring it doesnt hurt to have it ahead of schedule but thats not the point pretty damn big point if you ask me she know youre up to this i told her how i felt what i wanted im letting her stew on it awhile can we get back to the watch et la you always were muleheaded go ahead i walk into that shop decide i need a watch because mines acting up i decide i need a pocket watch even though ive never used one never thought about using one then i see that one and i know i know it was his i know she bought it for him for his birthday i know what it says on the back before i read it exactly what it says because i heard it in my head i dont know what to think about that remy raked his fingers through his hair isnt there something about how some people touch an object and get images from it its history or whatever its called psychometry ive been doing a lot of reading up on paranormal science in my spare time declan explained when remy frowned at him but ive never had anything like that happen before lenas got a theory that this is a reincarnation deal remy pursed his lips set the watch back in its box i guess id be more inclined to put some stock in that rather than the psycho whatever if it is then the house now this watch are triggering pastlife memories pretty weird the whole things been weird since the getgo cher heres the kicker if i accept that i was lucian then i know lena was abigail what i dont know is if im supposed to bring her into the house to make things right from before or if im supposed to keep her away from it and resolve the cycle that way in the vieux carre where lena prepared to leave her apartment for the bar and the afternoon shift she opened the door and stepped into another cycle an old one baby lilibeth simone threw open her arms sluggish with shock lena was unable to move back before they wrapped around her like chains trapped she was assaulted with impressions too much perfume that didnt quite cover the smell of stale smoke the bony form honed down by years of hard living sticky layers of hairspray over curls dyed black as pitch and through it all seeped her own dark dread i went downstairs first and that handsome young man behind the bar said you were still up here why im so glad to catch you the voice was a bright bubble that bounced and jerked in the air let me just look at you i swear i swear you just get prettier every time i see you sweetie pie i just have to sit down a minute and catch my breath im just so excited to see you i can hardly stand it she talked too fast lena noted walked too fast on the spiked backless heels shed paired with hotpink and skintight capris those were warnings that shed taken a hit of her current drug of choice very recently look what youve done with this place lilibeth dropped into a chair and dumped a floral suitcase beside her she clapped her hands like a child so the plastic bracelets on her bony wrists banged together why i just love it suits you baby it sure does suit you shed been pretty once lena thought as she studied her mother shed seen pictures but all that prettiness had been carved down diamondhard to canny at fortyfour lilibeths face showed all the wear from too much liquor too many pills and far too many men deliberately lena left the door open and remained standing just inside it the sound of traffic the scent of the bakery across the street kept her grounded what do you want why to see you of course lilibeth let out a trill of laughter that scraped over lenas brain like nails on a blackboard what a thing to ask i got such a yen to see you baby i said to myself my lenas busy but weve just got to have a little time together so i got myself on a bus and here i am you just have to sit on down here honey and tell me everything youve been up to disgust rolled through her and lena clung to it better disgust than the despair that crept along just under it i have work oh now you can take a little while for your own mama after all you own the place im just so proud of my baby all grown up and running your own business doing so well for yourself too she continued as she looked around the room lena caught the look and the cunning in it it tightened her chest and stiffened her spine i told you the last time it was the last time you wont get any money from me again why do you want to hurt my feelings like that lilibeth widened her eyes as they filled with tears i just want to spend a few days with my little girl im not a little girl lena said dully yours in particular dont be mean honey after ive come all this way just to see you again i know i havent been a good mama to you darling but im going to make it up she jumped up pressing a hand to her heart the nail on the pinkie of her right hand was very long slightly curved coke nail lena realized without shock or regret now she knew lilibeths current drug of choice i made some mistakes i know i did honey lilibeths voice rang with apology with regret you gotta understand i was just so young when you came along youve used that one up lilibeth dug into her shiny red purse pulled out a tattered tissue why you wanna be so hard on your mama baby girl why you wanna hurt my heart you dont have a heart and youre not my mama carried you inside me for nine months didnt i sorrow became temper as if a switch had been flicked lilibeths voice rose shrilled nine months of being sick and fat and stuck back that damn bayou lay there in pain for hours giving birth to you and left me within a week an alley cat spends more time with its litter than you did with me i was sixteen it was that the sad fact of it that had caused lena to make room time and time again in her heart until her heart had simply calcified from the blows you havent been sixteen in quite a while neither have i im not going to waste time arguing about it i have to work and you have to go but baby panicked lilibeth shifted back to the teary choked voice youve got to give me a chance to make things right im going to get me a job i can work for you awhile wont that be fun ill just stay here with you for a couple weeks till i find a place of my own well have such a fine time just like girlfriends no you wont work for me and no you cant stay here i made that mistake four years ago and when i caught you turning tricks up here you stole from me and took off again i dont repeat myself i was sick back then im clean now honey i swear i am you cant just turn me out she held out her hands palms up in a gesture of pleading im flat broke billy he took almost everything i had and ran off lena could only assume billy was the latest in the string of users losers and abusers lilibeth gravitated to youre high right now do you think im blind or just stupid im not i just took a little something because i was so nervous about seeing you i knew youd be mad at me tears spilled out tracking bits of mascara down her cheeks you just have to give me a chance to make it up to you lena honey ive changed youve used that one up too resigned lena walked to her purse counted out fifty dollars here she stuffed it into lilibeths hand take this get on a bus and ride it as far away as this takes you dont come back here again theres no place for you here you cant be so mean to me baby you cant be so cold yes i can she picked up the suitcase carried it over to the door and set it outside its in the blood take the fifty its all youre going to get and get out or i swear to god ill throw you out lilibeth marched to the door the money had already disappeared into her purse she stopped gave lena one last glittering look i never wanted you then were even i never wanted you either she shut the door in her mothers face then flipped the locks sat down on the floor and cried in absolute silence she was certain shed smoothed away the edges by the time she drove out to manet hall that evening shed nearly canceled the dinner plans she had with declan but that would have given her mother too much importance that would have acknowledged the grief that had slashed its way into her heart despite the locks she needed to put her mind to other things and would never manage it if she stayed at home brooding shed get through the night hour by hour and in the morning lilibeth would be gone from her life and from her mind the house looked different she thought little changes that somehow made it seem more real it was good to look at it to focus on it and to contemplate that some things could change for the better with the right vision over the years shed come to think of manet hall as a kind of dream place burrowed in the past more than that she decided of the past now with new unpainted boards checkerboarded with the old peeling white with some windows gleaming and others coated with dust it was a work in progress declan was bringing it back to life though the front gardens were a bit straggled a bit lost there were flowers blooming and hed plopped a huge clay pot full of begonias on the gallery hed have planted them himself she thought as she walked toward the door he was a man who liked his hands in things especially when he considered them his she wondered if he thought of her as one of his works in progress probably she couldnt quite decide if the idea amused or irritated her she strolled in she figured that when two people had slept with each other a time or two formalities were superfluous she smelled the lilies first the good strong scent bringing the garden indoors hed bought a lovely old table a couple of straightback chairs and she saw with a grin an enormous ceramic cow for the foyer some would call it foolish others charming she supposed but no one would call the entrance to the old hall sterile any longer declan she wandered in and out of the parlor noting the few new additions she circled into the library and found herself crossing to the mantel and the heavy candlesticks standing on it why did her fingers tremble she wondered as she reached out to touch why did those old tarnished candlesticks look so strangely familiar there was nothing special about them really expensive perhaps but too ornate for her taste and yet her fingers brushed down each of them lightly and yet they looked right here so right she could imagine the slim white tapers they were waiting to hold once more she could smell the melting wax shivering she stepped back and walked out of the room she kept calling his name as she started up the stairs when she reached the first landing the hidden door in the wall opened she and declan choked back simultaneous screams with a gasping laugh she clutched at her heart and stared at him he had cobwebs in his hair dirt smeared on his cheek and hands the flashlight he carried bobbled lord cher next time just shoot me and get it over with same goes he blew out a breath dragged at his hair and the cobwebs lacing it you scared five years off me well i called out a couple times then decided id just hunt you up she peered over his shoulder whatve you got here secret passages no servants access there are doors on every level so i thought id take a look its kind of cool but a real mess he looked down at his filthy hands why dont you go fix yourself a drink or something ill clean up i might be persuaded to fix us both a drink whatre you in the mood for could use a beer but he was studying her face now that hed recovered from the jolt whats wrong lena nothing other than you frightening the wits out of me youre upset i can see it she tried a suggestive smile maybe im sulking cause you dont bother to kiss me hello maybe you dont trust me enough yet and figure all im looking for with you is a good time he used one knuckle to lift her chin stared into her eyes until hers began to sting youre wrong i love you he waited a beat then nodded when she didnt respond ill be down in a minute she started down the steps then stopped speaking without looking back declan i dont think youre looking for a good time but i dont know as i have what it is you are looking for angelina youre what ive looked for all my life he didnt press if she needed to pretend she wasnt upset and skittish hed give her room they took a walk through the rear gardens as dusk crept in this place all these years people come people go mostly they go and here you are doing more in a few months than anyones done since before i can remember she turned to study the house oh it still needed work wood and paint new shutters here and there but it no longer seemed dead she realized it hadnt just been abandoned it had been dead until hed come youre bringing it back to life its more than the money and the work could you live here her eyes startled even panicked whipped back to his but his gaze stayed calm and level i have my own place thats not what i asked i asked if you could if you could be comfortable here or if the idea of sharing the place with ghosts or memories whatever youd call it would bother you if it bothered me i wouldnt have come over tonight so you could feed me which reminds me what are you feeding me cher im going to try my hand at grilling tuna he pulled his pocket watch out in a bit he said after checking the time she was mesmerized by the watch in his hand her stomach jittered as it had done when shed seen the candlesticks where did you get that i found it at a shop today alerted by her tone fascinated by it he held the watch out look familiar you just dont see many men using that type of watch anymore i knew it was mine as soon as i saw it i think you bought it for me he said and her head jerked up a long time ago he turned the watch over so she could read the inscription on the back lucians because her instinct was to curl her fingers into her palms she made herself reach out and touch the engraving very strange strange indeed declan you think i was abigail yeah i do she shook her head dont you think thats a little too neat and tidy and selfserving murder despair suicide a century of wandering souls he shrugged and slipped the watch back in his pocket not very tidy if you ask me but i think lena that maybe love is patient enough to wait until its time comes around again god you are so appealing and its irritating that i have to be the sensible one around here i like being with you declan she toyed with the key on her neck chain as she spoke a habit he thought she was probably unaware of i like your company i like your looks and i like making love with you thats all i have right now he took her into his arms ill take it lena rolled over slid along one pillow to the other she heard singing a deep male voice in a dreamy refrain and sighing she ran her hand over the sheets he wasnt beside her in bed but his warmth was opening her eyes she blinked against the misty sunlight she hadnt meant to stay the night but with declan her intentions often twisted around to meet his wishes more somehow his wishes circled until they ended up being hers as well clever man she mused yawning as she burrowed into the pillow he rarely seemed to push never appeared to be unreasonable and always got his way damned if she didnt admire him for it even now though shed have preferred waking in her own bed she was glad shed stayed her mood had been heavy and a bit prickly when shed arrived seeing her mother usually had that effect on her for a few hours shed forgotten about it and had just enjoyed being with him that was enough and would have to be enough for both of them for as long as it lasted seeing lilibeth was a stark reminder of the promises lena had made to herself to succeed on her own terms to live precisely how she chose to live and never never to place her hopes her needs her wants in the hands of another declan would move along sooner or later everyone did but she cared more this time and would make a genuine effort to be and to remain friends so she would be very very careful not to fall in love with him very careful not to hurt him while he believed he loved her her brow creased she did hear singing in the shower she realized declans voice over the drum of water long years have passed child ive never wed true to my lost love though she is dead an odd tune for a man to belt out in the shower she thought and found herself singing the refrain with him in her mind after the ball is over after the break of morn puzzled where had those lyrics come from she rose and went to the bathroom door she knew the tune but more she knew the words the sad story of lack of faith of death melded to the romantic melody and her heart was pounding she felt the pulse of it jump in her throat dancing in the moonlight with the house a white beacon against the night a girl in faded muslin and the young man in elegant black tie the smell of lilacs heavy and sweet the airs thick with flowers so thick its hard to breathe so thick it makes you dizzy as you spin around and around through the garden along the bricks with the music playing dizzy dizzy from the dance dizzy dizzy from the fall into love she swayed reaching out to brace a hand against the door but it opened and steam poured out as she fell forward whoa declan caught her scooped her off her feet still wet from the shower his hair dripping onto her face he carried her back to bed im okay i just lost my balance baby youre white as a sheet he brushed her hair back rubbed her chilled hand between both of his what happened nothing torn between confusion and embarrassment she nudged him back to sit up i got up too fast is all then i lost my balance when i reached for the door and you opened it im fine cher ga va its just a little early for me to be up and around ill get you some water sweetheart dont fuss simones arent swooning sorts she ran a finger over his chin it was all fading away now the song the scent of lilacs the giddy sense of reeling though that handsome face of yours does take my breath away you leave any hot water for me probably not he eased down to sit beside her ive got to replace that water heater if you give it a half hour it should come through for another shower mmm now what could i do with a half hour laughing she pulled him into bed now that lena decided was a much better way to start the day she lingered over her first cup of coffee at the little table declan had set up on the gallery outside his bedroom as his breakfast pickings were slim at best shed settled on a bowl of frosted flakes and had watched him load his down with sugar cher why dont you just have yourself a big old candy bar for breakfast dont have one he grinned over at her and damn it he did take her breath away youve got yourself a nice spot here she told him good morning contemplation sort of spot itll be better when i get some of the boards replaced and its painted needs more stuff too he glanced around pots you know flowers and things a glider or a swing she spooned up some cereal youre just a homebody arent you cher looks like and it delighted him whodve thought and what does the homebody have planned for today i want to finish the first section of the exterior stairs if the weather holds through the weekend ill have a good start on the front of the house ive got guys coming in to start on the other bathrooms got some more shopping to do want to come with me ive never seen a man so crazy to shop it was tempting to give in to the charming image of hunting with him for treasures and to have some part in selecting pieces for the house and wouldnt that go toward forging another link in making them a couple instead of two people just enjoying the moment so she shook her head and denied herself the pleasure unless this shopping involves looking at shoes or earrings youre on your own sugar i could probably fit that in between hunting up drawer pulls and hardware in fact hang on a minute he rose and went inside while lena stretched back and cupping her mug in both hands looked out over the gardens to the pond shed distracted him she thought or at least he was pretending to be distracted from what had happened that morning shed damn near fainted and that wouldve been a first something in the house she mused was affecting her just as it did declan one side pulling her in another pushing her out but she was determined to stand firm was it possible he was right after all could it be so perfectly neat he had been lucian in a past life and she his doomed abigail had they danced in the moonlight to that old sad song if it were true what did it mean to them now in this life her face was clear of worry when he stepped out again and put a small box on the table beside her bowl cher you keep picking up presents like this whatre you going to do when my birthday rolls around ill think of something well i dont think youre going to top my salt and pepper shakers but she opened the box expecting to see some cute and foolish pin or silly earrings then just stared down at the pair of ruby and diamond hearts they caught my eye you you cant give me something like this for the first time since hed known her she stuttered you cant just just give me earrings like these these are real stones do you think im too stupid to recognize real diamonds no interesting he thought that shed jump from fluster into temper at the gift of diamonds i thought theyd look good on you i dont care how rich you are she snapped the lid back down on the sparkle of blood and ice i dont care how much money youve got stuffed away in your portfolios and your bank accounts i dont want you buying me expensive jewelry if i want diamonds and rubies then alors ill buy them for myself im not sleeping with you for baubles and profit well these were a big hit he tipped back in his chair to meet her furious eyes as shed leaped to her feet as shed shouted at him so theyd be okay with you if they were glass let me get the ground rules clear if i see something id like to get for you it has to be what under a hundred one fifty give me a ballpark i dont need you to buy me things lena if you needed me to buy you things id buy you groceries for christs sake these were pretty they made me think of you and look at this he picked up the box ran his free hand around it no strings attached something costs as much as a decent secondhand cars got strings cher wrong moneys relative i have a lot of it so deal you dont want them fine he shrugged picked up his coffee ill give them to someone else her eyes went to slits oh will you they appear to upset your moral balance but theres no point in them going to waste youre trying to make me sound like an idiot no youre acting like an idiot im just playing my part in your little drama id like you to have them but not if youre going to think theyre payment for services rendered thats just as insulting to me as it is to you lena he said when her mouth dropped open your telling me you dont want payment for sex is telling me im willing to buy it from you theyre just goddamn rocks theyre beautiful rocks damn damn damn why did the man constantly throw her off balance and wasnt it just like him just exactly like him to sit there calmly watching her flash and burn she took a deep steadying breath while he looked at her with both patience and amusement i was rude and i overreacted im not used to men handing me diamonds and rubies over bowls of cereal okay want me to wait and give them to you over a nice steak dinner she gave a weak laugh dragged her hair back youre entirely too good for me what the hell does that mean he demanded but she shook her head then picked up the box she studied the earrings against their bed of velvet for a long moment before taking them out putting them on how do they look perfect she leaned down kissed him thank you they just scared me a little but im getting over it pretty quick now good im going to have to wear my hair back with them show them off damn it she said as she ran for the door i have to see she stopped at the mirror held her hair back with one hand oh god theyre fabulous ive never had anything so lovely in my life youre a sweet man declan a hardheaded crazy sweet man when you marry me he said from the doorway ill give you diamonds for breakfast once a week stop that okay but keep it in mind ive got to get on i want to stop by and see my grandmama before i head back give me a ride over ive got something for her her eyes when they tracked to his in the glass were indulgent and just a little frustrated you bought her another present dont start on me he warned and stepped back out to gather up the bowls why do you have to buy things all the time cher she knew him now and the little ripple movement of his shoulders told her he was annoyed and uncomfortable so she softened the question by giving him a quick kiss on the cheek ive got money he said and i like stuff you trade money for stuff which is more fun and interesting than having a bunch of green paper in your wallet i dont know me i like that green paper just fine but she fingered the diamonds at her ears i could grow mighty fond of these pretty rocks go on get whatever youve gone and bought for grandmama bound to brighten her day whatever it is cause its from you you think shes sweet on you i like that he turned wrapped his arms around lenas waist how about you you sweet on me a long line of warmth flowed down her spine nearly made her sigh you make it hard not to be good he touched his lips to hers then eased away i like that even better he carried a little gift bag out to her car it struck her as odd and charming that he would think of things like that not just a present a token he could so easily afford but the presentation of it pretty bags or bows ribbons or wrappings most men or men shed known would never bother with any woman she knew would call declan fitzgerald one hell of a catch and he wanted her im going to ask you a question she began as she started the car true or false multiple choice i guess its more the essay type he settled back stretched out his legs as best he could as she started down the drive hed always aced his tests shoot how come with all those fine ladies up in boston and all the goodlooking women here round new orleans you zeroed in on me not one of them ever made my heart stop or sprint like a racehorse at the starting gun but you do not one of them ever made me see myself ten years twenty years down the road reaching out to take her hand but you do lena and what i want most in the world is to hold onto you she didnt look at him didnt dare as everything inside her seemed to fill up so she knew one glance at his face would have it all spilling out warm and sweet and conquered thats a good answer she managed its a true one he took one of her tensed hands off the wheel kissed it gods truth i think it is i dont know what to do about it declan youre the first man whos ever made me worry about what to do ive got powerful feelings for you id rather i didnt heres what i think we should elope to vegas then you wont have anything to worry about oh im sure the boston fitzgeralds would just be thrilled hearing youve eloped to vegas with a cajun bar owner from the bayou thatd set them up right and tight itd give them something to talk about for the next decade or two my mother would like you he said almost to himself and shes no easy mark shed like that youre your own woman and dont take any crap off anyone run your own business look after your grandmother shed respect that and shed like that then shed love you because i do my father would take one look at you and be your slave she laughed at that and it loosened some of the tightness in her chest are all the fitzgerald men so easy were not easy we just have exceptional taste she pulled up in front of odettes house and finally turned to look at him any of them coming down for remy and effies wedding my parents are well see what we see wont we she hopped out headed to the door ahead of him grandmama she bumped the door open and strolled in i brought you a handsome gentleman caller odette came out of the kitchen wiping her hands on a red checked cloth the smells of fresh coffee and baking followed her she was as always decked out in layers of jewelry and sturdy boots but there was a strain around her eyes and mouth even declan spotted instantly a gentleman callers always welcome bibi she replied and kissed lenas cheek whats wrong baked me some brown bread this morning odette said evading lenas question yall come back to the kitchen she wrapped an arm around lenas waist to nudge her along what you got in the pretty bag cher just a little something i thought youd like in the kitchen declan set it on the table smells fabulous in here maybe i ought to learn how to bake bread odette smiled as hed hoped she would but the tension in the air didnt lessen could be ill teach you a thing or two kneading doughs good therapy takes your mind off your troubles gives you thinking time she took the small wrapped box out of the gift bag turned it in her hand then tugged the ribbon free lena you dont nail this boy down i may just snatch him for myself when she opened the box her face softened the trinket box fit into the palm of her hand it was heartshaped and hand painted with a couple in oldfashioned formal dress sitting on a garden bench when she lifted the lid it played a tune ive been hearing that song in my head for weeks declan told her so when i saw this i figured id better buy it after the ball odette told him its an old waltz sad and sweet she looked up at him maybe you got a nice widowed uncle you could send my way well theres uncle dennis but hes homely as a billy goat hes got half your heart ill take him isnt this a pretty picture at the voice lena went stiff as if someone had pressed a gun to her head and cocked the hammer declan saw the look pass between her and her grandmother apologetic on odettes part shocked on lenas then they turned lilibeth slumped against the doorjamb she wore a short red robe loosely belted her hair was a tumble around her shoulders and her face already made up for the day with her eyes darkly lined her lips slick and red as her robe and who might this be she lifted one hand languidly pushed back her hair as she sent declan a slow feline smile whats she doing here lena demanded what the hell is she doing in this house its my house as much as yours lilibeth shot back some of us have more respect for blood kin than others i told you to get on a bus and go i dont take orders from my own daughter lilibeth pushed off the jamb sauntered to the stove this here coffee fresh mama how could you lena demanded of odette how could you take her in again lena all odette could do was take her hand shes my child im your child the bitter fury poured out and left its horrid taste on her tongue youre just going to let her come back stay until shes sucked you dry again until she and whatever junkie she hooks up with

surged forward even as lena threw out her chin to take the blow declan stepped between them think again he said it quietly but the heat in his voice pumped into the kitchen you lay a hand on her lilibeth one hand on her and ill put you out odette stepped to the stove poured the coffee herself with hands not quite steady i mean that shes got no call to speak to me that way lilibeth let her lips quiver and in front of a stranger declan fitzgerald im a friend of lenas and miss odettes ill get that coffee miss odette you sit down now this is family business declan lena kept her furious eyes on her mothers face she would think of the embarrassment later right now it was only a dull pinch through the cushion of anger you should go in a minute he poured coffee brought a cup to odette crouched so their faces were level im irish he told her both sides nobody puts on a family fight like the irish you only have to call me if you need me he squeezed her hand then straightened same goes he said to lena im not staying ill drive you back she had to breathe deeply to brace for the pain her own words would cause grandmama i love you with all my heart but as long as shes in the house i

changed honey i want to make it all up to you give me a chance to was outside lena whirled youve had your last chance with me dont you come near me dont you come near my place youre dead to me you hear she slammed the car door ground the engine to life then sped off spewing up a thin cloud of smoke that obscured her mother and the house where shed grown up well that was fun wasnt it lena punched the gas i bet your family would just love a load of lilibeth simone whore junkie thief and liar you cant blame your grandmother for this lena i dont blame her i dont the tears were rushing up from her throat she felt the burn but i wont be a part of it i wont she slammed the brakes in front of the hall i need to go now but she lowered her brow to the wheel go on get out va ten no im not going away others had he realized now and thats where the hurt came from do you want to talk about this out here or inside im not going to talk about it anywhere yes you are pick your spot i told you all you need to know my mothers a whore and a junkie if she cant earn enough to feed her various habits on her back she steals shed as soon lie as look at you she doesnt live around here i dont know where she lives no place for long she came to my place yesterday stoned and full of lies and her usual talk about new starts and being friends thought id let her move in with me again never again she said and leaned her head back on the car seat i gave her fifty dollars for bus fare shouldve known better likely its already gone up her nose lets take a walk this isnt something you walk off or kiss better declan i need to get back youre not driving into town when youre still churned up lets walk to ensure she didnt just drive away when he got out he took the keys out of the ignition pocketed them then he climbed out walked around the car opening her door he held out a hand she couldnt drum up the energy to argue but instead of taking his hand she slid out of the car and dipped hers in her pockets theyd walk she figured theyd talk and then it would be over she imagined he thought his gardens that new blossoming the tender fragrances would soothe her he would want to comfort he was built that way more hed want to know so he could find solutions when it came to lilibeth there were no solutions family can suck cant it her gaze whipped to his dark and fierce and sheened with damp shes not my family i get that but its a family situation were always having situations in my family probably because there are so many of us not having enough canapis at a cocktail party or having two aunts show up in the same fancy dress isnt a situation he debated whether to let the insult pass she was after all raw and prickly but he couldnt quite swallow it you figure having money negates personal problems takes the sting out of hurts buries tragedies thats pretty shallow lena im a shallow gal comes through the blood thats bullshit but youre entitled to feel sorry for yourself after almost taking a slap in the face money didnt make my cousin angie feel much better when her husband got her and his mistress pregnant the same month it didnt help my aunt when her daughter died in a car wreck on her eighteenth birthday life can fuck you over whatever your income bracket she stopped ordered herself to calm down i apologize she tends to put me in a mood thats not fit for company im not company before she could evade he cupped her face in his hands i love you stop it declan i cant im no good for you no good for anybody and i dont want to be thats the key isnt it yeah he reached down lifted the key she wore around her neck it wasnt a man but a woman who broke your heart now you want to lock it up close it off so you wont accept love when its offered wont let yourself give it back safer that way if you dont love it doesnt matter if someone walks away that makes you a coward so what if it does she shoved his hand aside its my life i live it the way i want and i get along fine youre a romantic cher under all that yankee sense that expensive education youre a dreamer i dont put stock in dreams what is thats what counts one of these days youre going to wake up and find yourself in this big old house in the middle of nowhere wondering what the hell you were thinking and youll hightail it back to boston go back to lawyering marry some classy woman named alexandra and have a couple pretty children you forgot the pair of golden retrievers he said mildly oh she threw up her hands merde couldnt agree more first the only woman i know named alexandra has teeth like a horse she sort of scares me second and more important what im going to do angelina is live out my life in this big old house with you im going to raise a family with you right here golden retrievers are optional you saying it over and over isnt going to make it so now he grinned white and wide bet there was something about him when he was like this she realized something potent and just a little frightening when he wore that sheen of affability over a core of concrete stubbornness im going to work you just stay away from me for a while you hear im too irritated to deal with you he let her walk away it was enough for now that her anger with him had dried up those tears that had glimmered in her eyes new orleans julian was drunk as he preferred to be he had a halfnaked whore in his lap and her heavy breast cupped in his hand the old black man played a jumpy tune on the piano and the sound mixed nicely in his head with wild female laughter cigar smoke stung the air giving him a lowlevel urge for tobacco but he couldnt quite drum up the gumption for a cigar or to haul the whore upstairs the fact that he was broke again didnt worry him overmuch he patronized this brothel habitually and always eventually scraped together the funds to pay his bill his credit was good here for the moment hed selected the prostitute because she was blond and lush of build vacant of brain he could tell himself that later when he rode her he wouldnt see abigails face staring back up at him not this time he took another swig of bourbon then pinched the blonds nipple she squealed and slapped playfully at his hand he was grinning when lucian walked in my sainted brother though his words slurred they were bitter on his tongue julian gulped more whiskey as he watched lucian shake his head at a redhead who sidled up to him he looked julian thought pale and gold and perfect through the hazy smoke against the garish colors through the raucous noise and he wondered if cain had looked at abel and felt the same violent disgust as he himself felt now he waited jiggling the blond on his knee squeezing her breast as lucian scanned the parlor when their eyes met identical eyes there was a clash julian would have sworn he heard it in his head the sound two swords make when struck in battle whats this he said as lucian approached finally lowering yourself to the rest of us humans my brother needs a drink a drink and a woman for mon frhre he called out though i doubt he knows what to do with either you embarrass yourself and your family julian im sent to bring you home im not embarrassed to pay for a whore julian set down his glass and ran his hand up the blonds thigh now if i married one it would be a different matter but you beat me to that brother as you have so many other things lucians face whitened you will not speak of her in this place my brother married a slut from the swamps he said conversationally jerking the blond back when she tried to crawl off his lap he could feel her heart pounding pounding under his hand now as the heat between him and lucian stirred fear and her fear excited him as none of the promises shed whispered in his ear had done lucian pride of the manets brought his tramp into our home and now he pines and weeps because she left him for another and saddled him with her bastard whelp he had to believe it over the winter hed drowned in an ocean of bourbon the look of her staring eyes the sound of her body sliding wetly into the bayou he had to believe it or go mad allez lucian ordered the blond g i like her where she is julian clamped his hands on her arms as she struggled neither of them noticed as the room fell silent as the notes of the piano died away and the laughter trailed off lucian reached down dragged the blond off julians lap she bolted away like a rabbit even as lucian yanked julian from the chair gentlemen the madam of the house swept forward behind her was an enormous man in spotless evening dress we want no trouble here monsieur julian her voice cooed her hand glided intimately over his cheek and her eyes were frigid go with your brother now mon cher ami this isnt the place for family squabbles of course my apologies he took her hand kissed it then turned and leaped on lucian the table and lamp they fell on shattered while people rushed away women screamed they rolled jabbing with fists snapping like dogs as the violence of a lifetime sprang out of both of them the bouncer waded in dragged julian up by the scruff he quickmarched him to the door heaved him through lucian had barely gained his hands and knees when he was lifted curses and screams followed him out the door and anger was smothered by mortification lucian shook his head clear gained his feet he looked down at his brother that reflection of self and felt a different kind of shame have we come to this he said wearily brawling in brothels sprawling in gutters i want peace between us julian god knows i have peace nowhere else he held out a hand an offering to help julian to his feet but julians shame had a different color and it was black he wouldnt remember drawing the knife out of his boot liquor and temper and guilt blinded him nor would he remember surging to his feet striking out he felt the blade slice through his brothers flesh with a kind of wild glee and his lips were peeled back his eyes mad as he scented first blood they struggled lucian through the pain and shock julian through the black haze with the hilt of the knife slippery in their hands and the bright bright horror paralyzed him as julians eyes widened when the killing point turned on him into him mhre de dieu julian murmured and stared down at the blood on his breast youve killed me manet hall the heat had pumped in from the south it seemed to declan that even the air sweat mornings and evenings when it was bearable he worked outside afternoons he sought the cooler regions of the house it wasnt as efficient dragging his tools in and out but he was making progress that was the name of the game he didnt call lena he figured she needed to simmer and settle but he thought of her constantly he thought of her as he nailed boards when he studied paint samples when he installed paddle fans and he thought of her when he woke in the middle of the night to find himself curled on the grass by the edge of the pond lucians watch clutched in his fist and his face damp with tears he tried to put the sleepwalking out of his mind in the daylight but he couldnt put her out one more day he ordered himself as he wiped sweat off his face then he was going into town banging on her door if he had to push her into a corner to force her to talk to him thats what hed do remys wedding was coming up fast which meant not only was he going to watch his best friend get married but his parents were coming to town he was ridiculously grateful theyd declined his offer for them to stay with him everyone would be a hell of a lot happier with them tucked into a nice hotel suite regardless he was determined to finish the galleries and one of the spare bedrooms in that way the house would look impressive when they came down the drive and he could prove hed had the room hed offered them his mother would look to be sure that was a given he backed down the ladder grabbed the cooler and gulped cold water then poured the rest over his head refreshed he walked across the lawn then turned back to look dripping already starting to steam he felt the smile spread across his face not bad he said aloud not half bad for a yankee amateur hed finished the dual staircases the sweep of them curved up opposite sides of the secondfloor gallery the elegance of them negated all the nicks cuts scrapes and the hours of labor they would be he realized his pride and joy now all he needed was to bribe the painters to work in this heat wave or pray for a break in the weather either way he wasnt going to wait until hed finished the rear of the house he wanted the front painted wanted to stand as he was standing now and see it gleam in bridal white to please himself he strode back walked slowly up the righthand stairs crossed the gallery and walked slowly down the left it gave him such a kick he did it again then he dug through his toolbox for his cell phone and called lena he had to share his excitement with her what did it matter if he was a day ahead of schedule the phone was ringing in her apartment when he glanced over and saw lilibeth crossing his lawn he pressed end got to his feet and put the phone back in his toolbox i swear this heats just wilting she beamed at him fluttering her lashes as she waved a hand in front of her face he noted the bracelets she wore were odettes and its barely noon look at you she said in a slow purr she sauntered straight to him trailed a fingertip down his bare chest youre all wet impromptu shower instinctively he took a step back so her finger no longer touched his skin what can i do for you miss simone you can start by calling me lilibeth after all youre a good friend of my mamas and my little girls arent you she wandered away a bit let her eyes widen as she scanned the house i just cant hardly believe what youve done with this big old place you must be awfully clever declan she said flirtatiously i can call you declan cant i sure you dont have to be so clever he said you just have to have plenty of time and money she thought plenty of money oh now dont you be modest its just a miracle what youre doing here i hope it wouldnt be putting you out too much to show me some of the inside and i surely could use something cold just walking over here from homes left me parched he didnt want her in his house more than distaste there was a kind of primitive dread but whatever else she was she was lenas mother and his own had drummed manners into his bones of course ive got some tea cant think of anything that would be more welcome she followed him to the door was pleased when he opened it for her and stepped back for her to enter ahead of him she let her body brush his just the faintest suggestion then walked into the foyer and let out a gasp she didnt have to feign the shock or her wonder as she gazed around the grand entrance shed been inside before remy and declan werent the first to get liquored up and break into manet hall shed never liked it much the place had given her the creeps with its shadows and dust its cobwebs and faded glamour but now it was full of light and polish glossy floors glossy walls she didnt think much of the old furniture not for looks anyway but she had no doubt the price tags had been heavy old money bought or kept old things it was a concept that baffled her when there was so much new and glittery in the world my lord sugar this is a showplace just a showplace she repeated and wandered into the parlor she mightve preferred the city where the action was but she could see that a woman could live like a queen in such a place and bring the action in at her whim goodness did i say you were clever why youre just a genius everythings so beautiful and fresh she turned back to him you must be awful proud its coming along kitchens back this way we can get you that cold drink that would be lovely but dont you hurry me along now she slid a proprietary hand onto his arm clung there as she walked down the hall im just fascinated by what youve done with this place mama said youd only started on it a few months ago you can get a lot done if you stick to the plan and since he seemed to be stuck with her for the time being he banked down on the desire to get her out again instead as she turned into the library made purring noises he took the opportunity to study her he couldnt see lena in her there were he supposed some physical similarities but where lena had that compact bombshell body lilibeths had been whittled down with time and abuse to nearly gaunt showing it off in tiny red shorts and a tight tank top only made her appear cheap and pathetic a wornout kewpie doll painted up for one last night at the carnival he felt a stir of sympathy for a woman who sought approval and attention by trying to showcase a sexuality shed already lost shed used a heavy hand with makeup and the heat hadnt been kind her face seemed sallow and false under all the borrowed color her hair had frizzed and graying roots were streaking through it by the time he got her into the kitchen he found her too pitiful to resent have a seat he told her ill get you that drink and she mistook the kindness in his voice for attraction a kitchen like this she slid into a chair it was cool here and she tipped back her head to let the air reach her throat and to watch him dont you go and tell me you cook too why if thats so sugar im just going to have to cut lena out and marry you my own self sorry the mention of lena tightened him up again but his back was to her and she didnt see his face i dont cook well a girl can make allowances she lapped her tongue over her lips he had a good strong build to go along with those deep pockets and she was starting to itch for a man you wouldnt have anything a little stronger than that tea would you honey would you rather a beer shed rather a good glass of whiskey but she nodded thatd be just fine you gonna join me ill stick with tea ive got work to do yet today too hot to work she stretched back looking at him under her lashes days like this you just wanna soak in a cool tub then lie on down in a dim room with a fan blowing over your skin she accepted the glass of beer hed poured her and sipped what do you do to beat the heat honey pour cold water over my head hows miss odette lilibeths lips pursed oh shes fine house is hot as hell in the morning with her baking gotta save her pennies ive been helping out best i can but things are tight declan she ran her finger down the condensation on the glass drank some more i wanted to apologize for that scene over at the house the other day lena and i well we just rub each other wrong half the time i guess i cant deny i didnt do right by her when she was a little thing but im trying to make it up to her she widened her eyes until they stung and watered cooperatively ive changed ive come to a point in my life when i realize whats important and thats family you know what i mean youve got family yes ive got family and now youre down here you must miss them and they miss you whatever troubles you might have between you youd put them aside and support each other no matter what aint that right yes she dabbed delicately at her tears i need lena to see thats all i want she doesnt trust me yet and i cant blame her i was hoping maybe you could help convince her to give me a chance she slid her hand across the table skimmed it over the back of his id sure appreciate it if you did i feel so alone woman in my situation she needs a friend a strong man in her corner if i knew i had you on my side it would help so much if there have to be sides im on lenas either way i cant step between family and if i was stupid enough to try it she wouldnt listen to me anyway maybe the two of you arent as close as i assumed its always risky to make assumptions he returned equably she took another swallow of beer youre sleeping with her arent you im not going to discuss that with you why not lilibeth ran the chilly glass between her breasts then laughing rose you shy honey dont you be shy with lilibeth we could be friends you and me she skirted the table leaned in behind him very good friends she added as her arms twined down and her teeth nipped at his ear miss simone youre putting me in the awkward position of asking you to get your hands off me you are shy with a chuckle that blew warm breath and beer over his cheek she trailed her hands down toward his lap he clamped a hand over her wrists jerked them up again youre embarrassing yourself he twisted so he could lever out of the chair and onto his feet to face her thats your business but youre using me to take a shot at lena and thats mine angry color spotted her cheeks maybe you think youre too good for me theres no maybe about it get out and well forget this happened she wanted to scream at him to strike out but she still had her wits about her she hadnt had enough beer to dull them and the hit of coke shed had before walking over had been miserly playing it out she sank into a chair dropped her head on her folded arms and sobbed i dont know what to do im just so alone im just so scared i need help i thought i thought if i let you have me youd help me i just dont know what to do she lifted her head and the two tears shed managed to squeeze out tracked through her makeup im in such awful trouble he went to the sink ran the water cold then got a glass what kind of trouble i owe some money thats why i left houston and im afraid theyll find me hurt me maybe lena too i dont want them to hurt my baby he set the water in front of her how much money he saw it the quick glint of satisfaction in her eyes before she lowered them five thousand dollars it wasnt my fault really it wasnt my fault i trusted the wrong people a man she said wearily and he ran off with the money and left me owing if i dont find a way to pay it back theyre going to track me down and do something to me something to mama and lena he sat back down looked at her intently youre a liar you want to try to soak me for a quick five k so you can score some drugs and get out of town you figure me for an easy mark but you figure wrong if it wasnt for lena id give you a couple hundred to send you along but you see lilibeth there is lena she wouldnt like it she hurled the water in his face he barely blinked fuck you i thought we already established that wasnt an option think youre so smart dont you so important because you come from money she pushed to her feet big fancy highfalutin family i found out all about you declan fitzgerald let me ask you just what that big fancy highfalutin familys going to think when they hear youre heating the sheets with a cajun swamp whore the phrase had something clutching in his gut in the back of his throat in his head her face changed in front of his eyes became fuller older colder josephine get out he wasnt sure not entirely if he spoke to the fleshandblood woman or to the ghost his hands shook as he gripped the edge of the table all those fine doctors and lawyers and indian chiefs up there in boston how are they gonna like the idea of their golden boy hooking up with some bastard child from the bayou no money no pedigree runs a secondrate bar and has a grandmama who sews for other people to earn extra pennies gonna cut you right out of the will sugar leave you high and dry with this big white elephant of a house on your hands especially when i tell them you slept with her mama too his legs were weak as water but he stood on them get out of my house before i hurt you your type doesnt lay hands on a woman dont think i dont know the difference riding on coke and confidence she tossed back her hair you wanna keep plugging your wick into my girl and you wanna keep your family out of it youll write me a check cher youll write it quick fast and in a hurry and were going to make it ten thousand now because you hurt my feelings your feelings arent worth a buck and a half to me lilibeth they will be after i have a little chat with your mama my mother will chew you up and spit you out he walked to the counter yanked open a drawer and took out a pad scrawled a number on it here thats her number call her you can use my phone as long as i can listen in itll be a real pleasure to hear her slice you to bloodless pieces i need money you wont get it here out of patience he grabbed her arm and pulled her to the door i can make a lot more trouble for you than you can for me believe it he said and shut the door in her face he had to sit down until he had his legs under him again he felt ill physically ill something had happened when shed raged at him over lena the face that had become her face was one hed seen in his dreams the face belonged to the house or to the part of it that slammed doors that wished him away that wished him harm no doubt now he told himself that lenas mother now wished him harm as well he rose went to the phone one positive result of the ugly incident was it had made him appreciate his own mother he dialed and felt cleaner at the familiar sound of her voice hi ma declan what are you doing calling in the middle of the day whats wrong you had an accident no i was all those horrible tools youve cut off a hand i still have two and all other assigned parts i just called to tell you i love you there was a long pregnant pause youve just

danny boy i really dont id as soon rest in peace so noted what is it really declan i want to tell you about the woman im in love with and want to marry this pause was even longer is this a joke no got a couple minutes i think i can rearrange my schedule for this okay he walked over picked up his iced tea the ice had melted but he glugged it down anyway her names angelina simone and shes beautiful fascinating frustrating hardheaded and perfect shes just perfect ma when do i meet her remys wedding theres this one minor glitch other than the one where she isnt ready to say yes im sure you can overcome that minor detail whats the glitch he sat down again and told her about lilibeth by the time he got off the phone he felt lighter going with impulse he went upstairs to clean up and change he was going to confront lena a bit ahead of schedule declan detoured by remys office on the way to et trois the wedding was approaching quickly and his duties as best man included coordinating the bachelor party though he figured the big picture was clear enough enough booze to float a battleship and a strip club there were some finer details to work out when reception buzzed through to remys office he heard his friends almost frantic send him right in the minute he opened the office door he saw why effie tears streaking down her cheeks sat in one of the visitor chairs with remy crouched at her feet though remy kept mopping at the tears kept trying to comfort he shot declan a look of sheer male panic in a testament to friendship declan resisted the urge to back out and run instead he closed the door crossed over and rubbed effies shoulder sweetheart i told you id tell him you were dumping him for me effie merely looked up then covered her face with her hands and sobbed okay bad joke declan scrubbed nowsweaty palms over his jeans whats wrong problem with the wedding venue remy began and effie let out a wail there is no wedding venue she snatched remys handkerchief buried her face in it they had they had a kitchen fire and the fire department came and they they oh whatre we going to do smoke and water damage remy explained to declan over and above the fire damage theyre not going to be able to put it back together in time its my fault mirroring remy declan crouched okay honey whyd you start the fire it made her laugh for a split second i wanted to use that old plantation house its romantic and so lovely remy said itll all be easier booking a hotel ballroom but no i just had to have my way and now look weve got less than three weeks and were were just sunk thats all no were not honey well find another place pleure pas chhre remy kissed the tip of her nose worse comes to worst well have the wedding then well have our party later well have us a real fais dodo after the honeymoon where are we going to get married city hall i dont care where we get married now he kissed her fingers long as we do she sniffled sighed leaned into him im sorry im being silly and selfish youre right it doesnt matter where or how sure it does declans statement had them both staring at him effie with tears still swirling remy with baffled frustration you cant let a little fire screw up your plans use my place what do you mean your place remy demanded the hall sure as hell big enough ballroom needs some work but theres time i have to strongarm some painters but i finished the entrance this morning gardens are in really good shape kitchens done parlors library lots of rough spots yet but people wont care about that theyll get the house the grounds the ghosts theyll talk about it for years do you mean it effie snagged declans hands before remy could speak sure i do we can pull it off dec remy began but effie rolled right over him oh god oh i love you she threw her arms around declans neck youre the most wonderful man in the world an angel she said and kissed him a saint do you mind declan said to remy wed like to be alone laughing effie spun to her feet oh i shouldnt let you do this youll have all those strangers roaming around your house trooping all over your lawn but im going to let you because im desperate and its so perfect i swear i swear you wont have to do any of the work ill take care of everything im going to owe you till my dying day giving me your firstborn son will be payment enough remy sat on the edge of the desk and shook his head i say ill marry you anywhere anytime all he does is give you a brokendown house and hes the one gets kissed i already got you but she turned wrapped her arms around remy and with a sigh rested her head on his shoulder i want it to be beautiful remy i want it to be special it means a lot to me i know it does so it means a lot to me too well have us some party wont we we will she gave him one last squeeze then whirled away the sad sobbing woman was replaced by a dervish can i go out now she asked declan i need to get my mother and my sister and well go out right now and start figuring it all out go ahead thank you she kissed his cheek thank you then the other thank you then his mouth with a long drawnout smack remy you come on out soon as you can oh dec she was pulling out her cell phone as she headed for the door my bride colors are rose and blue you dont mind if we have the house painted those colors do you his mouth dropped open as she shut the door behind her she was kidding right probably knowing his girl and the pack she ran with remy blew out a breath cher you dont know what you just got yourself into you made my girl happy and im grateful but i gotta tell you youre in for a couple weeks of pure insanity i couldnt stand seeing her crying like that besides it makes sense rose and blue he thought how much trouble could they get into with nice harmless colors like rose and blue anyway he added rubbing a hand over his sinking heart ive been through wedding plans before you havent met her mother before declan shifted his feet is she scary pretty scary hold me good deeds put him in a good mood when he walked into et trois he was ready for a cold one a selfcongratulatory pat on the back and lena she was behind the bar pulling a draft and chatting up one of her regulars he watched her gaze wash over then land on him stay on him as he walked up flipped up the passthrough she had time to slide the foaming mug across the bar to waiting hands start to turn before he lifted her off her feet and planted his lips on hers the scattering of applause and hoots had him grinning as he held her an inch off the floor missed you she rubbed her tingling lips together your aim seemed good to me she patted his cheek gave him that quick wicked gleam now down boy im working here youre going to need someone to cover for you im busy cher go on and sit down ill get you a beer he just hitched her up giving her legs a little swing so he could get his arm under them he elbowed the door to the bar kitchen lena needs you to cover for her he called back then nodded toward the passthrough mind he asked the man sipping the draft sure thing declan she didnt struggle bad for the image im running a business here and you do a damn good job of it thanks he added when the man flipped up the passthrough it ought to run fine without you for a half hour he nodded as his new friend hustled over and opened the door for him he carried her outside they got a few glances as he walked down the sidewalk and turned into her courtyard i dont like being pushed around cher im not pushing you im carrying you wheres your spare key he asked as he climbed the stairs when she said nothing he shrugged fine were going to get arrested for doing what i plan on doing out here on your gallery but im game under the pot second from the left good to her shock he shifted her slinging her over his shoulder as he crouched down to retrieve the key she continually underestimated his strength and she admitted her reaction to it youve dropped a couple of pounds he commented and unlocked her door good i beg your pardon she said in her best frigid southernbelle tone i figure its because youve been pining for me youre going to want to get a grip cher got one he said and reached up to squeeze her butt as he kicked the door closed i cant tell you how flattered i am that youd take time out of your busy day to come into town for a quickie but i was excellent idea it wasnt my first order of business but why wait he hitched her more securely on his shoulder and headed for the bedroom declan youre starting to seriously irritate me now youd better just put me down and was she lost the rest and the air in her lungs when he flipped her onto the bed he could see her eyes glittering dangerously behind her hair before she shoved it out of her face and that he thought was perfect he was in the mood for the fast and the physical the sweaty and the sexy what the hells gotten into you you come marching into my place like you own it cart me off like im spoils of war if you think im here to scratch your itch whenever it suits you youre about to find out different he merely grinned yanked off a shoe and tossed it aside put that back on or hobble out either way i want you gone he pulled off the other shoe then his shirt her response to that was to scramble to her knees and spit out in cajun so rapid and thick he caught only about every sixth word sorry he said in mild tones as he unbuttoned his jeans that was a little quick for me did you say i was a pig who should fry in hell or that i should go to hell and eat fried pig he was ready when she leaped and laughing as she swiped at him it was time for a fast tumble fast and violent and her clawing nails and bared teeth added the perfect punch she slapped cursed kicked then bucked like a wild mare when he crushed her under him on the bed and covered her snarling mouth with his in a hot hungry kiss not what you expect from me is it breathless and randy he tore at her shirt given you too much of what you expect so far stop it stop it now her heart sprinted under his rough hand no it wasnt what she expected from him any more than her electrified response to his dominance was what she expected from herself look at me he clamped her hands on either side of her head tell me you dont want me that you dont want this say it and mean it and im gone let go of my hands though her gaze remained steady her voice shook you let go of my hands he released one say it his muscles quivered you want or you dont she fisted a hand in his hair and dragged his mouth back to hers jai besoin i need she used her teeth gnawing restlessly at his lips used her legs wrapping them around to chain him to her take me she demanded fast fast and rough his hand shot beneath the short snug skirt tore away the thin panties beneath sweat already slicked his skin and hers as she arched to him hold on he warned and plunged into her she cried out as the explosive sensation ripped through her cried out again as he drove deeper harder filled invaded took until needs frantic outrageous needs swarmed through her her nails scored down his back pinched into his hips de plus en plus more and more her mind screamed more she managed i want more so did he he shoved her knees back opened her and hammered himself inside her it burned his lungs his heart his loins the ferocious heat the unspeakable pleasure of going wild with her hazed his vision until the world was drenched with it white sun beating through the windows the brassy blast of a trumpet from the street the mad squeak of springs as slick skin slapped rhythmically against slick skin and her eyes dark and glossy as onyx locked on his i love you endlessly he didnt know if he spoke or if the words simply ran a desperate loop in his brain but he saw her eyes change watched emotion swirl into them blind them he heard her sob for breath felt her vise around him as she came helpless half mad he shattered and poured into her out of breath out of his mind he collapsed onto her beneath him she continued to quake to quiver and shudder those aftershocks of eruption then she was still cant move yet he mumbled he felt hollowed out light as a husk that could be happily blown apart by the slightest breeze dont need to her lips were against the side of his throat and their movement there brought him an exquisite tenderness a rainbow after the storm would you believe i came in to talk to you no did figured wed get to this after change of plans i owe you a shirt and some underwear ive got more hed recovered just enough to prop on his elbows and look down at her her cheeks were flushed and glowing curls of damp hair clung to her temples spilled over the rumpled spread he wanted to lap her up like a cat with cream pissing you off got me hot he told her me too seems like i wasnt going to do this with you again werent you no she laid a hand on his cheek amazed by the wave of tenderness id made up my mind about it then you come into my place all sexy and goodlooking scoop me up that way you mess with my mind cher you just go and unmake it for me time and again youre everything i want and nothing thats good for you go on she gave his shoulder a little push get off me two of us are a sweaty mess well take a shower then well talk talk he repeated when she raised a brow scouts honor he held up two fingers ive got to get back to work angelina all right she waved him away it was she knew no use arguing with him god knew why she found that muleheaded streak of his so appealing go get yourself cleaned up ill call down and make sure everythings covered for the next little while she stepped into the shower just as he got out he imagined shed timed it that way to avoid the intimacy giving her room he went to the kitchen found the expected pitcher of tea and poured two glasses when she came in wearing that same sexy skirt and a fresh shirt he offered her a glass she took it into the living room in the last few days shed resigned herself to what needed to be throughout part of her had indeed pined for him and every time shed caught herself glancing toward the bar door looking for him or waking up in the night reaching for him shed cursed herself for being a weak fool then shed glanced at the door and there he was her own soaring pleasure depthless relief had annoyed her even before hed nipped at her pride by plucking her out of her own bar declan she began i wasnt fair to you the other day i wasnt in the mood to be fair if youre going to apologize for it save it i wanted to make you mad id rather see you angry than sad she makes you both i suppose she does mostly i hate knowing shes out there with grandmama knowing shell hurt her again i cant stop it i cant fix it that troubles me but you shouldnt have been brought into it you didnt bring me into it it happened he angled his head correct me if im wrong youve got the impression that since i come from where and who i come from im not equipped to handle the darker the more difficult the stickier aspects of life your life in particular cher im not saying youre not tough but this particular aspect of life my life is out of your scope you wouldnt understand someone like her since ive been so sheltered he nodded she came to see me today the healthy flush sex and heat had put in lenas cheeks drained what do you mean lilibeth paid me a call around noon i debated whether to tell you about it or not and decided that im not going to keep secrets from you or tell lies not even to spare your feelings she came by invited herself in for a cold one then she tried to seduce me im sorry her lips felt stiff and ice cold as she formed the words her throat burned like fire it wont happen again ill see to it shut up do i look like i need your protection and save your outrage until im done he told her when she reached for my zipper i told her not to embarrass herself her next tack was to fling herself down on the kitchen table and cry he eased down on the arm of lenas sofa the tone of conversation he thought in some corner of his brain didnt lend itself to lounging among all those soft colorful pillows she didnt manage to work up many tears along with the noise but i give her marks for effort the story was how bad mean people were after her theyd hurt her you miss odette if she didnt give them five thousand dollars where could she turn what could she do color rushed back into lenas face rode high on her cheekbones you gave her money how could you believe was first a sheltered wimp now a moron he gave an exaggerated sigh and sipped his tea youre really pumping up the ego here baby i didnt give her a dime and let her know clearly i wasnt going to be hosed that irritated her into threatening to go to my family seems shes asked around about me and got the picture she figured theyd be shocked and shamed by the idea of their fair haired boy falling under your spell for good measure shed tell them id fucked her too she could do it it was more than the cold now the sickness roiled in her belly declan shes perfectly capable of was didnt i tell you to wait until i was finished his voice didnt whip didnt sting it was simply implacable the cost doubled to ten thousand for this spot of blackmail i dont think she was pleased with my response i kicked her out thats about it so you can be outraged now if you want dont cry he spoke roughly when her eyes filled shes not worth one tear from you im mortified cant you understand yes though were both smart enough to know this had nothing to do with you i understand and im sorry for it sorry to add to it its not you its never been you she wiped a tear from her lashes before it could fall thats what ive been trying to get through your head from the start its not you either lena its never been you i looked at her i looked close and hard and theres nothing there thats part of you familys the luck of the draw lena what you make of yourself because of or despite it thats where the spine and heart come in ill never be rid of her not all the way no matter what i do no you wont im sorry no damn it i will say it she snapped when his face tightened im sorry she came into your home im sorry she touched on your family i need to ask you not to say anything about this to my grandmama why would i she nodded then rising wandered the room she loved this place because shed made it herself she respected her life for the same reasons now because she cared for because she respected the man who was so determined to be part of her life shed explain she left me before i was two weeks old she began just went out one morning got in her mamas car and drove off dumped the car in baton rouge i was three before she came back around your father she shrugged depends on her mood once she told me it was a boy she loved and who loved her but his parents tore them apart and sent him far away another time she told me she was raped on the way home from school still another it was a rich older man who was going to come back for both of us one day and set us up in a fine house she turned back so she could face him i was about eighteen when i figured she told me the truth she was high enough careless enough mean enough for it to be the truth how the hell should she know she said there were plenty of them what the hell did she care who planted me in her one was the same as the other she was whoring when she got pregnant with me i heard talk when i was old enough to understand what the talk meant when she got in trouble she ran back to my grandparents she was afraid of an abortion afraid shed die of it then go to hell or some such thing so she had me and she left me those are the only two things in this world i owe her she drew a breath made herself sit again anyway she came back when i was three made what would become her usual promises that shed learned her lesson she was sorry shed changed she stayed around a few days then took off again thats a pattern thats repeated since sometimes shed come back beat up from whatever bastard shed taken up with most recently sometimes shed come back sick or just high but lilibeth she always comes back she fell silent brooding over that single unavoidable fact it hurts when she does declan said quietly hurts you hurts miss odette she hurts everyone its her only talent she was high when she showed up on my thirteenth birthday we were having a fais dodo at the house all the friends and family and she stoned with some lowlife it got ugly pretty quick and three of my uncles turned them off i need a smoke she said and left the room she came back a moment later with a cigarette i had a boy i was seeing crazy about that boy i was sixteen and she came back she got him liquor and drugs and had sex with him he was hardly older than i was so its hard to blame him for being an idiot she thought it was funny when i stumbled over them out in the bayou she laughed and laughed still when i got this apartment and she came back i took her in better me than grandmama i thought and maybe this time just maybe but she turned tricks in my bed and brought her drugs into my home she stole from me and she left me again from then ive been done with her im done with her and ill never be done with her declan nothing i can do changes her being my mother and nothing she does can change who you are youre a testament to your own grit lena and a credit to the people who raised you she hates you for what you are she stared at him she hates me she whispered ive never been able to say that to anyone before why should saying such a thing such an awful thing help so much i wont say she cant hurt you any more because she can but maybe now she wont be able to hurt you as much or for as long thoughtfully she tapped out her cigarette i keep underestimating you thats okay that way i can keep surprising you hows this one shes connected to manet hall what do you mean i dont know exactly and cant explain it i just know she is and i think maybe she was meant to come back now to say what she said to me one more link in the chain and i think shes pretty well done around here this time out call your grandmother lena dont let this woman put a wedge between you ive been thinking of it i guess i will declan she picked up her glass set it down again the useless gesture made him raise his eyebrows i was going to end things between us you couldve tried i mean it wed both be better off if we stepped back a ways tried to be friends of some sort we can be friends i want our children to have parents who like each other she threw up her hands i have to get back to work okay but listen speaking of weddings slight change of plans in remy and effies were having the whole deal at my place she rubbed her temple tried to switch gears and moods as smoothly as he did in with half finished rooms and tools and lumber and was thats a very negative attitude and not at all helpful especially since i was going to ask you for a hand how are you with a paintbrush she let out a sigh do you save everyone just the ones who matter somewhere between declans leaving the hall and effies arrival lilibeth paid another call she was riding on coke and insult the lousy son of a bitch couldnt spare a few bucks for the mother of the woman he was screwing shed just help herself shed cased the first floor when hed led her back to the kitchen and going in through the back she arrowed straight to the library and the big rolltop desk shed spotted people with money kept cash handy in her experience moving quickly she yanked open drawers riffled through then let out a shout when she found a neat pile of fifties those she stuffed into her pocket she figured the books hed shelved and the ones yet in boxes were probably worth something but theyd be heavy and hard to sell hed likely have more cash a few pieces of jewelry up in his bedroom she raced up the main stairs the fact that he could come back at any time only added to the thrill of stealing a door slammed had her falling straight to her knees just a draft she told herself as she caught her breath as the pulse in her throat began to pop big drafty old house in fact she felt cold air whisk over her as she jumped to her feet again she touched a doorknob yanked her hand away again the knob was so cold it all but burned didnt matter what the fuck his room was down the hall she wasnt as stupid as people thought she was hadnt she watched the house over the last few days hadnt she seen him come out on the gallery from the room at the far corner laughing out loud the sound rolling back over her she dashed down streaked through the open door she yanked open the top drawer of a dresser and hit pay dirt with the old carved box inside gold cuff links at least she assumed they were real gold silver ones too with some sort of fancy blue stone diamond studs a gold watch and in a box inside the box a womans ring of ruby maybe diamond and ruby fashioned in interlocking hearts she set the box on the dresser hunted through a couple more drawers until she found another wad of cash paid anyway didnt you you bastard paid just fine she tossed the bills into the jewelry box tucked the box under her arm standing there her breath whistling out in excitement cocaine dancing in her blood she debated the satisfaction of trashing the place it would be satisfying more payment but it wasnt smart and she was smart she needed time to turn the jewelry into cash time to turn some of the cash into drugs time to get the hell out of dodge best to leave things as they were shed go out the other side just in case her longnosed mama was looking this way but when she stepped back into the hall she found herself staring at the third floor stairs what was up there she wondered maybe something good maybe something she could come back for later something that would make her rich her breath wasnt just whistling now but wheezing her skin was ice cold but she couldnt resist the urge to climb those stairs she was alone in the house wasnt she all alone and that made it her house it was her house swallowing continually to wet her dry throat she started up shivering voices how could she hear voices when there was no one there but they stopped her urged her to turn back something wrong here something bad here time to go but it seemed hands pressed to her back pushed her on until with trembling fingers she reached for the door she meant to ease it open slowly just take a peek but at the touch of her hand it swung violently open she saw the man and woman on the floor heard the baby screaming in the crib saw the womans eyes staring and blind and dead and the man his hair gold in the dim light turned to look at her lilibeth tried to scream but couldnt grab the air as she opened her mouth something pushed into her for one horrifying moment it became her then it swept through her cold vicious furious another figure formed in the room female sturdy in a long night robe julian and in speechless terror lilibeth turned and ran within twentyfour hours declan discovered he had more help on the house than he knew what to do with apparently everyone in louisiana was invited to the wedding and they were all willing to lend a hand he had painters plumbers carpenters and gofers and though it occurred to him in the middle of the melee that if half that amount had pitched in to repair the original venue the job would have been done in about twenty minutes he decided to keep the thought to himself it seemed rude to voice it and he appreciated the labor sincerely reminded himself of it whenever he felt certain pieces of the house slipping away from him into someone elses charge hed been looking forward to screening in the lower rear gallery himself but comforted himself that one good hurricane would demand rescreening hed intended to sand and varnish the ballroom floors but bucked up when he thought of all the other floors waiting for him throughout the house and he sure as hell didnt mind turning over the exterior painting to others it was a hot exacting and laborious job and crossing it off his list left him free to tackle the downstairs powder room and to hang the blownglass chandelier hed bought for the foyer and to finish plans for the mud room and well there was plenty to go around he reflected then there was the pure pleasure of watching effie zip in and out on her lunch hour or after work even when she brought her mother in tow mrs renault was a spitandpolished older version of her daughter with an eye like an eagle and a voice like a drill sergeant remy was right she was pretty scary declan hid from her whenever possible and without shame on the second day of the fullout campaign declan strode toward the rear gallery to check progress he was feeling pretty peppy from the tile hed just set was covered with ceramic dust from cutting it the noise level was amazing voices radios power tools as much as he enjoyed people hed have given a thousand dollars for five minutes alone in his house jim ready i want those windows sparkling you hear hows it going to look in the wedding pictures if those windows are dull put your back into it boy the sound of mrs renaults voice had declan turning sharply on his heel and changing direction he all but bowled over odette hey sorry you all right i didnt see you i was running away you got a houseful youre right about that if this place isnt fixed up enough to suit general renault by dday were all going to be shot he took her arm as he spoke and thinking only of selfpreservation hustled her into the library shut the doors can i come live at your house she smiled a curve of lips that didnt reach her eyes youre such a good boy declan doing all this for your friend im not doing much more right now than staying the hell out of the way and youd rather all these people go back where they came from and leave you be so you can play with your house yeah well he shrugged pushed his dusty hand through his dusty hair therell still be plenty to do once they go were not touching the third floor or the servants area and only doing one other room on the second tell me whats wrong miss odette i gotta work up to it she set down the shopping bag she carried then walked over to look at some of his books there were still boxes of them to be shelved but she saw what it would be towers of words some old and worn some fresh and new small treasures deep colors you got vision she said at length you picture what you want then you make it happen thats a fine skill cher some people call it singleminded youre anything but youve got a lot of channels in that head of yours working on one at a time till its done shows character to me im awful fond of you declan im awful fond of you too i wish youd sit down miss odette you look tired and troubled why dont i get us a cold drink no dont you trouble and risk getting shanghaied by sarah jane renault now thats a singleminded individual and i dont fault her for it she told me to get a haircut by the end of the week so i dont look shaggy or freshly shorn for the wedding sulking over it a little declan ran a testing hand through his hair and that shell be putting fancy soaps towels and so on in all the bathrooms the day before the wedding im not to use them under penalty of death and im to get more green plants inside the house a house cant breathe without green plants shes just nervous honey effies her baby her youngest daughter odette pressed her lips together declan im shamed to say what i have to say to you and i wont blame you if after im done you ask me not to come back in your home again the words alarmed him nearly as much as the pain in her eyes theres nothing you can say that would make you unwelcome in my home miss odette who hurt you oh mon dieu if this spoils what i see between you and my lena ill never forgive myself my daughter stole from you she blurted out she came in your house and took what was yours with a heavy heart she reached into her bag took out his carved box this was in her room i knew it was yours even before i looked in and saw a set of cuff links with your initials i dont know if its all here but thats all there was if anythings missing was lets just see i want you to sit down now i mean it she nodded sank into a chair he chained down his rage as he set the box on a table opened it he saw the ring box first opened it and felt the worst of the anger fade when the stones glittered up at him okay he breathed out the most important things still here as was as far as he could see everything else but the couple thousand in twenties he kept secured with the money clip that had been his greatgrandfathers its all here youre not telling me the truth odette said dully a little cash thats all i need to know how much so i can pay it back do you think id take money from you some of the anger lashed out made her wince look at my face do you think id take money from you for this for anything her lips wanted to quiver so she pressed them into a firm line shes my responsibility the hell she is dont insult me again by talking about restitution despite her promise not to shed one in front of him a tear spilled over i know what she is and i know shell never be what i hoped for worked for wished for from the moment i knew she was inside me but she gave me lena she dug out a tissue patted her cheeks there would be no more tears i expected shed steal from me before she took off again but i didnt think shed take from you i never thought of it and im sorry for that you want to look at my face again and see if i blame you no you dont blame me oh i want you for my lena im sitting here knowing my child stole from you and all i can think is i want you for my baby good thing because i want me for her too he picked up the ring box crossed over to her chair i bought this for her maybe you could put in a good word for me so when i give it to her she takes it odette looked at the ring and sighed suits her sure does suit her shes got a good heart declan but its got scars on it shes so strong sometimes i worry shes too strong and shell forget how to give ill have to tell her about this yes and youll have to figure out how to keep her from pulling away from you when she knows thats what shell want to do dont worry wheres lilibeth gone i found this in her room this morning shes barely come out of there since the day before when i went in and found it i put it away where she wouldnt find it then we had words about it she packed up and left shell come back she said in the same hollow tone hed heard from lena in a year or two and well go through it once more well deal with it when it happens he leaned down kissed her cheek i love you when her eyes filled again he took her hand whether lenas ready for it or not were family now family sticks when i meet your mama odette managed im gonna give her one big rib cracking hug thatll set her up why dont we take a look at whats happening around here and you can protect me from general renault he didnt expect it to take long and wasnt disappointed about the time most of his free labor was packing up for the day and effie and her mother had him out in the back garden lena strode around the side of the house since he was in the middle of the series of uhhuhs youbets and noproblems that had become his litany of responses to the renault womens wedding agenda he decided the confrontation in lenas eyes would be a relief the railings and baluster will be wrapped in tulle and lace uhhuh and well have baskets white baskets of flowers set out on the gallery there you bet the florist will need to start early on the day of the wedding so you just scoot out of the way and make sure they have access to all the areas of the house ive got marked off on my chart here no problem lena he reached out and clutched her hand a drowning man grabbing a rope were just talking about flower arrangements flowers are the landscape of a wedding mrs renault declared and made more notations on the clipboard she carried everywhere how are you lena im just fine miss sarah jane isnt this exciting counting right down to the big day effie you must be half mad with the details ive passed half working toward pure insanity itll all be beautiful she kept her smile bright her voice light even as the dark heat coursed through her those rhododendrons are going to be spectacular on your day the gardens are going to be a sight mrs renault agreed and ran down her checklist again pity though there wasnt time to put up an arbor train some sweet peas up she looked over the tops of her reading glasses at declan with a faintly accusatory gleam maybe the franks can rig something ah can you excuse me a minute theres something i need to show lena he escaped pulling her toward the steps to the secondfloor gallery there was still some of general renaults militia on the lower level theyre like ants he babbled crawling out of the woodwork when youre not looking whatre you talking about p everywhere watch that bucket i think the ballrooms safe feeling a little pressed are you cher im thinking of a nice vacation in maui until this is over ive got to say i admire women really she glanced down at the ladders the tarps the debris of construction and the two women picking their way through it with visions of tulle and lace in their heads why is that you can be spitting mad and still carry on a polite conversation about rhododendrons he peeked through the ballroom doors sighed all clear anyway when most guys work up a head of steam it spews well he stepped inside what do you think the walls were a pale rose the floor gold and gleaming its big itll need to be for this little do the general says weve got twofifty coming otherwise you can use the pocket doors to turn it into a couple of parlors he crossed the floor drew one of the big doors out of its slot isnt this amazing he trailed his fingers over the carved wood reverently the craftsmanship in these more than a hundred years ago i hate hiding them see how the pattern matches the ceiling medallions tibald did a hell of a job restoring those she had worked up a head of steam since her conversation with her grandmother but found it dispersing now as she watched his undiluted pleasure and pride its true love isnt it you and this house most men dont look at a woman the way you look at those doors i look at you that way she had to turn away you make it damn hard to hold onto a mad tell me why youre not mad declan why arent you mad she stole from you i am and if i have occasion to see her again shell know it you should go to the police i thought about it i might get some of the money back but it would embarrass miss odette shes already embarrassed i know why add to it i got back the things that mattered the bitterness gushed through her anew she came in your house she went through your things she took from you he lifted a brow at the tone of her voice working up that steam again goddamn it goddamn it declan she violated your home its not like taking from me or grandmama how much did she take couple thousand the muscles in lenas jaw tightened ill have you a check tomorrow you know ill tear it up put it away lena i figure it was a cheap lesson if youre going to live in the country have a houseful of valuables and spare cash you dont walk off and leave it unlocked and unattended shed have broken a window yeah thats why im getting a couple of dogs always wanted a pack of dogs i thought id go to the shelter after the wedding want to come with me she just shook her head you lose two thousand dollars and i bet it was more to a thieving junkie and your response is to buy some dogs figured id get some fun out of it how about it theyll be your dogs too stop it declan uhuh with a satisfied smirk on his face he walked toward her lets get us a couple mongrel puppies lena theyll be good practice before the kids come along you get your own puppies but hed teased a smile out of her and run around after them when they pee on your rugs and chew on your shoes maybe rufus will teach them their manners youre wearing my earrings he said as he slipped his arms around her and glided into a dance theyre my earrings now you think of me when you put them on maybe then i think how nice they look on me and i forget all about you well then ill have to find other ways to remind you a necklace she skimmed her fingers up the nape of his neck into his hair couple of nice glittery bracelets i was thinking of a toe ring she laughed eased in closer so that she could rest her cheek on his they were waltzing and a tune was playing in her head one shed heard him hum or whistle countless times she could smell his workday on him the sweat the dust and under it the faint faint drift of soap from his morning shower his cheek was a little rough against hers as hed neglected to shave if life were a fairy tale she thought they could stay just like this waltzing around and around on the satiny floor while the sun slid down the flowers rioted and the lights from hundreds of tiny crystal prisms showered over them ive got such feelings for you more than i ever had for anyone or wanted to i dont know what to do with them give them to me he pleaded turning his lips into her hair ill take good care of them she hadnt realized shed spoken aloud hadnt meant to now when she would have drawn back he pulled her closer so close so tight she couldnt get her breath her head spun and the music inside it soared the strong scent of lilies rose up and almost smothered her do you hear it his hands trembled as he gripped her arms violins i cant his voice sounded far off and as she fought to focus on his face another seemed to float over it im dizzy lets sit down he kept his hands on her arms lowered them both to the floor you heard it too the music you felt it too just hold on a minute she had to regain her bearings the room was empty but for the two of them there was no music no crystal light no pots heaped with fragrant white lilies yet she had heard seen smelled i didnt know hallucinations were catching its not hallucination its memory somehow its memory theyd have danced here lucian and abigail like we were loved each other like we do when she shook her head he swore all right damn it he loved her the way i love you and theres something still alive between them maybe something that needs to be finished or just acknowledged were here lena yes were here and im not living someone elses life its not like that it felt like that and living someone elses life might just mean dying someone elses death he drowned himself in that pond outside there and she was she died in this house lena took a calming breath depending on whose story you believe i know she did upstairs in the nursery something happened to her up there and he never knew he grieved himself to death not knowing i need to find out for him and for myself i need you to help me what can i do come to the nursery with me were closer now maybe youll remember this time declan she took his face in her hands theres nothing for me to remember you hang witch bottles out in my tree but sit here denying any possibility of reincarnation which you brought into the mix in the first place thats not what im doing theres nothing for me to remember because im not abigail you are she might as well have slipped on a pair of brass knuckles and plowed her fist into his stomach the shock of her words had him reeling get out thats not possible why not because flustered oddly embarrassed he pushed to his feet youre trying to say i was a girl i dont know why thats such a shock to your system a lot of us get along just fine female i dont im not i wasnt it makes the most sense if any of this makes sense no sense none no way youre the one who keeps hearing the baby cry shed never seen him quite so flustered mothers do before anyone else and youre drawn to that room upstairs the way a mother would be to her baby even though the room scares you youre pulled back you said how you wandered through the servants wing how easy it was to find your way shed have known it but why would lucian it was his house but he remembered how hed imagined looking out the window imagined seeing the two men riding toward the house why would he imagine seeing lucian riding home if hed been lucian a couple other things lena continued one telling one that day when i came along and saw you walking toward the pond trancelike you walked oddly i couldnt figure out what it was about the way you walked that struck me but now i know you were walking the way a very pregnant woman walks waddling a bit she said as he turned and gaped at her with something like horror a hand pressed to the small of your back small careful steps now youre saying i wasnt just a girl but a pregnant girl oh for heavens sake cher some people believe you can come back as a poodle whats so bad about a pregnant woman because pregnant women go into labor at a certain point then have to push several pounds of baby out of a very limited space the horror on his face was comical and enough to have her relaxing into the theory i dont think youll have to repeat that performance in this life have you considered that if you look at this puzzle from this new angle you might find the answers you want he found himself wanting to rub at his crotch just to make sure everything was where it should be maybe work up a good manly belch i like it better the other way keep an open mind cher ive got to get to work wait a minute wait a minute he dashed after her youre just going to drop this bombshell on me then leave ive got to work for a living come back after closing stay i need to stay at grandmamas for a night or two till shes feeling steadier okay okay he let out a breath when they reached the main floor let me try this he spun her around crushed his mouth to hers then took the kiss deep and dreamy you didnt get any lesbiantype vibe from that did you he asked when he drew back hmm she touched her tongue to her top lip pretended to consider no i can attest that youre all man this time around now shoo youve got plenty to do the next few days to keep your mind occupied this whole things waited a hundred years it can wait till after remys wedding come back and stay when miss odettes feeling better all right i love you lena im afraid you do she whispered and walked away lena left the bar as early as she could manage but it was still after one in the morning when she pulled up to the bayou house the porch light was burning and the moths seduced to death by it she sat for a moment listening to the music of the frogs and night birds and the teasing whisper of a faint breeze this was the place of her girlhood perhaps the place of her heart though shed made her life in the city it was here she came when she was most happy or most troubled here she came to think her deepest thoughts or dream her most secret dreams shed let herself dream once those innate female dreams of romance and a handsome man to love her of home and children and sunday mornings when had she stopped that sticky summer afternoon she admitted that hot hazy day when shed seen the boy shed loved with all her wild heart and foolish youth coupling like an animal with her mother on a ragged blanket in the marsh the marsh that was hers the boy that was hers the mother that was hers it had sliced her life in two she thought now the time before when there was still hope and innocent dreams and faith and the time after where there was only ambition determination and a steely vow never never to believe again the boy didnt matter now she knew she could barely see his face in her mind her mother didnt matter not at the core of it but the moment mattered without it who knew what direction her life would have taken oh she and the boy would have parted ways soon enough but it mightve been with some sweetness it might have left her with some soft memory of first loves but that stark vision of sex and betrayal had forged her shed understood then what it might have taken her years to learn otherwise that a woman was smarter safer to drive the train herself men came men went and enjoying them was fine loving them was suicide suicide she shook her head as she climbed out of the car that was overly dramatic wasnt it heartbreak wasnt death hed died from it she all but heard the voice in her head it hadnt been the knife wound it hadnt been the pond that had killed lucian manet it had been a broken heart she let herself into the house and immediately saw the spill of light from odettes room even as she approached lena heard the quick thumpthump of rufuss tail on the floor she stepped to the doorway cocked her head odette was sitting up in bed a book open on her lap the faithful dog curled on the floor what are you doing up so late waiting for my baby i didnt think youd be back for another hour or more business was light enough to spare me odette patted the side of the bed in invitation you took off early because you were worried about me you shouldnt you used to tell me worrying was your job lena lay down on top of the sheets her head in the curve of her grandmothers arm now its mine too im sorry she hurt you oh baby i think that must be her job god knows shes good at it odette stroked lenas hair i got you though i got my lena i was thinking what it was like for you and grandpapa to raise a baby after youd already raised your own you were nothing but pure pleasure to both of us it made me think about how the manets brought your grandmama back here when she was a baby you remember her pretty well dont you i remember her very well youve the look of her youve seen the old pictures so you know that did she ever say how the hall shouldve been hers never heard her say anything like she was a happy woman lena maybe happier here than she wouldve been in the hall had things been different she had a fine hand with baking and that she passed to me she told good stories too sometimes when id come spend time with her shed make them up just like they were real i think she couldve been a writer if shed wanted that for herself she m ve thought of her parents and the manets no matter how happy she was here she m ve thought of them i expect so she used to take flowers to her papas grave took them every year on her birthday did she you never told me that said she owed him life hers her children her grandchildren she even laid flowers on the graves of josephine and henri manet though she never stopped there to say a prayer and she did one more thing on her birthday every year until she died she took flowers and tossed them into the river and there she said a prayer for her mother you think she never said but thats what i think and do you think thats where abigail is in the river some say lena raised her head im not asking some im asking you i know sometimes i walk along the bank and i feel an awful sadness and i think sometimes old souls search for new life and keep searching until it comes out right whatre you searching for lena laid her head down again closed her eyes i thought id found it now im not so sure he loves me grandmama i know he does if i love him back everything changes odette smiled leaned over to shut off the light it surely does she murmured and continued to stroke lenas hair it surely does as host of remys bachelor party declan felt socially obligated to stay till the bitter end the bitter end was some dingy backstreet dive in the quarter where the liquor burned holes in what was left of a mans stomach lining and the strippers were woefully past their prime nobody seemed to care in the spirit of goodfellowship declan tucked a final dollar in the frayed garter on a flabby white thigh then hauled a glassyeyed remy to his feet lets go pal of mine huh what is it morning close enough as they stumbled out arm in arm as much for necessity as friendship remy looked around his head bopped like a puppets on a jerked string wherez everybody passed out in jail dead in an alley oh wimps remy grinned his rubber grin you n me dec we still got it im starting a course of antibiotics in the morning to get rid of it he tripped and had to wrap both arms around remy to keep from falling on his face too much gravity theres entirely too much gravity out here lets go find us another naked woman i think we found all of them already time to go home old buddy old pal im getting married in three days remy held up four fingers to demonstrate no more carousing for remy he looked around the streets were nearly deserted and oily with the light drizzle do we have to bail anybody out screw em damn right wheres my girl effie he shouted it and the name echoed back making declan snort drunkenly stella cracked up by his own wit he sat down hard in a puddle fuck it remy lets just sleep here gotta go find my girl gonna make sweet sweet love to my effie you couldnt get it up right now with a hydraulic pump bet remy fumbled for his zipper and declan had just enough brain cells left to stagger up and stop him put that thing away before you hurt yourself get us arrested for decent exposure s okay were lawyers speak for yourself find cabs we must find cabs cab to effie wheres my blushin bride home in bed like every other good woman is at he lifted remys wrist tried to focus on the watch whatever oclock in the morning lena shes in bed she thinks im a woman you must not be fucking her right then no you ass and remind me to punch you for that later she thinks im abigail you havent been trying on her underwear or anything weird like that have you son i like the little black lace panties with the roses best they slim down my hips pretty sure youre joking wait he stopped leaned over the curb hands braced on his knees then slowly straightened again false alarm not gonna puke theres good news cab declan waved desperately when he saw one cruising in the name of god you first he said and all but shoved remy inside before diving in after where do i live remy demanded i used to know but i forgot can i call effie and ask her fortunately declan remembered and as remy snoozed on his shoulder he concentrated on remaining conscious until he fulfilled the last of his duties and got his friend home alive at the curb he elbowed remy and brought him up like an arrow from a bow what where sum bitch im home how bout that can you make it from here declan asked him i can hold my liquor all six gallons of it shifting remy caught declans face in his hand and kissed him hard on the mouth i love you cher but if youd been abigail idve slipped you some tongue ugh was the best declan could manage as remy climbed out youre the goddamnedest best friend i ever had and that was the goddamnedest best bachelors party in the history of bachelors parties im gonna go up puke and pass out now you do that wait till he gets in the door declan told the driver and watched remy waver split in two both of them stumbled inside the building okay the rest is his business you know where the old manet hall is the driver eyed him in the rearview mirror i guess i do i live there take me home okay thats a long way out the driver shifted turned eyed declan up and down you got enough for the fare i got money i got lotsa money declan pawed through his pockets came up with bills littered the cab with them im loaded youre telling me with a shake of his head the driver pulled away from the curb m ve been some party buddy tell me declan muttered then slid face first on the backseat the next thing he knew clearly a dixieland band was blasting in his head he was still facedown but the beach of waikiki had ended up in his mouth and his tongue had grown a fine fur coat some sadist was hammering spikes into his shoulder holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners no point falling back on that now just roll over nice and slow cher dont open your eyes yet im dying here call a priest here now lenas got you gently and with great amusement she eased him over supported his head just swallow this he glugged choked felt something vile wash over the fur through the sand and down his throat in defense he tried to push the glass away from his lips and opened his eyes hed go to his grave denying the sound that had come out of his mouth had in any way resembled a girlish scream lena clucked her tongue i told you not to open your eyes what eyes what eyes theyve been burned to cinders drink the rest go away go very far away and take your poison with you thats no way to talk to someone whos come to tend you on your deathbed he slid back down dragged a pillow over his face howd you know i was dying effie called whens remys funeral fortunately hes marrying a woman with a great deal of tolerance understanding and humor how many titty bars did yall hit last night all of them all the titty bars in all the land i suppose that explains why you have a pasty on your cheek i do not but when he groped under the pillow he felt the tassel oh god have some mercy and just kill me well all right honey she applied just enough pressure to the pillow to have him flapping his hands and shoving up his face was flushed his bloodshot eyes just a little wild that wasnt funny you had to see it from this side and she laughed he still wore his clothes the wrinkled liquorspotted shirt half in half out of his jeans another pasty peeked out of the shirt pocket this one was pink and silver his eyes were narrowed to a pained squint youre going to feel better in a bit not good but better you get a shower and some food on top of that potion i poured into you youll get the feeling back in your extremities in two maybe three hours someone had shaved the fur off his tongue he discovered he wasnt sure it was an improvement what was in that stuff you gave me you dont want to know but i laced it with four aspirin so dont take any more for a while im going to fix you a nice light omelette and some toast why because you look so pitiful she started to kiss him then jerked back waving a hand between them christ jesus do something about that breath cher before you kill someone with it who asked you and make that a long shower you smell like the barroom floor she pushed to her feet how come nobodys around here today in anticipation of a hangover i let it be known that anyone who came around this house before three in the afternoon would be executed without trial she checked her watch looks like you got a few hours yet if i have to get out of this bed im getting a gun ill feel bad about killing you but ill do it ill be in the kitchen she cocked a brow bring your gun cher and well see if you remember how to use it is that a euphemism he called after her then immediately regretted raising his voice holding his head to keep it in place he eased creakily out of bed she chuckled all the way downstairs laughed harder when she heard a door slam bet hes sorry he did that she thought then stopped looked back when she heard another two slams ah well she supposed he couldnt threaten ghosts with a gun make all the racket you want she said as she headed back toward the kitchen you dont worry me any the library doors shook as she passed them she ignored them if a surly smelly man didnt chase her off a meantempered ghost wouldnt hed looked so damn cute she thought as she hunted up the coffee beans all pale and male and cross and with that silly pasty plastered on his cheek men just lost half their iq when they had a look at a naked woman put a pack of them together with women willing to strip to music and they had the common sense of a clump of broccoli she ground the beans set coffee to brew she was mixing eggs in a bowl when it occurred to her that it was the first time in her life shed made breakfast for a man she hadnt slept with the night before wasnt that an odd thing odder still that she was humming in the kitchen of an annoyed smelly hungover man whod snapped at her out of character lena just whats going on here shed been so intrigued by effies cheerful amusement over remys condition and here she was feeling the same thing over declans she peered out the window at the garden that had been wild and abandoned only months before it bloomed now beautifully with new sprigs fresh green spearing out shed gone and done it after all gone and let him sneak into her right through the locks and bolts she was in love with him and oh god she didnt want to be as much for his sake as for her own hed blown the dust off those young dreams shed so rigidly put away the ones colored with love and hope and trust they were so shiny now that they were staring her in the face so shiny they blinded her and terrified her marriage the man wanted marriage and she didnt believe in making promises unless youd shed blood to keep them would she could she i think id want to she said quietly i think id want to for him as she spoke a cupboard door flew open a thick blue mug shot out and smashed at her feet she leaped back heart hammering as shards rained over her ankles grimly she stared down at the blood seeping out of tiny nicks seems i already have you dont want that do you bowl still clutched in her hand she spun a circle you want anything but our being together well see who wins in the end wont we well just see deliberately she reached down for one of the shards then ran it over her thumb as the blood welled she held her hand up let it drip im not weak as he was if i take love if i promise love ill keep it the sound of chimes had her bolting straight up it was declans tune the first ringing notes of it fear and wonder closed her throat had her bobbling the bowl goddamn it answer the door will you his voice blasted downstairs full of bitter annoyance then murder whoever rang that idiot doorbell doorbell she pushed her free hand through her hair hed installed a doorbell that played after the ball wasnt that just like him you keep shouting at me she called as she marched down the hall youre going to have worse than a hangover to deal with if youd go away and let me die in peace i wouldnt have to shout in about two shakes im coming up there and wringing your neck and after i wring your neck im going to kick your ass she wrenched open the door on the final threat and found herself glaring at a very handsome couple it took only one blink to clear the temper for her to see declans eyes looking curiously back at her out of the womans face im colleen fitzgerald the woman tidy blond and lovely held out an elegant hand and who are you if thats my sons ass youre intending to kick id like to know your name mom dripping from the shower wearing nothing but ripped sweatpants declan rushed to the top of the stairs hey mom dad despite the ravages of the hangover he bolted down threw one arm around each of them and squeezed i thought you were flying down tomorrow change of plans are you just getting up colleen demanded its after one in the afternoon bachelor party last night hard liquor loose women really colleen said and eyed lena oh not this one she came over to play florence nightingale colleen and patrick fitzgerald angelina simone good to meet you patrick long lanky with his dark hair gorgeously silvered at the temples sent lena a generous smile his blue eyes were bright and bold as he held out a hand then they narrowed in concern as he saw her thumb youve hurt yourself its nothing whatd you do youre bleeding jesus lena panicked declan grabbed her wrist all but plucked her off her feet and rushed her toward the kitchen its just a scratch stop it declan your parents youre embarrassing me she hissed shut up let me see how deep it is still in the doorway patrick turned to his wife shes the one he certainly thinks so colleen pursed her lips stepped into the house lets just see about all this hell of a looker ive got eyes patrick and she used them to take in the house as they followed declans hurried path it was more a great deal more than shed expected not that she doubted her sons taste but shed been led to believe the house was in serious perhaps fatal disrepair and what she saw now were gracious rooms charming details glinting glass and wood and in the kitchen she saw her son hovering over the hand of a very annoyed very beautiful woman who looked perfectly capable of carrying out her earlier threat i beg your pardon lena elbowed declan aside and smiled coolly at his parents i dropped a cup thats all its nice to meet both of you declan turned to root through cupboards you need some antiseptic and a bandage oh stop fussing youd think i cut my hand off and if you dont watch yourself youll step on the shards and be worse off than i am im sorry your welcomes so disrupted she said to his parents im just going to sweep up this mess then ill be on my way where are you going declan demanded you promised food she wondered if he could hear her teeth grinding together pour whats in that bowl into a skillet turn on the burner and youll have food she yanked open the broom closet why arent you getting your parents coffee or a cold drink after their long trip they raised you better than that we certainly did colleen agreed sorry seeing the woman i love bleeding all over the floor distracted me declan though her voice was low lenas warning was loud and clear coffee sounds great patrick said cheerfully we came here straight from the airport wanted to see this place and you too dec he added with a wink wheres your luggage had it sent to the hotel son this place is enormous a lot of space for one man lena and i want four kids she heaved the broken shards into the trash and rounded on him okay three he amended without a hitch in his stride but thats my final offer ive had enough of this she shoved the broom and dustpan into his hands you clean up your own messes i hope you enjoy your stay she said stiffly to colleen and patrick im late for work she strode out the back because it was closer and fought off the towering urge to slam the door until the windows cracked isnt she beautiful declan said with a huge grin isnt she perfect you annoyed and embarrassed her colleen told him good i tend to make more progress that way let me get the coffee then ill show you around an hour later declan sat with his mother on the rear gallery while patrick whod lost the debate made sandwiches the worst of the hangover had receded declan imagined he had whatever mysterious potion lena had given him to thank for it and the pleasure of seeing her in the same room as his parents jeez hed missed them he thought hed had no idea how much hed missed them until hed seen them so he said at length are you going to tell me what you think yes but she continued to sit and look out over his gardens warm isnt it early in the year to be so warm id think actually its cooler today you shouldve been here a couple days ago you couldve poached eggs out here she heard the way he said it with a kind of pride you were never a big fan of the cold even when we went skiing youd prefer rattling around the lodge to charging down the slopes skiings something people invented so they can pretend snows fun see if we invite you to vermont this season but her hand moved over touched his the house is beautiful declan even what you havent gotten to yet is beautiful in its way i liked to think your fiddling with tools and wood and so on was a nice little hobby i preferred to think that as long as you were a lawyer it was probable youd stay in boston youd stay close i dreaded seeing you go so i made it hard on you im not sorry youre my baby she said and touched him in the deepest chamber of his heart i dont have to be in boston to be close she shook her head you wont come swinging in the house unexpectedly we wont run into you in restaurants or at parties or the theater thats a wrench in me one youll understand when you have those three or four children i dont want you to be sad well of course im sad dont be a boob i love you dont i you keep saying so he said playfully she looked at him gray eyes steady on gray eyes lucky for both of us i love you enough to know when to let go you found your place here i wont deny i hoped you wouldnt but since you have im glad for you damn it thanks he leaned over kissed her now as for this woman lena i know her name declan colleen said dryly as a potential motherinlaw im entitled to refer to her as this woman until i get to know her a little better as for this woman shes nothing like what id imagined for you not when i imagined you climbing up the ranks in the law firm buying a house close by and within easy access to the country club jessica would have suited my requirements as daughterinlaw quite well in that scenario a good challenging tennis partner who plays a decent hand of bridge and has the skill to chair the right committees maybe you should adopt jessica be quiet declan colleens voice was mild and steel lena would have recognized the tone instantly im not finished jessica however well suited for me was very obviously not suited for you you werent happy and id begun to see and to worry about that just before you broke it off i tried to convince myself it was just prewedding jitters but i knew better it wouldnt have hurt for you to clue me in on that one maybe not but i was annoyed with you tell me dont sass young man especially when im about to be sentimental you were always a happy child bright clever a smart tongue but i respect that you had id call it a bounce in your heart and you lost it i see youve gotten that back today i saw it in your eyes again when you looked at lena he took colleens hand rubbed it against his cheek you called her lena temporarily i havent made up my mind about her and believe me boy she hasnt made hers up about your father and me either so id advise you to stay out of it and let us get on with the job of doing so she stretched out her legs patrick did you have to hunt down the pig for those ham sandwiches declan grinned gave the hand he held a big noisy kiss i love you guys we love you too she squeezed his fingers hard then let them go god knows why he dreamed of storms and pain of fear and joys rain and wind lashed the windows and the pain that whipped through him erupted in a sobbing scream sweat and tears poured down his face her face her face her body his pain the room was gold with gaslight and the snap and simmer of the fire in the grate and as that storm raged outside another spun through her through him agony vised her belly with the next contraction she was blind with it her cry against it was primal and burned his throat with its passion push abby you have to push youre almost there tired she was so tired so weak how could she live through such pain but she grit her teeth almost mad everything she was everything she had focused on this one task this one miracle her child her child lucians child was fighting to come into the world she bore down with all the strength she had left life depended on it theres the head et la such hair one more abby one more chhre she was laughing now better than screaming even if the laugh was tinged with hysteria she braced herself on her elbows threw her head back as fresh unspeakable pain rolled through her this one moment this one act was the greatest gift a woman could give this gift this child would be held safe would be cherished would be loved for all of her days and on the pain with lightning flashing on the roar of thunder she pushed pushed pushed wailing life into the world a girl you have a beautiful girl pain was forgotten the hours of sweat and blood and agony were nothing now in the brilliant flash of joy weeping from it she held out her arms for the small wriggling baby who cried out in what sounded like triumph my rose my beautiful marie rose tell lucian oh please bring lucian to see our daughter they cleaned both mother and baby first smiling at the mothers impatience and the childs irritable cries there were tears in lucians eyes when he came into the room when he clasped her hand his fingers trembled when he looked at the child theyd created his face filled with wonder she told him what she had vowed on the instant marie rose had been placed in her arms well keep her safe lucian no matter what well keep her safe and happy shes ours promise me youll love and care for her always of course shes so beautiful abby my beautiful girls i love you say the words i need to hear you say the words still holding abigails hand lucian laid a tender finger on his daughters cheek ill love and ill care for her always i swear it patrick fitzgerald took his wifes hand as they strolled through the quarter he knew their destination was et trois and their mission another look at angelina simone you know colleen this is very close to interference and spying and your point is he had to laugh after nearly forty years of marriage the woman could always make him laugh he considered that above all a sign of a successful partnership you realize she might not be there owning a bar doesnt mean youre in it all day every day so well get a look at her place of business and have a drink its perfectly up front and respectable yes dear he used that phrase that tone only when he was making fun of her colleen debated between giving him a good elbow shot in the ribs and laughing then did both the crowds the noise the heat and the somehow florid and decaying elegance of the city werent things that appealed to her for more than a brief visit she preferred the oldworld charm and yes the dignity of boston certainly boston had its seamier sides but it wasnt so overt so celebratory about it sex was meant to be fun and interesting she wasnt a prude for gods sake but it was also meant to be private and still the tragic wail of a tenor sax weeping on the air touched some chord in her if her son was determined to make his home here shed accept that maybe with a bit more study and debate shed accept the woman youll have time and opportunity to grill her at the wedding tomorrow patrick pointed out colleen only sighed at the minds of men god bless them they were simple creatures guileless really the first step obviously was to observe the girl in her own milieu she considered the neighborhood the positioning of the bar the level of traffic she decided lena had chosen wisely and had taste and sense enough to let the exterior of the bar blend smoothly into the other establishments she liked the gallery over it the pots of flowers bright colors against the soft creams it demonstrated taste and style an appreciation for atmosphere shed pried the information out of declan that lena lived above the bar and wondered now if she should wheedle a visit upstairs to check out the living quarters she stepped inside et trois made a good objective study it was clean which met with her approval it was crowded but not jammed which met with her business sense too early for the rowdy night crowd colleen judged too late for the lunch shift the music coming out of the speakers was cajun she supposed and she approved that as well it was lively but not so loud as to make simple conversation a chore a black man in a bright red shirt worked behind the bar a good face she decided smooth hands a young waitress blond perky wearing jeans perhaps just a tad too tight served one of the tables colleen spotted what she decided were a number of tourists from their camera and shopping bags others she assumed were locals whatever food had been or was being served put a hot spicy scent over the air lena stepped out of the kitchen their eyes met immediately and with instant acknowledgment colleen let her lips curve in a small polite smile and walked to the bar with patrick following afternoon mrs fitzgerald mr fitzgerald an equally small equally polite smile curved lenas lips youve been taking in the quarter she asked with a glance at the shopping bags patrick carried colleen rarely passes a store without seeing something that needs to be bought that must be where declan gets it can i show you a menu weve had lunch thanks colleen slid onto a stool id love a martini stoli very cold dead dry straight up shaken three olives and for you mr fitzgerald make it the same and make it patrick he took the stool beside his wife youve got a nice place here live music he asked with a nod toward the stage area every night nine oclock as she began to mix the martinis she sent him a genuine smile you like to dance you should come back well get your feet moving you enjoying your visit were looking forward to the wedding colleen commented remys like family and were pleased to see declan making such progress on the house hes happy there yes lena took out the two martini glasses shed chilled during the mixing be nicer for you if hed be happy in boston and with the one he almost married yes it would wouldnt it but we cant choose other peoples lives even our childrens and you certainly cant select the person theyll love are you in love with my son lena hands rock steady lena strained the martinis into the cold glasses thats something ill talk to him about when im ready these are on the house she added sliding the olives in i hope they suit your tastes thank you colleen picked up her glass sipped raised an eyebrow its excellent ive always felt mixing the perfect martini is a kind of art and have been surprised and disappointed that often those who own a bar or club or restaurant make or serve imperfect martinis why do anything if you dont set out to do it right exactly its a matter of pride isnt it in self in ones work ones life flaws are acceptable even necessary to make us human and humble but to serve a guest or customer less than the best one is capable of strikes me as arrogant or sloppy often both i dont see the point in doing anything halfway lena said and filled a bowl with fresh snack mix if i cant make a martini fine then i step back until i learn how its done otherwise id disappoint myself and the person who was counting on me a good policy colleen sampled an olive without high standards we tend to settle for less than what makes us happy and productive and can shortchange the people who matter to us when someone matters to me and im careful about who does i want the best for them they may settle for less but i wont when patrick leaned over peered closely at colleens martini she frowned at him what are you doing trying to see whats in yours that isnt in mine it made lena laugh had her shoulders relaxing hes an awful lot like you isnt he got his mamas eyes though sees right through you even when you dont want him to he loves you both like crazy and that says something to me so im going to say something to you she leaned a little closer i come from plain stock strong but plain my mother shes a dead loss and more of an embarrassment to me than i care to speak of but my grandfather was a fine and decent man my grandmamas as good as anybody and better than most i run this bar because im good at it and i like it and i dont waste my time on things i dont like she swept her hair behind her ear kept her gaze level on colleens im selfish and im stubborn and i dont see a damn thing wrong with that i dont care about his money or yours so lets just set that aside hes the best man i ever met in my life and im not good enough for him i say that knowing im good enough for damn near anybody but hes different turns out under that affable exterior that mans even more stubborn than i am and i havent figured out what to do about that quite yet when i do hell be the first to know i expect hell fill you in on that particular outcome now unconsciously lena toyed with the key she wore around her neck would you like another drink well just nurse these for a while colleen told her excuse me a minute i see i have an order to fill she moved down the bar to where her waitress waited with an empty tray well patrick asked i believe she set you neatly in your place yes well satisfied colleen took another sip of her martini shell do im not nervous pale jittery remy stood in the library while declan attached the boutonniere of lily of the valley to his friends tuxedo lapel maybe if you say that another dozen times youll believe it hold still damn remy im holding still sure except for the mild seizure you seem to be having youre steady as a rock i want to marry effie want to live my life with her this is the day weve both been looking forward to for months thats right today declan said in sober tones is the first day of the rest of your life i feel a little sick its too late to puke declan said cheerfully youre down to the final fifteen want me to call your dad back in no no hell have his hands full with mama how many people did you say were out there couple hundred last i looked and more coming jesus jesus why didnt we elope hows a man supposed to stand up in front of hundreds of people and change his life forever i think the tradition started so the groom couldnt run away theyd go after him like a lynch mob that sure does settle me down cher how about you find me a couple fingers of bourbon declan merely strolled over to a painted cabinet and took out a bottle i figured youd need a hit he pulled out a tin of altoids as well and these dont want to be breathing whiskey on the bride she might be the one who runs declan started to pour but when the door opened after a cursory knock and his mother marched in he whipped bottle and glass behind his back dont you both look handsome declan dont give him more than one shot of that whiskey youve got behind you and make sure he chases it with mouthwash i got altoids fine smiling she walked over and fussed with remys tie youre nervous because this is the most important day of your life thered be something wrong with you if you didnt have some shakes i promise theyll go away the minute you see effie she looks beautiful colleen framed remys face in her hands im very proud of you how about me declan demanded i thought of the altoids ill get to you later youre marrying the woman you love colleen went on youre surrounded by friends and family who love you both its a beautiful day and your brother the one of your heart has seen to it that you have a beautiful setting now you take a shot of that bourbon then take a deep breath then get your butt out there and get married yes maam i purely love you miss colleen i know it i love you too but im not going to kiss you and smear my lipstick one drink declan this boy goes out there tipsy im holding you responsible later declan would think his mother was right as usual when he stood beside remy and effie frothy in white stepped out on the gallery declan felt the nerves drain out of his friend his brother he saw the wide wide grin stretch over remys face heard his soft thats my girl he found his own gaze traveling through the rows of people meeting lenas and youre mine he thought this time around were going to make it work so he stood in the spring garden with the old white house rising over the green lawn and watched his friends marry when they kissed when they turned to be announced as husband and wife cheers rang out so much more liberating and celebratory than the applause declan was more accustomed to he felt his own grin stretch nearly as wide as remys the music started up almost immediately fiddles washboards accordions when the photographer whittled down to just the bride and groom declan broke free and wove his way through the sea of people to lena she wore red bright poppy red that left her back bare but for an intriguing web of thin straps just above her heart shed pinned the enamel watch and gold wings lucian had once given abigail i wondered if youd ever wear it its special she said so i save it for special it was a beautiful wedding declan you did a fine job getting this place ready for it youre a good friend i have lots of good qualities which makes you a very lucky woman ive missed you the last couple days weve both been busy stay tonight he caught her hand seeing denial and excuses in her eyes angelina stay tonight maybe youve got a lot of people you should be talking to theyre all talking to each other wheres miss odette lena scowled your mother swept her off somewhere you want me to find them cut miss odette loose pride stiffened her spine her voice my grandmama can hold her own against your mama any day of the week oh yeah amused declan narrowed his eyes in challenge if they get physical my moneys on colleen shes got a wicked left why dont we get some champagne and go find them see what round theyre in if she hurts my grandmamas feelings was she would never do that no longer amused declan gave her shoulders a little shake what do you take her for lena if she went off with miss odette its because shed like to get to know her i suppose thats why she dragged your daddy into my place so she could get to know me better they were in your place my bar yeah annoyed with herself for being annoyed lena reached out to take a flute from a waiter passing champagne she came in to check the place out and me with it so she got her an eyeful and a damn good martini and i set her straight he experienced the jittery male panic at the image of the two most important females in his life squaring off what the hell does that mean i said what i had to say thats all we understand each other fine now why dont you bring me up to date so i can understand you fine too this isnt the time or the place were going to find the time and the place because she heard the temper in his voice she shrugged then smiled and traced a finger down his cheek now dont get all riled up cher we got us a party here you and me we can fight anytime okay well schedule it in for a little later he caught her chin in his hand i cant figure out who youre selling short lena me my family or yourself let me know when youve got the answer he bent brushed his lips over hers see you later the reception moved into the ballroom and still managed to spill onto the galleries onto the lawn for the first time in decades the house filled with music and laughter racing children crying babies flirting couples and gossiping friends filled the great room relaxed in the shade of white umbrellas at tables around the gardens or plopped down on the gallery declan liked to imagine the house absorbing all that positive energy even into the dark corners of the rooms hed kept locked declan effie laid a hand on his arm may i have this dance did somebody kill remy he led her out on the floor i figure thats the only way hed let you more than a foot away from him he kissed her hand before taking her into his arms cant blame him when youve got the most beautiful woman in the room you keep her close oh declan she laid her cheek on his if i wasnt madly in love with my husband id make such a play for you if you ever get tired of him let me know i want to thank you for everything you did to give me this perfect day i know my mama my sister and i drove you a little crazy the last couple weeks has it only been a couple weeks he laughed it was worth every hour i hid in closets so none of you could find me im so happy im so happy and i love you i love everybody today she said with a laugh everyone in the world but today next to remy i love you best of all so i want you to be happy i am not enough she turned her lips to his ear declan theres something in this house thats just not finished i didnt think i believed in that sort of thing but i feel it whenever im here i feel it i feel it even today he could feel the tremor move through her rubbed his hand over her back to soothe it away you shouldnt think about it today you shouldnt worry today im worried for you something it isnt finished part of it somehow part of its my fault yours he eased her back now so he could see her face then circled her toward one of the corners what do you mean i wish i knew what i meant i only know what i feel something i did or didnt do for you it doesnt make a bit of sense but its such a strong feeling the feeling that i wasnt there for you when you needed me most i guess im a little afraid something bads going to happen again if its not all made right so well as silly as this sounds i just want to tell you im sorry so awfully sorry for letting you down however i did its all right he touched his lips to her forehead you couldnt know whatever it was if it was you couldnt know and sweetheart this isnt a day for looking back its all about tomorrow now youre right just just be careful she said as remy walked up and gave declan a mock punch thats my wife youre holding cher you go get your own girl good idea he hunted up lena found her in a clutch of people the red of her dress was like a sleek tongue of flame over her dusky skin he imagined his reaction to it to her transmitted clearly enough as he saw that knowing and essentially female look come into her eyes as he stepped toward her he turned slightly and held out a hand to her grandmother miss odette would you dance with me day hasnt come when ill turn down a dance with a handsome man you look wonderful he told her when they took the floor weddings make me feel young i had a nice talk with your mama did you youre wondering she said with a chuckle ill tell you we got on just fine and she seemed pleased when i told her i saw how youd been raised up right the first time i met you she paid me back the compliment by saying the same about my lena then we chatted about things women often chat about at weddings which would likely bore you except to say we agreed what a handsome young man you are and handsome young men should find more reason to wear tuxedos i could become a mamtre d but they get better tips when they have a snooty accent and im not sure i could pull that part off then ill just have to wait until your own wedding to see you all slicked up again yeah he looked over her head but lena had moved on this ones working out pretty well anyway i was a little panicked that the storm last night would screw things up storm cher we didnt have a storm last night sure we did a mean one dont tell me you slept through it i was up till midnight she watched his face now finishing the hem on this dress then i was up again round four when rufus decided he needed to go outside i saw lights on over here then wondered what you were doing up at that hour night was clear as a bell declan i i m ve dreamed about a storm prewedding stress but he hadnt been up at four hadnt been up at all as far as he knew after midnight when hed walked through the house to turn off all the lights before going to bed dreams he thought wind and rain the flash of lightning the yellow flames of the fire in the grate pain sweat thirst blood womens hands womens voices effies giving comfort giving encouragement he remembered it now clearly and stopped dead in the middle of the dance hed had a baby hed gone through childbirth good god cher declan you come on outside gently odette guided him off the floor you need some air yeah southern ladies are big on swooning right whats that never mind he was mortified he was awed at what had happened to him inside his own dream inside he supposed his own memories go on back in he told her im just going to take a walk clear my head what did you remember a miracle he murmured remind me to buy my mother a really great present i dont know how the hell you women get through it once she did it four times amazing he mumbled and headed down the steps fucking amazing he walked all the way around the house then slipped back in for a tall glass of icy water he used it to wash down three extrastrength aspirin in hopes of cutting back on the vicious headache that had come on the moment hed remembered the dream he could hear the music spilling down the steps from the ballroom he could feel the vibrations on the ceiling from where dozens of feet danced he had to get back up perform his duties as best man and host all he wanted to do was fall facedown on the bed close his eyes and slide into oblivion declan lena came in through the gallery doors then shut them behind her whats the matter nothing just a headache youve been gone nearly an hour people are asking about you im coming up but he sat on the side of the bed in a minute she crossed to him is it bad ive had worse why dont you just lie down a few minutes im not crawling into bed on my best friends wedding day unless you want to keep me company its tempting seeing a man in a tux always makes me want to peel him out of it mamtre ds must just love you there now you made a stupid joke so you must be feeling better considering i gave birth less than twentyfour hours ago id say im doing great lena pursed her lips cher just how much have you had to drink this evening not nearly as much as i plan on having you know how you had this theory that i was abigail manet well im starting to think youre onto something seeing as i dreamed i was in that room down the hall in the bed ive seen in there that one that isnt there i wasnt seeing abigail on that bed in the last stages of labor i experienced it and let me tell you it aint no walk on the beach any woman who doesnt go for the serious drugs is a lunatic it beats anything they dreamed up for that entertaining era known as the spanish inquisition you dreamed you were abigail and you was it wasnt like a dream lena and i think i m ve been in that room when i had the flash or hallucination or whatever we call it i can remember the storm the sound of it and how scared i was how focused i was on bringing that baby out he paused replayed his own words boy that sounded weird yes yes it did she sat beside him i heard the voices other women helping me i can see their faces especially the young one the one close to my age abigails age i can feel the sweat running down my face and the unbelievable fatigue then that sensation that peak of it all when it was like coming to the point of being ripped open bearing down then the relief the numbness the fucking wonder of pushing life into the world then the flood of pride and love when they put that miracle in my arms he looked down at his hands while lena stared at him i can see the baby lena clear as life i can see her all red and wrinkled and pissed off dark blue eyes dark hair a rosebud mouth tiny slender fingers and i thought there are ten and she is perfect my perfect rose he looked at lena now marie rose your greatgreatgrandmother marie rose he repeated our daughter their daughter she couldnt dismiss it and something deep inside her grieved but she couldnt speak of it wouldnt speak of it not when her head and heart were so heavy lena threw herself back into the crowds the music the laughter this was now she thought now was what counted she was alive with the warm evening air on her skin under the pure white moonlight with the fragrance of the flowers and gardens rioting around her roses and verbena heliotrope jasmine lilies her favorite had been the lily she kept them always in her room first in the servants quarters then in their bedroom clipped in secret from the garden or the hothouse and for the nursery there were roses tiny pink buds for their precious marie rose frightened she pushed those thoughts those images aside grabbing a partner she flirted him into a dance she didnt want the past it was dead and done she didnt want the future it was capricious and often cruel it was the moment that was to be lived enjoyed even controlled so when declans father took her hand she smiled at him brilliantly this one heres a cajun twostep can you handle it lets find out they swung among the circling couples with quick stylish moves that had her laughing up at him why patrick youre a natural you sure youre a yankee blood and bone then again you have to factor in the irish my mother was a hell of a stepdancer and can still pull it off after a couple of pints how olds your mama eightysix he twirled her out and back fitzgeralds tend to be longlived and vigorous somethings upset you she kept her cheerful expression in place now what could upset me at such a lovely time and place thats the puzzle why dont we get a glass of champagne and you can tell me he didnt give her a chance to refuse like father like son she thought as he kept her hand firmly in his he drew her to the bar ordered two flutes then led her outside a perfect night she said and breathed it in look at those gardens its hard to believe what they were like just a few months back did declan tell you about the franks about the franks tibald about effie and miss odette about the ghosts about you he bit off a lot here she sipped champagne wandered to the baluster below people were still dancing on the lawn a group of women sat at one of the white tables under a white moon some with babies sleeping on their shoulders some with children drooping in their laps he was bored in boston intrigued lena looked away from the people the charm of the fairy lights and looked at patrick bored unhappy restless but in a large part bored with his work his fiancie his life the only thing that put any excitement in his face was the old house he was redoing i worried hed go along end up married to the wrong woman working in a field he disliked living a life that only half satisfied him i shouldnt have worried he leaned back on the baluster and looked through the open doors into the ballroom his mind his heart was never set on the path we his mother and i cleared for him we didnt want to see that so for a long time we didnt you only wanted the best for him people tend to think whats best for them is best for the people they love yes and declans nature is to do whatever he can to make those he loves happy he loves you when she said nothing patrick turned to her you said he was stubborn its more than that once declan sets his mind on a goal on a vision hes got a head like granite he wont be turned away by obstacles or excuses or lukewarm protests if you dont love him lena if you dont want a life with him hurt him hurt him quick and make it deep then walk away i dont want to hurt him thats the whole point and problem he didnt think he was capable of loving anyone he told me that after he broke it off with jessica he said he didnt have that kind of love inside him now he knows he does and hes better for it youve already made a difference in his life an important one now you have to love him back or leave him to do anything in between would be cruel and youre not cruel she reached up closed her fingers around the key on its chain then dropped them nervous now to the wings on her breast hes not what i planned for hes not what i was looking for he smiled then kindly and patted her hand lifes full of surprises isnt it some of them are a real kick in the ass then he leaned down and kissed her cheek ill see you again he said and left her alone the party rolled on a good two hours after the bride and groom were seen off in a shower of confetti which declan imagined hed be finding in his lawn his clothes perhaps even his food for the next six months the music stayed hot and the guests stayed happy in the early hours of the morning some walked to their cars others were carried and not all of them were children declan stood on the curve of his front steps and watched the last of them drive away the sky in the east was paling just a gentle lessening of the dark even as he stood he saw a star go out morning was waking you must be tired lena said from the gallery above him no he continued to look at the sky i should be but im not its going to take you a week to clean this place up nope the general and her troops are coming over tomorrow to deal with it im ordered to keep out of the way and thats one command i wont have any trouble obeying i didnt think youd stay neither did i he turned now looked up at her a kind of romeo and juliet pose he thought and hoped for a better ending why did you im not sure i dont know what to do about you declan i swear to god i just dont know menve never been any trouble for me maybe ive been trouble for them she said with a faint smile but youre the first whos given me any he started up to her none of them loved you no none of them loved me wanted me desired me but thats the easy part you can be careless with wants and ill tell you the truth sometimes most times i enjoyed that carelessness not just the sex but the dance the game whatever you want to call that courtship thats no courtship at all when the music stops or the games over there might be some bumps and bruises but nobodys really hurt but this isnt a game between the two of us ive already hurt you bumps and bruises so far lena he stopped facetoface with her bumps and bruises when you look at me what are you seeing someone something else from before you cant run the living on the dead i see you clear enough but i see something else in both of us that shouldnt be ignored or forgotten maybe something that needs to be put right before we can move on he reached in his pocket pulled out lucians watch i gave this to you once before about a hundred years ago its time you had it back her fingers chilled at the idea of holding it if this is true dont you see it all ended in grief and death and tragedy we cant change what was why risk bringing it on again because we have to because were stronger this time he opened her hand put the watch into her palm closed her fingers over it because if we dont set it right it never really ends all right she slipped the watch into the pocket of the short jacket shed put on then she unpinned the watch on her dress i gave this to you once before take it back when he took it held it the clock that had once stood inside the hall began to bong midnight he said with perfect calm itll strike twelve times and he looked down at the face of the enameled watch he held midnight he repeated showing it to her look at yours her fingers werent so steady when she pulled it out jesus she breathed when she saw both hands straight up why were going to find out i have to go inside he looked up toward the third floor i have to go up to the nursery the baby even as he spoke they heard the fretful cries lets just go declan lets just get in the car and drive away from here but he was already moving inside the babys crying shes hungry she needs me lucians parents are sleeping i always go upstairs early when hes not home i hate sitting with them in the parlor after dinner i can feel the way she dislikes me his voice had changed lena realized as she followed him there was a cajun cadence to it declan claudine will walk her or change her but my pretty rosie needs her mama i dont like having her up on the third floor he said as he hurried down the corridor but madame josephine always gets her way not always he corrected and there was a smile in his voice now if she always did id be alligator bait stead of married to lucian hell be home tomorrow i miss him so as he started up the stairs his gait slowed and lena heard the rapid pace of his breath i have to go up it was his own voice now with fear at the edges i have to go in i have to see gathering all her courage lena took his hand well go in together his hand shook the cold that permeated into the air speared into the bone nausea rolled through his belly rose up his throat clamping down against it he shoved the door open he stumbled and even as lena tried to catch him fell to his knees he comes in hes drunk i dont want him coming up here but he wont go away everyone says they say how he looks just like lucian but they dont see his eyes i have to make him go away away from my baby i wish claudine hadnt gone off to meet jasper i dont like being alone up here with julian he scares me but i dont want him to see it his eyes were glazed glassy smoke in a face that had gone pale as death declan oh god declan come back she squeezed his hand until she felt bone rub against bone when he grabs at me i get away his voice was breathless now he still knelt a rangy man with sunstreaked hair wearing a tuxedo with the tie dangling loose a man with a womans memories a womans terror storming inside him but i cant leave my baby i get the poker from the fireplace ill kill him if i have to ill kill him if he touches me or my baby oh god oh god oh god as her knees seemed to melt away lena sank to the floor beside him tried to wrap her arms around him hes stronger than me i scream and i scream but nobody comes to help me hes drunk and hes crazy hes crazy and hes drunk he knocks me down and he rips at my clothes i cant get away my babys crying but i cant get to her i cant stop him oh shaking lena tried to hold him rock him no no no no he rapes me fire burned in the center of him pain the pain and the fear oh god the fear i call for help i call for you but youre not here his voice tore with tears you dont come i need you dont dont dont it was all she could say as she clung to him he hurts me but i fight him i try to stop him but he wont stop im so scared im so scared but even then i know hes not doing this because he wants me its because he hates you he turned his head those stormgray eyes drenched he hates you and because im yours he has to break me the way he broke your toys when you were children i beg him to stop but he wont he tries to make me stop screaming but i cant stop i cant his hands are around my throat it doubled him over that hideous pressure that shocking loss of air i cant breathe i cant breathe my babys crying for me and i cant breathe he kills me while my babys crying in her crib our baby while hes still inside me he breaks me like a toy that belongs to his brother he lifted his head looked at her now and when he spoke his voice was so full of grief she wondered they both didnt die of it you didnt come i called but you didnt come im sorry im so sorry she came declan got rockily to his feet she came and she saw what he had done to me she looked down at me like i was a mess that had to be cleaned up before the neighbors came to call his eyes were dry now and narrowed at the slamming of doors on the second floor her house her sons and i was the bayou slut whod trespassed i watched her look down on me it was like a dream that watching i saw her tell him to carry me out down to the bedroom while she cleaned up the blood and the candle wax and the broken crockery he took my body out the gallery but i watched her watched her go over to my sweet baby and i heard her mind wonder if it would be best just to smother the child she considered it and i believe if shed tried there was enough of me left that i could have struck her down like a lightning bolt he walked back to the door she thought i was weak but she was wrong they could kill me but they couldnt end me declan thats enough no not yet he walked down the steps down the hall opened the door to abigails bedroom he laid me on the bed in here and he wept not for me but for himself what would happen to him his hand had defiled me and killed me but he thought only of himself and does still for hes in this house he and josephine walking and waiting in their little hell he crossed over to the wall where the armoire had been opened the door of it in his mind they took some of my clothes i had the gown in here for the ball i was so proud of it i wanted to be beautiful for you make you proud of me she dropped my watch but didnt notice she had julian wrap me up and they carried me out with the suitcase full of my things they got old bricks to weigh me down and they carried me away it was hard even though there was moonlight even though it was cool it was a hard walk carting all of that julian got sick but she brooked no nonsense they would say i ran off with another man they would let the gossip spread that my baby was a bastard fawned off on you as your own she told julian how it would be as they put the bricks over me as they tied the cloak around me with rope as they pushed me into the bayou he looked back at her you believed them no lena was weeping now for him for abigail for herself for lucian no not at first you feared for me you searched for me you wept for me i tried to reach you but you wouldnt let me in you wouldnt let me in because some part of you already believed their lies i loved you with all my heart my soul my body i died for you i couldnt stop what happened to you i wasnt here to stop it no you werent here that night and you were never really here again not for me and not for our child you broke your promise to me the solemn vow you made to me in that bed the night she was born more than death that is what doomed us how did i break my promise you promised to love our child to care for her always i was always true to you lucian you have to know i do know she closed her hand over the watch in her pocket and felt the weight the grief the sorrow how could you leave her alone how could you turn from her you were all she had you swore to me i dont know i was weak i wasnt as brave or as true as you maybe i think maybe you were the making of me and when you were gone i had nothing to hold me straight you had marie rose perhaps i loved you too much and her not enough forgive me forgive me for what i did for what i didnt do i cant go back and change it she drew out the watch held it face up in her palm no matter how often time stops its too late if i could i would never leave you id take you and the baby away id do anything to stop what happened to you i loved you and my heart ached every minute since they took me from you ached with grief then with hope and then with sorrow you chose death lucian rather than life still you choose loneliness rather than love how can i forgive when you cant until you do theyve won and the house that shouldve been ours still holds them none of us will ever be free until you choose he turned opened the gallery doors and walked outside the door slamming at her back made her jolt it was lena thought like a rude laugh aimed at someone elses misery ignoring it she stepped outside took a deep breath declan he was leaning on the baluster staring out at the first hints of dawn yeah im trying to figure out if i need an exorcist a psychiatrist or if i should cash in and see about starring in a remake of the three faces of eve he rolled his shoulders as if trying to shrug off an irritating weight i think ill settle for a bloody mary cautious she stepped up behind him ill make us both one she began and started to lay her hand on his back he sidestepped evading her touch and left her standing there with her hand suspended i dont need to be petted and stroked still a little raw here comes from getting raped and murdered i guess jamming his hands in his pockets he strode down the steps she waited a moment struggling for balance then walked down to join him in the kitchen let me make them im the professional i can make my own goddamn drink it stung when he snatched the bottle of vodka out of her hand stung like a slap all right then make your own goddamn drink while youre at it you oughta think about living your own goddamn life she spun away and when he grabbed her arm she lashed out with her own slap when her hand cracked across his cheek the clock began to strike again and the doors to slam cold settled gleefully into the bone you ever been raped she yanked her arm free no probably havent been strangled to death either forgoing the niceties he took a long drink straight from the bottle let me give you a clue it tends to put you in a really foul mood temper drained out of her dont drink like that cher youll only get sick im already sick i need a shower go on and take one youll feel better for it im going to make some tea just let me do this she snapped out before he could argue maybe itll settle us both down some fine whatever he stomped up the stairs she sat for a moment just sat because her legs were still shaking then she took the watch out of her pocket studied the face the second hand ticked around and around but the time never went beyond midnight putting it away again she rose to brew the tea she carried it up along with the tidy triangles of toast the sickbed meal her grandmother had made for her in childhood he was sitting on the side of the bed wearing a tattered pair of sweatpants his hair was still wet his skin was reddened from vicious scrubbing she set the tray beside him do you want me to go no when she poured a mug of tea he took it tried to warm his hands despite the blasting heat of the shower he still felt chilled i didnt just see it or remember it i felt it the fear the pain the violation the humiliation and more like that isnt bad enough part of me was still me that part the big tough guy part was helpless just helpless watching a terrified woman be raped and strangled i cant explain it you dont have to i felt some of it not as strong not as clear as you but when you looked at me when she was looking at me out of your eyes i felt such grief such regret such guilt drink your tea now sweetheart he lifted the mug obediently its good pretty sweet sweet tea and toast its good for you she crawled onto the bed behind him knelt and began to knead at his shoulders she was stronger than he was its not his fault so much he was raised weak but he loved her declan i know that without a doubt even without knowing the terrible thing that happened to her he blamed himself for not being with her not giving her enough of himself he deserted the child there was such finality in his voice he did yes he did lena replied and though it was wrong of him wrong to take his own life and leave their baby an orphan she had a better life because of it she was surrounded by people who loved her who valued the memory of her mother she would never have had that life here in the hall she was entitled to it he should have seen to it she laid her cheek on the top of his head you cant forgive him i cant understand him no a man like you wouldnt understand a man like him maybe i do maybe i understand a man whod run off with a woman rather than stand up to his parents one whod bring her back into a house full of resentment and shadows instead of making them a home one whod fall apart enough to drown himself rather than live with the hurt and raise his own child with the love and compassion that had been denied him he wanted to be more than he was with her he would have been you shouldnt despise him declan you should pity him maybe its hard ive still got a lot of her despair inside me abigails he thought and a good portion of his own can you rest i dont think so why dont you try i need to go change she slid off the bed then lifted the tray and set it aside try to sleep awhile i wont be long he didnt try to stop her it was probably best to be alone he lay back stared at the ceiling as the first birds began to sing abigail had been broken he thought body and heart he was feeling pretty much the same himself he must have dozed for when he opened his eyes the sun was up still early he decided but the general and her troop of whirlwinds would be coming along shortly to storm through his house with mops and brooms and god knew maybe the place needed to be cleaned up shaken out it was still his he wasnt giving it up whatever had happened whatever shared it with him he wasnt giving it up and by christ he wasnt giving lena up either he sat up scowling and saw her sitting in the chair across the room she wore jeans a plain white tshirt there were three small bouquets lying in her lap you up for a little drive she asked him i guess put a shirt on and some shoes where are we going ill tell you on the way she drove and he kept the flowers in his lap now i want to take flowers to her to marie rose as her ancestor lena thought as her father i thought you might like to visit there too he said nothing grandmama told me lena continued how marie rose used to go to the cemetery once a year on her birthday shed bring him flowers this morning when i went over to change my clothes she told me where wed find his crypt and we picked these from the marsh i want to take flowers to lucian too he picked one clutch up your symbol of pity if thats the best we can do and the others marie rose took them to her mother once a year as well a part of her m ve known she went to the river every year on her birthday and dropped flowers in the water grandmama told me where she drove smoothly a little fast then slowed to turn into the cemetery i know youre still angry with him and with me if you dont want to do this you can wait in the car i wont blame you why are you doing it hes part of me through blood and more if i can find a way to accept who birthed me if i can live with that then i can find a way to accept this to live with it she stopped the car took two of the bouquets its a little walk from here it shouldnt take me long im coming with you he got out but didnt as shed grown used to reach for her hand they wound their way over the paths between the tombs the ornate grilles the marble angels and through shadows thrown by crosses she stopped at one of the raised tombs there were many simple and unadorned her grandfather rested here and others who were parts and pieces of her but today she had come only for one her hands gripped tight on the flowers marie rose she read blood of my blood heart of my heart grandmama she told me marie rose was a happy woman she had a good life she was content with it that might not be enough to make up for what was done but if it had been done different well i dont see how id be standing here with you this morning she started to lay the flowers and declan closed his hand over hers on the stems they placed them on the grave the baby the girl the old woman together hes a ways from here lena managed her voice was thick her vision blurry as she turned away they walked through the sunlight through the shadows of the tombs in silence the manet crypt was a towering square its porticoes carved its doors thick and studded topping it was a fierce angel holding a harp as a soldier might a shield cheerful declan commented id say none of them went gently into that good night he glanced around saw the plain concrete box on a raised slab the plaque read lucian eduard manet hes out here he wasnt to be forgiven lena explained not for his marriage his child his embarrassing death they called it accidental drowning though everyone knew it was suicide but though josephine wouldnt have him in the family crypt she wanted him buried on consecrated ground otherwise there would have been yet another scandal declan looked back at the crypt bitch he had no grandparents as i did to love him to soften the blows he had a twin brother who loathed him simply because he existed he had money and position education and privilege but no love until abigail then they took her from him she laid the flowers for him he did the best he could it just wasnt enough youre stronger than he ever was smarter more resilient i hope so and i hope he rests soon the flowers wont last long in this sun but well you do what you can she walked away without another word declan lingered a moment more staring at the plaque then the flowers then he went with his impulse took a single flower out of the bouquet and laid it on top of the tomb lena put her sunglasses on because her eyes were tearing that was kind well you do what you can this time he took her hand they didnt speak on the drive back nor did rufus or odette come out of the house when lena parked in front of it he remained silent as she led the way through the marsh silent as he remembered the way in the night with the chill in the air the flitting moonlight the call of an owl and the panting breaths of a killer and his accomplice do you want to go back youre awfully pale no sweat ran down his back despite the cold under his skin i need to do this its not much farther there were marsh flowers springing up along the edges of the narrow beaten path he concentrated on them on the color the small beauty but when she stopped on the bank he was out of breath and dizzy it was here right here i know marie rose came here to this spot her heart knew this time she handed him the bouquet and drew a single flower out declan let the flowers fall into the river watched the color the small beauty float on the brown water not everybody can put flowers on his own grave im sorry tears slid down her cheeks im so sorry she knelt tossed the flower where it would drift alone she groped for declans hand im so sorry i hurt you dont he drew her to her feet into his arms its all right he didnt trust enough i didnt too much grief and not enough faith then now theres been enough grieving then now he tipped up her face and said what hed realized was inside him inside abigail at the moment theyd taken flowers to marie rose i forgive you youre more forgiving than she was maybe maybe thats why we keep going around gives us a chance to fix things we screwed up or make the same mistakes again ive got something else to give you but not here back at the hall its the right place to give it to you okay he kissed her hand were okay i think were getting there id like to walk back get my bearings good idea theres something id like to ask you to do she said as they took the path again id like to put up three markers maybe near the pond one for lucian one for abby and one for marie rose i think its time they were together i think they are together now or nearly he thought very nearly because there was a lightness in his heart he hadnt expected to feel again but the markers would be a nice
