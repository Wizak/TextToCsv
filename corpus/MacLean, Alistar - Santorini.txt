 alistair maclean santorini fontanacollins back cover santorini in the heart of the agean sea a luxury yacht is on fire and sinking fast minutes later a four engined jet with a fire in its nose cone crashes into the sea is there a sinister connection between these two tragedies and is it an accident that the ariadne a nato spy ship is the only ship in the vicinity the only witness only commander talbot of the ariadne can provide the answers as he uncovers a deadly plot involving drugs and terrorism leading to the heart of the pentagon to tom and rena map of agean sea maclean alistair santorini mapjpg chapter an overhead broadcaster on the bridge of the frigate ariadne crackled into life a bell rang twice and then orourkes voice came through calm modulated precise and unmistakably irish orourke was commonly referred to as the weatherman which he wasnt at all just picked up an oddlooking customer forty miles out bearing talbot pressed the reply button the skies above us chief are hotching with oddlooking customers at least six airlines crisscross this patch of the aegean nato planes as you know better than all of us are all around us and those pesky fighterbombers and fighters from the pesky sixth fleet bloweth where the wind listeth me i think theyre lost half the time ah but this is a very odd oddlooking lad orourkes voice was unruffled as ever unmoved by the less than flattering reference to the sixth fleet from which he was on temporary loan no transaegean airline uses the flight path this plane is on there are no nato planes in this particular sector on my display screen and the americans would have let us know a very courteous lot captain the sixth fleet i mean true true the sixth fleet talbot was aware would have informed him of the presence of any of their aircraft in his vicinity not from courtesy but because regulations demanded it a fact of which orourke was as well aware as he was orourke was a doughty defender of his home fleet that all you have on this lad no two things this plane is on a due southwest to northeast course i have no record no information of any plane that could be following this course secondly im pretty sure its a big plane we should see in about four minutes his course is on a direct intersection with ours the size is important chief lots of big planes around not at feet sir which is what this one is only a concorde does that and we know there are no concordes about military job i would guess of unknown origin a bandit could be keep an eye on him talbot looked around and caught the eye of his secondincommand lieutenantcommander van gelder van gelder was short very broad deeply tanned flaxenhaired and seemed to find life a source of constant amusement he was smiling now as he approached the captain consider it done sir the spyglass and a photo for your family album thats it thank you the ariadne carried an immense and to the uninitiated quite bewildering variety of looking and listening instruments that may well have been unmatched by any naval ship afloat among those instruments were what van gelder had referred to as the spyglass this was a combined telescope and camera invented and built by the french of the type used by spy satellites in orbit and which was capable under ideal atmospheric circumstances of locating and photographing a white plate from an altitude of miles the focal length of the telescope was almost infinitely adjustable in this case van gelder would probably use a one in a hundred resolution which would have the optical effect of bringing the intruder if intruder it was to an apparent altitude of four hundred feet in the cloudless july skies of the cyclades this presented no problem at all van gelder had just left the bridge when another loudspeaker came to life the repeated double buzzer identifying it as the radioroom the helmsman leading seaman harrison leaned forward and made the appropriate switch i have an sos i think repeat think vessels position is just south of thera all i have very garbled certainly not a trained operator just keeps repeating mayday mayday mayday myers the radio operator on duty sounded annoyed every radio operator the tone of his voice said should be as expert and efficient as he was wait a minute though there was a pause then myers came on again sinking he says four times he said he was sinking talbot said that all thats all sir hes gone off the air well just keep listening on the distress frequency harrison or near enough cant be more than ten twelve miles away he reached for the engine control and turned it up to full power the ariadne in the modern fashion had dual engineroom and bridge controls the engineroom had customarily only one rating a leading stoker on watch and this only because custom dictated it not because necessity demanded it the lone watchman might just possibly be wandering around with an oilcan in hand but more probably was immersed in one of the lurid magazines with which what was called the engineroom library was so liberally stocked the ariadnes chief engineer lieutenant mccafferty rarely ventured near his own domain a firstclass engineer mccafferty claimed he was allergic to diesel fumes and treated with a knowing disdain the frequently repeated observation that because of the enginerooms highly efficient extractor fans it was virtually impossible for anyone to detect the smell of diesel he was to be found that afternoon as he was most afternoons seated in a deckchair aft and immersed in his favourite form of relaxation the reading of detective novels heavily laced with romance of the more dubious kind the distant sound of the diesels deepened the ariadne was capable of a very respectable knots and the bridge began to vibrate quite noticeably talbot reached for a phone and got through to van gelder weve picked up a distress signal ten twelve miles away let me know when you locate this bandit and ill cut the engines the spyglass though splendidly gimballed to deal with the worst vagaries of pitching and rolling was quite incapable of coping with even the mildest vibration which more often than not produced a very fuzzy photograph indeed talbot moved out on to the port wing to join the lieutenant who stood there a tall thin young man with fair hair thick pebbled glasses and a permanently lugubrious expression well jimmy how do you fancy this a maybe bandit and a sinking vessel at the same time should relieve the tedium of a long hot summers afternoon dont you think the lieutenant looked at him without enthusiasm lieutenant the lord james denholm talbot called him jimmy for brevitys sake seldom waxed enthusiastic about anything i dont fancy it at all captain denholm waved a languid hand disturbs the even tenor of my ways talbot smiled denholm was surrounded by an almost palpable aura of aristocratic exhaustion that had disturbed and irritated talbot in the early stage of their acquaintanceship a feeling that had lasted for no more than half an hour denholm was totally unfitted to be a naval officer of any kind and his highly defective eyesight should have led to his automatic disbarment from any navy in the world but denholm was aboard the ariadne not because of his many connections with the highest echelons of society heir to an earldom his blood was indisputably the bluest of the blue but because without question he was the right man in the right place the holder of three scientific degrees from oxford ucla and mit all summa cum laude in electrical engineering and electronics denholm was as close to being an electronics wizard as any man could ever hope to be not that denholm would have claimed to be anything of what he would have said to be the ridiculous kind despite his lineage and academic qualifications denholm was modest and retiring to a fault this reticence extended even to the making of protests which was why despite his feeble objections he had been under no compulsion to go he had been dragooned into the navy in the first place he said to talbot this bandit captain if it is a bandit what do you intend to do about it i dont intend to do anything about it but if he is a bandit well then hes spying isnt he of course well then what do you expect me to do jimmy bring him down or are you itching to try out this experimental laser gun you have with you heaven forfend denholm was genuinely horrified ive never fired a gun in anger in my life correction ive never even fired a gun if i wanted to bring him down a teenyweeny heatseeking missile would do the job very effectively but we dont do things like that were civilized besides we dont provoke international incidents an unwritten law sounds a very funny law to me not at all when the united states or nato play war games as we are doing now the soviets track us very closely indeed whether on land sea or air we dont complain we cant when theyre playing their game we do exactly the same to them can admittedly have its awkward moments not so long ago when the us navy were carrying out exercises in the sea of japan an american destroyer banged into and quite severely damaged a russian submarine which was monitoring things a little too closely and that didnt cause what youve just called an international incident certainly not nobodys fault mutual apologies between the two captains and the russian was towed to a safe port by another russian warship vladivostok i believe it was talbot turned his head excuse me thats the radioroom callup myers again the speaker said delos name of the sinking vessel very brief message explosion on fire sinking fast keep listening talbot said he looked at the helmsman who already had a pair of binoculars to his eyes you have it harrison yes sir harrison handed over the binoculars and twitched the wheel to port fire off the port bow talbot picked it up immediately a thin black column of smoke rising vertically unwaveringly into the blue and windless sky he was just lowering his glasses when the bell rang twice again it was orourke the weatherman or more officially the senior longrange radar operator lost him im afraid the bandit i mean i was looking at the vectors on either side of him to see if he had any friends and when i came back he was gone any ideas chief well orourke sounded doubtful he could have exploded but i doubt it so do i weve had the spyglass trained on his approach bearing and theyd have picked up an explosion for sure then he must have gone into a steep dive a very steep dive god knows why ill find him the speaker clicked off almost at once a telephone rang again it was van gelder z sir smoke plane could be the bandit almost certainly is the weathermans just lost it off the longrange radar screen probably a waste of time but try to get that photograph anyway he moved out on to the starboard wing and trained his glasses over the starboard quarter he picked it up immediately a heavy dark plume of smoke with he thought a glow of red at its centre it was still quite high at an altitude of four or five thousand feet he didnt pause to check how deeply the plane was diving or whether or not it actually was on fire he moved quickly back into the bridge and picked up a phone sublieutenant cousteau quickly a brief pause henri captain emergency have the launch and the lifeboat slung outboard crews to stand by to lower then report to the bridge he rang down to the engineroom for slow ahead thensaid to harrison hard aport steer north denholm who had moved out on to the starboard wing returned lowering his binoculars well even i can see that plane not a plane rather a huge streamer of smoke could that have been the bandit sir if it was a bandit must have been denholm said tentatively i dont care much for his line of approach sir i dont care much for it myself lieutenant especially if its a military plane and even more especially if its carrying bombs of any sort if you look youll see that were getting out of its way ah evasive action denholm hesitated then said doubtfully well as long as he doesnt alter course dead men dont alter courses that they dont van gelder had just returned to the bridge and the man or the men behind the controls of that plane are surely dead no point in my staying there sir gibsons better with the spyglass camera than i am and hes very busy with it well have plenty of photographs to show you but i doubt whether well be able to learn very much from them as bad as that you werent able to establish anything very little im afraid i did see the outer engine on the port wing so its a fourengined jet civil or military ive no idea a moment please talbot moved out on the port wing looked aft saw that the blazing plane there was no mistaking the flames now was due astern at less than half the height and distance than when he had first seen it returned to the bridge told harrison to steer due north then turned again to van gelder that was all you could establish about except that the fire is definitely located in the nose cone which would rule out any engine explosion it couldnt have been hit by a missile because we know there are no missilecarrying planes around even if there were a heatseeking missile the only type that could nail it at that altitude would have gone for the engines not the nose cone it could only have been an upfront internal explosion talbot nodded reached for a phone asked the exchange for the sick bay and was through immediately doctor would you detail an sba with firstaid kit to stand by the lifeboat he paused for a moment sorry no time to explain come on up to the bridge he looked aft through the starboard wing doorway turned and took the wheel from the helmsman take a look harrison a good look harrison moved out on the starboard wing had his good look it took him only a few seconds returned and took the wheel again awful he shook his head theyre finished sir arent they so i would have thought theyre going to miss us by at least a quarter mile maybe a half harrison took another quick look through the doorway this angle of descent they should land rather hit the sea a mile mile and a half ahead unless by some fluke they carry on and hit the island that would be curtains sir it would indeed talbot looked ahead through the forard screens thera island was some four miles distant with cape akrotiri lying directly to the north and mount elias the highest point of the island it was close on feet to the northeast between them but about five miles further distant a tenuous column of bluish smoke hardly visible against a cloudless sky hung lazily in the air this marked the site of thira village the only settlement of any size on the island but the damage would be limited to the plane the southwest of the island is barren i dont think anyone lives there what are we going to do sir stop over the point where it goes down something like that you can handle it yourself or maybe another quarter or half mile further on along the line he was taking have to wait and see fact is harrison i know no more about it than you do it may disintegrate on impact or if it survives that it may carry on some distance under water not for far i should think not if its nose has gone number one this to van gelder what depths do we have here i know the five fathom mark is about half a mile offshore along the south of the island beyond that it shelves pretty steeply ill have to check in the chartroom at the moment id guess were in two to three hundred fathoms a sonar check sir please van gelder left brushing by sublieutenant cousteau as he did cousteau barely in his twenties was a happygolucky youngster always eager and willing and a more than competent seaman talbot beckoned him out on to the starboard wing have you seen it henri yes sir cousteaus normal cheerfulness was in marked abeyance he gazed in unwilling fascination at the blazing smoking plane now directly abeam and at an altitude of under a thousand feet what a damnable awful thing aye its not nice they had been joined by surgeon lieutenantcommander andrew grierson grierson was dressed in white shorts and a flowing multicoloured hawaiian shirt which he doubtless regarded as the correct dress of the day for the summer aegean so this is why you wanted moss and his firstaid box moss was the leading sick bay attendant im thinking maybe i should be going myselfgrierson was a west highland scot as was immediately evident from his accent an accent which he never attempted to conceal for the excellent reason that he saw no earthly reason why he ever should if there are any survivors which i consider bloody unlikely i know something about decompression problems which moss doesnt talbot was conscious of the increased vibration beneath his feet harrison had increased speed and was edging a little to the east talbot didnt even give it a second thought his faith in his senior quartermaster was complete sorry doctor but i have more important things for you to do he pointed to the east look under the trail of smoke to the planes left i see it i should have seen it before somebody sinking for a fiver indeed something called the delos a private yacht i should imagine and as you say sinking explosion and on fire pretty heavily on fire too i would think burns injuries we live in troubled times grierson said grierson in fact lived a singularly carefree and untroubled existence but talbot thought it was hardly the time to point this out to him the planes silent sir cousteau said the engines have been shut off survivors you think im afraid not the explosion may have destroyed the controls in which case i imagine the engines shut off automatically disintegrate or dive grierson said daft question well know all too soon van gelder joined them i make it eighty fathoms here sir sonar says seventy theyre probably right doesnt matter its shallowing anyway talbot nodded and said nothing nobody said anything nobody felt like saying anything the plane or the source of the dense column of smoke was now less than a hundred feet above the water suddenly the source of the smoke and flame dipped and then was abruptly extinguished even then they failed to catch a glimpse of the plane it had been immediately engulfed in a fiftyfoothigh curtain of water and spray there was no sound of impact and certainly no disintegration for when the water and the spray cleared away there was only the empty sea and curiously small waves little more than ripples radiating outwards from the point of impact talbot touched cousteau on the arm your cue henri hows the whalers radio tested yesterday sir okay if you find anything anybody let us know i have a feeling you wont need that radio when we stop lower away then keep circling around we should be back in half an hour or so cousteau left and talbot turned to van gelder when we stop tell sonar i want the exact depth five minutes later the whaler was in the water and moving away from the side of ae ariadne talbot rang for full power and headed east van gelder hung up a phone thirty fathoms sonar says give or take a fathom thanks doctor hundred and eighty feet grierson said i dont even have to rub my chin over that one the answer is no even if anyone could escape from the fuselage which i think would be impossible in the first place theyd die soon after surfacing divers bends burst lungs they wouldnt know that theyd have to breathe out all the way up a trained fit submariner possibly with breathing apparatus might do it there would be no fit trained submariners aboard that plane questions academic anyway i agree with you captain the only men aboard that plane are dead men talbot nodded and reached for a phone myers signal to general carson unidentified fourengined plane crashed in sea two miles south of cape akrotiri thera island hours impossible to determine whether military or civilian first located altitude feet apparent cause internal explosion no further details available at present no nato planes reported in vicinity have you any information sylvester send code b wilco sir where do i send it rome wherever he is hell have it two minutes later grierson said well yes if anyone knows he should carson was the cinc southern european nato he lifted his binoculars and looked at the vertical column of smoke now no more than four miles to the east a yacht as you say and making quite a bonfire if theres anyone still aboard theyre going to be very warm indeed are you going alongside captain alongside talbot looked at denholm whats your estimate of the value of the electronic gear we have aboard twenty million maybe twentyfive a lot anyway theres your answer doctor that things gone bang once already it can go bang once again i am not going alongside you are in the launch thats expendable the ariadnes not well thank you very much and what intrepid soul im sure number one here will be delighted to ferry you across ah number one have your men wear overalls gloves and flashmasks injuries from burning diesel can be very unpleasant indeed and you i go to prepare myself for selfimmolation and dont forget your lifebelts grierson didnt deign to answer they had halved the remaining distance to the burning yacht when talbot got through to the radioroom again message dispatched dispatched and acknowledged anything more from the delos nothing delos denholm said thats about eighty miles north of here alas the cyclades will never be the same for me again denholm sighed electronics specialist or not he regarded himself primarily as a classicist and indeed he was totally fluent in reading and writing both latin and greek he was deeply immersed in their ancient cultures as the considerable library in his cabin bore testimony he was also much given to quotations and he quoted now the isles of greece the isles of greece where burning sappho loved and sung where grew the arts of war and peace where delos rose and phoebus sprung eternal summer your point is taken lieutenant talbot said well cry tomorrow in the meantime let us address ourselves to the problem of those poor souls on the focsle i count five of them so do i denholm lowered his glasses whats all the frantic waving for surely to god they cant imagine we havent seen them theyve seen us all right relief lieutenant expectation of rescue but theres more to it than that a certain urgency in their waving a primitive form of semaphoring what theyre saying is get us the hell out of here and be quick about it maybe theyre expecting another explosion could be that harrison i want to come to a stop on their starboard beam at you understand a prudent distance a hundred yards sir fine the delos was or had been a rather splendid yacht a streamlined eightyfooter it was obvious that it had been until very very recently a dazzling white now because of a combination of smoke and diesel oil it was mainly black a rather elaborate superstructure consisted of a bridge saloon a diningroom and what may or may not have been a galley the still dense smoke and flames rising six feet above the poop deck indicated the source of the fire almost certainly the engineroom just aft of the fire a small motorboat was still secured to its davits it wasnt difficult to guess that either the explosion or the fire had rendered it inoperable talbot said rather odd dont you think lieutenant odd denholm said carefully yes you can see that the flames are dying away one would have thought that would reduce the danger of further explosion talbot moved out on the port wing and you will have observed that the water level is almost up to the deck i can see shes sinking indeed if you were aboard a vessel that was either going to go up or drag you down when it sank what would your natural reaction be to be elsewhere sir but i can see that their motorboat has been damaged agreed but a craft that size would carry alternative lifesaving equipment if not a carley float then certainly an inflatable rubber dinghy and any prudent owner would carry a sufficiency of lifebelts and lifejackets for the passengers and crew i can even see two lifebelts in front of the bridge but they havent done the obvious thing and abandoned ship i wonder why ive no idea sir but it is damned odd when weve rescued those distressed mariners and brought them aboard you jimmy will have forgotten how to speak greek but i will not have forgotten how to listen in greek precisely commander talbot you have a devious and suspicious mind it goes with the job jimmy it goes with the job harrison brought the ariadne to a stop off the starboard beam of the delos at the agreed hundred yards distance van gelder was away at once and was very quickly alongside the focsle of the delos two boathooks around the guardrail stanchions held them in position as the launch and the bows of the sinking yacht were now almost level it took only a few seconds to transfer the six survivors another had joined the group of five that talbot had seen aboard the launch they were indeed a sorry and sadly bedraggled lot so covered in diesel and smoke that it was quite impossible to discriminate among them on the basis of age sex or nationality van gelder said any of you here speak english we all do the speaker was short and stocky and that was all that could be said of him in the way of description some of us just a little but enough the voice was heavily accented but readily understood van gelder looked at grierson any of you injured any of you burnt grierson said all shook their heads or mumbled a negative nothing here for me number one hot showers detergents soap not to mention a change of clothing whos in charge here van gelder asked i am it was the same man anybody left aboard three men im afraid they wont be coming with us you mean theyre dead the man nodded ill check no no his oilsoaked hand gripped van gelders arm it is too dangerous far too dangerous i forbid it you forbid me nothing when van gelder wasnt smiling which wasnt often he could assume a very discouraging expression indeed the man withdrew his hand where are those men in the passageway between the engineroom and the stateroom aft we got them out after the explosion but before the fire began riley this to a leading seaman come aboard with me if you think the yachts going give me a call he picked up a torch and was about to board the delos when a hand holding a pair of goggles reached out and stopped him van gelder smiled thank you doctor i hadnt thought of that once aboard he made his way aft and descended the after companionway there was smoke down there but not too much and with the aid of his torch he had no difficulty in locating the three missing men all huddled shapelessly in a corner to his right was the engineroom door slightly buckled from the force of the explosion not without some difficulty he forced the door open and at once began coughing as the foulsmelling smoke caught his throat and eyes he pulled on the goggles but still there was nothing to see except for the red embers of a dying fire emanating from some unknown source he pulled the door to behind him he was reasonably certain there was nothing for him to see in the engineroom anyway and stooped to examine the three dead men they were far from being a pretty sight but he forced himself to carry out as thorough an investigation as he could he spent some quite considerable time bent over the third man in the circumstances thirty seconds was a long time and when he straightened he looked both puzzled and thoughtful the door to the after stateroom opened easily there was some smoke there but not so much that he required to use his goggles the cabin was luxuriously furnished and immaculately tidy a condition which van gelder very rapidly altered he pulled a sheet from one of the beds spread it on the floor opened up wardrobes and drawers scooped up armfuls of clothes there was no time to make any kind of selection and even if there had been he would have been unable to pick and choose they were all womens clothing dumped them on the sheet tied up the four corners lugged the bundle up the companionway and handed it over to riley put this in the launch im going to have a quick look at the forard cabins i think the steps will be at the forard end of the saloon under the bridge i think you should hurry sir van gelder didnt answer he didnt have to be told why he should hurry the sea was already beginning to trickle over on to the upper deck he passed into the saloon found the companionway at once and descended to a central passage he switched on his torch there was of course no electrical power left there were doors on both sides and one at the end the first door to port opened up into a food store the corresponding door to starboard was locked van gelder didnt bother with it the delos didnt look like the kind of craft that would lack a commodious liquor store behind the ochre doors lay four cabins and two bathrooms all were empty as he had done before van gelder spread out a sheet in the passageway this time threw some more armfuls of clothes on to it secured the corners and hurried up on deck the launch was no more than thirty yards away when the delos still on even keel slid gently under the surface of the sea there was nothing dramatic to mark its going just a stream of air bubbles that became gradually smaller and ceased altogether after about twenty seconds talbot was on deck when the launch brought back the six survivors he looked in concern at the woebegone and bedraggled figures before him my goodness what a state you people are in this the lot number one those that survived sir three died impossible to get their bodies out in time he indicated the figure nearest him this is the owner andropulos the man said spyros andropulos you are the officer in charge commander talbot my commiserations mr andropulos and my thanks commander we are very deeply grateful with respect sir that can wait first things first and the very first thing is to get yourselves cleaned up immediately ah and changed a problem clothes well find some clothing we have van gelder said he pointed at the two sheetwrapped packages ladies gentlemen a mention in dispatches for that number one you said ladies two commander andropulos said he looked at the two people standing by him my niece and her friend ah well should apologize i suppose but difficult to tell in the circumstances my name is charial the voice was unmistakably feminine irene charial this is my friend eugenia we could have met under happier circumstances lieutenant denholm here will take you to my cabin the bathroom is small but adequate by the time you bring them back lieutenant i trust they are recognizable for what they are he turned to a burly darkhaired figure who like most of the crew wore no insignia of rank chief petty officer mckenzie mckenzie was the senior nco on the ariadne the four gentlemen here chief you know what to do right away sir if you will come with me gentlemen grierson also left and van gelder and talbot were left alone we can find this place again van gelder asked no trouble talbot looked at him speculatively and pointed towards the northwest ive taken a bearing on the monastery and radar station on mount elias there sonar says that were in eighteen fathoms just to make sure well drop a marker buoy general carson laid down the slip of paper he had been studying and looked at the colonel seated across the table from him what do you make of this charles could be nothing could be important sorry that doesnt help i have a feeling i dont like it it would help a bit if we had a sailor around carson smiled and pressed a button do you know if viceadmiral hawkins is in the building he is sir a girls voice do you wish to speak to him or see him see him jean ask him if he would be kind enough to stop by viceadmiral hawkins was very young for one of his rank he was short a little overweight more than a little rubicund as to his features and exuded an aura of cheerful bonhomie he didnt look very bright which he was he was widely regarded as having one of the most brilliant minds in the royal navy he took the seat to which carson had gestured him and glanced at the message slip i see i see he laid the message down but you didnt ask me here to comment on a perfectly straightforward signal the sylvester is one of the code names for the frigate hms ariadne one of the vessels under your command sir dont rub it in david i know it of course more accurately i know of it dont forget im just a simple landlubber odd name isnt it royal naval ship with a greek name courtesy gesture to the greeks sir were carrying out a joint hydrographic survey with them is that so general carson ran a hand through his grizzled hair i was not aware that i was in the hydrographic business david youre not sir although i have no doubt it could carry out such a survey if it were called for the ariadne has a radio system that can transmit to and receive transmissions from any quarter of the globe it has telescopes and optical instruments that can pick out the salient features of say any passing satellite even those in geosynchronous orbit and thats miles up it carries longrange and surface radar that is as advanced as any in the world and it has a sonar location and detection system that can pick up a sunken object at the bottom of the ocean just as easily as it can pinpoint a lurking submarine the ariadne sir is the eyes and the ears and the voice of your fleet thats nice to know i must say very reassuring the ability of the commanding officer of the ariadne is ah commensurate with this extraordinary array of devices he controls indeed sir for an exceptionally complex task an exceptionally qualified man commander talbot is an outstanding officer handpicked for the job who picked him i did i see that terminates this line of conversation very abruptly carson pondered briefly i think colonel that we should ask general simpson about this one simpson the overall commander of nato was the only man who outranked carson in europe dont see what else we can do sir you would agree david no general i think youd be wasting your time if you dont know anything about this then im damned sure general simpson doesnt know anything either this is not an educated guess call it a completely uneducated guess but i have an odd feeling that this is one of your planes sir an american plane a bomber almost certainly perhaps not yet off the secret lists it was after all flying at an uncommon height the ariadne could have been in error the ariadne does not make mistakes my job and my life on it the flat unemotional voice carried complete conviction commander talbot is not the only uniquely qualified man aboard there are at least thirty others in the same category we have for example an electronics officer so unbelievably advanced in his speciality that none of your muchvaunted hightechnology whizzkids in silicon valley would even begin to know what hes talking about carson raised a hand point taken david point taken so an american bomber a very special bomber because it must be carrying a very special cargo what would you guess that to be hawkins smiled faintly i am not yet in the esp business sir people or goods very secret very important goods or very secret and very important people theres only one source that can give you the answer and it might be pointed out that their refusal to divulge this information might put the whole future of nato at risk and that the individual ultimately responsible for the negative decision would be answerable directly to the president of the united states one does not imagine that the individual concerned would remain in a position of responsibility for very much longer carson sighed if i may speak in a spirit of complaint david i might point out that its easy for you to talk and even easier to talk tough youre a british officer im an american i appreciate that sir carson looked at the colonel who remained silent for a couple of moments then nodded slowly twice carson reached for the button on his desk jean sir get me the pentagon immediately chapter you are unhappy vincent vincent was van gelders first name there were three of them seated in the wardroom talbot van gelder and grierson puzzled you might say sir i dont understand why andropulos and the others didnt abandon ship earlier i saw two inflatable dinghies aboard rolled up admittedly but those things can be opened and inflated from their gas cylinders in seconds there were also lifebelts and lifejackets there was no need for this theboystoodontheburningdeck act they could have left at any time im not saying theyd have been sucked down with the yacht but they might have had a rather uncomfortable time same thought had occurred to me mentioned it to andrew here odd maybe andropulos had a reason anything else the owner tried to stop me from boarding the yacht maybe he was concerned with my health i have the feeling he wasnt then i would much like to know what caused that explosion in the engineroom a luxurious yacht like that must have carried an engineer we can find that out easily enough and its a fair guess that the engines would have been maintained in an immaculate condition i dont see how they could have caused an explosion well have to ask mccafferty about that one that of course is why you were so anxious that we pinpoint the spot where the delos went down you think an expert on the effects of explosives could identify and locate the cause of the explosion im sure he could especially if he were an expert at determining the causes of aircraft lost through explosions those people are much better at that sort of thing than the navy is explosives experts we have aboard but no experts on the effects of explosives even if we did we have no divers aboard well you and myself apart trained to work at levels below a hundred feet we could borrow one easily enough from a lifting vessel or salvage tug but the chances are high that hed know nothing about explosives but theres really no problem it would be a simple matter for any lifting vessel to raise an aircraft fuselage to the surface talbot regarded van gelder thoughtfully but theres something else worrying you isnt there yes sir the three dead men aboard the delos well to be specific just one of them thats why i asked the doctor here to come along the three of them were so smoke begrimed and blackened that it was difficult to tell what they were wearing but two of them appeared to be dressed in white while the third was in a navy blue overall an engineer wouldnt wear whites well i admit our engineer lieutenant mccafferty is a dazzling exception but hes a oneoff case he never goes near his engines anyway in any event i assumed the man in the overalls was the engineer and he was the one who caught my attention he had a vicious gash on the back of his head as if he had been blown backwards against a very hard very sharp object grierson said or been struck by a very hard sharp object either way i suppose i wouldnt know im afraid im a bit weak on the forensic side had his occiput been crushed back of his head no at least im reasonably certain it hadnt been i mean it would have given wouldnt it or been squashy it wasnt like that a blow like that should have caused massive bruising did you see any difficult to say he had fairly thick hair but it was fair no i dont think there was any had it bled a lot he hadnt bled at all im quite sure of that you didnt notice any holes in his clothing not that i could see he hadnt been shot if that is what youre asking and that is what i think you are asking who would want to shoot a dead man his neck was broken indeed grierson seemed unsurprised poor man was through the wars wasnt he talbot said what do you think andrew i dont know what to think the inflicting of the wound on the head and the snapping of the vertebra could well have been simultaneous if the two werent simultaneous then it could equally well have been as vincent clearly seems to think a case of murder would an examination of the corpse help at all it might i very much doubt it but an examination of engineroom bulkheads would to see if there were any sharp edges or protrusions that could have caused such a head wound grierson nodded well when and if we ever raise that hull we should be able to kill two birds with one stone to determine the causes of both the explosions and this mans death maybe three birds van gelder said it would be interesting to know the number and layout of the fuel tanks in the engineroom there are i believe two common layouts in one case there is just one main fuel tank athwartships and attached to the forard bulkhead with a generator or generators on one side of the engine and batteries on the other plus a watertank to port and another to starboard or there could be a fuel tank on either side with the watertank up front in that case the two fuel tanks are interconnected to keep the fuel levels equal and maintain equilibrium a suspicious mind number one talbot said very suspicious what you would like to find of course is just one fuel tank because you think andropulos is going to claim that he didnt abandon ship because he thought another fuel tank was about to go and he didnt want his precious passengers splashing about in a sea of blazing fuel oil which would of course also have destroyed the rubber dinghies im grieved sir i thought id thought of that first you did in fact when the passengers are cleaned up see if you can get this young lady irene charial alone and find out if she knows anything about the layout of the engineroom the casual approach vincent the innocent and cherubic expression although i doubt the last is beyond you anyway its possible shes never been there and may possibly know nothing about it its equally possible sir that she knows all about it and may well choose to tell me something miss charial is andropuloss niece the thought had occurred however if andropulos is not all he might be then the chances are high that there is some other member of his ships company in his confidence and i would have thought that would be a man i dont say that thats because you know what the greeks are like because i dont know what the greeks are like and we mustnt forget that andropulos may be as innocent as the driven snow and that there is a perfectly rational explanation for all that has happened anyway it would do no harm to try and you never can tell vincent she might turn out to be a classic greek beauty from the fact that the whaler was lying stopped in the water and that cousteau his hand resting idly on the tiller appeared to be expressing no great degree of interest in anything it was obvious that his wait had been a vain one a fact he confirmed on his arrival on the bridge talbot called the sonar room you have pinpointed the location of the plane yes sir were sitting exactly above it depth registered is eighteen fathoms thats the echo from the top of the fuselage probably lying in about twenty fathoms its lying in the same direction as it was flying when it came down northeast to southwest picking up some rather odd noises down here sir would you care to come down yes i will for reasons best known to himself halzman die senior sonar operator preferred not to discuss it over an open line a minute or two he turned to van gelder have mckenzie put down a marker buoy about midships tell him to lower the weight gently i dont want to bump too hard against the planes fuselage in case we do actually come into contact with it when thats been done i want to anchor two anchors a stern anchor to the northwest about a hundred yards distant from the buoy then a bow anchor a similar distance to the southeast yes sir may i suggest the other way around of course youre right id forgotten about our old friend taking a holiday today isnt it the other way around of course the old friend to which he referred and which van gelder clearly had in mind was the meltemi wind referred to as the etesian in the british sailing directions in the cyclades in the summer months and indeed in most or the aegean it blew steadily but usually only in the afternoon and early evening from the northwest if it did start up the ariadne would ride more comfortably if it were bows on to it talbot went to the sonar room which was only one deck down and slightly aft the sonar room was heavily insulated against all outside noise and dimly lit by subdued yellow lighting there were three display screens two sets of control panels and over and above all a considerable number of heavily padded earphones halzman caught sight of him in an overhead mirror there were a number of such mirrors around speaking as well as any other kind of sound was kept to a minimum in the sonar room removed his earphones and gestured to the seat beside him those earphones sir i thought you might be interested in listening for a minute talbot sat and clamped the earphones on after about fifteen seconds he removed them and turned to halzman who had also removed his i cant hear a damned thing with respect sir when i said a minute i meant just that a minute first of all you have to listen until you hear the silence then youll hear it whatever that means ill try it talbot listened again and just before the allotted minute was up he leaned forward and creased his brow after another thirty seconds he removed the headset a ticking sound strange halzman you were right first you hear the silence and then you hear it tick tick tick once every two to three seconds very regular very faint youre certain that comes from the plane i have no doubt sir have you ever heard anything like it before no sir ive spent hundreds of hours more likely thousands listening to sonar asdics hydrophones but this is something quite new on me ive got pretty good hearing but i had to wait almost a moment before i could imagine i could hear anything its very very faint isnt it it is i had to turn the hearing capacity up to maximum before i stumbled on it not a practice i would normally follow or recommend in the wrong circumstances you can get your eardrums blasted off why is it so faint well the source of the sound may be very faint to begin with ive been thinking about this sir well ive had nothing else to think about its either a mechanical or electrical device in either case it has to be inside a sealed or waterproof casing a mechanical device could of course operate in water even if it was totally submerged but operating in water would dampen out the sound almost completely an electrical device would have to be totally sealed against seawater the planes own electrical system of course has ceased to function so it would have to have its own supply system almost certainly batterypowered in either event mechanical or electrical the sound impulses would have to pass through the waterproof casing after which they must pass through the fuselage of the plane have you any idea as to what it might be none whatsoever its a two and a half second sequence ive timed it i know of no watch or clock movement that follows that sequence do you sir no i dont you think it could be some sort of timing device i thought about that too sir but i put it out of my mind halzman smiled maybe im prejudiced against that idea because of all those cheap and awful video film cassettes we have aboard with all their special effects and pseudo science all i know for sure sir is that we have a mysterious plane lying on the seabed there lord only knows what mysterious kind of cargo it was carrying agreed i think wed better leave it at that for the moment have one of your boys monitor it once say in every fifteen minutes when talbot returned to the bridge he could see the marker buoy just astern bobbing gently in the very small wake van gelder was creating as he edged the ariadne gently to the northwest very soon he stopped juggled the engines to and fro until he reckoned the bows were a hundred yards distant from the buoy had the anchor dropped then moved just as slowly astern the anchor chain being paid out as he went soon the stern anchor had been paid out and the ariadne was back to where she had started the buoy nudging the midships portside neatly done talbot said tell me number one how are you on puzzles useless even the simplest crossword baffles me no matter were picking up a strange noise on the sonar maybe youd like to take a turn along there perhaps even identify it baffles me consider it done back in two or three minutes twenty minutes elapsed before he returned to the bridge where talbot was now alone as the ship was no longer under way harrison had retired to his mess that was a long couple of minutes vincent and what are you looking so pleased about i really dont know how you do it sir incredible i dont suppose you have any scottish blood not a drop as far as im aware am i supposed to be following you number one i thought maybe the second sight you were right a classic greek beauty irene miss charial that is odd mind you blonde as they come i thought all those warmblooded young latin ladies had hair as black as a ravens wing its the sheltered life you lead vincent you should go to andalucia some day seville on one street corner a dusky moorish maiden the next a nordic blonde well discuss pigmentation some other time what did you learn enough i hope its an art sir this casual and inconsequential approach the questioning i mean she seems honest and open enough not ingenuous if you know what i mean but quite straightforward certainly didnt give the impression of having anything to hide says she doesnt know the engineroom well but has been there a couple of times we came to the question of fuel oil i was just wondering out loud natural curiosity i hope she thought as to what could have caused the explosion seems i was wrong when i said there were just two common ways of arranging fuel and water tanks seems theres a third two big tanks on either side of the engine one fuel one water how big i dont know she was a bit vague about that no reason why she should know but at least thousands of litres she says if there was a spare fuel tank she didnt know about it i look forward sir to hearing mr andropulos justifying his decision not to abandon ship so do i should be interesting anyway congratulations a good job no hardship sir van gelder scanned the sea around odd dont you think sir i mean are we the only ones who heard the sos i would have thought the horizon would have been black with converging vessels by this time not so strange really nearly all the vessels around at this rime of year are private yachts and fishermen lots of them dont carry any radio at all and even those who do almost certainly wouldnt be permanently tuned to the distress frequency but we are this time im ahead of you the delos or at least andropulos knew that we would be permanently tuned to the distress frequency that we are automatically alerted by bell or buzzer whenever the distress frequency is energized this presupposes two things he knew we were a naval vessel and he also knew that we were in the vicinity you realize what you are saying sir sorry i didnt mean it to sound that way but the implications sir i must say i really dont like those at all neither do i opens up all sorts of avenues of interesting speculation doesnt it he turned as mckenzie came on to the bridge and how are our oilstained survivors chief clean sir and in dry clothes i dont think any of them will make the list of the ten bestdressed men he looked at van gelder i gather you didnt have too much time sir for the selection and careful matching up of clothes theyre a bit of an odd sight i must say but respectable enough i knew you would want to see them captain mr andropulos seems very anxious to see you and i know you dont like unauthorized people on the bridge so i took the liberty of putting the four gentlemen and the two young ladies in the wardroom i hope thats all right sir fine you might ask the surgeon commander and lieutenant denholm to join us there and send a couple of your boys up here to keep a lookout who knows our radar might have a day off the six survivors from the delos were standing around rather awkwardly not talking when talbot and van gelder reached the wardroom the four men as mckenzie had suggested did present rather an odd spectacle they looked rather as if they had just raided an old clothes shop few of the items of their clothing being a match and for the most part fitting only where they touched in striking contrast both girls were immaculately clad dressed in white blouses and white skirts they could have stepped straight from the pages of vogue please talbot said all of you be seated before we talk i suggest we get our priorities right first things first youve had a harrowing experience and a lucky escape i suggest you will not take amiss the suggestion of a suitable restorative he pressed a bell and a steward entered jenkins refreshments find out what they would like jenkins did so and left im the captain talbot said talbot this is lieutenantcommander van gelder ah the door had opened and this is surgeoncommander grierson whom you have met and whose services you fortunately didnt require and lieutenant denholm he looked at the short stocky man seated before him i take it that you sir are mr andropulos die owner i am commander i am andropulos had black hair black eyes white teeth and a deeply tanned complexion he looked as if he hadnt shaved that morning but then he would always look as if he hadnt shaved that morning he leapt to his feet took talbots hand and shook it vigorously he positively radiated a combined aura of benevolence and bonhomie words cannot express our gratitude a closerun thing commander a very closerun thing we owe you our lives i wouldnt go as far as to say that but ill admit you were in a rather nasty pickle pickle pickle dangerous circumstances i deeply regret both your loss of the members of your crew and your yacht the yacht is nothing i can always buy another well lloyds of london can buy it for me still sadder to lose an old friend like the delos but sadder still much sadder to lose the three members of my crew been with me for many years i treasured them all who were they sir my engineer chef and steward with me for many years andropulos shook his head they will be sadly missed wasnt it odd for a chef and steward to be in the engineroom andropulos smiled sadly not aboard the delos commander it was not exactly run along the lines of a ship of the royal navy they were in the habit of having an afterlunch drink there with the engineer they had my permission of course but they preferred to be discreet about it and what more discreet place than the engineroom alas their discretion cost them their lives that is ironic may i be introduced to the others of course of course this is my very dear friend alexander alexander was a tall man with a thin unsmiling face and black cold eyes who didnt look as if he could possibly be anybodys very dear friend this is aristotle my captain andropulos didnt say whether aristotle was the first or last name he had watchful eyes and a serious expression but looked as if he might unlike alexander be capable of smiling occasionally and this is achmed he didnt say what occupation achmed held he was young pleasantfaced and smiled readily talbot couldnt even begin to guess at his nationality except that he wasnt greek but i forget myself deplorable deplorable i forget myself such manners should have been ladies first of course this is my niece irene van gelder hadnt made any mistakes about her talbot thought except that hed missed out on the wide green eyes and a rather bewitching smile and this is eugenia this one talbot reflected was much closer to van gelders concept of a warmblooded young latin lady she had a slightly dusky skin black hair and warm brown eyes and she also no doubt was quite beautiful it seemed to talbot that van gelder was going to find himself in something of a quandary i congratulate you mr andropulos talbot said gallantly and ourselves certainly the loveliest passengers weve ever had aboard the ariadne ah the steward andropulos took his glass a scotch and not a small one and disposed of half the contents in one gulp my goodness i needed that thank you commander thank you not as young as i was nor as tough either age cometh to us all he quaffed the rest of his drink and sighed talbot said jenkins another for mr andropulos a slightly larger measure this time jenkins looked at him expressionlessly closed his eyes momentarily and left the ariadne andropulos said rather odd is it not greek name british vessel courtesy gesture to your government sir we are carrying out a hydrographic charting exercise with your people talbot saw no point in mentioning that the ariadne had never carried out a hydrographic exercise in its life and that the ship had been called ariadne to remind the greeks that it was a multinational vessel and to persuade a wavering greek government that perhaps nato wasnt such a bad thing after all hydrographic you say is that why were moored fore and aft a fixed platform for taking bearings a fixed platform yes but in this instance the purpose is not hydrographic weve had quite a busy afternoon mr andropulos and at the moment were anchored over a plane that crashed into the sea just about the time we were receiving your sos a plane crashed good god what what kind of plane we have no idea it was so wreathed in smoke that it was impossible to distinguish any important features but surely well dont you think it was a big plane it may have been but it could have been a big jet maybe hundreds of passengers if andropulos knew it wasnt a jet carrying hundreds of passengers his face wasnt saying so its always possible talbot saw no point in telling andropulos that it was almost certainly a bomber and equally certainly not carrying hundreds of passengers you you mean to tell me that you left the area to come to our aid a reasonable enough decision i think we were pretty certain that there were people alive aboard the delos and we were also pretty certain that there was no one alive aboard that plane there could have been survivors aboard that plane i mean you werent there to see mr andropulos talbot allowed a certain coldness to creep into his voice we are i hope neither callous nor stupid before leaving we lowered one of our motorboats to circle the area there were no survivors oh dear irene charial said isnt it awful all those people dead and there we were busy doing nothing except feeling sorry for ourselves im not being inquisitive captain and i know its none of my business but why do you remain anchored here i mean there cant possibly be any hope now that some survivors may surface there is no hope miss charial were remaining here as a marker until the diving ship arrives he didnt like lying to her but thought it inadvisable to tell her that there was no rescue ship hurrying to the scene and that as far as he knew the only other people who knew of the disaster were the nato hq in italy more especially he didnt want any person or persons in her company to know but but it will be too late to save anyone its already too late young lady but theyll send divers down to investigate to find out whether its a passengercarrying jet or not and to try to ascertain the cause of the accident he was looking without seeming to look at andropulos as he said the last words and felt almost certain that he saw a flicker of expression cross his face andropuloss captain aristotle spoke for the first time how deep is this plane commander seventeen eighteen fathoms just over thirty metres or so thirty metres andropulos said even if they do get inside and theres no guarantee that they will be able to do so wont it be difficult to move around and see anything i can guarantee theyll get inside there are such things as oxyacetylene torches you know and theyll have powerful underwater torches but they wont bother with either of those things the divers will carry down a couple of slings with them a diving ship will have no difficulty at all in bringing the fuselage to the surface then theyll be able to examine the plane at their leisure this time there was no trace of expression in andropuloss face talbot wondered if be andropulos had become aware that such changes in expression were being sought for jenkins entered and handed talbot a sealed envelope from the radioroom sir myers said it was urgent talbot nodded opened the envelope extracted and read the slip of paper it had held he slipped it in his pocket and stood my apologies ladies and gentlemen i have to go to the bridge come along with me number one ill join you at seven oclock for dinner once outside van gelder said you really are a fearful liar sir a fearfully good liar i mean andropulos isnt half bad either hes had practice between the two of you well in his own phrase its a closerun thing ah thank you he unfolded the slip of paper talbot had handed him vitally urgent you remain in closest contact with downed plane stop will join you earliest in the morning stop hawkins isnt that the viceadmiral sir none other vitally urgent and flying down to see us what do you make of that i make it that he knows something that we dont indeed incidentally youve kind of forgotten to tell me about your visit to sonar sorry about that sir i had something else on my mind somebody not something having seen her i can understand well the noise from the plane tick tick tick could be anything halzman half suggested it might be some sort of timing device could be that hes right i dont want to sound alarmist sir but i dont think i like it very much i dont particularly care for it myself well then the radioroom i thought you said you were going to the bridge that was for andropuloss benefit the less that character knows about anything the better i think hes cunning astute and alert for the slightest nuances is that why you didnt make any reference to the engineroom explosion yes i may of course be doing him a massive injustice for all i know he may be as fresh and innocent as the dawns early dew you dont really believe that sir no myers was alone in the radioroom another message to rome talbot said again code b to viceadmiral hawkins message received strongly advise that you come soonest tonight report repeated two and a half second ticking sounds from plane could be timing device please phone immediately a ticking sound possibly a timing device talbot says viceadmiral hawkins was standing by carsons chair as the general read and reread the slip of paper hawkins had just handed him a timing device we dont have to discuss the implications of this from his highrise office carson looked out over the roofs of rome then at the colonel across the desk then finally up at hawkins he pressed a button on his desk get me the pentagon the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was also standing as the man behind the desk read the slip of paper he had just been handed he read it three times laid it down carefully on the desk smoothed it out and looked across at the chairman his face looked drawn and tired and old we know what this means or what it could mean if anything goes wrong the international repercussions will be enormous general im afraid im fully aware of that sir apart from the universal condemnation we will become the pariah dog the outcasts of the world and no hint of any soviet involvement none whatsoever no proof direct or indirect as far as the world is concerned they are blameless my first reaction is that they are indeed blameless my second thoughts are exactly the same i can see no way they are linked with this we bear the burden sir we bear the burden and will stand condemned before the court of mankind the general made no reply the chiefs have no suggestions none that i regard as very useful in short bluntly none we have to rely on our people out there carte blanche sir we have no option how good are your men in the mediterranean the very best no rhetoric sir i mean it and this british vessel on the spot the frigate ariadne a very special vessel indeed i am given to understand whether or not it can cope with this no one can say there are too many imponderables do we pull it out thats not for my decision sir i know its not he was silent for a long moment then said it may be our only hope it stays yes mr president talbot was alone with van gelder on the bridge when the radioroom called i have voice contact with rome sir where will you take it here he gestured to van gelder to take up a listening phone talbot here hawkins im leaving shortly with two civilians for athens youll have a phone call from there letting you know our estimated time of arrival well be landing on thera island have a launch standing by to meet us yes sir take a taxi down to athinio theres a new quay about two miles south of the thira village anchorage my map shows that the thira anchorage is nearer what your map may not show is that the only way down to thira anchorage is by muletrack down a precipitous cliff a sevenhundredfoot cliff to be precise thank you talbot a life saved you have not forgotten my twin betes noires my fatal flaws till this evening then what betes noires van gelder said what flaws he hates horses i would imagine the detestation extends to mules and he suffers from acrophobia that sounds a very nasty thing to suffer from and what might that be vertigo a fear of heights almost got him disbarred from entry to the navy he had a powerful aversion to climbing up rigging you know him well then pretty well now this evening id normally send young henri to pick anybody up but viceadmiral hawkins and the two no doubt equally distinguished civilians who are with him are not anybody so we do it in style a lieutenantcommander i thought my pleasure sir and tell them all you know about the plane the delos and the survivors also our suspicions about the survivors saves the time when they get here ill do that speaking about the survivors when i go ashore do you want me to take them along and dump them you are unwell number one im fine didnt for a moment think youd want them out of your sight and we couldnt very well abandon the two young ladies on that barren rock there its as well the islanders cant hear you theres fourteen hundred people in the thira township and theres a fair amount of tourist accommodation and speaking again of the survivors not to mention our three other visitors well have to find sleeping accommodation for them the admiral can have the admirals cabin itll be the first time an admiral has slept there there are three empty cabins you can have mine ill sleep here or in the chartroom the rest well you fix it five minutes said he confidently he was back in fortyfive took me a little longer than i thought ticklish problems whos got my cabin irene eugenia has mine it took you threequarters of an hour to arrange that decisions decisions calls for a little delicacy and a modicum of finesse my word you do do yourselves well commander andropulos said he sipped some claret or is this a special treat for us standard fare i assure you andropulos whom grierson had reported as having a remarkable affinity for scotch seemed relaxed to the point of garrulity talbot would have taken long odds that he was cold sober he talked freely about quite a number of subjects but had not once broached the question of being sent ashore it was clear that he and talbot had at least one thing in common the wish that he remain aboard the ariadne jenkins came in and spoke softly to van gelder who looked at talbot call from the radioroom shall i take it talbot nodded van gelder left and returned within half a minute call was delayed sir difficulty in contacting us they will be there in less than half an hour id better go now im expecting visitors later this evening talbot said i shall have to ask you not to come to the wardroom for some time after they come not for too long twenty minutes at the most visitors andropulos said atthis time of the evening who on earth are they im sorry mr andropulos this is a naval vessel there are certain things i cant discuss with civilians chapter viceadmiral hawkins was the first up the gangway he shook talbots hand warmly the admiral didnt go in much for saluting delighted to see you again john or i would be if it werent for the circumstances and how are you my boy fine sir again considering the circumstances and the children little fiona and jimmy in the best thank you sir youve come a long way in a short time needs must when the devil drives and hes sitting on my tail right now he turned to the two men who had followed him up the gangway professor benson dr wickram gentlemen commander talbot the captain of the ariadne if you will come with me gentlemen ill have your gear taken to your quarters talbot led them to the wardroom and gestured them to their seats you want me to get my priorities right certainly talbot pressed a bell and jenkins came in a large gin and tonic for those two gentlemen hawkins said lots of ice theyre americans large scotch and water for me quarters you said what quarters you havent been aboard since before commissioning but you wont have forgotten for an admiral an admirals quarters never been used how perfectly splendid honoured im sure and for my two friends here a cabin apiece also never been used i think theyll find them quite comfortable id like to bring along some of my officers sir but of course whom did you have in mind surgeoncommander grierson know him hawkins said very wise bird lieutenant denholm our electronic wunderkind i know youve met him sir that i have he looked at his two friends smiling broadly youll have to mind your ps and qs here lieutenant denholm is the heir to an earldom the genuine article fearfully languid and aristocratic dont be deceived for an instant mind like a knife as i told general carson hes so incredibly advanced in his electronic speciality that your hightech whizzkids in silicon valley wouldnt even begin to understand what hes talking about then theres lieutenant mccafferty our senior engineer and of course lieutenantcommander van gelder whom youve already met for the first time favourably impressed very struck me as an able lad indeed hes all that more if i were laid low tomorrow you wouldnt have to worry he could take over the ariadne at any moment and you wouldnt notice the difference from you thats worth any halfdozen testimonials ill bear it in mind introductions completed hawkins looked at talbot and his four officers and said the first question in your minds of course gentlemen is why i have brought two civilians with me first i will tell you who they are and then when i have explained the purpose of our coming you will understand why they are here in passing i might say how extraordinarily lucky i am to have them here with me they seldom leave their home state of california it just so happened that both were attending an international conference in rome professor alec benson here benson was a large calm man in his early sixties grey of hair cherubic and cheerful of countenance and wearing a sports jacket flannels and polo jersey all of varying shades of grey and all so lived in comfortable and crumpled that he could well have inherited them from his grandfather the professor is the director of die seismological department of the california institute of technology in pasadena hes also a geologist and vulcanologist anything that makes the earth bang or shake or move as his field regarded by everybody in that line as the worlds leading expert he chaired or was chairing until i so rudely interrupted him an international conference in seismology in rome you all know of course what seismology is a rough idea talbot said a kind of science i think study would be a better word for it of the causes and effects of earthquakes a kind of science hawkins said i am distressed it is a science no offence meant im sure and none taken benson said equably the commander is perfectly correct far from being a science were still only dabbling on the periphery of the subject ah well dr wickram is a physicist as well known in his own field as professor benson is in his he specializes in nuclear physics talbot looked at dr wickram who in startling contrast to benson was thin dark and immaculately dressed in a blue suit white buttondown collar and a black tie the funereal hue of which went rather well with the habitual severity of his expression and said does your interest in nuclear physics extend to nuclear weaponry dr wickram well yes it does rather you and the professor are to be congratulated there should be some kind of civilian medal for this viceadmiral hawkins of course is acting in the line of duty i would have thought you two gentlemen should have stayed in rome i mean isnt it safer there hawkins cleared his throat you wouldnt dream of stealing a superior officers thunder would you i wouldnt dream of it sir well to the point your two signals duly received the first gave rise to some concern the second was profoundly disturbing the tick tick tick bit sir the tick tick tick bit both signals were sent to the pentagon the second one also going to the white house i should imagine that the word consternation would suitably describe their reaction guessing of course but i think the speed of the reply to the second message showed how badly shaken they were normally it can take forever well even months at times to extract just a nugget of information from the pentagon but this time minutes only when i read their reply i could understand all too well hawkins paused possibly for suitable dramatic effect so can i talbot said what do you mean if i were the pentagon or the white house id be upset too if a us air force bomber or cargo plane carrying a load of bombs suddenly disappeared into the sea especially if the bombs or missiles that plane was carrying were of the nuclear variety even more especially if they were hydrogen bombs well damn your eyes talbot you do deprive ageing viceadmirals of the simpler pleasures of life there goes my thunder it wasnt all that difficult sir we had already guessed it was a bomber civilian planes with the exception of concorde dont fly at the height at which we picked it up wed have had to be pretty stupid not to assume what we did bombers usually carry bombs american reaction made it inevitable that it was an american plane and you wouldnt have come down here in such a tearing hurry and be accompanied by an expert in nuclear weaponry unless the bombs were of a rather nasty variety i cant imagine anything nastier than hydrogen bombs nor can anyone when you put it the way you put it i suppose i should have guessed that you had guessed even the pentagon dont know or wont divulge what type of plane it was they suggest an advanced design of the c starlifter cargo plane it was refuelled in the azores and heading for greece from your first message we gathered you saw the plane crash into the sea but couldnt identify it why not number one show the admiral why not van gelder produced a sheaf of photographs and handed them to hawkins who flipped through them quickly and then more slowly a second time he sighed and looked up intriguing i suppose if youre a connoisseur of the pattern effects of smoke and flame im not all i can make out is what i take to be the outer port engine and thats no help at all and it gives no indication as to the source or cause of the ore i think van gelder would disagree with you sir talbot said hes of the opinion that the fire originated in the nose cone and was caused by an internal explosion i agree with him it certainly wasnt brought down by shipbased antiaircraft fire we would have known the only alternative is a heatseeking missile two objections to that such a missile would have targeted on the engines not the fuselage and more importantly there are no vessels in the area our radar would have picked them up as a corollary to that the missile didnt come from an aircraft either the admiral will not need reminding that the radar aboard the ariadne is as advanced as any in the world that may no longer be true sir denholms tone was deferential but not hesitant and if it is true then we cant discount missiles just like that this is not a dissenting opinion im just exploring another possibility explore away lieutenant hawkins said any light that can illumine the darkness of our ignorance etcetera etcetera im not sure im all that good as a beacon sir i do know that i dont go along with the belief that the soviets always trail the west in technological advancement whether this belief is carefully and officially nurtured i do not know i admit that the soviets spend a certain amount of time and trouble in extracting military secrets from the west i say certain because they dont have to try all that hard there appears to be a steady supply of scientists both american and british who along with associates not necessarily involved in direct research at all are perfectly willing to sell the soviets anything they want provided that is the price is right i believe this to be true in the case of computers where they do lag behind the west i do not believe it in the case of radar in this field plessey of britain probably leads the west they have developed a revolutionary new radar system the type which is fitted or about to be fitted to invincibleclass aircraftcarriers the type sheffieldclass destroyers and the new type norfolkclass frigates this new radar is designed not only to detect and track aircraft and seaskimming missiles but it also hawkins cleared his throat sorry to interrupt denholm you may know this but surely it comes under the heading of classified information if it did i wouldnt talk about it even in this company sir its in the public domain as i was about to say its also able to control sea dart and seawolf missiles in flight and home them in on their targets with great accuracy i also understand theyre virtually immune to jamming and radar decoys if plessey have done this the soviets may well have also theyre not much given to advertising such things but i believe they have the knowhow hawkins said and you also believe in this case that a missile was the culprit not at all sir im only suggesting a possibility the captain and lieutenantcommander van gelder may well be right trouble is i know nothing about explosives maybe there are missiles with such a limited charge that they cause only limited damage i would have thought that a standard missile would have ensured that a plane it brought down would not have struck the sea with its fuselage relatively intact but in a thousand pieces again i simply dont know i just wonder what the security was like at the base from which that plane took off in the states security in the case of a supersensitive plane such as this total does the admiral really believe there is such a thing as total security the admiral didnt say what he believed he just sipped his scotch in silence there were four major air disasters last year all four planes involved having taken off from airports which were regarded as having maximum security in all four cases terrorists found the most stringent airport checks childishly easy to circumvent those were civilian airports this would be a topsecret us air force base manned exclusively by us air force personnel specially chosen for their position rigidly screened backgrounds exhaustively researched and all subjected to liedetector tests with respect to the viceadmiral and our american friends liedetector tests more accurately polygraph tests are rubbish any moderately intelligent person can be trained to beat the polygraph test which after all depends on crudely primitive measurements of pulse rate blood pressure and perspiration you can be trained to give right answers wrong answers or merely confusing ones and the scrutineer cant tell the difference doesnt measure up to your idea of electronics eh nothing to do with electronics sir polygraphs belong to the horseandbuggy era youve just used the word supersensitive sir the ariadne if i may put it that way is a hotbed of supersensitivity how many members of this crew have ever been subjected to a polygraph test none hawkins considered his glass for a few moments then looked up at talbot should the need arise captain how long would it take you to contact the pentagon immediately well half a minute now no wait have to think about it trouble is even the pentagon is having difficulty in extracting information from this air force base which is i believe somewhere in georgia the pentagons own fault really although you cant expect them to admit this theyve so inculcated this passion for absolute secrecy into the senior officers of all four services that no one is prepared to reveal anything without the permission of the commanding officer of the air force base or ship or whatever in this particular case the commanding officer who to the pentagons distress would appear to have a human side to his nature has elected to take twentyfour hours off no one appears to know where he is van gelder said makes it a bit awkward sir doesnt it if war breaks out in the next halfhour no base remains in full operational readiness but theres still no relaxation of the ironbound rules concerning the release of classified information talbot said you wouldnt be sitting here unless theyd released some information naturally not the news theyve released is vague and incomplete but all very very bad one report says there were twelve nuclear weapons aboard another fifteen whether they were missiles or bombs was not disclosed what was disclosed was that they were hydrogen devices each one in the monster megaton range twelve to fifteen megatons the plane was also understood to be carrying two of the more conventional atom bombs i think ill break a selfimposed regulation and have a scotch myself talbot said a halfminute passed in silence then he said quietly this is worse than i ever dreamed dream grierson said nightmare dream or nightmare it wont matter to us lieutenant denholm said not when were drifting through the stratosphere in vaporized orbit a hydrogen bomb dr wickram talbot said lets call it that is there any way it can spontaneously detonate in itself impossible the president of the united states has to press one button the man on the spot another the radio frequencies are so wildly different that the chances of anyone happening on the right combination are billions to one is there a chance say a billion to one that the soviets might have this combination none you say its impossible to detonate in itself is there any other way some external means whereby it could be detonated i dont know does that mean youre not saying or that youre not sure i dont think dr wickram that this is the time to dwell on such verbal niceties im not sure if there were a sufficiently powerful explosion close by it might go up by sympathetic detonation we simply dont know the possibility has never been explored i mean no experiments i should hope not lieutenant denholm said if such an experiment were successful i wouldnt care to be within thirty or forty miles at the time that is one point for the first time dr wickram essayed a smile but it was a pretty wintry one in the second place quite frankly we have never envisaged a situation where such a possibility might arise we could i suppose have carried out such an experiment without the drastic consequences the lieutenant has suggested we could detonate a very small atom bomb in the vicinity of another even a charge of conventional explosive in the vicinity of a small atom bomb would suffice if the small atom bomb went up so then would the hydrogen bomb everybody knows that its the fissioning of an atom bomb that triggers off the fusion of a hydrogen bomb talbot said is there any timing device specifically a delayed one fitted in a hydrogen bomb none the flat finality in the voice left no room for argument according to viceadmiral hawkins there may be a couple of conventional atom bombs aboard the sunken plane could they be fitted with timing devices again i dont know not my field but i see no reason why they couldnt be for what purpose search me realms of speculation captain where your guess is as good as mine the only thing that occurs to me is a mine a marine mine neatly dispose of any passing aircraft carrier i should think thats thinking small van gelder said a hydrogen mine would neatly dispose of any passing battle fleet whose passing fleet one of ours in wartime as in peacetime the seas are open to all not the black sea not in wartime but a bit farfetched how would this mine be activated my continued ignorance must be a great disappointment i know nothing about mines well time was when mines were either magnetic or acoustic degaussing has made magnetic mines passe so acoustic triggered by a passing ships engines interesting isnt it i mean weve passed over it several times since we first heard the ticking and weve triggered nothing so far so maybe that ticking doesnt mean that the mine is set to go off any time maybe its not activated by which i mean ready to go off when a vessel passes over it until the ticking stops or maybe its just set to go up whenever the ticking stops trouble is weve no idea what started the ticking in the first place i cant see any way it could have been deliberate must have been caused by the explosion that brought down the plane or by the impact of striking the water youre a source of great comfort van gelder hawkins said heavily i admit sir that the alternatives arent all that attractive my own conclusions which in this case are probably completely worthless are that this ticking represents a period of grace i mean that it cannot explode as long as the ticking lasts and that its not designed to explode when the ticking stops but is then activated and ready to explode when triggered by passing engines a guess sir but not necessarily a wild one im going on the assumption that this mine could well be dropped by a surface vessel as well as a plane in that case the ship would want to be a large number of miles away before the mine was activated so it would start the timing mechanism running at the moment it dropped it over the side i am sure sir that the pentagon could provide some illumination on this subject im sure it could hawkins said and your conclusions are far from worthless they make a good deal of sense to me well captain what do you propose to do about all this i rather thought sir that your purpose in coming down here was to tell me what to do not at all i just came to make myself au fait with the situation and to garner some information in return for some i give you does this mean admiral i say this carefully you understand that i have a hand in making the decisions you dont have a hand you damn well make them ill endorse them thank you then my first decision or if you like a suggestion respectfully made is that you and your two friends depart for rome immediately its not going to help anyone and will be a considerable loss to both the scientific and naval communities if you three gentlemen elect for selfimmolation besides by asking me to make the decisions you have implied that theres nothing you can do here that my crew and i cant lieutenantcommander van gelder is at your immediate service the lieutenantcommander will have to wait for me at least your logic is sound but im not feeling very logical at the moment but i do agree as far as my two friends are concerned they could be back at their international conference in rome tomorrow without anyone having noticed their absence we have no right to put the lives of civilians not to mention two such eminent civilians at risk youve just put your finger on it admiral benson puffed comfortably on a sadly blackened pipe eminent or not we are civilians civilians dont take orders from the military i prefer the aegean to rome agreed wickram said ludicrous preposterous you dont seem to have any more clout with your two friends than i have with the three of you talbot produced two slips of paper from his inner pocket i suggest you sign those sir hawkins took them looked thoughtfully at talbot scanned the two sheets then read from one of them request urgent immediate dispatch of nearest salvage or diving vessel to n e due south cape akrotiri thera island to recover one sunken plane one sunken yacht further request immediate dispatch by plane to thera island two deepsea divers with diving equipment for four repeat four priority one double a signed viceadmiral hawkins hawkins looked at benson and wickram this message is directed to rearadmiral blyth hms apollo rearadmiral blyth is the operational commander of european section of nato sea forces in the eastern mediterranean priority one double a means drop everything else this has absolute priority admiral hawkins is i take it my good self why captain the request for four diving suits van gelder and i are trained divers sir exsubmariners i see second signal directed to defence minister athens urgent contact air control athens airport for information re aircraft thought american that crashed today south of thera island did it ask permission for flight path to and landing in athens or other greek airfield further request you enlist immediate aid of police and intelligence re anything known about one spyros andropulos owner of yacht delos this message is also im flattered to observe signed by me well well well captain i nearly did you a great injustice a minute or two ago i thought you had not perhaps addressed yourself to the problem on hand but you have and in some style and quite some time before i arrived two questions the aircraft and andropulos hawkins nodded at feet the pilot didnt have to bother to notify anyone about his presence he knew he was alone in the sky but once he started descending it was a different matter entirely he wouldnt be too keen on bumping into anyone especially not with the cargo he had on board and of course he would require permission to land but why greece because the flight path he was following when we first located him would have taken him to ankara in turkey or some place pretty close by now even although turkey is nominally at least a member of nato im sure the americans have no air bases at or near ankara i dont even know if they have any air bases at all in turkey im certain they have no missile launching bases in greece the americans have both so greece as for andropulos several of my officers and i think hes a leery customer and a suspicious one not one thing that could be proved in a court of law of course we suspect that he may know something about the downing of this plane that we dont know he knows if you follow me he says the delos was sunk as the result of an explosion but its the old question of did he fall or was he pushed in other words was the explosion accidental or deliberate if we could hoist the delos to the surface we might well find out we might well indeed still first things first hawkins looked briefly at the signals again seem to fit the task admirably ill gladly sign hawkins produced a pen signed and handed the papers to talbot as you had all this figured out quite some time i suspect before i left rome why didnt you send those signals yourself lowly commanders dont give the instructions to rearadmiral blyth i havent the authority you have thats why i asked you to join us as soon as was possible thanks for the signing sir that was the easy part now comes the difficult part difficult part hawkins said warily what difficult part have we the moral right to ask the crew of the salvage vessel or lifting vessel not to mention the divers to join us in lieutenant denholms elegant phrase in drifting through the stratosphere in vaporized orbit ah yes a point of course what do you think again not a decision for lowly commanders admirals only dear oh dear then if things go wrong youll have nothing on your conscience and everything in the world to reproach me with if anything goes wrong sir i dont think well be having too much to say to each other when were in vaporized orbit true mine was an unworthy remark no one likes to bear the responsibility for such decisions send the signals very good sir lieutenant denholm ask myers to come here hawkins said i understand im not making comparisons that the president of the united states was faced with a problem similar to the one youve just confronted me with he asked the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff if he should pull out the ariadne which they knew of course was sitting over the crashed plane the chairman said quite rightly that that wasnt his responsibility the old and honoured american tradition of passing the buck the president decided that the ariadne should stay well i could come all over bitter and say thats very noble and gallant of the president especially as theres no chance of his being blown out of his seat in the oval office when this little lot goes up but i wont its not a decision i would care to have to make i assume he gave a reason for his decision yes the greatest good of the greatest number myers came in talbot handed him the two messages get these off at once code b in both cases to both messages add immediate repeat immediate confirmation is requested myers left and talbot said it is my understanding admiral that in your capacity as officer commanding the naval forces in the eastern mediterranean you have the power to overrule the presidents instructions yes have you done so no you will ask why same reason as the president the greatest good of the greatest good of the greatest number why the questioning captain you wouldnt leave here even if i gave a direct order im just a bit puzzled about the reason giventhe greatest good of the greatest good of the greatest number bringing a rescue vessel which admittedly is my idea will only increase the greatest danger to a greater number i dont think you appreciate just how great the greatest number is in this case i think professor benson here can enlighten you enlighten all of us for im rather vague about it thats why professor benson is here the good professor is not at his best benson said hes hungry most remiss of us talbot said of course you havent eaten dinner say in twenty minutes id settle for a sandwich talbot looked at hawkins and wickram both of whom nodded he pressed a bell im a bit vague about it myself benson said certain facts are beyond dispute what were sitting on top of at this moment is one of them according to which estimate of the pentagons you choose to believe theres something like a total of between and megatons of high explosive lying down there not that the difference between the lowest and highest estimate is of any significance the explosion of a pound of high explosive in this wardroom would kill us all what we are talking about is the explosive power of let me see yes four and a half billion pounds the human mind cannot comprehend differences in estimates become irrelevant all we can say with certainty is that it would be the biggest manmade explosion in history which doesnt sound so bad when you say it quickly as im saying it now the results of such an explosion are quite unknown but stupefyingly horrendous however optimistic your guess might be if optimistic is the word im looking for which it isnt it might fracture the earths crust with cataclysmic results it might destroy part of the ozone layer which would permit the suns ultraviolet radiation either to tan us or fry us depending upon how large a hole had been blasted in the stratosphere it might equally well cause the onset of a nuclear winter which is so popular a topic among both scientists and laymen these days and lastly but by no means least are the tsunami effects vast tidal waves usually generated by undersea earthquakes those tsunami have been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people at a time when they struck lowlying coastal areas benson reached out a grateful hand for a glass that jenkins had brought talbot said if youre trying to be encouraging professor youre not doing too well at it ah better much better benson lowered his glass and sighed i needed that there are times when im quite capable of terrifying even myself encouraging thats only the half of it santorinis the other half in fact santorini is the major part of it gifted though mankind is in creating sheer wanton destruction nature has him whacked every time santorini wickram said who or what is santorini ignorance george ignorance you and your fellow physicists should look out from your ivory towers from time to time santorini is less than a couple of miles from where youre sitting had that name for many centuries today its officially known as it was five thousand years ago at the height of its civilization as thera island the island by whatever name has had a very turbulent seismic and volcanic history dont worry george im not about to sally forth on my old hobbyhorse not for long anyway just long enough to try to explain what the greatest number means in the term the greatest good of the greatest number it is commonly enough imagined that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are two faces of the same coin this is not necessarily so the venerable oxford english dictionary states that an earthquake is specifically a convulsion of the earths surface caused by volcanic forces the dictionary is specifically wrong it should have used the word rarely instead earthquakes especially the big ones are caused when two tectonic plates segments of the earths crust that float freely on the molten magma beneath come into contact with one another and one plate bangs into another or rubs alongside it or dives under it the only two recorded and monitored giant earthquakes in history were of this type in ecuador in and japan in similarly but on a lesser scale although still very big the californian earthquakes of san francisco and owens valley were due to crustal movement and not to volcanoes it is true that practically all the worlds active volcanoes someone may have bothered to count them i havent are located along convergent plate boundaries it is equally true that they are rarely associated with earthquakes there have been three large volcanic eruptions along such boundaries in very recent years mt st helens in the state of washington el chichon in mexico and one just northwest of bogota in columbia the last one it happened only last year was particularly nasty a foot volcano called nevada del ruiz which seems to have been slumbering off and on for the past four hundred years erupted and melted the snow and ice which covered most of its upper reaches giving rise to an estimated seventyfive million cubic yards mudslide the town of armero stood in its way people died there the point is that none of those was accompanied by an earthquake even volcanoes in areas where there are no established tectonic frontiers are guiltless in this respect vesuvius despite the fact that it buried pompeii and herculaneum stromboli mt etna and the twin volcanoes of the island of hawaii have not produced and do not produce earthquakes but the really bad apples in the seismic barrel and a very sinister lot those are too are the socalled thermal hotspots plumes or upswellings of molten lava that reach up to or through the earths crust giving rise to volcanoes or earthquakes or both we talk a lot about those thermal plumes but we really dont know much about them we dont know whether theyre localized or whether they spread out and lubricate the movements of the tectonic plates what we do know is that they can have extremely unpleasant effects one of those was responsible for the biggest earthquake of this century you have me confused professor hawkins said youve just mentioned the really big ones the ones in japan and ecuador ah but those were monitored and recorded this one wasnt certainly it was but countries like russia and china are rather coy about releasing such details they have the weird notion that natural disasters reflect upon their political systems is it in order to ask how you know of course governments may elect not to talk to governments but we scientists are an incurably gabby lot this quake happened in tangshan province in northeast china and is the only one ever known to have occurred in a really densely populated area in this case involving the major cities of peking and tientsin the primary cause was undoubtedly a thermal plume there are no known tectonic plate boundaries in the area but a very ancient boundary may be lurking in the area the date was july yesterday hawkins said just yesterday casualties twothirds of a million dead threequarters of a million injured give or take a hundred thousand in each case if that sounds flippant or heartless its not meant to be after a certain arbitrary figure a hundred thousand ten thousand even a thousand it all depends upon how much your heart and mind can take any increase in numbers becomes meaningless and theres also the factor of course that were referring to faceless unknowns in a faroff land i suppose hawkins said that that would be what one might call the granddaddy of them all in terms of lives lost it probably is we cant be sure what we can be sure of is that tangshan rates as no more than third in the cataclysmic league just over a century ago the island of krakatoa in indonesia blew itself out of existence that was quite a bang literally the sound of the explosion was heard thousands of miles away so much volcanic material was blasted into the stratosphere that the world was still being treated to a series of spectacular sunsets more than three years afterwards no one knows the height of the tsunami caused by this eruption what we do know is that much of the three great islands bordering the java sea sumatra java and borneo and nearly all of the smaller islands inside the sea itself lie below an altitude of feet no tally of the dead has ever been made it is better perhaps that we dont know and perhaps its also better that we dont know what youre going to say next talbot said i dont much care for the road youre leading us along i dont much care for it myself benson sighed and sipped some more gin anyone ever heard of the word kalliste certainly denholm said means most beautiful very ancient goes back to homeric times my goodness benson peered at him through his pipe smoke i thought you were the electronics officer lieutenant denholm is primarily a classicist talbot said electronics is one of his hobbies ah benson gestured with his thumb kalliste was the name given to this little lady before it became either thera or santorini and a more singularly inapt name i cannot imagine it was this beautiful lady that blew her top in bc with four times the explosively destructive power of krakatoa what had been the cone of a volcano became a circular depression we call it a caldera some thirty square miles in area into which the sea poured stirring times gentlemen stirring times unfortunately those stirring times are still with us santorini has had and continues to have a very turbulent seismic history incidentally mythology has it that there was an even bigger eruption about bc however it hasnt done too badly since bc in bc another eruption separated therasia from northwest thera forty years later the islet of old jaimeni appeared there have been bangs and explosions the appearances and disappearances of islands and volcanoes ever since in the late sixteenth century the south coast of thera together with the port of eleusis vanished under the sea and stayed there even as late as a considerable earthquake destroyed half the buildings on the west coast of the island santorini one fears rests on very shaky foundations talbot said what happened in bc regrettably our ancestors of some thirtyfive centuries back dont seem to have given too much thought to posterity by which i mean they left no records to satisfy their descendants intellectual curiosity one can hardly blame them they had too many urgent and pressing matters on hand at the time to worry about such things according to one account the explosion caused a tidal wave feet high i dont know who worked this out i dont believe it it is true that water levels on the alaskan coast caused by tsunami earthquakerelated tidal waves have risen over three hundred feet but this only happens when the seabed shallows close inshore in the deep sea although the tsunami can travel tremendously fast two perhaps three hundred miles an hour its rarely more than a ripple on the surface of the water the experts an expert may be loosely defined as any person who claims he knows what hes talking about are deeply divided as to what happened loggerheads would be too mild a term its an archaeological minefield the explosion may have destroyed the cyclades it may have wiped out the minoan civilization in crete it may have swamped the aegean isles and the coastal lowlands of greece and turkey it may have inundated lower egypt flooded the nile and swept back the red sea waters to permit the escape of the israelites fleeing from the pharaoh thats one view in scientist by the name of immanuel velikovsky caused a considerable furore in the historical religious and astronomical worlds by stating unequivocally that the flooding was caused by venus which had been wrenched free from jupiter and made an uncomfortably close encounter with earth a very scholarly and erudite work widely acclaimed at the time but since much maligned professional jealousy upsetting the scientific applecart a charlatan unlikely man was a friend and colleague of albert einstein then of course there was edmund halley he of comet fame he was equally certain that the flooding had been caused by a passing comet theres no doubt there was a huge natural disaster all those millennia ago as to its cause take your pick your guess is as good as mine reverting to the situation we find j ourselves in at this moment there are four facts that can be regarded as certainties or nearcertainties santorini is about i as stable as the proverbial blancmange its sitting on top of i a thermal plume thirdly the chances are high that it is sitting atop an ancient tectonic boundary that runs eastwest under the mediterranean this is where the african and eurasian plates are in contention lastly and indisputably we are sitting atop the equivalent of roughly million tons of tnt if that goes up i would say it is highly probable in fact think i should use the word inevitable that both the thermal plume and the temporarily quiescent earthquake zone along the tectonic fault would be reactivated i leave the rest deeply divided as to what happened loggerheads would be too mild a term its an archaeological minefield the explosion may have destroyed the cyclades it may have wiped out the minoan civilization in crete it may have swamped the aegean isles and the coastal lowlands of greece and turkey it may have inundated lower egypt

sitting atop the equivalent of roughly million tons of tnt if that goes up i would say it is highly probable in fact think i should use the word inevitable that both the thermal plume and the temporarily quiescent earthquake zone along the tectonic fault would be reactivated i leave the rest to your imagination benson drained his glass and looked around hopefully talbot pressed a bell hawkins said i dont have that kind of imagination none of us has fortunately were talking about the combined and simultaneous effect of a massive thermonuclear detonation a volcanic eruption and an earthquake this lies outwith the experience of mankind so we cant visualize those things except to guess and its a safe guess that the reality will be worse than any nightmare the only consolation of course is that we wouldnt be around to experience anything nightmare or reality the extent of potential annihilation beggars belief by annihilation i mean the total extinction of life except possibly some subterranean or aquatic forms what lava volcanic cinders dust and ashes dont get the blast air percussion waves fire and tsunami will if there are any survivors and this could be in an area of thousands of square miles the massive radioactive fallout will attend to them it hardly seems necessary to talk about such things as nuclear winters and being fried by ultraviolet radiation so you can see commander talbot what we mean when we talk about the greatest good of the greatest number what does it matter if we have two ships or ten out here two hundred men or two thousand every extra man every extra ship may just may be of a tiny percentage more help in neutralizing this damn thing on the seafloor whats even two thousand compared to the unimaginable numbers who might perish if that device does detonate sooner or later almost certainly sooner if we dont do something about it you put things very nicely professor and you make things very clear not that the ariadne had any intention of going anywhere but its nice to have a solid reason to stay put talbot thought briefly solves one little problem anyway i have six survivors from the yacht delos aboard and had thought to put three of the innocent parties among them ashore but that seems a little pointless now alas yes whether they are aboard here or on santorini it will be all one to them when they join us in what lieutenant denholm is pleased to call vaporized orbit talbot lifted a phone asked for a number listened briefly and hung up the sonar room still tick tick tick ah benson said tick tick tick chapter you had an enjoyable teteatete with mr andropulos sir viceadmiral hawkins together with his two scientist friends had just come to the bridge in response to talbots invitation that they join him enjoyable ha thank you incidentally for rescuing us enjoyable depends what you mean john i mean were you suitably impressed i was suitably unimpressed interested mind you but deeply unimpressed mans character i mean not his quite extraordinary affinity for strong spirits he comes across as whiter than the driven snow a man of such transparent honesty has to have something to hide and he got his slurring wrong too benson said slurring sir just that commander thickened his voice in the wrong places to try and convince us that he was under the influence maybe he could have got away with it in his native greek but not in english cold sober i believe and clever anyway hes clever enough to hoodwink those two charming young ladies he has with him i think theyre being hoodwinked and his bosom friend alexander hawkins said hes not so clever he comes over as what he might well be a paidup member if not a capo in the mafia he was quite unmoved when i sympathized with them about the loss of the three members of their crew andropulos said he was desolated by the deaths of his treasured friends van gelder had already told us that maybe he was overcome by grief maybe not in view of the fact that like you i regard him as a fluent liar and consummate actor i think not maybe he is consciencestricken at having arranged their deaths again i think not by that i dont mean he couldnt have been responsible for their deaths i just mean that i dont think hes on speaking terms with his conscience only information i gathered from him is that he abandoned his yacht because he thought his spare fuel tank was going to blow up a man of mystery your newfound friend hes all that very mysterious hes a multimillionaire maybe a multimultimillionaire not in the usual greek line of tankers bottoms fallen out of that market anyway hes an international businessman with contacts in many countries hawkins said van gelder told me nothing of this of course he didnt he didnt know your name attached to a message admiral is a guarantee of remarkably quick service reply received to our query to the greek defence ministry received twentyfive minutes ago a businessman what kind of business they didnt say i knew that would be your question so i immediately radioed a request for that information signed by me of course naturally sir had it been a different matter i would of course have asked your permission but this was the same matter the reply came in a few minutes ago listing ten different countries with which he does business again what kind of business again they didnt say extraordinarily odd what do you make of it the foreign minister must have authorized this reply maybe censored it a little he is of course a member of the government i would assume that the mysterious mr andropulos has friends in the government the mysterious mr andropulos gets more mysterious by the moment maybe sir maybe not not when you consider the list of ten foreign trading partners he has four of them are in cities of what you might regard as being of particular interest tripoli beirut damascus and baghdad indeed hawkins thought briefly gunrunning but of course sir nothing illegal about being gunrunners britain and america are hotching with them but all governments are holierthanthou in this respect and never publicly associate themselves with them never do to be classified as a merchant of death could well explain why the greek government is being so cagey indeed it could one thing strikes me as odd why is tehran missing from the list true true the iranians with the possible exception of the afghans are more desperate for arms than any other place around but gunrunners dont specialize in blowing up planes in flight i dont know what were talking about sir the hampton court maze has nothing on this lot i have the feeling that its going to take us quite some time to figure this out fortunately we have more immediate problems to occupy our minds fortunately hawkins lifted his eyes heavenwards did you say fortunately yes sir vincent this to van gelder i should think jenkins knows the requirements of the viceadmiral and his two friends by this time you are not joining us benson said better not we expect to be quite busy later on tonight he turned to van gelderagain and give orders for our six shipwrecked mariners to return to their cabins they are to remain there until further orders post guards to see that those instructions are obeyed i think id better go and do this myself sir fine im all out of tact at the moment hawkins said do you think theyll take kindly to this ah incarceration incarceration lets call it protective custody fact is i dont want them to see whats going on in the next few hours ill explain why in a moment the ministry of defence had another item of information for us about the bomber it had been in touch with air control in athens and had been instructed to alter course over the island of amorgos thats about forty miles northeast of here and proceed on a roughly northnorthwest course two fighter planes us air force fs went up to meet it and escort it in did you see any such planes in the vicinity no sir wouldnt have expected to rendezvous point was to be over the island of euboea the destination was not athens but thessalonika i assume the americans have a missile base in that area i wouldnt know admiral blyth on the apollo has also come through weve had luck here two pieces of luck a recovery ship en route to piraeus has been diverted to santorini diving crews recovery gear the lot youll know it sir the kilcharran i know it auxiliary fleet vessel nominally under my command i say nominally because i also have the misfortune to know its captain lad called montgomery a very crusty irishman with a low opinion of royal navy regulations not that that matters hes brilliant at his job couldnt ask to have a better man around your other item of good news theres a plane en route to santorini at this moment with a couple of divers and diving equipment for four aboard very experienced men im told a chief petty officer and a petty officer ive sent sublieutenant cousteau ashore to pick them up they should be here in half an hour or so excellent excellent and when do you expect the kilcharran about five in the morning sir by jove things are looking up you have something in mind i have with your permission sir oh do shut up yes sir it will also answer your two questions why gelder and i are on the wagon and why the six survivors have been well locked up out of harms way when cousteau comes back with the divers and equipment van gelder and i are going down with them to have a look at this plane im pretty sure we wont be able to accomplish much but well be able to assess the extent of the damage to the plane with luck locate this ticking monster and with even great luck try to free it i know in advance that were not going to have that kind of luck but its worth a try youd be the first to agree sir that in the circumstances anything is worth a try yes yes but well youll excuse me if i frown a bit you and van gelder are the two most important people on this ship no were not if anything should happen to us personally and i dont see what can happen you are in your spare time so to speak accustomed to commanding a battle fleet i can hardly see that a mere frigate is going to inconvenience you to all that extent and if anything should happen on a catastrophic scale nobodys going to be worrying too much about anything wickram said you are a coldblooded soandso commander hawkins sighed not cold blood dr wickram cold logic im afraid and when and if you come back up what then then were off to have a look at the delos should be very interesting andropulos may have made a mistake admiral in telling you that he was scared that his spare fuel tank might blow up but then he could have had no idea that we were going to have a look at the delos thats why hes locked up i dont want him to know weve got divers aboard and i especially dont want him to see me taking off with divers in the general direction of the delos if we find that there was no spare tank we shall have to keep an even closer eye on him and for good measure on his dear friend alexander and his captain aristotle i cant believe that that young seaman achmed or whatever his name is or either of the two girls can have anything to do with this i think theyre along for the purpose of camouflage respectability if you will in any event we should be back long before the kilcharran arrives he turned to look at denholm who had just arrived on the bridge well jimmy what drags you away from the fleshpots if i may say so with some dignity sir im trying to set them an example ive just had a thought sir if you will excuse me admiral i think that any thought you might have could be well worth listening to young man not greek literature this time ill be bound this ah hobby of yours electronics is it not well yes it is sir denholm seemed faintly surprised he looked at talbot that atom bomb down there the one that goes tick tick tick the intention is or the hope anyway to detach it from the other explosives if it can be done and then sir one thing at a time jimmy thats as far as my thinking has got so far would we try to deactivate it denholm looked at wickram do you think it could be deactivated sir i honestly dont know lieutenant i have powerful suspicions but i just dont know i should have imagined that this lay more in your field than mine electronics i mean i know how to build those damned weapons but i know nothing about those fancy triggering devices neither do i not without knowing how they work for that id have to see the blueprint a diagrammatic layout you said you had powerful suspicions what suspicions sir i suspect that it cant be deactivated in fact im certain the process is irreversible the second suspicion is also a certainty im damn sure that im not going to be the one to try that makes two of us so what other options are open to us benson said may a total ignoramus venture an opinion why dont we take it to some safe place a hundred miles away and dump it at the bottom of the deep blue sea a tempting thought professor denholm said but not a very practicable one it is of course a hundred per cent certain that this triggering device is batterypowered the latest generation of nife cells can lie dormant for months even years and still spring smartly to attention when called on to do their duty you cant declare a whole area of the mediterranean offlimits to all shipping for years to come i prefaced my suggestion by saying that i was an ignoramus well in for a penny in for a pound another doubtlessly ludicrous suggestion we take it to the selfsame spot and detonate it denholm shook his head im afraid that still leaves us with a couple of problems the first is how are we going to get it there we take it there yes we take it there or we set out to take it there then somewhere en route the ticking stops then the triggering device cocks its ear and says aha whats this i hear ships engines and detonates there wouldnt even be a seconds warning hadnt thought of that we could i say this hopefully tow it there our little friend is still listening and we dont know and have no means of knowing how sensitive its hearing is engines of course would set it off so would a generator a derrick winch even a coffeegrinder in the galley might provide all the impulse it requires talbot said you came all the way up to the bridge jimmy just to spread sweetness and light your own special brand of jobs comfort not quite sir its just that a couple of ideas occurred to me one of which will have occurred to you and one which you probably dont know about getting the bomb to its destination would be easy enough we use a sailing craft lots of them hereabouts aegean luggers talbot looked at hawkins one cant think of everything i forgot to mention sir that in addition to being a student of ancient greek language and literature lieutenant denholm is also a connoisseur of the small craft of the aegean used to spend all his summers here well until we nabbed him that is i wouldnt begin to know how to sail those luggers or caiques in fact i couldnt even sail a dinghy if you paid me but ive studied them yes most of them come from the island of samos or bodrum in turkey before the war the first world war that is they were all sailing craft nowadays theyre nearly all engined most of them with steadying sails but theres quite a few both with engines and a full set of sails those are the trehandiri and perama types and i know there are some in the cyclades one of those would be ideal for our purposes because they have shallow keels a minimum draught and no ballast they are almost useless performers to windward but that wouldnt matter in this case the prevailing wind here is northwest and the open sea lies to the southeast useful information to have talbot said very useful indeed um you wouldnt happen to know anyone with such a craft as a matter of fact i do good god youre as useful as your information talbot broke off as van gelder entered the bridge duty done number one yes sir andropulos was a bit reluctant to go so were alexander and aristotle in fact they pointblank refused to go infringement of their liberties as greek civilians or some tosh to that effect demanded to know on whose orders i said yours demanded to see you i said in the morning more outrage i didnt argue with them just called up mckenzie and some of his merry men who removed them forcibly i told mckenzie not to post any guards just lock the doors and pocket the keys youre going to hear from the greek government about this sir excellent wish id been there and the girls sweet reason no problem fine now jimmy you said a couple of ideas had occurred to you what was the second one its about the second problem that the professor raised the detonation we could of course try sympathetic detonation by dropping a depth charge on it but as we would be in the immediate vicinity at the time i dont think that would be a very good idea neither do i so the pentagon could have the answer despite feeble denials to the contrary everyone knows that the pentagon controls nasa the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in turn is supposed to administer the kennedy space center supposed is the operative word they dont the centre is operated by eg g a major defence contractor eg g dr wickram will know much more about this than i do oversees such things as nuclearweapons tests and the socalled star wars more importantly they are developing or have developed what they call the krytron a remotecontrolled electronic impulse trigger that can detonate nuclear weapons a word from the admiral in the ear of the pentagon might work wonders hawkins cleared his throat this little titbit of information lieutenant it will of course like your other titbits be in the public domain it is sir you astonish me most interesting most could be a big part of the answer to our problem dont you agree commander talbot nodded i think we should act immediately on this one ah the very man himself myers had just entered carrying a piece of paper which he handed to talbot reply to your latest query to the pentagon sir thank you no dont go well have another message to send them in a minute talbot handed the paper to hawkins security at bomber base hawkins read believed to be effective but cards on the table however unlikely there may be one chance in ten thousand that security has been penetrated this could have been that one chance well isnt that nice absolutely useless piece of information of course plane carried fifteen hbombs of fifteen megatons each and three atom bombs all three equipped with timing devices well thats just fine so now we have three of those ticking monsters to contend with with any luck just one talbot said sonar picks up only one extremely unlikely that all three would be ticking in perfect unison points academic anyway one or a hundred the big boys would still go up identified by size they say hawkins went on sixty inches by six pretty small for an atom bomb i would have thought kilotons thats a lot dr wickram by todays standards peanuts less than half the size of the hiroshima bomb if the bomb is the dimensions they say then its very large for such a small explosive value it goes on to say that theyre designated for marine use i suppose thats a fancy way of saying that they are mines so your guess was right dr wickram also explains the size of the bomb quite a bit of space will be taken up by the timing mechanism and of course it will have to be weighted to give it negative buoyancy the real sting comes in the tail hawkins said when the ticking stops the timing clock has run out and the firing mechanism is activated and ready to be triggered by mechanical stimulation by which i take it they mean ships engines so it looks as if you were right about that one van gelder then by way of cheerful farewell they say that enquiries so far confirm that the timing mechanism once in operation cannot be neutralized and appears to be irreversible the last words were met with silence no one had any comment to make for the excellent reason that everyone had already been convinced of the fact a message to the pentagon myers urgently require to know state of development of the eg g krytron thats krytron isnt it lieutenant nuclear detonation device talbot paused add if operating model exists essential dispatch immediately with instructions that do admiral hawkins nodded sign it admiral hawkins we must be giving them quite some headaches in the pentagon hawkins said in some satisfaction this should call for still more aspirin aspirins are not enough van gelder said sleepless nights are what are called for you have something in mind van gelder yes sir they can have no idea of the really horrendous potential of the situation here in santorini the combination of all those megatons of hydrogen bombs thermal plumes and volcanoes and earthquakes along the tectonic plate boundaries and the possibly cataclysmic results if professor benson here were to make a very brief prйcis of the lecture he gave us in the wardroom this evening it might give them something more to think about you have an evil mind van gelder what a perfectly splendid suggestion uneasy will lie the heads along the potomac this night what do you think professor it will be a pleasure when sublieutenant cousteau together with the two divers and their equipment returned from santoriai they found the ariadne in virtual darkness with the thought of the malevolent listening bug on the seafloor dominating every other in his mind talbot had sought lieutenant denholms advice on the question of noise suppression denholm had not been halfhearted in his recommendations with the result that the use of all mechanical devices on the ship from generators to electric shavers had been banned only essential lighting radar sonar and radio were functioning normally all these could function equally well as they had been designed to do on battery power the sonar watch on the ticking device in the crashed bomber was now continuous the two divers chief petty officer carrington and petty officer grant were curiously alike both aged about thirty of medium height and compact build both were much given to smiling a cheerfulness that in no way detracted from their almost daunting aura of competence they were with talbot and van gelder in the wardroom thats all i know about the situation down there talbot said and heaven knows its little enough i just want to know those three things the extent of the damage the location of this ticking noise and to see if its possible to remove this atom bomb or whatever which im convinced in advance is impossible you are aware of the dangers and you are aware that i cannot order you to do this how does the prospect appeal chief it doesnt appeal at all sir carrington was imperturbable neither bill grant nor i is cast in the heroic mould well walk very softly down there you shouldnt be worrying about us you should be worrying about what your crew is thinking if we slip up theyll all join us in the wide blue yonder or whatever i know you want to come down sir but is it really necessary were pretty experienced in moving around inside wrecks without banging into things and were both torpedo gunner mates and explosives you might say are our business not i admit the kind of explosives you have down there but we know enough not to trigger a bomb by accident and we might talbot smiled youre very tactful chief what you mean is that we might bang into things or kick a detonator on the nose or something of the kind when you say necessary do you mean wise i refer to our diving experience or lack of it we know about your diving experience sir you will understand that when we knew what we were coming into we made some discreet enquiries we know that you have commanded a submarine and the lieutenantcommander was your first lieutenant we know youve both been through the hms dolphin submarine escape tower and that youve done more than a fair bit of free diving no we dont think youll be getting in our way or banging things around carrington turned up palms in acceptance whats your battery capacity sir for essential and nonmechanical purposes ample several days well put down three weighted floodlights and suspend them about twenty feet above the bottom that should illuminate the plane nicely well have a powerful handflash each we have a small bag of tools for cutting sawing and snipping we also have an oxyacetylene torch which is rather more difficult to use under water than most people imagine but as this is just a reconnaissance trip we wont be taking it along the closedcircuit breathing is of the type we prefer fiftyfifty oxygen and nitrogen with a carbon dioxide scrubber at the depth of a hundred feet which is what we will be at we could easily remain underwater for an hour without any risk of either oxygen poisoning or decompression illness thats academic of course provided theres access to the plane and the fuselage is not crushed a few minutes should tell us all we want to know two points about the helmet theres a rotary chin switch which you depress to activate an amplifier that lets us talk visor to visor a second press cuts it off it also has a couple of sockets over the ears where you can plug in what is to all effects a stethoscope thats all all we can go now a last check sir carrington didnt have to specify what check talbot lifted a phone spoke briefly and replaced it our friend is still at work the water was warm and still and so very clear that they could see the lights of the suspended arclamps even before they dipped below the surface of the darkened aegean with carrington in the lead and using the marker buoy anchor rope as a guide they slid down fifty feet and stopped the three arclamps had come to rest athwart the sunken bomber sharply illuminating the fuselage and the two wings the left wing though still attached to the fuselage had been almost completely sheared off between the inner engine and the fuselage and was angled back about thirty degrees from normal the tail unit had been almost completely destroyed the fuselage or that part of it that could be seen from above appeared to be relatively intact the nose cone of the plane was shrouded in shadow they continued their descent until their feet touched the top of the fuselage halfwalked halfswam until they reached the front of the plane switched on their flashlights and looked through the completely shattered windows of the cockpit the pilot and the copilot were still trapped in their seats they were no longer men just the vestigial remains of what had once been human beings death must have been instantaneous carrington looked at talbot and shook his head then dropped down to the seabed in front of the nose cone the hole that had been blasted there was roughly circular with buckled and jagged edges projecting outwards conclusive proof that the blast had been internal the diameter of the whole was approximately five feet moving slowly and cautiously so as not to rip any of the rubber components of their diving suits they passed in file into a compartment not more than four feet in height but almost twenty feet in length extending from the nose cone under the flight deck and then several feet beyond both sides of the compartment were lined with machinery and metal boxes so crushed and mangled that their original function was incomprehensible twothirds of the way along the compartment a hatch had been blasted upwards the opening led to a space directly behind the seats of the two pilots aft of this was what was left of a small radioroom with a man who appeared to be peacefully sleeping leaning forward on folded arms the fingers of one hand still on a transmitting key beyond this four short steps led down to an oval door let into a solid steel bulkhead the door was secured by eight clamps some of which had been jammed into position by the impact of the blast a hammer carried by carrington in his canvas bag of tools soon tapped them into a loosened position beyond the door lay the cargo compartment bare bleak functional and obviously designed for one purpose only the transport of missiles these were secured by heavy steel clamps which were in turn bolted to longitudinal reinforced steel beams let into the floor and sides of the fuselage there was oil mixed with the water in the compartment but even in the weird swirling yellowish light they looked neither particularly menacing nor sinister slender graceful with either end encased in a rectangular metal box they looked perfectly innocuous each contained fifteen megatons of high explosive there were six of those in the first section of the compartment as a formality and not because of any expectations talbot and carrington applied their stethoscopes to each cylinder in turn the results were negative as they had known they would be dr wickram had been positive that they contained no timing devices there were also six missiles in the central compartment three of these were of the same size as those in the front compartment the other three were no more than five feet in length those had to be the atom bombs it was when he was testing the third of those with his stethoscope that carrington beckoned to talbot who came and listened in turn he didnt have to listen long the two and a half second ticking sequence sounded exactly as it had done in the sonar room in the aft compartment they went through the routine exercise of listening to the remaining six missiles and found what they had expected nothing carrington put his visor close to talbots enough enough that didnt take you long hawkins said long enough to find out what we needed missiles are there all present and correct as listed by the pentagon only one bomb has been activated three dead men thats all except for the most important fact of all the bomber crashed because of an internal explosion some kindly soul had concealed a bomb under the flight deck the pentagon must be glad thatthey added the faint possibility that there was one chance in ten thousand that security might be breached the faint possibility came true raises some fascinating questions doesnt it sir who what why when we dont have to ask where because we already know that i dont want to sound grim or vindictive hawkins said because im not well maybe a little should cut the gentlemen on foggy bottom or wherever down to size and make them a mite more civil and cooperative in future not only is it an american plane that is responsible for the dreadful situation in which we find ourselves but it was someone in america who was ultimately responsible if they ever do discover who was responsible and its not without the bounds of possibility its going to cause an awful lot of red faces and im not just referring to the villain himself id lay odds that the person responsible is an insider a pretty highup insider with free access to secret information such as closely guarded secrets as to the composition of the cargo the destination and the time of takeoff and arrival wouldnt you agree commander i dont see how it can be otherwise not a problem id care to have on my hands however thats their problem we have an even bigger problem on our hands true true hawkins sighed whats the next step then in recovering this damn bomb i mean i think you should ask chief petty officer carrington sir not me he and petty officer grant are the experts its a tricky one sir carrington said cutting away a fuselage section large enough to lift the bomb through is straight forward enough but before we could lift the bomb out we would have to free it from its clamps and this is where the great difficulty lies those clamps are made of hightensile steel fitted with a locking device for that we need a key and we dont know where the key is it could be hawkins said that the key is held at the missile base where the bombs were due to be delivered with respect sir i think that unlikely those clamps had to be locked at the air force base where they were loaded so they would have to have a key there i think it would be much easier and more logical if they just took the key with them trouble is a key is a very small thing and thats a very big bomber indeed if theres no key there are two ways we can remove that clamp one is chemical using either a metal softener or corrosive the metal softener is used by stage magicians who go in for spoonbending and suchlike magicians hawkins said charlatans you mean whatever the principle is the same they use a colourless paste which has no effect on the skin but has the peculiar property of altering the molecular structure of a metal and making it malleable a corrosive is simply a powerful acid that eats through steel lots of them on the market but in this case both softeners and corrosives have one impossible drawback you cant use them underwater hawkins said you mentioned two ways of removing the clamp whats the other oxyacetylene torch sir make short work of any clamp it would also i imagine make even shorter work of the operator those torches generate tremendous heat and i should also imagine that anyone who even contemplates using an oxyacetylene torch on an atom bomb is an obvious candidate for the loonybin hawkins looked at wickram comment no comment not on the unthinkable i speak in no spirit of complaint carrington hawkins said but youre not very encouraging what you are about to suggest of course is that we wait for the kilcharran to come along and hoist the damn thing to the surface yes sir carrington hesitated but theres a snag even to that a snag talbot said you are referring of course to the distinct and unpleasant possibility that the ticking might stop while the kilcharrans winch engine is working overtime at hauling the bomber to the surface i mean just that sir a trifle there are no trifles that the combined brainpower aboard the ariadne cant solve he turned to denholm you can fix that lieutenant yes sir how sir there was a pardonable note of doubt if not outright disbelief in carringtons voice lieutenant denholm didnt look like the type of person who could fix anything talbot smiled if i may say this gently chief one does not question lieutenant denholm on those matters he knows more about electrics and electronics than any man in the mediterranean its quite simple chief denholm said we just couple up the combined battery powers of the ariadne and the kilcharran the kilcharrans winches are probably dieselpowered we may or may not be able to convert them to electrical use if we cant it doesnt matter we have excellent electric anchor windlasses on the ariadne yes but well with one of your two anchors out of commission youd start drifting wouldnt you we wouldnt drift a diving ship normally carries four splayed anchors to moor it precisely over any given spot on the ocean floor we just tie up to the kilcharran thats all im not doing too well am i one last objection sir probably a feeble one an anchor is only an anchor this bomber and its cargo probably weighs over a hundred tons i mean its quite a lift diving ships also carry flotation bags we strap them to the planes fuselage and pump them full of compressed air until we achieve neutral buoyancy i give up carrington said from now on i stick to diving so we twiddle our thumbs until the kilcharran arrives hawkins said but not you i take it commander i think well have a look at the delos sir chapter they had rowed about a mile when talbot called up the ariadne he spoke briefly listened briefly then turned to mckenzie who was at the tiller ship oars the timing device is still at it so i think well start the engine gently at first at this distance i hardly think wed trigger anything even if the bomb was activated but no chances course there were nine of them in the whaler talbot van gelder the two divers mckenzie and the four seamen who had rowed them so far those last would not be required again until they reached the last mile of the return trip after about forty minutes van gelder moved up into the bows with a portable sixinch searchlight which on such a clear night had an effective range of over a mile the searchlight was probably superfluous for there was a threequarter moon and talbot with his nightglasses had a clear bearing on the monastery and the radar station on mount elias van gelder returned within minutes and handed the searchlight to mckenzie fine off the port bow chief i have it mckenzie said the yellow buoy in the light of both the moon and the searchlight was clearly visible do i anchor not necessary talbot said no current thats worth speaking of no wind a heavy anchor weight and a stout anchor rope just make fast to the buoy in course of time mckenzie did just that and the four divers slipped over the side touching down on the deck of the delos just over an hour after leaving the ariadne carrington and grant disappeared down the forard companionway while talbot and van gelder took the after one talbot didnt bother entering the after stateroom the two girls had stayed there and he knew it would hold nothing of interest for him he looked at the dead engineer or the man whom van gelder had taken to be the engineer because of his blue overalls and examined the back of his head carefully the occiput had not been crushed and there were no signs of either bruising or blood in the vicinity of the deep gash in the skin of the skull he rejoined van gelder who had already moved into the engineroom there was of course no smoke there now and very little traces of oil in the light of their two powerful flashlights visibility was all that could be wished for and it took them only two minutes to carry out their examination unless one is looking for some obscure mechanical fault there is very little to look for in an engineroom on their way out they opened up a toolbox and took out a long slender chisel apiece they found the bridge when they arrived there to be all that they would have expected a bridge on such a yacht to be with a plethora of expensive and largely unnecessary navigational aids but in all respects perfectly innocuous only one thing took talbots attention a wooden cupboard on the after bulkhead it was locked but on the understandable assumption that andropulos wouldnt be having any further use for it talbot wrenched it open with a chisel it contained the ships papers and ships log nothing more a door on the port side of the same bulkhead led to a combined radioroom and chartroom the chartroom section held nothing that a chartroom should not have had including a locked cupboard which talbot opened in the same cavalier fashion he had used on the bridge it held only pilot books and sailing directions andropulos it seemed just liked locking cupboards the radio was a standard rca they left they found carrington and grant waiting for them in the saloon carrington was carrying what appeared to be a portable radio grant had a black metallic box slightly larger than a sheet of foolscap paper and less than three inches thick carrington put his visor close to talbots all we could find of interest i mean we have enough dispatch would appear to be the keynote of your investigations commander hawkins said glass in hand he was seated across the wardroom table from talbot i mean you seem to spend singularly little time on your um aquatic investigation you can find out interesting things in a very short space of time sir too much for some people you refer to our shipwrecked friends who else five things sir van gelder was right there were no signs of bruising or blood where the engineer had been gashed on the head an examination of the engineroom turned up no signs of protrusions anglebeams or sharp metallic corners that could have caused the injury circumstantial evidence i know but evidence that strongly suggests that the engineer was clobbered by a heavy metallic instrument no shortage of those in an engineroom we have of course no clue as to the identity of the assailant secondly im afraid the owner of the delos has been guilty of telling you fibs admiral he said he abandoned the delos because he was afraid that the reserve fuel tank might blow up there is no such tank isnt that interesting does make things look a little black for andropulos it does a bit he could always claim of course that he knew nothing of the layout of the engineroom and had always assumed that there had to be a reserve tank or that in a panicstricken concern for the welfare of his beloved niece he had quite forgotten that there was no such tank hes undoubtedly intelligent we know hes a thespian of some note and could put up a spirited and convincing defence in court but hed have no defence against a further charge that the explosion was not due to natural causes unless you regard the detonation of a bomb almost certainly a plastic explosive under the main fuel tank as being a natural cause well well well one wonders how hell talk his way out of this one youre quite certain of course we are wounded sir van gelder said the captain and i are developing quite some expertise on the effects of explosives on metal in the bomber the metal of the fuselage was blown outwards in this case the metal of the fuel tank was blown inwards we are not explosives experts sir talbot said but it would seem that andropulos wasnt either he nodded towards carrington and grant but those two gentlemen are experts we were talking about it on the way back they reckon that andropulos if it was andropulos it could have been alexander or aristotle made an amateurish blunder they say the villain whoever he was should have used what they call an inverted beehive plastic explosive attached to the underside of the tank by a magnetic clamp in which case more than ninety per cent of the explosive charge would have been directed upwards it would seem that they didnt use such a device hawkins looked at carrington you can be sure of this chief as sure as can be sir we do know that he couldnt have used a beehive the explosive charge would have been either flat circular or cylindrical and in any of those cases the disruptive explosive power would have been uniformly distributed in all directions grant and i think he didnt deliberately sink the yacht but that he just through ignorance kind of accidentally blew a hole through the bottom if it werent for the three dead men this could be almost amusing as it is one has to admit that life is full of its little ironies whats that youve got in front of you there carrington some sort of radio sir took it from the captains cabin why did you take it struck me as odd sir unusual out of place you might say every cabin is fitted with its own bulkhead radio all probably fed from the central radio in the saloon so why should he require this additional radio especially when he had access to and was probably the only user of the much superior radio in his radioroom talbot looked at denholm just a standard radio is it not quite denholm took the radio and examined it briefly a transceiver which means it can transmit as well as receive hundreds of them around thousands most commonly as shiptoshore radios in private yachts also used in geological and seismological work and construction building remote control detonation he paused and looked around myopically i dont want to sound sinister but it could equally well be used to trigger off the detonator in an explosive device being carried by an american air force bomber there was a brief silence then hawkins said i dont want to complain denholm but you do rather tend to complicate matters i used the word could sir not did on the whole given the mysterious and inexplicable circumstances i rather think i prefer the word did if that is the case it leads of course to even more mysteries how did andropulos or whoever know when and from where that bomber was leaving how did he know its cargo how did he know an explosive device was being smuggled aboard how did he know the radio wavelength to set it off and of course theres the why why why the silence was considerably longer this time finally hawkins said maybe were doing andropulos an injustice maybe alexander is the mastermind not a chance sir van gelder was definite andropulos lied about the spare tank he has connections with main centres of known gunrunning activities the fact that alexander who unquestionably plays the role of assistant villain had the radio in his cabin is of no significance i should imagine that irene charial might be in the habit of dropping in on her uncle occasionally and he wouldnt want her saying whatever are you doing with a spare radio in your cabin uncle i can hardly imagine her dropping in on alexander at any time far less occasionally so alexander kept the radio you mentioned the possibility of an insider at this air force base in america sir talbot said i think we should be thinking in terms of a whole platoon of insiders you will be composing messages for the pentagon air force intelligence and the cia suitably etched in acid i think by this time they must be dreading the thought of another signal from the ariadne i dont see much point in your going to washington and entering a popularity stakes contest the slings and arrows well were accustomed to injustices what do you have in that box petty officer grant picked this up in andropuloss cabin havent opened it yet not without difficulty he undid two spring clips and lifted the lid waterproof by jove he looked at the contents means nothing to me hawkins took the box from him lifted out some sheets of paper and a paperback book examined them briefly and shook his head means nothing to me either denholm denholm shuffled through the papers in greek naturally looks like a list of names addresses and telephone numbers to me but i cant make sense of it i thought you understood greek i do but i dont understand grecian code and this is what its written in a code code damn it to hell hawkins spoke with considerable feeling this could be urgent vital its more than likely sir denholm looked at the paperback homers odyssey i dont suppose its here just by coincidence if we knew the connection between the poem and whats written on those sheets then cracking the code would be childs play but we dont have the key thats locked away inside andropuloss mind anagrams and word puzzles are not in my line of country sir im no cryptologist hawkins looked moodily at talbot you dont have a codecracker among this motley crew you have aboard to the best of my knowledge no and certainly not a greek codecracker shouldnt be too difficult to find one i should imagine the greek defence ministry and their secret service are bound to have some cryptologists on their staffs just a radio call and a halfhours flight away sir hawkins glanced at his watch two am all godfearing cryptologists are tucked up in their beds by this time so are all godfearing admirals denholm said besides my friend wotherspoon didnt mind being rousted out of bed an hour ago positively cheerful about it in fact talbot said who may i ask warily is wotherspoon professor wotherspoon my friend with the aegean lugger you asked me to contact him remember lives in naxos seven or eight hours sail from here hes on his way with the angelina very civil of him i must say angelina odd name better not let him hear you say that sir name of his lugger ancient and honoured grecian name some sort of classical goddess i believe also the name of his wife charming lady is he what shall we say slightly eccentric all depends upon what you mean by eccentric he regards the rest of the world as being slightly eccentric a professor what does he profess archaeology used to hes retired now retired oh dear i mean have we any right to bring an elderly archaeologist into this dont let him hear you say that either sir hes not elderly old man left him a fortune you warned him of the perils of course as directly as i could seemed amused said his ancestors fought at agincourt and crecy something to that effect whats good enough for a retired archaeologist should be good enough for a greek cryptologist hawkins said not that i follow the logic of that if you would be so good commander well radio athens right away two things sir i suggest we release andropulos and his friends for breakfast and leave them free sure weve got plenty on them but as yet no conclusive proof and the three as andropulos aristotle and alexander are a closemouthed and secretive lot and we can be certain they wont talk to us or give anything away but they might just might talk among themselves lieutenant denholm will lurk unobtrusively they dont and wont know that he talks greek as well as they do number one would you tell mckenzie to warn the four seamen who were with us tonight that they are on no account to mention the fact that we were on the delos keelhauling walking the plank that sort of thing one other thing the presence of the cryptographer when he arrives will not go unnoticed hes not a cryptographer van gelder said peace be to lieutenant denholm but hes a civilian electronics specialist whos come out to fix some abstruse electronic fault that only he can fix also gives a splendid reason for him to use denholms cabin while he gets on with his decoding well thank you very much denholm smiled and turned to talbot with the captains permission id like to retire there right now and get some sleep before this impostor arrives an excellent idea viceadmiral hawkins professor benson dr wickram i suggest you follow his example i promise you well give you a shake if anything untoward occurs another excellent idea hawkins said after our nightcap and after youve sent your signal to athens and ive composed a suitably stirring message to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in washington stirring certainly why should i be the only one suffering from insomnia i shall tell him that we have every reason to believe that the bomber was carrying a smuggled explosive device aboard that its detonation was triggered by a radio wave and that we have the miscreant responsible in our hands reason to believe not proof i shall name andropulos i shall want to know how he knew when and from where that bomber was taking off how did he know what it was carrying how could this explosive device possibly have been smuggled aboard how did he know the radio wavelength to set it off i shall suggest that our concern should be made immediately known to the white house air force intelligence the cia and the fbi i will suggest that andropulos has been provided with toplevel ultrasecret information from a very senior official i will suggest that this should considerably narrow their field of search i will further suggest that it seems very likely that the traitor is in his own fiefdom the pentagon stirring indeed laying it on the line as you might say talbot paused it has occurred to you admiral hawkins that you might also be laying your own career on the line only if im wrong only if were wrong in the circumstances a bagatelle you would do exactly the same thing five oclock sir talbot woke in his seacabin abaft the bridge to find van gelder bending over him the kilcharran is three miles out whats the latest word from sonar still ticking away sir captain montgomery says hes going to shut down his engines in another halfmile sees us clearly and reckons hell come to a stop more or less alongside he says that if hes going to overshoot hell use a sea anchor or drop a stern anchor and if he stops short of us hell send a crew with a rope from the way he talks he seems to regard either possibility as a remote contingency doesnt seem the shy or bashful type i gathered as much from the admiral has our cryptologist arrived yes calls himself theodore speaks perfect english but i suppose hes greek installed in denholms cabin denholm himself is up in the wardroom trying to resume his slumbers van gelder broke off to accept a sheet of paper from a seaman who had appeared in the doorway glanced briefly at the message and handed it without a word to talbot who read it in turn muttered something inaudible and swung his legs to the deck hell have to try to resume his slumbers later on tell him to join us in the admirals cabin at once a pyjamaclad viceadmiral hawkins propped up on the pillows of his bunk glowered at the message in his hand and passed it across to denholm pentagon unsigned this krytron device you suggested if i were the spluttering type which im not this would be a sure firestarter denholm reread the message understand krytron experimental device in hand endeavour expedite soonest clearance gobbledygook sir writer is ignorant or stupid or thinks hes clever very likely all three at once what does he mean endeavour he can either do it or not what does he mean understand he either knows or not expedite means to try to hurry things along the pentagon doesnt expedite they demand immediate compliance same goes for that meaningless word soonest again should be immediate clearance by whom the pentagon can clear anything they want what do they mean experimental either it works or it doesnt and doesnt the phrase in hand have a splendid meaningless vagueness about it gobbledygook sir jimmys right sir talbot said its insulting stalling for time what theyre saying in effect is that theyre not going to entrust their latest toy to their closest ally because wed flog it to the first russian we came across its rich denholm said its really wonderful the americans positively force their stinger surfacetoair missiles on the rebels who are fighting the marxist regime in angola and the contras in nicaragua its no secret that those guerrilla bands contain a fair proportion of characters who are just as undesirable as the dictatorial governments theyre supposed to be fighting and who would have no hesitation in disposing of those missiles at a fraction of their cost to any passing terrorists who in turn would have no hesitation in loosing off one of those missiles at a passing boeing preferably one packed with five hundred american citizens but thats perfectly ok for the american administrations ad hoc kneejerk set of reactions that passes for their foreign policy but its unthinkable that they should allow the krytron into the hands of their oldest ally it makes me sick it makes me mad hawkins said let us give them a lesson on clear and unequivocal english unsigned message received meaningless mumbojumbo designed to stall and delay demand immediate repeat immediate repeat immediate dispatch of krytron or immediate repeat immediate repeat immediate explanation of why not available sender of message and person responsible for delay in clearance will be held directly responsible for possible deaths of thousands can you not imagine the worldwide reaction when it is learnt that not only is america responsible for this potential disaster but that it was almost certainly caused by treason in the highest american military echelons a copy of this message is being sent directly to the president of the united states that do you think you could have pitched it a bit more strongly sir talbot said but id have to spend the rest of the night thinking how you spoke earlier of sleepless heads along the potomac i think we should now talk of heads rolling along the potomac if i were you sir id keep clear of washington for some little time by which i mean the rest of your life he rose the kilcharran will be alongside in a few minutes i assume you are in no hurry to meet captain montgomery you assume right there is no charity in me he looked at his watch fivethirteen my respects to the captain and ask him to join me for breakfast at say eightthirty in my cabin here captain montgomery whether by luck or design design talbot was certain brought the kilcharran alongside the ariadne with faultless precision talbot stepped across the two gunwales they were almost exactly of a height and made his way up to the bridge captain montgomery was a tall burly character with a jutting black beard white teeth a slightly hooked nose and humorous eyes and in spite of the immaculately cut uniform and four golden rings on either cuff could easily have passed for a welltodo and genial eighteenthcentury caribbean pirate he extended a hand youll be commander talbot of course the voice was deep the irish brogue unmistakable you are welcome aboard has there been any further deterioration in the situation no the only deterioration possible captain is one i dont care to imagine indeed i shall be sadly missed in the mountains of mourne were great ones for the lamentations the weepings and the wailings in the mountains of mourne is this atom bomb or whatever still ticking away it is i suppose you might call it a deterioration when the ticking stops you shouldnt have come here captain you should have nipped into the gulf of corinth you might have stood a chance there not to be thought of for a moment nothing to do with heroics heroics are for those epics they make in hollywood or the fact that i couldnt live with myself i just couldnt stand the thought of what that man would say youll be referring to viceadmiral hawkins the very same maligning and blackening my character as usual i dare say hardly talbot smiled he did mind you make some casual remark about you being allergic to certain naval regulations he also said youre the best in the business aye a fair man and a bloody good admiral but dont tell him i said so i suggest coffee in my cabin commander and perhaps youll be kind enough to tell me all you know that shouldnt take long eleven pm the president said whats the time over there six am theres a sevenhour time difference a very forthright character this admiral hawkins the president gazed thoughtfully at the two dispatches lying on his desk you know him of course pretty well sir an able man general exceptionally so he also appears to be an exceptionally tough sob thats undoubtedly true sir but then you have to be to command the nato mediterranean sea forces do you know him john this was to john heiman the defence secretary the only other person present yes not as well as the general but well enough to agree with the generals assessment pity i never met him who selected him for the job general usual nato committee you were on it of course yes i was the chairman ah the man with the casting vote no casting vote the decision was unanimous i see he well he seems to have rather a low opinion of the pentagon he doesnt exactly say that but he does appear to have a low opinion deep suspicions if you like of a person or persons in the pentagon puts you in a rather unhappy position i mean there must be some stirrings in the pentagon dovecote as you say mr president a few ruffled feathers some are hopping mad others are giving the matter serious consideration generally you could speak of an air of quiet consternation are you personally prepared to lend any credence to this outrageous suggestion or what appears to be outrageous think the unthinkable i dont have any option do i every instinct says no this cannot be those are all my friends and colleagues of many years standing all honourable men but instinct is a fallible guide mr president common sense and what little knowledge of history i have tells me that every man has his price i have to investigate the enquiry is already under way i thought it prudent not to involve the intelligence arms of the four services so the fbi the pentagon does not care to be investigated by the fbi its an extremely difficult and delicate situation sir yes one can hardly go up to an admiral of the fleet and ask him what he was doing on the night of friday the thirteenth i wish you luck the president looked at one of the papers before him your message re the krytron that provoked hawkinss ire must have been badly handled it was very badly the matter has been attended to this krytron device is it operational yes been sent the general shook his head the president pressed a button and a young man entered take this message for the general here krytron device en route would greatly appreciate uptodate assessment of existing problems and measures being taken fully appreciate extreme gravity dangers and complexities of the situation i personally guarantee total and immediate repeat immediate repeat immediate support and cooperation in all measures undertaken that should do it sign my name i hope he appreciates the three immediates the general said eightforty sir mckenzie said admirals apologies but hed like to see you hes in his cabin with captain montgomery talbot thanked him rose washed the sleep from his face and eyes and made his way to the admirals quarters a shirt sleeved hawkins beckoned him to join himself and montgomery at the breakfast table coffee sorry to disturb you but these are times that are sent to try mens souls for a troubled soul hawkins looked remarkably fresh rested and relaxed and was attacking his breakfast with some gusto captain montgomery has been reporting the state of progress and i thought you might like to hear it incidentally our friend the timing device is still ticking merrily away we are making progress montgomery said slow but steady slow because the presence of what the admiral calls your friend the timing device does have a rather inhibitory effect and were probably taking some quite needless precautions as far as acoustic levels are concerned but were dealing with a devil we dont know and were paying the devil more than his due our own sonar is now locked on to this device and the sonar room has suddenly become the focal centre of interest in the kilcharran we have achieved two things first by coupling up the battery resources of our two vessels we have ample electric power to lift this wreck your young lieutenant denholm looks and talks like a character out of p g wodehouse but he unquestionably knows his stuff your engineer officer mccafferty is no slouch either and neither is mine anyway no problem secondly weve cut away the port wing of the bomber youve what talbot said well you know how it is montgomery sounded almost apologetic it was three parts torn away in any case and i figured that neither you nor the us air force would have any further use for it so i had it burnt off despite his faint air of apology it was quite clear that montgomery had no regrets about what had been a wholly unilateral decision as the only expert on the spot he had no intention of consulting anybody a difficult decision and a tricky operation no one as far as i know has ever before cut away the wing of a submerged big jet thats where the fuel tanks are located and though it seemed likely that the partial tearing away of the wing had also ruptured the fuel lines and spilled the fuel there was no way of being sure and no one again as far as i know has ever come up against the problem of what happens when an oxyacetylene jet meets a fuel tank under water but my men were very careful there was no fuel and so no trouble and now at the present moment my men are securing flotation bags and lifting slings to the plane removing this wing gives us two advantages one minor one major the minor one is that with the wing and two very heavy jet engines gone we have all that less to lift although im certain we could have lifted the whole lot without trouble the major one is that the wing had it been left there would have snagged on the underside of the kilcharran as it surfaced and tilted the fuselage maybe to so acute an angle as to make access to this damned bomb difficult or impossible very well done captain hawkins said but surely theres still one problem when the bomber surfaces isnt the weight of the remaining wing and its two engines going to tilt it just as far in the other direction montgomery smiled in a kindly and tolerant fashion which any average person would have found more than wildly infuriating hawkins fortunately was not an average person no problem montgomery said were also securing flotation bags under that wing when the fuselage surfaces the wings will still be under water you know how low wings are set on a modern jet in the first stage of surfacing only the top of the fuselage will be above waterlevel when we cut away a rectangular section over where the bomb is located i want as much water as possible below that section to dissipate the heat of the oxyacetylene torches after weve made that hole in the top well lift the fuselage high enough to drain most of the water from it how long will it take to inflate the bags and haul the plane to the surface an hour or two i dont know an hour or two hawkins made no attempt to conceal his surprise i should have thought a few minutes you dont know you say i would have thought those things could have been pretty closely calculated normally yes montgomerys air of massive restraint was on a par for provocation with his kindly tolerance but normally wed use powerful diesel compressors out of deference to the little lady lying on the sea floor no diesel electricity again but using only a fraction of the power so an indeterminate period do you think i could have some more coffee montgomery clearly regarded the conversation as over van gelder knocked on the opened door and entered a message slip in his hand he handed it to hawkins for you admiral came in a couple of hours or so ago not urgent so i didnt think it worth waking you for it a wise decision my boy hawkins read it smiled broadly and handed it to talbot who glanced at it smiled in turn and read it out aloud well well talbot said hobnobbing with presidents perhaps after all sir you could walk down pennsylvania avenue without being clapped in irons or whatever they do to you over in those parts more importantly you have the krytron and this splendid pledge of cooperation your indignation the less charitable would call it calculated gamble has paid off i like the repeat immediate bit the president would appear to have a sense of humour he would indeed one has to be grateful to him for intervening personally very very satisfactory i note that he requires information would you please naturally emphasis of course on the gravity and the dangers of course another item of news sir van gelder said to talbot ive just had a rather intriguing chat with irene charial i can well imagine that andropulos and company of course are now at liberty how are they this fine morning glowering a bit sir at least andropulos and alexander were but the cook was in fine form and they seemed to be thawing a bit when i left them chattering away in greek with denholm sitting among them and not understanding a word they were saying irene wasnt there oh so naturally overcome by concern you hurried up to my cabin to enquire after her health naturally i knew that was what you would want me to do sir she didnt look as if she had slept too well and admitted as much seemed worried apprehensive even at first she was rather reluctant to talk about what was bothering her misplaced loyalty i should say i would say so too talbot said if that is i knew what you were talking about sorry turned out she wanted to know if uncle adam had been sending any radio messages it seems uncle adam adamantios andropulos his parents have a lot to answer for seems that she and her pal eugenia both sets of parents live in piraeus the two girls are at the university in athens were in the habit of phoning home every night she wanted their parents to know that they had had an accident were safely aboard a royal navy ship and would be home soon i hope shes right hawkins said me too sir i told her no messages had been sent and suggested that if uncle was a businessman i thought it better not to mention that we already knew he was a multimillionaire businessman he might naturally tend to be secretive and that he might also be reluctant to broadcast the fact that he had lost his yacht through what might have been his own fault she said that was no excuse for not informing the next of kin of the three crew members of the delos who had died i asked her if she had raised the question with him and she said no she was a bit evasive on this point i gather she either doesnt know very much about uncle adam or doesnt care very much about what she does know van gelder produced a paper from his pocket i told her to write a message and i would see it was sent talbot looked at the paper its in greek perhaps this uncle adam we share the same nasty suspicious mind sir i called jimmy from the breakfast table quite innocent he says i have a better idea take the two young ladies to the radioroom its a simple matter to lock into the telephone land lines through the piraeus radio station they can talk direct to their folks with jimmy just happening to be there we share as you say the same nasty suspicious minds before you do that however i think well go and see how our latest recruit is getting on ah our resident cryptologist theodore theodore after weve seen him and the young ladies have finished their calls i want you to take irene charial aside and engage her in casual conversation what else it would seem that she and her uncle are less than soulmates and of course she will be feeling suitably grateful to you for having permitted her to speak to her folks find out what you can about andropulos find out what she thinks of him see what you can discover about his business or businesses find out who his business contacts and friends are and what she thinks of them assuming of course that shes ever met any of them and it would be very interesting to know where his travels take him im not talking about his yacht cruises when she is with him and why they take him there you are asking me sir in effect to ply irene with cunning and devious questions to entrap her if you will to engage in duplicity and extract unwitting information from a sweet and innocent girl yes a pleasure sir theodore was a cheerful plump man in his late forties with a pale face and thick pebble glasses those last a very probable consequence of having spent a lifetime poring over abstruse codes you have come to check on progress gentlemen i am making some im happy to report took me quite some time to find the key the connection between the code and the odyssey since then its straightforward these sheets are in three sections and im now about twothirds of the way through the first one found anything of interest talbot said interesting fascinating captain fascinating statements of his accounts bank holdings if you like he has his money stashed away stashed is the word all over the world it seems as a matter of interest im totting up the sum of his holdings as i go along hes made it very easy for me everything is in us dollars so far let me see its twoeighty yes twoeighty dollars a man could retire on that van gelder said indeed twoeighty followed by six zeros talbot and van gelder looked at each other in silence then bent forward over theodores shoulders to look at the figures he had added up after some seconds they straightened looked at each other again then lent forward once more two hundred and eighty million dollars talbot said on that you could retire vincent if i scraped and pinched a bit i might manage do you know where those bank accounts are kept theodore cities countries i mean some i do because hes given names and addresses some i dont for the second lot he may have another code which i dont have or he just knows them by heart by heart i would guess i have no means of knowing where at least half the accounts are just the amounts thats all could you show us some of those talbot said of course theodore pointed to some entries flipped over several pages and indicated several more just amounts as i said as you see theres a differing capital letter after each entry they mean nothing to me maybe they do to andropulos talbot leafed through the pages again five letters just five recur regularly z w v b and g well now if you were a thrifty citizen and wanted a safe piggybank secure from the prying eyes of nasty parties such as police and income tax authorities which country would you choose switzerland i think the same far from original thought had occurred to andropulos for at least half his assets z for zurich w winterthur perhaps v offhand i dont know about that one vevey van gelder said on lake geneva i dont think so hardly what you might call an international banking centre ah i have it not in switzerland but it might as well be vaduz liechtenstein i dont know much about those things but i understand that once cash disappears into the vaults of vaduz it never surfaces again b could be berne or basle andropulos would know of course g has to be geneva how am i doing number one splendidly im sure youre right i hardly like to point out sir that we still dont have the names and addresses of those banks true crestfallen but only slightly we still have names and addresses of other banks you have a list of those cities where those banks are located i dont have to theodore said i have it in my head theyre all over the place west east and in between places as different as miami tijuana mexico city bogota in colombia bangkok islamabad in pakistan kabul in afghanistan why anyone should want to hide away money in kabul is quite beyond me country is torn by war and the russians occupy and control the capital andropulos would appear to have friends everywhere talbot said why should the poor russians be left out in the cold that about the lot quite a few other places theodore said mostly smaller accounts one exception though the biggest deposit of the lot where washington dc well now talbot was silent for a few minutes what do you make of that number one i think ive just about stopped making anything out of anything my mind has kind of taken a leave of absence but my eyes are still working in a fashion you might say i think i see a faint light at the end of the tunnel i think if we think a bit more it might turn into a searchlight how much money eighteen million dollars eighteen million dollars van gelder said my my even in washington dc a man could buy a lot with eighteen million dollars chapter the angelina to put it at its most kindly was a rather strikinglooking craft an eightytonner built of pinewood from the forests of the island of samos she had a dazzling white hull which contrasted strongly some would have said violently with her vermilion gunwale wide of beam and low in the water amidships she had a pronounced flare aft and forard a curved stem that projected high above the gunwale as a sailing boat she was well equipped with a standinglug main and balancelug foresail together with two jibs had it been left at that as she had originally been built the angelina a typical example of the tehandiri class would not only have been striking but downright handsome unfortunately it had not been left at that the owner professor wotherspoon although a selfavowed traditionalist was also strongly attached to his creature comforts not content with converting the crafts very considerable hold it was after all originally constructed as a cargo vessel into cabins and bathrooms he had constructed on the deck a bridge saloon and galley which while admittedly functional detracted notably from the overall aesthetic effect shortly before ten oclock in the morning the angelina almost slacksailed and ghosting along under a meltemi that hardly rated as a zephyr tied up along the starboard side of the ariadne talbot accompanied by denholm climbed down a rope ladder to greet the owner the first impression that talbot had of wotherspoon was that he didnt look a bit like a professor or an archaeologist but then he had to admit he had no idea what a professor or archaeologist was supposed to look like he was tall lean shockhaired and deeply tanned humorous of mien and colloquial of speech he was the last person one would expect to find wandering through the groves of academe he was certainly not more than forty years old his wife with auburn hair and laughing hazel eyes was at least ten years younger and was also it seemed an archaeologist introductions effected by denholm talbot said i appreciate this very much professor very kind of you to come not to say very gallant you appreciate that there is a fair chance that you might find yourself prematurely in another world lieutenant denholm did explain the dangers to you in a cautious and roundabout fashion hes become very tightlipped since he joined the senior service i didnt join i was dragooned he did mention something about vaporization well one gets a bit tired of studying ancient history much more interesting to be a part of the making of it it might be a very shortlived interest indeed does mrs wotherspoon share your shortlived interests angelina please we had to entertain a very prim and proper swiss lady the other day and she insisted on addressing me as madame professor wotherspoon ghastly no i cant say i share all of my husbands more extravagant enthusiasms but alas he does have one professorial failing hes horribly absentminded someone has to look after him talbot smiled a fearful thing for so young and attractive a lady to be trapped for life again thank you both very very much i should like it if you would join us for lunch meantime ill leave lieutenant denholm to explain the full horrors of the situation to you especially the ones youll encounter across the lunch table gloom and despondency van gelder said it ill becomes one so young and beautiful to be gloomy and despondent what is the matter irene in so far as one so young and beautiful could look morose irene charial gazed out morosely over the taffrail of the ariadne i am not lieutenantcommander van gelder in the mood for flattery vincent flattery is an insincere compliment how can the truth be flattery but youre right about the word mood you are in a mood youre worried upset whats troubling you nothing being beautiful doesnt mean youre above telling fibs you could hardly call that flattery could you no a fleeting smile touched the green eyes not really i know this is a very unpleasant situation you find yourself in but were all trying to make the best of it or did something your parents say upset you you know perfectly well that thats not true van gelder also knew it denholm had reassured him on that point yes thats so you were hardly in a cheerful frame of mind when i first met you this morning something worries you is it so dreadful a secret that you cant tell me youve come here to pry havent you yes to pry and probe crafty cunning devious questions to extract information from you that you dont know youre giving away it was van gelders turn to look morose i dont think im very good at it i dont think you are either that man sent you didnt he what man now youre being dishonest commander talbot your captain a cold man distant humourless hes neither cold nor distant and hes got a very considerable sense of humour humour i dont see any signs of it im beginning not to be surprised van gelder had stopped smiling maybe he thought it would be wasted on you maybe hes right she appeared not to have taken offence or maybe i just dont see too much to laugh about at the moment but im right about the other thing hes remote distant ive met people like him before i doubt it very much in the same way that i doubt your power of judgement you dont seem to be very well equipped in that line oh she made a moue flattery and charm have flown out the window is that it i dont flatter ive never claimed to have charm i meant no harm please i see nothing wrong with being a career officer but he lives for only two things the royal navy and the ariadne you poor deluded creature van gelder spoke without heat but how were you to know john talbot lives for only two things his daughter and his son fiona aged six and jimmy aged three he dotes on them so do i im their uncle vincent oh she was silent for some moments and his wife dead i am sorry she caught his arm to say i didnt know is no excuse go ahead call me a clown i dont flatter i dont charm and i dont tell lies but you do turn a pretty compliment she took her hand away leaned on the rail and looked out over the sea after some time she said without looking around its my uncle adam isnt it yes we dont know him we dont trust him and we think hes a highly suspicious character you will forgive me talking about your nearest and dearest in this fashion he is not my nearest and dearest she had turned to face him there was neither vehemence in her voice nor marked expression in her face at most a slight degree of bewilderment in both dont know him dont trust him and think hes a highly suspicious character if you dont know him what on earth are were you doing aboard his yacht i suppose that too seems suspicious not really three reasons i would think hes a very persuasive man he seems to be genuinely fond of our family my younger brother and sister and myself for he is forever giving us presents very expensive presents too and it seemed churlish to refuse his invitation then there was the element of fascination i know practically nothing about him nor what his business activities are or why he spends so much time in foreign countries and of course perhaps both eugenia and i are snobs at heart and were flattered by the invitation to go cruising on a very expensive yacht well good enough reasons but still not good enough to explain why you went with him if you dislike him i didnt say i disliked him i said i distrusted him not the same thing and i didnt begin distrusting him until this trip why start now alexander is why she gave a mock shudder would you trust alexander candidly no and aristotle is almost as bad the three of them spent hours talking together usually in the radioroom whenever eugenia or i went near them they stopped talking why obvious isnt it they didnt want you to hear what they were talking about ever been with him abroad on his business trips good heavens no she was genuinely startled at the idea not even on the delos ive only been on the delos once before with my brother and sister a short trip to istanbul he was going to have less than a sensational report to make to his captain van gelder reflected she didnt know her uncle she didnt know what his businesses were she never travelled with him and her only reason for distrusting him was that she distrusted alexander a feeling almost certainly shared by the majority of people who had ever met him van gelder made one last try your mothers brother of course she nodded what does she think of him she never speaks ill of him but she never speaks ill of anyone shes a wonderful lady a wonderful mother not simple or anything like that just a very trusting person who could never bring herself to speak ill of anyone shes obviously never met alexander your father he never speaks of uncle adam either but he doesnt speak in a very different way if you follow me my father is a very straight very honest man very clever head of a big construction company highly respected by everyone but he doesnt speak of my uncle im not as trusting as my mother i believe my father strongly disapproves of uncle adam or whatever businesses he runs or both i dont believe theyve talked in years she shrugged and gave a faint smile sorry i cant be of more help you havent learnt anything have you yes i have ive learnt i can trust you this time the smile was warm and genuine and friendly you dont flatter you dont charm and you dont tell lies but you are gallant yes van gelder said i believe i am sir john the president said you have put me in a most damnably awkward position i speak you understand more in sorrow than in anger yes mr president i am aware of that and im sorry for it it is of course no consolation for you to know that i am in an equally awkward situation if sir john travers the british ambassador to the united states did indeed find himself in such a situation he showed no signs of it but then sir john was renowned throughout the diplomatic world for his savoirfaire his monolithic calm and his ability to remain wholly unruffled in the most trying and difficult situations im only the messenger boy grade one of course who the hell is this fellow hawkins anyway richard hollison deputy head of the fbi couldnt quite match sir johns tranquil serenity but he had his obvious anger under tight control i dont think i care very much for having a foreigner telling the white house the pentagon and the fbi how to run their business hawkins is a viceadmiral in the british navy the general was the fourth and only other person in the office an exceptionally able man i cannot think of any united states naval officer whom i would sooner have in his place in those nearimpossible circumstances and i dont think i need point out that i am in the most awkward situation of all i dont want to sound overly possessive but bloody hell the pentagon is my concern richard hollison sir john said ive known you for some years now i know your reputation for toughness is matched only by your reputation for fairness be fair in this case admiral hawkins as the general has just said is in a position of having to cope with almost impossible circumstances which as you are in a position to know better than most involves making almost impossible decisions hes not telling anyone how to run their business in order to get a message to the president without anyone in the government or the pentagon seeing the message before the president he elected to bypass the pentagon and all the standard avenues of communication certainly the pentagon knows its already under investigation but hawkins didnt want anyone to know that he was pointing fingers in certain directions if it is your intention to set a cat among the pigeons or let loose an eagle in the dovecote you dont send a postcard in advance announcing your intentions yes i accept that hollison said with weary resignation i accept it but dont ask me to like it like it or lump it the president said i accept it too he looked unenthusiastically at the paper before him on his desk it would appear that this adamantios andropulos who is hawkinss temporary guest i could well imagine that admiral hawkins would use the term guest even if this unfortunate were clapped in irons in some shipboard dungeon has an account with a washington bank name and address supplied of some eighteen million dollars and would we kindly make enquiries to see if he has been disbursing any of this of late and if so in what direction i know this lies well within your capabilities richard point is how long will it take all depends upon how many false names how many dud companies how much of the usual laundering paraphernalia is involved the villain if there is a villain might well have a numbered account in outer mongolia unlikely i admit but you take my point one hour maybe three we will not stand upon the order of our going excuse me mr president excuse me gentlemen hollison left the army and the marines will be pleased to learn when they do learn of it that admiral hawkins does not consider them worthy of his regard the president went on only the air force and the navy the air force i can in the circumstances understand but it would be interesting to know why he has deemed the navy to be deserving of his interests he gives no indications on that score the president sighed maybe he doesnt even trust me or maybe he knows something that we dont know sir john said placidly if that is the case that he knows something we dont i have little doubt that hell tell us in the fullness of time the man under discussion in the white house was at that moment dwelling on precisely the same subject times winged chariot john i forget the rest of the quotation but its definitely on the wing leaning back in a comfortable armchair a glass of frosted lime juice in his hand hawkins succeeded only in giving the impression of a man with all the time in the world so much to do so little time to do it in how stands the ariadne in respect of the rest of this uncaring world i think you might say sir that the patient is coming along as well as could be expected our carpenter is aboard the angelina building a cradle for the bomb according to the specifications the pentagon gave us there will be two hinged clamps to secure it in even the worst weather which as you can see for yourself is the last thing we expect today indeed the admiral looked through the window of his cabin the weather is all wrong john considering the possibly apocalyptic and doomladen task we have on hand the least we could reasonably expect is high winds torrential rain thunder lightning tempests tornadoes and all those other adverse weather conditions that king lear encountered on his walkabout around the blasted heath but what do we have a blistering july sun a cloudless blue sky and the winedark seas without even a ripple to show for themselves downright disappointing also disappointing not to say extremely disturbing is the likelihood that if those zerowind conditions persist itll take the angelina a week to get even half way towards the horizon i dont think we have to worry about that sir weather conditions in the cyclades between early july and midseptember are remarkably predictable its already eleven fortyfive any minute now the meltemi the etesian wind will start up from the northwest during the afternoon it reaches forces or sometimes even seven usually dies away in the evening but it has been known to last all night the meltemi will be ideally suited for the angelina those luggers as denholm said are hopeless windward sailors but in this case it will be directly astern of them and carry them down towards the kasos strait to the east of the easternmost tip of crete sounds fine but well even if montgomery manages to raise this bomber fhe manages to cut a hole in the fuselage without blowing us all to kingdom come if he manages to extract the atom bomb and if he manages to secure it to the angelinas cradle what happens if the thing detonates before he reaches the kasos strait then thats it for wotherspoon and his crew for us the risk is low ive been talking to dr wickram about this he seems convinced of the inherent stability of the hydrogen bomb after all he does build the damn things while he says it would be a hundred per cent certain to go up if an atom bomb exploded alongside it we mustnt overestimate the effects of a more remote explosive shock even at a distance of a few miles after all those bombs did survive the effect of the explosion in the nose of the bomber and the impact of the plane hitting the water at high speed besides the intervening miles of water we hope there will be those intervening miles should have a powerfully dampening effect therell be no such effect for those aboard the angelina curtains what motivates a man like that john obviously hes incredibly brave but well is he all right if you mean is he off his rocker then were all off our rockers hes as sane as you or i hes a romantic at heart a born adventurer a couple of hundred years ago and hed have been somewhere on the other side of the world building up the odd empire thats as may be but its still a terrible thought that a man like that should die for us he wont be dying for all of us im going on the angelina so is vincent van gelder hawkins put down his glass and stared at him do you know what youre saying know what youre saying and i think youve taken leave of your senses are you mad you and van gelder quite mad van gelder insists on coming along i insist on going thats all there is to it i absolutely forbid it with the deepest respect admiral youll forbid me nothing did you honestly expect me to leave a job half done did you honestly expect me to let him go out there and die alone i would remind you that i am the captain of this ship and that at sea not even an admiral can take over from me or give orders which i consider to be to the detriment of this vessel mutiny hawkins waved a dismissive hand at his lime juice have we nothing stronger than this naturally talbot went to the admirals wine cupboard and prepared a drink while hawkins gazed at a spot on the deck which was about a thousand miles away a large scotch and water no ice thank you hawkins drained almost half the contents mutiny forsooth yes sir cant hang me from the yardarm though its my yardarm you havent yet met angelina professor i wotherspoons wife i mean not the lugger but you will i ive invited them aboard for lunch young rather lovely nice i sense of humour and dotty about her husband she has to be i dotty i mean to do something she clearly doesnt want i to do that is to go along from here with her husband and the i bomb on the lugger im sure i shall be delighted to make her acquaintance hawkins took another sip of his drink whats she got to do with the matter in hand shes not going with the bomb and the lugger neither is wotherspoon for that matter or his two crew members they remain aboard the ariadne wotherspoon of course will have to be forcibly restrained but thats no problem at all van gelder and i will take the angelina down through the kasos strait two small medals will suffice hawkins was silent for quite some time then said how are you going to pin on a couple of posthumous vcs or whatever when youre circling the earth in a vaporized orbit one problem at a time we cant let the girl go good god no ill never forgive myself i never even started to think i wonder wonder me no wonders sir we dont have room for three heroes aboard the angelina someone has to take the ariadne home again remember well thats the angelina now the kilcharran ive just been talking to captain montgomery hes just given a couple of experimental tugs on the lifting slings and he reckons the bomber with the help of the flotation bags of course is nearing a state of neutral buoyancy twenty minutes half an hour at the most and hes going to start to haul away you wont want to miss that sir no indeed what did walter de la mare say look your last on all things lovely every hour this may be the last thing ill ever see i rather hope it doesnt come to that sir apart from the lugger and the recovery of the bomber we have to wait for three other things the reaction to the message we sent to the president via our embassy in washington which might take quite some time for even the most cooperative of banks and banks almost by definition are secretive and detest the very thought of cooperation are going to be very reluctant to disclose any information about their important clients because important clients dont like that sort of thing admittedly air force generals and admirals are unlikely to be very important financially but they are from the point of view of prestige and power and would i should think carry a disproportionate amount of clout i do hope we havent upset too many people over there then and this i should expect very soon there should be a reply from greek intelligence to our query asking for the complete list of places where andropulos has conducted business any kind of business over the past few years then of course we await the arrival of this krytron device from america which may arrive any old time i mean we have no idea have we do the americans have supersonic planes sure they have but fighters only and their nearest refuelling point would be the azores and im quite certain no fighter could fly the close on two thousand miles theyd have to travel to get there question of fuel capacity besides its not absolutely essential that we get this device before leaving with the bomb always assuming of course that we do leave we could always dump the bomb drop a marker warn all shipping to keep clear wait for the krytron to arrive return there and detonate the bomb much more satisfactory if it could all be done in one fell swoop hawkins thought for a moment then smiled whats the time in washington four am i think excellent excellent a short message ask them how its being transported and whats the expected time of arrival give em something to do talbot lifted a phone and dictated the message havent seen your secondincommand lately hawkins said i understood he was prising secrets loose from andropuloss niece vincent normally carries out his duties with efficiency and dispatch when the duties involve irene charial it seems to take a little longer not so many years ago it would have taken me a little longer myself ah van gelder had appeared in the doorway just discussing you young man a difficult and protracted interview i take it one treads delicately sir but she told me everything she knew he looked reproachfully at talbot i detect a trace of scepticism in your expression sir unwarranted i assure you i believe her i trust her and i was not bewitched by her green eyes owing to the fact that i was on duty at the time less than admirable though they may be vincent deviousness and low cunning have their place in the scheme of things it wasnt like that at all i told her that you had sent me to try to trap her into making unwary and unguarded statements and unwittingly to betray herself after that we got along famously talbot smiled just another way of being devious what does she know nothing i guarantee youd come to the same conclusion sir she doesnt know her uncle except superficially she doesnt trust him she thinks hes a highly suspicious character she thinks alexander is a highly suspicious character although that wouldnt require any great acumen on anyones part she knows nothing about his businesses shes never travelled with him her father whom she obviously dotes on and has the highest respect for thinks hes a highly suspicious character he and andropulos havent spoken for years shes convinced that her father knows a great deal about her uncle and his businesses but dad refuses to discuss any aspect of the matter sounds as if we could do with dad aboard right now hawkins said i have the feeling we could learn some very interesting things from him im sure we could sir one odd thing shes convinced that her uncle is genuinely fond of her hawkins smiled i think it would be rather difficult not to be fond of the young lady however i would point out in the passing and apropos of nothing that mass murderers have been known to dote on tiny tots i hardly think hes a mass murderer sir and shes certainly not a tiny tot he looked speculatively at talbot a passing thought john yes talbot looked out through the window for an unseeing moment then back at hawkins how do we know hes not a mass murderer the speculation was still in hawkinss eyes you dont normally make remarks like that not without good reason you have something in mind i think i have but its so far back in my mind that i cant reach it itll come he turned as denholm entered the cabin i seem to recall having asked you this question before what drags you away from the fleshpots duty sir you will have noticed admiral talbot said how devoted the ariadnes officers are to their duty i thought jimmy that you were supposed to be lurking and eavesdropping i have lurked sir and eavesdropped i have also been plying mr andropulos and his friends with strong drink at this time of the morning hawkins said captains orders sir i hope captain that the admiralty are going to take care of my bar bill prodigious not as prodigious as their thirsts they have relaxed a bit they have apparently agreed that im simpleminded they are quite certain i dont know a word of greek but even so theyre still very cautious much given to allusions and cryptic references all made for good measure in a macedonian dialect which you learnt at your mothers knee a bit later than that but im at home in it i dont know whether you will consider this good news or bad sir but andropulos knows there are hydrogen bombs aboard that bomber he even knows there are fifteen of them there was a fairly lengthy silence while the other three men in the cabin considered the implications of denholms words then hawkins said good news and bad news good news for us bad news for andropulos well done my boy very well done i echo that sir talbot said lieutenant denholm is miscast as either a classicist or electronics officer mi should have him there is no way that andropulos could have learnt aboard the ariadne of the existence of those bombs so he knew before proof if that were needed of our nearcertain conviction that andropulos has penetrated the pentagon i would point out sir denholm said that the words hydrogen bombs werent actually used also its only my word against theirs thats irrelevant and this is no court of law there will be no confrontation all that matters is that we know and they dont know that we do my usefulness is over or do i continue to lurk lurk of course the three as must be making some contingency plans we know now why they wanted aboard the ariadne what we dont know is what they intend to do now that they are here resume your wassailing wassailing denholm sounded bitter i have an arrangement with jenkins whereby i consume copious quantities of tonic water lemon and ice ghastly he turned to go but talbot stopped him as a seaman entered and handed over a sheet of paper you might as well hear whats in this he studied the paper briefly this is in reply to a request we made of greek intelligence for as exhaustive a list as they could supply of all places where andropulos is known either to do business or have contacts no names no addresses just towns forty or fifty of them my my this list wasnt compiled on the spur of the moment greek intelligence must have been taking a more than passing interest in the activities of our friend andropulos over a long period years i would think i wonder why about half of those places are marked by asterisks again i wonder why was that for their own information or is it intended to suggest something to us he handed the paper to hawkins who studied it for a moment then said i know those places marked with an asterisk i dont see their relevance in our circumstances i cant even remotely associate them with our problem id swear that none of those places had any connection with hydrogen bombs so would i talbot said maybe they handle something else in spite of the situation we find ourselves in maybe hydrogen bombs arent the biggest cause for concern if you can imagine anything worse than our present situation that is could i have that back sir he sat at the desk made some marks on the paper before him then looked up bangkok islamabad kabul bogota miami mexico city tijuana san diego bahamas ocho rios ankara sofia andropulos playing both sides of the fence with those last two the ethnic turks are having a very bad time in bulgaria just now but andropulos wouldnt let that interfere with his business interests and amsterdam what does that list suggest drugs van gelder said drugs heroin cocaine marijuana you name it now some more towns tehran baghad andropulos again playing both sides of the fence iran and iraq had been at war for six years now tripoli damascus beirut athens rome east berlin new york and london that suggest something yes it was van gelder again terrorism im not quite sure why new york and london qualify i seem to remember there have been two attempts one at john f kennedy the other at heathrow to smuggle bombs aboard planes both bungled both failed i think its fairly safe to assume in fact it would be criminally negligent not to assume that the terrorists who planned those crimes are still in residence in london and new york waiting jimmy would you please go to your cabin and bring theodore here with whatever further results his cryptology has turned up hawkins said i most sincerely hope that you are not thinking what i think you are if you follow me it may be sir that i am thinking what you are if you follow me what you are suggesting is that this andropulos is some kind of mastermind possible world coordinator of drugsmuggling is that what you meant by your remark that we didnt know he wasnt a mass murderer yes sir what else can that list of contacts he has in drug areas mean where else has he accumulated his vast wealth and we havent added it all up yet not by any means theres no actual proof all depends on what you call proof its very powerful suggestive evidence how far are you prepared to stretch the long arm of coincidence to infinity and youre further suggesting hes engaged in terrorism that hes using his vast profits from drugsmuggling to finance his terrorist activities its possible but i dont think so i think the two activities are being run in tandem a drugpeddler is one thing a terrorist quite another incompatibles poles apart never the twain shall meet one hesitates to contradict a senior officer but im afraid youre wrong sir vincent would you enlighten the admiral you know what im talking about all too well sir october admiral our last submarine patrol north atlantic about two hundred miles west of the irish coast i can remember it as if it were yesterday we were asked to move into position to observe but not to intercept a small american ship en route from the states to ireland and given its course and estimated time when it would pass a certain point neither the crew of this vessel nor its captain a certain captain robert anderson who i believe is still at large knew that they had been monitored from the moment they had left port by an american spyinthe sky satellite we upped periscope identified it then downed periscope they never saw us it was a new england trawler the valhalla based on gloucester massachusetts from which it had sailed a few days earlier it transferred its cargo to an irish tug the marita ann which was duly seized by the irish navy the cargo consisted entirely of military hardware rifles machineguns shotguns pistols hand grenades rockets and as i recall about rounds of ammunition all destined for the ira it was to have been the iras biggest gunrunning plot ever but it was foiled because of what was called operation leprechaun where the cia our mi and irish intelligence took a healthy or unhealthy it all depends on your point of view interest in the activities of noraid an irishamerican group that specialized for all i know it may still be specializing in buying american arms and shipping them to the ira in ireland round about the same time a panamanian registered cargo ship by the name of the ramsland chartered by the same gang who had organized the valhalla put into boston harbour and was promptly seized by the united states coast guard the ramsland had secret compartments below decks but the coast guard knew all about those secret compartments they held no less than thirty tons of marijuana another smuggling record the proceeds from the sale of those drugs were of course intended to fund ira terrorist activities we became quite interested in the drugsterrorist connection talbot said and made some discreet enquiries at least five other drugterrorist connections had been discovered and broken up it is believed that considerably more connections have not been discovered and so not broken up why should andropulos be an exception to what appears to be a fairly well established rule a suitably chastened admiral sits before you hawkins said we live we learn you two should join denholm and offer your services to mi ah the man himself denholm entered the cabin with theodore who handed over to talbot some papers he had with him talbot looked at them and handed them over to hawkins well well well hawkins said what an interesting coincidence or in view of what ive just been learning perhaps not all that much of a coincidence fifteen of the towns that greek intelligence asterisked if thats the word on their list only in this case my my my they give names and addresses isnt that splendid captain a thought has occurred to me theres one of those towns marked with an asterisk that you omitted to mention washington dc does that come under d for drugs or t for terrorism neither b for bribery are you about through this list theodore twothirds i would say and that will be the end of it no captain theres still a last list it would be gratifying if it held some more revelations but perhaps that would be too much to hope for how long have you been up and around theodore three oclock this morning threethirty im not sure i was a bit fuzzy if i had known what would be required of me this morning i wouldnt have gone to that birthday celebration last night and its now noon or thereabouts seven hours of beating your brains out when you werent feeling all that hot to begin with you must be exhausted but i would appreciate it if you could at least finish this present list off after that jimmy i suggest that theodore has a drink snack and snooze in that order the two men left if you agree admiral i suggest that vincent contacts greek intelligence after theodore has finished that list and furnishes them with a list of the towns together with the appropriate names and addresses could help and what do you imagine greek intelligence can do very little i imagine but they can forward the list with utmost urgency to interpol admittedly interpols writ doesnt run worldwide they would have zero clout in places say like tripoli tehran or beirut and they are an information gathering and dispensing agency not an executive unit and they know more about bad people than any other group in the world and ask them if they suspect suspect not have proof that andropulos is engaged in drugrunning shall be done sir sign it admiral hawkins naturally hawkins shook his head admiral hawkins here admiral hawkins there it seems hes signing his name everywhere or rather somebodys signing it for him i shall have to look to my chequebooks chapter i the heavy steel derrick projected upwards and outwards from the midships side of the kilcharran at an angle of about thirty degrees off the vertical from the winch at the foot of the derrick the hawser rose upwards through the pulley at the top of the derrick and then descended vertically into the sea the lower end of the hawser was attached to a heavy metal ring which was distanced about twenty feet above the fuselage of the sunken plane from the ring two shorter cables bartaut were attached to the two lifting slings that had been attached fore and aft to the nose and tail of the bomber the winch turned with what seemed to most watchers an agonizing and frustrating slowness there was ample electrical power available to have revolved the drum several times as quickly but captain montgomery was in no hurry standing there by the winch he exhibited about as much anxiety and tension as a man sitting with his eyes closed in a garden deckchair on a summers afternoon although it was difficult to visualize it was possible that a sling could have loosened and slipped and montgomery preferred not to think what might happen if the plane should slip and strike heavily against the bottom so he just stood patiently there personally guiding the winchs control wheel while he listened with clamped earphones to the two divers who were accompanying the plane on its ten foot a minute ascent after about five minutes the grotesque shape of the plane grotesque because of the missing left wing could be dimly discerned through the now slightly windruffled surface of the sea another three minutes and the lifting ring came clear of the water montgomery centred the winch wheel applied the brake went to the gunwale looked over the rail and turned to the officer by his side too close in fuselage is going to snag on the underside have to distance it a bit more fenders fore and aft the side of the kilcharran was already festooned with rubberized fenders and lay out ropes to secure the nose and tail of the plane he returned to the winch eased forward on a lever and slowly lowered the derrick until it was projecting outwards from the ships side at an angle of forty degrees above the horizontal the plane which could now be clearly seen only twenty feet below the surface moved sluggishly outwards from the ships side montgomery started up the winch again and soon the top of the planes fuselage broke the surface he stopped the winch when the top eighteen inches was clear the starboard wing was still beneath the surface montgomery turned to admiral hawkins so far a simple and elementary exercise with luck the rest of it should be equally straightforward we cut away the appropriate section on the top of the fuselage while attaching more flotation bags to the undersides of the fuselage and the wing and inflating those then well lift a bit more until the fuselage is almost clear of the water and go inside he lifted a ringing phone thanked the caller and replaced the receiver well perhaps not quite so straightforward it would appear that the timing device has stopped ticking has it now hawkins didnt look particularly concerned and certainly not upset it could have happened at a better time and a better place but it had to happen so our friend is armed indeed still no reason why we shouldnt go ahead as planned especially as we have no option every person on both ships to be warned no mechanical devices to be used no banging or crashing everyone on fairy tiptoes they already know that of course but i imagine theyll now redouble their caution a gangway had been lowered down the ships side until one of its feet rested on the planes fuselage carrington and grant descended and ran a tapemeasure back along the top of the fuselage from the cockpit the internal distance from the cockpit to the exact location of the bomb had already been measured to the corresponding area above this they mopped dry with engineroom waste and then proceeded to paint the outline of a black rectangle to guide the two men with the oxyacetylene cutters who were already standing by hawkins said how long will this take i can only guess montgomery said an hour maybe a bit longer we dont know how thick the fuselage skin is or how tough it is we dont know how thick or tough the lateral reinforcing members are what i do know is that were going to cut with the lowest possible flame that will do the job even with that reduced power were going to generate a fair amount of heat in the airspace and water below it goes without saying that no one has ever done this sort of thing before will your standing here supervising operations just looking on rather help things along resolve the unknown i mean not a bit of it ah lunch whether were here or in the wardroom of the ariadne its not going to make all that difference if this lot goes up true true a millisecond here a millisecond there the condemned man ate a hearty breakfast in our case lunch lunch while hardly festive was by no means the doomladen affair it could have been in view of the fact that most of the people at table were well aware that they were sitting on top of a timebomb that had now ceased to tick conversation flowed freely but in no way resembled the compulsive nervous chatter of those conscious of being under stress professor wotherspoon spoke freely and often on any subject that arose not through garrulity but because he was a born conversationalist who loved discussion and the free exchange of ideas andropulos too was far from silent although he appeared to have only one idea in mind and that was the mystery of the bomber that had just been raised from the depths he had not been invited aboard the kilcharran but had seen well enough from the ariadne what had been going on he appeared to be deeply and understandably interested in what had happened and was going to happen to the bomber but was clever enough not to ask any penetrating questions or say a word that he knew anything whatever about what was going on across the table talbot caught the eye of admiral hawkins who nodded almost imperceptibly it was clear that they couldnt keep him completely and totally in the dark up to now mr andropulos talbot said we have not told you everything we know we have not been remiss and no apology for our silence is necessary our sole concern i can assure you was not to cause unnecessary alarm and apprehension especially to your two young ladies but a man like you must have a keen interest in international affairs and you are after all a greek and member of nato and have a right to know no one could have guessed from talbots openness and relaxed tone that he considered andropulos to have a keen interest in international crime that he didnt give a damn about either greece or nato and had a right to know only what he talbot chose to tell him the plane was an american bomber and was carrying a lethal cargo among them hydrogen and atomic bombs almost certainly for a nato missile base somewhere in greece andropuloss expression at first stunned rapidly changed to grimfaced understanding we can only guess at what caused the crash it could have been an engine explosion on the other hand it could have been carrying a variety of weapons and one of them obviously of the nonnuclear variety may have malfunctioned we dont know we have no means of telling and probably almost certainly we will never know the crew of course died andropulos shook his head the clear innocent eyes were deeply tinged with sadness dear god what a tragedy what a tragedy he paused and considered but there are terrorists in this world he spoke of terrorists as if they were alien beings from an alien planet i know this sounds unthinkable but could this have been a case of sabotage impossible this plane flew from a top secret air force base where security would have been absolute carelessness there may have been but the idea of the deliberate implantation of any explosive device passes belief it can only be classified as an act of god i wish i shared your trust in our fellowman andropulos shook his head again there are no depths which some inhuman monsters would not plumb but if you say it was physically impossible then i accept that and gladly for i would not care to be counted as a member of a human race ъ that could proceed to such unspeakable lengths whats past is past i suppose but theres also a future what happens next commander before we decide on that well have to wait until we get inside the plane i understand that impacts and explosions such as those nuclear weapons have experienced can have what shall we say a very disturbing effect on their delicate firing control systems you or some member of your crew have the expertise to pass judgement on such matters neither i nor my crew know anything about such matters defence will have a plane standing by when the concorde lands if its estimated time of arrival is reasonably accurate we should have this krytron device in santorini about threethirty even allowing for the fact that your men will have to row to and from at least cape akrotiri we should have the device aboard by five pm theres an even chance that the messages to the fbi and the washington bank may produce some positive results as to the news that the mine is armed we shall await the presidential reaction with interest send these at once you have some other matters on your mind captain urgent i take it as you said yourself not so long ago sir time is cm the wing questions sir and wed better try to find some answers quickly why was andropulos so restrained in his questioning about the bombers because apart from that ticking time device he already knew everything there was to know and saw no point in asking questions when he already held the answers why did he express no surprise at dr wickram here just happening to be aboard at this critical juncture even the most innocent of people would have thought it the most extraordinary coincidence that dr wickram should be here at the moment when he was most needed and would have said so whats going to pass through that crafty and calculating mind when he sees us hauling that atom bomb out of the fuselage always providing we do of course and what are we going to do to satisfy his curiosity i can answer your last two questions and explain my presence here wickram said ive had time to think although to be honest it didnt require all that much thought you heard that the planehad hydrogen bombs aboard you didnt know what the degree of danger was so you called in the resident expert thats me the resident expert informs you there is a high degree of danger theres no way to prevent a slow but continuous degree of radioactive emanations from a hydrogen bomb and there are fifteen of those aboard that plane this radioactivity builds up inside the atom bomb which is of an entirely different construction until the critical stage is reached then its goodnight all all a question of mass really this really happens how the hell should i know ive just invented it but it sounds scientific enough and more than vaguely plausible your average citizen has a zero knowledge level of nuclear weaponry who is going to dream of questioning the word of a worldfamous nuclear physicist which in case youve forgotten commander talbots words is me talbot smiled i wouldnt dream of it dr wickram excellent next query what are andropuloss code lists doing aboard the ariadne well to start with hawkins said you put them there no need for massive restraint captain you had something else in mind wrong question why did he leave them behind he forgot not likely not something as important as that because he thought theyd never be found possible but again not likely because he thought that if anyone found them then it would be unlikely that that person would recognize it as a code or try to decode it rather more likely but i think the real reason is that he thought it would be too dangerous to bring them aboard the ariadne the very fact that that was the only item he chose to salvage from the wreck would have been significant and suspicious in itself so he elected to leave them behind and recover them later by diving he may always have had this possibility in his mind and if he did he wouldnt have left them in a cardboard folder so he chose a waterproof metal box recovery of the box from the bottom of the sea would mean the presence or availability of a diving ship just a hunch i think that the delos was sunk by accident and not by design probably andropulos never visualized the need of a diving ship for that purpose but a convenient diving ship would have been useful for other purposes such as dare i suggest the recovery of nuclear weapons from a sunken bomber they whoever they are wouldnt have brought it down anywhere in the sea of crete thats the area between the peloponnese in the west the dodecanese in the east the cyclades in the north and crete to the south because by far the greater part of that area is between and feet much too deep for recovery by diving maybe it was meant to bring it down where it was brought down maybe this hypothetical diving ship was meant to be where we inconveniently were its a long shot hawkins said but no stone unturned is that it what you would like to know is whether there is any diving ship based in those parts or temporarily located or cruising by isnt that it talbot nodded finding out is no problem heraklion in crete of course the us air force base there is our main centre for electronic surveillance in those parts they use awacs and other highflying radar planes to monitor soviet libyan and other countries military movements the greek air force use their phantoms and mirages for the same purpose i know the base commander rather well an immediate signal theyll either find out in very short order or have the information already a couple of hours should do it i speak in no spirit of complaint captain montgomery said to talbot his voice in fact held a marked note of complaint but i think we might have been spared this he indicated a bank of heavy dark cloud approaching from the northwest the winds already force and were beginning to rock a bit travel agents wouldnt like this at all this is supposed to be a golden summers day in the golden aegean force isnt uncommon here in the afternoons even at this time of year rain is most unusual but it looks as if were going to have quite a lot of the unusual in the very near future weather forecast is poor and the barometer unhappy talbot looked over the rail of the kilcharran and this is what makes you unhappy montgomerys ship was not in fact rocking at all headed directly northwest into the gentle threefoot swell it was quite motionless which couldnt be said for the plane lashed alongside because of its much shorter length and the fact that it was ninetenths submerged it was reacting quite badly to the swell pitching rather noticeably to and fro and snubbing alternately on the ropes that secured its nose and the remnants of its tail to the kilcharran cutting the metal and maintaining balance was becoming increasingly difficult for the oxyacetylene team on top of the fuselage as the tops of the swells periodically washed over the area on which they were working they had already reached the stage where they were spending more time looking after their own safety than using their torches not so much unhappy as annoyed their rate of progress has been reduced to almost zero and god knows they were moving slowly enough even in good conditions that fuselage and especially the transverse members are proving much tougher than expected if things dont improve and looking at that weather coming at us im sure they wont im going to have to withdraw the cutters theyre in no danger of course but the plane might very well be we have no way of knowing how weakened the nose or tail may be and i dont care to imagine what will happen if one of them comes off so youre going to float it astern on a single towrope i dont see i have any option ill build a cradle of ropes round the nose and wing of the plane attach a single rope a heavy one to act as a spring to it and let it drift a cable length astern have to inform the admiral first no need he never interferes with an expert an unpleasant thought occurs captain what happens if it breaks loose send a boat out rowing of course to secure it with an anchor and if that goes we puncture the flotation bags and sink it cant have it drifting all over the shop ready to blow the whole works whenever the first ships engines come within auditory range and if it sinks where it is we of course wont be able to move from here you cant have everything agreed hawkins said montgomerys got no option when is he starting any moment perhaps you might have a word with him i said that there was no question but that you would agree but i think hed like your sayso of course hawkins said whats your weather forecast deteriorating any word from the washington bank the fbi or heraklion nothing just a lot of unsolicited rubbish from diverse heads of states presidents premiers and so forth commiserating with us in one breath and asking us why we arent doing something about it in the second breath one wonders how the news has been leaked i dont know sir whats more i really dont care nor i he waved to some papers on his desk want to read them they dont know that the tick tick has stopped i dont want to read them i didnt think you would whats next for you john i didnt have much sleep last night its quite possible i may lack some tonight nows the time nothing i can do an excellent idea same for me when i come back from the kilcharran when talbot emerged from his day cabin and passed through to the bridge shortly after six oclock in the evening it should still have been broad daylight but so low was the level of light in the sky that it could well have been late twilight he found van gelder and denholm waiting for him in this weather talbot said i could almost say well watchmen what of the night everything running smoothly and under control while drake was in his hammock we have not been idle van gelder said neither has captain montgomery hes got the bomber strung out about a cable length to the southeast riding quite badly its either a force or out there but it seems to be holding together hes got a searchlight well a sixinch signalling lamp on it either to check that it doesnt break away or to discourage the disaffected from snaffling it although why there should be anyone around or daft enough to try that i cant imagine id advise against going out on the wing to have a look sir you might get washed away van gelders advice was superfluous the rain falling from the black and leaden skies was of the torrential or tropical downpour variety the heavy warm drops rebounding six inches from the deck i take your point he looked at the brown metal box lying on the deck whats that voila denholm seized the handle let into the top and swept off the cover with all the panache of a stage magician unveiling his latest impossible trick the piece de resistance what was presumably the control panel on the top of the box was singularly unimpressive and oldfashioned reminiscent of a prewar radio with two calibrated dials some knobs a pressbutton and two orange hemispherical glass domes let into the surface the krytron i assume talbot said no less three cheers for presidents this particular one has been as good as his word excellent really excellent lets only hope we get the chance to use it under let us say optimal circumstances optimal is the word denholm said very simple device as far as operating it is concerned that is inside its probably fiendishly complicated this particular model there may be others runs off a twentyfour volt battery he placed his forefinger on a button i depress this and hey presto if youre trying to make me nervous jimmy youre succeeding take your finger off that damned button denholm depressed it several times no battery we supply that no problem and under those two orange domes are two switches that have to be rotated through degrees specially designed you see for careless clowns like me as an added precaution you cant unscrew those domes one sharp tap with a light metal object the instructions say and they disintegrate again i should imagine designed with people like me in mind in case we remove the tops and start twiddling the switches around designed if you follow me to be a oneoff operation the only time those switches will ever be exposed is immediately before the firing button is depressed when are you going to attach the battery as an added precaution this is my precaution only immediately before use these are positive and negative connections we use springloaded crocodile clips two seconds to attach the clips three seconds to crack the domes and align the switches one second to press the button nothing could be simpler only one other trifling requirement sir that we have that atom bomb on its own and a long long way from anywhere and us at a very prudent distance when we detonate it you ask for very little jimmy talbot looked out at the driving rain and the dark and now whitecapped seas we nay have to wait a little an hour or two as an optimistic guess all night as a pessimistic one before we can even begino move anything else i repeat we have not been idle van gelder said weve heard from the heraklion air base there is or was a living vessel in the near vicinity if you can call the western tip of crete the near vicinity is or was was it was anchored off souda bay for a couple of days and apparently took off about one am this morning as you know souda bay is a very hushhush greek naval base and the area is very protected very restricted foreign vessels even harmless cruising yachts are definitely not welcomed souda bay naturally took an interest in this lad its their business to re suspicious especially at a time when nato are operating a the area what did they find out precious little it was called the taormina and registered in panama a sicilian name no significance panama a convenience registry some of the most successful oceangoing crooks inhe world are registered there anyway you dont have to be in artist to change both names in very short order all you require is a couple of pots of paint and a set of stencils where had it come from they didnt know as it had anchored offshore it didnt nave to register with either the customs or the port authorities but they did know that it took off in a roughly northeasterly direction which just coincidentally is the course it would lave taken if it were heading for santorini and as souda bay is just under a hundred miles from here even a slow ship he could have been in this area well before the bomber came down so your hunch could have been right sir only problem is weve seen no sign of him could have been a coincidence could have been that the delos warned him off did heraklion say anything about going to have a look for this ship no jimmy and i discussed the idea but we didnt think it important enough to disturb you when you were ah resting lightly and the admiral probably unimportant we should have a go normally that is where does heraklion lie from here about due south near enough a couple of planes one carrying out a sweep to the north the other to the east should locate this lad if he is in the area in half an hour probably less part of an urgent nato exercise you understand but conditions arent normal a waste of time in near zero visibility an option well keep in mind for better weather anything else yes weve heard from both the washington bank and the fbi mixed results you might say under the initials of kk the bank says it has a certain kyriakos katzanevakis promising you could hardly get anything more grecian than that under tt they have a thomas thompson you cant have anything more anglosaxon than that the fbi say there are no highranking officers in the pentagon by which i take it they mean admirals and air force generals or at the outside viceadmirals and lieutenantgenerals with those initials on the face of it disappointing but it may equally well be just another step in the laundering coverup another step to distance themselves from their paymaster the fbi hasnt been in touch with the bank of course not we didnt even mention the bank to them remiss of us no remiss of me montgomery sipped his drink gazed gloomily through his cabin window winced and looked away the weather has deteriorated in the past halfhour commander talbot it couldnt possibly be any worse than it was half an hour ago im an expert on such matters montgomery sighed makes me quite homesick for the mountains of mourne we get a lot of rainfall in the mountains of mourne do you see this lot clearing up in the near future not this side of midnight and that would be an optimistic estimate im thinking by the time we haul this damn bomber back alongside cut away the hole in the fuselage hoist it out of the water and extract that bomb itll be dawn at least might possibly be well into the forenoon youll understand if i turn down your kind offer to join you for dinner an early snack for me then bed might have to get up any time during the night ill have a couple of boys on the poop all night watching the plane and with orders to wake me as soon as they think the weather has moderated enough for us to start hauling it in dr wickram said hows that for a brief resume of the speech i shall so reluctantly make at the table tonight not too much i would have thought and not too little perfect perhaps the tone a thought more doomladen a half octave deeper you think odd isnt it how easily this mendacity comes to one aboard the ariadne its become positively endemic very catching ive just had a word with eugenia denholm said i thought you ought to know that youve been neglecting your duty not lurking i mean a man gets tired of lurking i meant what she had to say you spoke to her privately i take it yes sir in her cabin number ones cabin that is to say you surprise me jimmy if i may say so sir with some dignity we had been discussing matters on a purely intellectual level very bright girl going for a double first at university language and literature greek ancient and modern ah deep calling unto deep i wouldnt call it that because i spoke only in english i was under the impression that she was convinced that i didnt speak a word of greek shes no longer convinced a close observer the young lady perhaps you registered a flicker of expression when something was said in greek when you should have registered nothing i suspect you were trapped in your innocent youth by some fiendish feminine wile how would you react sir if you were told that a scorpion was crawling up your shoe talbot smiled she spoke in greek of course you immediately carried out a hurried check to locate this loathsome monster anybody would have fallen for it you have not suffered too much chagrin and mortification i hope not really sir shes too nice and too worried wanted to confide in me alas the days when lovely young ladies wanted to confide in me appear to be over i think shes a little scared of you sir so is irene she wanted to talk about andropulos girl talk of course and i suppose theres no one else really on the ship they can talk to thats not quite fair i suppose theyre clearly very close friends seems that irene repeated to her more or less verbatim the conversation she had with number one this morning and told her shed told vincent everything she knew about her uncle adam it would appear that eugenia knows something about uncle adam that his niece doesnt know may i have a drink sir ive been awash since dawn in tonic and lemon help yourself revelations is that it i dont know how youd classify it sir but i know youll find it very interesting eugenias father has quite a lot in common with irenes father apparently theyre good friends theyre both wealthy businessmen they both know andropulos and both think hes a crook well nothing new in that so far we all think hes a crook but eugenias father unlike irenes is willing to talk freely and at length about andropulos and eugenia hasnt talked about it to irene because she doesnt wish to hurt her feelings denholm sampled his drink and sighed in satisfaction it would seem that adamantios soyros andropulos has a pathological hatred of americans who would suspect such a charming courteous urbane and civilized gentleman to have a pathological hatred of anyone i would well we all know hes intelligent so he had to rave a reason he had two his son and only nephew apparently he doted on them eugenia quite believes this because she says that andropulos is unquestionably fond of irene and herself a feeling im glad to say that they dont reciprocate what about his son and nephew disappeared in most mysterious circumstances never to be seen again andropulos is convinced that they were done in by the american cia the cia has a reputation justified or not for eliminating people they regard as undesirables but they usually have a reason again whether that is justifiable or not does eugenias old man know the reason yes he says and hes convinced of this that the two young men were heroin peddlers well well ties in all too well with what we have been increasingly suspecting there are times jimmy when i regard the cia as being a much maligned lot the atmosphere at the dinner table that night was noticeably but not markedly less relaxed than it had been at lunchtime conversation flowed rather less freely than it had then and three men in particular hawkins talbot and van gelder seemed more given than usual to brief and introspective silences occasionally gazing at some object or objects that lay beyond a distant horizon there was nothing that one could put a finger on and the insensitive would quite have failed to recognize that there was anything amiss andropulos proved that he was not one of those i do not wish to pry gentlemen and i may be quite wrong i frequently am but do i not detect a certain aura of uneasiness even of tension at the table tonight his smile was as open and ingenuous as his words had been frank and candid or is it my imagination you are surprised perhaps commander talbot no not really the only thing that surprised talbot was that andropulos had taken so long in getting around to it you are very perceptive mr andropulos im rather disappointed i must say i thought or hoped that our concern was better concealed than that concern captain to a slight degree only no real anxiety yet no reason in world why you shouldnt know as much as we do as wickram had said talbot reflected mendacity required s practice to become second nature there was every reason the world why andropulos should not know as much as he did you know of course that the bad weather has forced us to suspend operations on the bomber i have seen that it is riding several hundred metres astern of us operations what operations captain you are trying to recover those wicked weapons just one of them an atom bomb why only one dr wickram would you kindly explain certainly well as far as i can what we have here is a situation of considerable complexity and doubt because we are dealing largely with the unknown you will be aware that a nuclear explosion occurs when a critical mass of uranium plutonium is reached now theres no way to prevent a slow but continuous degree of radioactive emanations from a hydrogen bomb and there are fifteen of them aboard that pane this radioactivity builds up inside the atom bomb which is of an entirely different construction until the critical mass of the atom bomb is reached then the atom bomb goes poof unfortunately because of something we call sympathetic detonation the hydrogen bombs also go poof i will not dwell on what will happen to us normally because of this wellknown danger hydrogen bombs and atom bombs are never stored together not at east for any period of time twentyfour hours is regarded as a safe period and a plane as in this instance can easily make a longdistance flight with them together at the end of which of course they would immediately be stored separately what happens after twentyfour hours we simply dont know although some of us i am one believe that the situation deteriorates very rapidly thereafter incidentally thats why i have asked the captain to stop all engines and generators it is an established fact that acoustical vibrations hasten the onset of the critical period wickrams deep solemn and authoritative voice carried absolute conviction had he not known talbot thought that dr wickram was talking scientific malarkey he for one would have believed every word he said so you will readily appreciate that it is of the utmost urgency that we remove that atom bomb from the plane as soon as possible and then take it away by sail of course thats why the angelina is alongside the critical mass will decay only very slowly to some distant spot some very distant spot there we will deposit it gently on the ocean floor how will you do that andropulos said deposit it gently i mean the ocean could be thousands of feet deep at the spot wouldnt the bomb accelerate all the way down wickram smiled tolerantly i have discussed the matter with captain montgomery of the kilcharran he had not in fact discussed the matter with anybody we attach a flotation bag to the bomb inflate it until it achieves a very slight negative buoyancy and then it will float down like a feather to the ocean floor and then and then nothing if wickram were having visions of a passenger cruise liner passing over an armed atomic mine he kept his visions to himself it will decay and corrode slowly over the years perhaps even over the centuries may give rise to a few digestive upsets for some passing fish i dont know what i do know is that if we dont get rid of that damned beast with all dispatch were going to suffer more than a few digestive problems better that some of us those concerned with the recovery of the bomb have a sleepless night than that we all sleep forever chapter talbot stirred half sat up in his bunk and blinked at the overhead light that had suddenly come on in his day cabin van gelder was standing in the doorway twothirty an unchristian hour vincent something is afoot weather moderated and captain montgomery hauling in the plane yes sir but theres something more immediately urgent jenkins is missing talbot swung his feet to the deck jenkins i wont say missing or how can he be missing if you say he is he is youve had a search carried out of course of course forty volunteers you know how popular jenkins is talbot knew jenkins their mess steward and a marine of fifteen years standing a man whose calmness efficiency and resource were matched only by his sense of humour was highly regarded by everyone who knew him can brown cast any light on this marine sergeant brown a man as rocklike and solid as chief mckenzie was jenkinss closest friend on the ship both men were in the habit of having a tipple in the pantry when the days work was done an illicit practice which talbot tacitly and readily condoned their tipple invariably stopped at that just that even in the elite royal marines it would have been difficult to find two men like them nothing sir they went down to their mess together brown turned in while jenkins started on a letter to his wife that was the last brown saw of him who discovered his absence carter the masteratarms you know how he likes to prowl around at odd hours of the day and night looking for nonexistent crime he went up to the wardroom and pantry found nothing returned to the marine messdeck and woke brown they carried out a brief search again nothing then they came to me it would be pointless to ask you if you have any ideas pointless brown seems convinced hes no longer aboard the ship he says that jenkins never sleepwalked drank only sparingly and was devoted to his wife and two daughters he had no problems brown is certain of that and no enemies aboard the ship well among the crew that is brown s further convinced that jenkins stumbled across sometiling he shouldnt have or saw something he shouldnt have seen although how he could do anything like that while sitting in the mess writing to his wife is difficult to imagine his suspicions immediately centred on andropulos and company i gather he and jenkins have talked quite a lot about them and he was all for going down to andropuloss cabin and beating the living daylights out of him i had some difficulty in restraining him although privately i must say j found it rather an appealing prospect an understandable reaction on his part talbot paused i cant see how andropulos or his friends could have any possible connection with this or have any conceivable reason for knocking him off do you think theres a remote chance that he might have gone aboard the kilcharran no earthly reason why he should have but the thought did occur i asked danforth hes the kilcharrans chief officer if hed have a look around so he collected some of his crew and carried out a search there arent many places you can hide or be hidden on a diving ship took them less than ten minutes to be sure he wasnt anywhere aboard nothing we can do at the moment i have the uncomfortable feeling that theres nothing were going to be able to do either lets go and see how captain montgomery is getting on the wind had dropped to force the sea was no more than choppy and the rain had eased but only slightly from torrential to heavy montgomery clad in streaming oilskins was at the winch the plane still bobbing rather uncomfortably was slowly but steadily nearing the stern of the diving ship the oxyacetylene crew also in oilskins were standing by the guardrail torches at the ready talbot said your men are going to be able to maintain their footing it wont be easy the plane should steady up a bit when we secure it fore and aft and well have ropes on the men of course and this confounded rain doesnt help i think we should be able to make some progress but itll be slow point is this may be as good weather as were going to get no point in your remaining commander youd be better off in your bunk ill let you know when weve cut away the section and are ready to lift he wiped rain away from his eyes i hear youve lost your chief steward bloody odd isnt it do you suspect foul play im at the stage where im about ready to suspect anything or anybody van gelder and i are agreed that it couldnt have happened accidentally so it must have happened on purpose and not of course his purpose yes foul play as to what kind of foul play and the identity of the person or persons responsible we dont have a clue it should have been dawn but wasnt when van gelder roused talbot shortly after sixthirty in the morning the sky was still heavy and dark and neither the wind nor the steadily drumming rain had improved in the past four hours so much for your breathless aegean dawns talbot said i take it that captain montgomery has cut away that section of the planes fuselage forty minutes ago hes got the fuselage more than half way out of the water already how are the winch and the derrick taking the strain very little strain i believe hes secured four more flotation bags under the fuselage and wing and is letting compressed air do most of the work he asks if youd like to come along oh and weve had a communication from greek intelligence about andropulos you dont seem very excited about it im not interesting but doesnt really help us it just confirms that our suspicions about uncle adam are far from groundless theyve passed on our messages to interpol it seems the message i must say is couched in very guarded language that both greek intelligence and interpol have been taking a considerable interest in andropulos for several years both are certain that our friend is engaged in highly illegal activities but if this was a trial in a scottish court of law the verdict would be not proven they have no hard evidence andropulos acts through intermediaries who operate though other intermediaries and so on until either the trail runs cold or occasionally ends up in shell companies in panama and the bahamas where much of his money is stashed away the banks there consistently refuse to acknowledge letters and cables in fact they wont even acknowledge his existence no cooperation from the swiss banks either theyll only open up their books if the depositor has been convicted of what is also regarded as a crime in switzerland he hasnt been convicted of anything illegal activities what illegal activities drugs message ends with a request sounds more like a demand the way they put it that this information be treated in total secrecy utter and absolute confidentiality words to that effect what information they havent given us any information that we didnt already suspect or have no mention of the one item of information wed like to know who either in the government the civil service or the top echelons in the armed forces is andropuloss powerful protector and friend possibly they dont know more probably they dont want us to know nothing from washington not a word maybe the fbi dont work at night more likely that other people dont work at night its eleventhirty pm their time the banks are shut and all the staffs to hell and gone until tomorrow morning we may have to wait hours before we hear anything were nearly there captain montgomery said well stop hoisting in this case more lifting from below than hoisting when the waterlevel drops below the floor of the cabin that way we wont get our feet wet when we go inside talbot looked over the side to where a man torch in his hand pointing downwards sat with his legs dangling through the rectangular hole that had been cut in the fuselage were going to get a lot more than our feet wet before we get there weve got to pass first through the compartment under the flight deck and that will still have a great deal of water in it i dont understand montgomery said i mean we dont have to we just drop down through the hole weve made in the fuselage thats fine if all we want to do is to confine ourselves to the cargo hold but you cant get into the flight deck from there theres a heavy steel door in the bulkhead and the clamps are secured on the forard side so if we want to get at those clamps you have to do it from the flightdeck side and to do that you must pass through the flooded compartment first why should we want to open that door at all because the clamps holding the atom bomb in place have padlocks where is one of the first places youd look if you were searching for a key to the padlocks ah of course the pockets of the dead men enough captain the man on the fuselage called out decks clear montgomery centred the winch and applied the brake then checked the fore and aft securing ropes when he had them adjusted to his satisfaction he said wont be long gentleman just going to have a firsthand look van gelder and i are coming with you weve brought our suits talbot checked the level of the top of the jagged hole in the nose cone relative to the surface of the sea i dont think well be needing our helmets they did not as it proved require their helmets the compartment under the flightdeck was no more than twothirds full they moved along to the opened hatch and hauled themselves up into the space behind the pilots seats montgomery looked at the two dead men and screwed his ryes momentarily shut what a bloody awful mess and to think that the fiend responsible is still walking around free as air i dont think he will be for much longer but youve said yourself you dont have the evidence to convict him andropulos will never come to trial vincent would you bang open that door and show captain montgomery where our friend is no banging maybe our friend doesnt like banging van gelder produced a large stilson wrench persuasion arent you coming sir in a moment they left and talbot addressed himself to the highly distasteful task of searching through the dead mens pockets he found nothing he searched through every shelf locker and compartment in the cockpit again nothing he moved aft and joined montgomery and van gelder nothing sir nothing and nothing i can find anywhere in the flightdeck montgomery grimaced you were of course looking through the pockets of the dead men sooner you than me this is a very big plane the key if there ever was a key could have been tucked away anywhere i dont give much for our chances of recovering it so other methods your number one suggests a corrosive to cut through those clamps wouldnt it be easier just to use an oldfashioned hacksaw i wouldnt recommend it sir van gelder said if you were to try id rather be a couple of hundred miles away at the time i dont know how intelligent this armed listening device is but i would question whether its clever enough to tell the difference between the rhythmic rasping of a hacksaw and the pulse of an engine i agree with vincent talbot said even if it were only a one in ten thousand chance and for all we know it might be a one in one chance the risk still isnt worth taking lady luck has been riding with us so far but she might take a poor view of our pushing her too far so corrosives you think i have my doubts montgomery stopped to examine the clamps more closely i should have carried out some preliminary test aboard i suppose but i never thought those clamps would be so thick nor made as i suspect they are of hardened steel the only corrosive i have aboard is sulphuric acid neat sulphuric hso at specific gravity vitriol if you like is a highly corrosive agent when applied to most substances which is why it is usually carried in glass carboys which are immune to the corrosive action of acids but i think it would find this a very meal to digest patience and diligence of course and i sure it would do the trick but it might take hours talbot said what do you think vincent im no expert i should imagine captain montgomery is quite correct so no corrosives no hacksaws no oxyacetylene ches van gelder hoisted the big stilson in his hand this talbot looked at the clamps and their mountings then added of course that were not very bright are we at least im not he looked at the way the clamps were secured to the side of the fuselage and the floor each of the bases of four retaining arms of the clamps was fitted over two ts and were held in place by heavy inchandahalf nuts we leave the clamps in situ and free the bases instead see how stiff those nuts are will you van gelder applied the stilson to one of the nuts adjusted the grip and heaved the nut was big and tightly jammed in position but a stilson wrench affords great leverage the nut turned easily simple van gelder said indeed talbot looked at the length of the retaining arms which projected at ninety degrees from each other then aged the width of the hole that had been cut overhead thats not so simple is getting the bomb up through the with those arms in position theres just not enough clearance for it to go through well have to widen the hole you can do that captain no bother just means that well have to lower the fuselage down to its previous position im coming around to van elders view about taking zero chances i want as much water as possible in this compartment to dissipate the heat the torches itll take a couple of hours maybe longer to complete the job but better two or three hours late down here than twenty years early youknowwhere van gelder said do i undo those nuts now no were stable enough at the moment but if the fuselage returns to its previous position of being almost submerged and then the weather blows up well i dont think it would be a very clever idea to have an armed atomic mine rolling about all over the shop i dont think so either talbot and van gelder were back aboard the ariadne and having coffee in the deserted wardroom when a seaman from the radioroom entered and handed talbot a message talbot read it and handed it to van gelder who read it twice then looked at his captain with a certain thoughtful surprise looks as if i have been casting unjust aspersions on the fbi sir it further looks as if they do work at night even better it seems as if they have no compunction about waking others such as bank managers in the middle of the night and making them work also one gathers from the message that andropuloss mysterious friend george skepertzis does know the even more mysterious kyriakos katzanevakis and thomas thompson if gs deposits one million dollars each in the accounts o kk and tt and has given them smaller sums on previous occasions one gathers that they are more than passing acquaintances unfortunately it seems that the one person who could identify them the bank clerk who handled the accounts of all three men had been transferred elsewhere they say that they are pursuing enquiries whatever that means it means im certain that the fbi are going to drag this unfortunate bank clerk from his bed and have him conduct an identity parade i find it hard somehowto visualize generals and admirals voluntarily consenting to line up for inspection they wont have to the fbi or the pentagon itself is bound to have pictures of them talbot looked out of the window dawn is definitely in the sky and the rain has eased off to no more than a drizzle i suggest we contact heraklion air base and ask them if theyll kindly go and have a look for the diving ship taormina together with the admiral and the two scientists talbot and van gelder were just finishing breakfast when a messenger arrived from the kilcharran captain montgomery he informed them had just finished enlarging the opening on the sop of the bombers fuselage was now about to raise the plane again would they care to come across he had made especial mention of lieutenantcommander van gelder its not me he wants van gelder said its my trusty stilson wrench as if he doesnt have a dozen aboard i wouldnt miss this hawkins said he looked at benson and wickram im sure you gentlemen wouldnt want to miss this either it will after all be a historic moment when for the first time in history they drop a live atomic mine on the deck of a ship you have a problem captain montgomery the admiral asked montgomery winch stopped was leaning over the guardrail and looking down at the fuselage which had been raised to its previous position with its cargo deck just above die level of the sea you look a mite despondent i am not looking despondent admiral i am looking thoughtful the next step is to hoist the bomb from the plane after that we have to load it aboard the angelina and then the angelina sails away correct hawkins nodded and montgomery wet his forefinger and held it up to sail away you require wind unfortunately and most inconveniently the mekemi has died completely it has hasnt it hawkins said most inconsiderate i must say well if we manage to get the bomb aboard the angelina without blowing ourselves to smithereens well just tow it away how will we do that sir van gelder said the ariadnes whaler not the engine of course we row how do we know that the cunning little brain of this explosive device can differentiate between the repeated creaking of oars and the pulse of an engine after all sir it is primarily an acoustic device then well go back to the naval days of yore muffled oars but the angelina displaces between eighty and a hundred tons sir even with the best will and the strongest backs in the world it wouldnt be possible to make as much as one nautical mile in an hour and thats with men continuously pulling with all their strength even the strongest fittest and most highly trained racing crews oxford cambridge thames tideway approach complete exhaustion after twenty minutes not being oxbridge blues our limit would probably be nearer ten minutes half a nautical mile if were lucky and then of course the periods between successive onsets of exhaustion would become progressively shorter cumulative effects if you follow me sir a quarter of a mile an hour its close on a hundred miles to the kasos strait even assuming they can row night and day which they cant and discounting the possibility of heart attacks its going to take them at least a fortnight to get to the kasos strait when it comes to comfort and encouragement hawkins said i couldnt ask for a better man to have around bubbling over with optimism professor wotherspoon you live and sail in these parts whats your opinion its been an unusual night but this is a perfectly normal morning zero wind the etesian wind the meltemi as they it in these parts starts up around about noon comes from the north or northwest what if the wind comes from the south or southwest brad van gelder said it would be impossible for the rowers to make any headway against it the reverse rather cant you just picture it the angelina being driven on to the rocks of santorini jobs comforter hawkins said would it be too much to ask you kindly to cease and desist not job sir nor his comforter i see myself more in the role of cassandra why cassandra beautiful daughter of priam king of troy denholm said the prophecies of the princess though always correct were decreed by apollo never to be believed im not much of a one for greek mythology montgomery said had it been a leprechaun or a brownie now i might have listened as it is we have work to do mr danforth to his chief officer detail halfadozen men a dozen haul the angelina round to our port quarter once the bomb has been removed we can pull the fuselage forard and angelina can then move forard in her turn to take its place under montgomerys instructions the derrick hook was detached from the lifting ring and the derrick itself angled slightly aft until the hook dangled squarely over the centre of rectangular opening that had been cut in the fuselage montgomery van gelder and carrington descended the companionway to the top of the fuselage van gelder with his stilson carrington with two adjustable rope grommets to which were attached two slender lengths of line one eight feet length the other perhaps four times as long van gelder carrington lowered themselves into the cargo bay and lipped and secured the grommets over the tapered ends of the mine while montgomery remained above guiding the winch driver until the lifting fork was located precisely over the centre of the mine the hook was lowered until it was four feet above the mine none of the eight securing clamp nuts offered more than a token resistance to van gelders stilson and as each clamp came free carrington tightened or loosened the pressure on the two shorter ropes which had been attached to the hook within three minutes the atomic mine was free of all restraints that had attached it to the bulkhead and floor of the cargo bay and in less than half that time it had been winched upwards slowly and with painstaking care until it was clear of the planes fuselage the two longer ropes attached to the grommets were thrown up on to the deck of the kilcharran where they were firmly held to ensure that the mine was kept in a position precisely parallel to the hull of the ship montgomery climbed aboard and took over the winch the mine was hoisted until it was almost level with the ships deck and then by elevating the angle of the derrick carefully brought alongside until it was resting against the rubbercushioned sides of the kilcharran a manoeuvre that was necessary to ensure that the mine did not snag against the port stays of the foremast of the angelina when that vessel was brought alongside it took what seemed like an unconscionably long time in fact it took just over half an hour to bring the angelina alongside hauling the planes fuselage forward to leave space for the lugger had been a quick and simple task but then because of the supporting air bags the fuselage was in a state of neutral buoyancy and one man could have accomplished the task with ease but the angelina displaced upwards of eighty tons and even the dozen men assigned to the task of towing it found it a laborious task just to get it under way a difficulty that amply confirmed van gelders assertion that towing it any distance at all by a whaler propelled only by oars was a virtual impossibility but eventually brought alongside it was the mine gently lowered into its prepared cradle and clamped into position routine montgomery said to hawkins if he was experiencing racing any feelings of relief and satisfaction and he would i have been less than human not to have done he showed no signs of them nothing should have gone wrong and nothing did go wrong all we need now is a tiny puff of wind the luggers on her way and all our troubles are over maybe all our troubles are just beginning van gelder said hawkins looked at him suspiciously and what may we ask are we expected to gather from that cryptic remark there is a tiny puff of wind sir van gelder wetted a i forefinger and held it upwards unfortunately its not from the northwest its from the southeast the beginning im afraid of what is called the euros van gelder had assumed a conversational tone reading about it last night rare in the summer months but not unknown im sure professor wotherspoon will confirm this wotherspoons unsmiling nod did indeed confirm it can turn very nasty very stormy gusting up to force or i can only assume that the radio operators on the kilcharran and the ariadne have what shall i say relaxed their vigilance a bit understandable after what theyve been through must have been something about it in the weather forecasts and if this wind increases and according to the book there is no doubt it will any attempt to sail or row the angelina anywhere will end up in her banging not against the rocks of santorini as i suggested but against those of siphinos or folegandros which i believe are rather sparsely populated but if the euros backs more to the east which i understand it occasionally does then it would bang into milos five thousand people on milos so it says in the book i speak with restraint van gelder hawkins said i dont exactly see myself in the role of an ancient roman emperor but you do know what happened to messengers who brought bad news to them they got their head chopped off twas ever thus sir a prophet hath no honour in his own country bearers of bad news were having a hard time of it on both sides of the atlantic that morning the president of the united states was no longer a young man and at half past five on that morning in the oval office he was showing every year of his age the lines of care and concern were deeply entrenched in his face and the skin beneath the permanent tan had a greyish tinge to it but he was alert enough and his eyes were as clear as could be expected of an elderly man who had had no sleep whatsoever that night i am beginning gentlemen to feel almost as sorry for myself and ourselves as i am for those unfortunates in santorini the gentlemen he was addressing were the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff richard hollison of the fbi john heiman the defence secretary and sir john travers the british ambassador i suppose i should in all decency apologize for bringing you all together at this unearthly hour of the morning but frankly i have no decency left in me im right at the undisputed top of my selfpity list he rifled some papers on his desk admiral hawkins and his men are sitting on top of a ticking timebomb and it seems that nature and circumstances are conspiring to thwart their every attempt to rid themselves of this canker in their midst with his latest report i had thought that i had reached the ultimate nadir inevitably i was wrong he looked sorrowfully at the deputy head of the fbi you had no right to do this to me richard i am sorry about that mr president hollison may well have meant what he said but the sorrow was completely masked by the expression and tone of bitter anger its not just bad news or damnably bad news its shattering news shattering for you shattering for me most of all shattering for the general i still can hardly bring myself to believe it i might be prepared to believe it sir john travers said and might well be prepared to be shattered along with the rest of you if that is i had the slightest idea what you are talking about and am sorry about that the president said we have not really been remiss there just hasnt been time yet richard the ambassador has not yet read the relevant documents could you put him in the picture please that shouldnt take too long its a most damnably ugly picture sir john because it reflects badly just how badly its only now beginning to dawn on me on both americans in general and the pentagon in particular the central figure in the scenario of whom you have of course heard is a certain adamantios spyros andropulos who is rapidly emerging as an international criminal of staggering proportions as you know he is at present being held aboard the frigate ariadne he is an exceptionally wealthy man im talking merely of hundreds of millions of dollars it could be billions for all i so far know and he has money laundered money under false names hidden away in various deposit accounts all over the world marcos of the philippines and duvalier of haiti are or were rather good at this sort of thing but theyre being found out they should have employed a real expert like andropulos he cant be all that expert richard sir john said youve found out about him a chance in a million a break that comes to a law agency once in a lifetime in any but the most exceptional and extraordinary circumstances he would have taken the secret to the grave with him and i didnt find out about him there is no possible way i ever could have done and no credit whatsoever attaches to us that he was found out is due entirely to two things an extraordinary stroke of luck and an extraordinary degree of astuteness by those aboard the ariadne i have incidentally have had cause to revise my earlier and i must admit prejudiced and biased opinion of admiral hawkins he insists that none of the credit belongs to him but to the captain and two of his officers aboard the ariadne it takes quite a man to insist on that sort of thing among his apparently countless worldwide deposits andropulos had tucked away eighteen million dollars in a washington bank through an intermediary or nominee by the name of george skepertzis this nominee had transferred over a million dollars apiece to the accounts of two men registered in the bank as thomas thompson and kyriakos katzanevakis the names inevitably are fictitious no such people exist the only bank clerk who could identify all three men inasmuch as he was the person who had handled all three accounts had left the bank we tracked him down he was understandably a bit upset about being dragged out of his bed at midnight and showed him a group of photographs two of them he recognized immediately but none of the photographs remotely resembled the man going by the name of george skepertzis but he was able to give us some additional and very valuable information about skepertzis who seemed to have taken him into some limited degree of confidence no reason why he shouldnt of course skepertzis has had every reason to believe that his tracks were completely covered this was approximately two months ago he wanted to know about the banking facilities in certain specified towns in the united states and mexico the bank clerk his name is bradshaw gave him what information he could it took bradshaw about a week to find out the details skepertzis wanted i should imagine that he was well rewarded for his labours although of course bradshaw didnt say so there were no criminal charges that we could have laid against him for that not that we would even if we could have bradshaw provided our agent with the names and addresses of the banks concerned we checked those against two lists regarding andropuloss banking activities that we had just received from the ariadne and greek intelligence a third if you count interpol skepertzis had made enquiries about banks in five cities and lo and behold and to nobodys surprise all five also appeared on the lists concerning andropulos we instituted immediate enquiries bankers especially senior banking officials have profound objections to being woken in the middle of the night but among our eight thousand fbi agents in those united states we have some very tough and persistent individuals who are also very good at putting the fear of god into even the most lawabiding citizens and we have some very good friends in mexico it turns out that friend skepertzis has bank accounts in all five cities all under his own name youre ahead of me here the president said this is news to me when did you find this out just over half an hour ago im sorry mr president but there just hasnt been the time to confirm everything and tell you until now in two of those banks in mexico city and san diego we struck gold in each of those banks close on threequarters of a million dollars have been transferred to the accounts of a certain thomas thompson and a certain kyriakos katzanevakis its a measure of those two gentlemens belief in their immunity to investigation that they hadnt even bothered to change their names not that that would have mattered in the long run not after we had got around to circulating photographs one final point of interest two weeks ago the bank in mexico city received a draft of two million dollars in favour of george skepertzis from a reputable or supposedly reputable bank in damascus syria a week later exactly the same amount was transferred to a certain philip trypanis in greece we have the name of the athens bank and have asked greek intelligence to find out who or what trypanis is or for whom he is fronting a cent gets a hundred dollars that it is a pal of andropulos a silence ensued a silence that was long and profound and more than a little gloomy it was the president himself who finally broke it a stirring tale is it not sir john stirring indeed richard had the right term for it shattering but well have you no questions no the president looked at him in near disbelief not even one little question not even one mr president but surely you must want to know the identities of thompson and katzanevakis i dont want to know if we must refer to them at all id rather just refer to them as the general and the admiral he looked at hollison that would be about right richard im afraid so a general and an admiral your admiral hawkins sir john is smarter than your average bear i would agree but you have to be fair to yourselves he had access to information that you hadnt had until now i too have an advantage that you people lack youre deep in the middle of the wood im on the outside looking in two things gentlemen as a representative of her majestys government i am bound to report any developments of significance to the foreign office and cabinet but if i specifically lack certain information such as specific names then i cant very well report them can i we ambassadors have the power to exercise a very wide range of discretion in this particular instance i choose to exercise that discretion the second point is that you all seem convinced there appears to be a certain doomladen certainty about this that this affair this toplevel treason if you will is bound to become public knowledge i have one simple question why why why the president shook his head as if bemused or stunned by the naivetй of the question god damn it sir john its bound to come out its inevitable how else are we going to explain things away if we are at fault if we are the guilty party we must in all honesty openly confess to that guilt we must stand up and be counted we have been friends for some years now mr president friends are allowed to speak openly of course of course your sentiments mr president do you the greatest possible credit but hardly reflect what fortunately or unfortunately goes on in the more rarefied strata of international diplomacy i am not speaking of deception and deviousness i am referring to what is practical and politic its bound to come out you say certainly it will but only if the president of the united states decides that it must how you ask are we going to explain things away simple we dont you give me one valid reason why we should move this matter into me realm of the public domain or as you appear to suggest make a clean breast of things and ill give you half a dozen reasons reasons equally valid if not more so why we shouldnt sir john paused as if to marshal his facts but was in fact merely waiting for one of the four intent listeners to voice an objection he had already marshalled his facts i think mr president that it might do us no harm to hear what sir john as to say hollison smiled who knows we might even learn something as the senior ambassador of a vastly experienced foreign office it seems likely that sir john must have gained some little expertise along the way thank you richard bluntly and undiplomatically mr president you have a duty not to speak out there is nothing whatsoever to be gained and a very great deal to be lost at best you will be hanging out a great deal of dirty washing in public and all to no avail to no purpose at worst you will be providing invaluable ammunition for your enemies such open and if i may say so illadvised confession will achieve at best an absolute zero and at worst a big black minus for you the pentagon and the citizens of america the pentagon i am sure is composed of honourable men sure it may have its quota of the misguided the incompetent even the downright stupid name me any large and powerful bureaucratic elite that has never had such a quota all that matters finally and basically is that they are honourable men and i see no earthly justification for dragging the reputations њf honourable men through the dust because we have discovered two rotten apples at the bottom of the barrel you yourself mr president are in an even worse position you have devoted a considerable deal of your presidential time to combating terrorism in every shape and form how will it look to the world if it comes out that two senior members of your armed forces have been actively engaged in promoting terrorism for material gain you may hardly know the two gentlemen concerned but they will of course be elevated to the status of highly trusted aides and thats just looking on the bright side on the dark side you will not only be accused of harbouring men who are engaged in terrorism but of aiding abetting and inciting them to new levels of terrorism cant you just see the headlines smeared across the front pages of the tabloids and yellow press throughout the world by the time they have finished with you you will be remembered in history for one thing and one thing only the ultimate byword for hypocrisy the allegedly noble and highprincipled president who ha spent his life in encouraging and promoting the one evil he had sworn to destroy throughout the countries of the world that dislike or fear america because of its power authority and wealth and that like it or not means most countries your reputation would lie in tatters because of your exceptionally high level of popularity in your own country you will survive but i hardly think that that consideration would affect you what would and should affect you is that your campaign against terrorism would be irrevocably destroyed no phoenix would arise from those particular ashes as a world force for justice and decency you would be a spent man to put it in the most undiplomatic terms sir to go ahead as you propose to do youd have to be more than slightly off your rocker the president stared into the middle distance for quite some time then said in a voice that was almost plaintive does anyone else think im off my rocker nobody thinks youre off your rocker mr president the general said least of all i would say sir john here he is merely saying what our unfortunately absent secretary of state would advocate if he were here both gentlemen are high on pragmatism and cold logic and low on unconsidered and precipitate action maybe im not the ideal person to be passing judgement on this issue i would obviously be delighted if whatever reputation the pentagon has survives intact but i do feel most strongly that before jumping off the top of the empire state or whatever one should give some thought to the fatal and irrevocable consequences i can only nod emphatic agreement john heiman the defence secretary said if i may mix up two metaphors if i am mixing them we have only two options we can let sleeping dogs lie or let slip the dogs of war sleeping dogs never harmed anyone but the dogs of war are an unpredictable bunch instead of biting the enemy they may well turn in this case almost certainly would turn and savage us the president looked at hollison richard youre in the cardgame of your life mr president youve got only one trump and its marked silence so its four to one is it no mr president heiman said its not and you know it its five to zero i suppose i suppose the president ran a weary hand across his face and how do we propose to mount this massive display of silence sir john sorry mr president but not me if i am asked for my opinions i am not as you have seen slow to give them but i know the rules and one of them is that i cannot be a party to formulating the policy of a sovereign state decisions are for you and for what is in effect your war cabinet here a messenger entered and handed a slip of paper to the president dispatch from the ariadne mr president i dont have to brace myself for this the president said as far as dispatches from the ariadne are concerned i am permanently braced some day ill get some good news from that ship he read the message but not of course this time atomic mine removed from cargo bay of bomber and safely transferred to sailing vessel angelina excellent news as far as it goes but then unexpected degree change in wind course makes sailing departure impossible anticipated delay three to six hours hydrogen weapons from planes cargo bay being transferred to diving ship kilcharran expect to complete transfer by nightfall end of message well where does that leave us sir john travers said it leaves you mr president with a few hours breathing space meaning masterly inactivity nothing that can be profitably done at the moment i am merely thinking out loud he looked at the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff tell me general do those two gentlemen in the pentagon know they are under suspicion correction do they know that you have proof of their treason no and i agree with what you are about to say no point will be served by acquainting them with that fact at the present moment none with the presidents permission i would like to retire and ponder the problems of state and international diplomacy with the aid of a pillow the president smiled one of his increasingly rare smiles what a splendid suggestion i also shall do exactly that its close on six now gentlemen may i suggest that we foregather again at tenthirty am at that afternoon van gelder message sheet in hand joined talbot on the bridge of the ariadne radio from heraklion sir seems that a phantom of the greek air force located the diving ship taormina less than ten minutes after taking off from base it was just east of avgo island which the chart tells me is about forty miles northeast of heraklion very conveniently positioned to break through the kasos strait what direction was it headed no direction having no wish to raise any suspicion the greek pilot didnt hang around but he reports that the taormina was stopped in the water lurking lurking one wonders for what speaking of lurking whats jimmy doing at the moment last seen he was lurking with two young ladies in the wardroom no dereliction of duty i assure you the three as have retired to their cabins presumably for the afternoon the girls report a far from subtle change in their behaviour they have stopped discussing the predicament they find themselves in in fact they have stopped discussing anything they appear unusually calm relaxed and not very concerned about anything which may mean that they have philosophically resigned themselves to whatever fate may hold in store or they may have made up their minds about some plan of action although what that could be i couldnt even begin to imagine what would your guess be vincent a plan of action i know its only the slenderest of clues but its just possible that they may be resting up this afternoon because they dont expect to be doing much resting during the coming night i have the oddest feeling that we wont be doing much resting ourselves tonight aha the second sight sir your nonexistent scottish blood clamouring for recognition when it clamours a bit more ill let you know i just keep wondering about jenkinss disappearance a phone rang and talbot picked it up a message for the admiral from the pentagon bring it here talbot hung up and gazed out through the forard screens of the bridge the angelina to protect it from the buffeting of the fourfoothigh waves generated by the now very brisk euros wind from the southeast had been moved to a position where it lay snugly in the still waters between the bows of the ariadne and the stern of the kilcharran speaking of the pentagon its only an hour since we told them that we expected the unloading of the hydrogen missiles to be completed by nightfall and what do we have a force and the planes fuselage streamed out a cable length to the northwest lord only knows when the unloading will be finished now do you think we should so inform them i should think not sir the president of the united states is a much older man than we are and the kind of cheery communications he has been receiving from the ariadne of late cant be doing his heart any good i suppose youre right ah thank you myers bloody funny signal if you ask me sir cant make head nor tail of it these things are sent to try us talbot waited till myers had left then read out the signal identity of cuckoos in the nest established irrefutable proof that they are linked to your generous benefactor friend sincerest congratulations to admiral hawkins and the officers of the ariadne recognition at last van gelder said you are the last to arrive sir john the president said i have to advise you that we have already made up our minds what to do a very difficult decision i assume mr president probably the most difficult you have ever been called upon to make it has been now that the decision is made and is irrevocable you can no longer be accused of meddling with the affairs of a sovereign state what would you have done sir john perfectly straightforward exactly what you have done no one is to be informed except two people and those two people are to be informed that the president has suspended them indefinitely from duty pending the investigation of allegations and statements that have been laid against them well damn your eyes sir john the president spoke without heat instead of sleeping all the time i spent a couple of hours wrestling with my conscience to arrive at the same conclusion it was inevitable sir you had no option and i would point out that its easy enough for us to arrive at decisions you and only you can give the executive order i will not insult your intelligence by asking if you are aware what this executive order means i am perfectly aware of what it means now that my opinion is no longer called for i have no hesitation in saying that i would have done exactly the same thing it is a death sentence and it can be no consolation at all that you will not be called upon to carry out or to order to be carried out the execution of that death sentence chapter manhattan project admiral hawkins said what on earth does she mean by manhattan project i dont know sir denholm said eugenia doesnt know either she just caught the words as she walked into the wardroom only andropulos alexander and aristotle were there the phrase was repeated twice and she thought it odd enough i think its very odd too to pass it on to me when they became aware of her presence the subject was switched she said that whatever the nature of the subject was they seemed to find it rather amusing talbot said even alexander was amused humour sir is not alexanders forte nobodys seen him smile since he came aboard the ariadne i would doubt if anyone has ever seen him smile besides it was alexander who was discussing the subject maybe he doesnt laugh at his own jokes i know you know something about those things denholm hawkins said doesnt it suggest anything to you zero sir the immediate and obvious far too obvious connection is the atom bomb the manhattan project of course was that immensely long immensely complicated and immensely expensive project that led to the invention of the atom bomb manhattan was only a code word the actual research was carried out in new mexico and nevada or thereabouts im sorry sir but the significance the relevance of the phrase in our present situation quite escapes me at least ive got company hawkins said he picked up two slips of paper from his table in the admirals cabin those two messages have come in since last we saw you in this case i dont think their significance will escape you ah this one from the white house itself two of your philanthropists beneficiaries are no longer with us beneficiary a has been involved in a fatal automobile accident denholm looked up from the paper has he now for beneficiary a i take it we can read either admiral x or general y did he fall did he jump or was he pushed he looked at the paper again and i see that beneficiary b has just disappeared again i assume that beneficiary b was either x or y how very inconvenient for them how very convenient for us denholm looked from hawkins to talbot from the very restrained wording i take it that this news is not to be broadcast from the housetops i shouldnt have thought so hawkins said we have already arranged for the coded original to be destroyed i take it then sir that speculation about their abrupt departure is pointless indeed not only pointless but needless they have fallen upon their swords one does not wish to sound cynical nor stand in condemnation but its probably the only faintly honourable thing they have done for a long time the second signal denholm the one from heraklion interesting sir it seems that the taorminas last port of call was tobruk furthermore although its registered in panama it appears to be permanently based in tobruk its more than interesting its intriguing especially considering that that wellknown philanthropist sitting in our wardroom seeps to have considerable business interests in tripoli its most damnably frustrating sir what is that we havent a single shred of evidence to adduce against him far less proof i have this feeling talbot said that neither evidence nor proof will ever be required andropulos will never come to trial hawkins looked at him for a few thoughtful moments thats the second time youve said that captain you have access to some information that we lack not at all sir maybe ive just got blind faith in this blindfolded goddess of justice you know the lady who holds die scales in her hands talbot smiled or maybe as van gelder keeps on hinting i have some traces of highland blood in me says im fey the second sight or some nonsense like that ah the man himself a radio message from greek intelligence van gelder said he proffered the paper he held in hand just tell me hawkins said gently im becoming allergic to bad news not all that bad sir not for us at any rate says that someone attached to the department for middle east and north african affairs they carefully dont give his name i suppose hes a minister of some sort i suppose we could find out easily enough but it seems unimportant took off by government plane on a routine visit to canea the town close by the souda bay air base never got there but at exactly the time he should have got there a patrolling greek mirage spotted a plane very like the one he was flying in too much of a coincidence for it not to have been the same plane passing directly over heraklion so of course talbot said you consulted the chart and arrived at the conclusion that he was heading for some place what place tobruk and you also arrived at the conclusion that he wouldnt be coming back from there allowing for the vagaries of human nature sir i would not have thought so greek intelligence have also established the fact that the vanishing minister if minister he was held an account at the same athens bank that philip trypanis honours with his custom it would appear to coin a phrase that they are now hot on the trail of mr trypanis whether they nab mr trypanis or not hardly seems a matter of concern for us i would think hawkins said if our philanthropist friend in the wardroom knew of the fate of his pal in government here and those of a and b or x and y in washington his humour might be in marked abeyance by now and if he knew that we knew of the taormina and that its home baї was tobruk he would be downright thoughtful was that all van gelder on that subject sir yes captain montgomery professor wotherspoon and i have been discussing the weather you have hawkins looked at him in suspicion dont tell me that cassandra has you in her clutches again certainly not sir the euros has died away completely we suspect it will only be a matter of time before the weather returns to normal a very short time latest met reports confirm that the angelina at the present moment is lying between our ship and the kilcharran facing northwest if the meltemi starts up also from the northwest of course we wont be able to sail her out of her present position it might be wise to tow her alongside us now of course talbot said see to it now would you number one after that let us foregather for the last supper van gelder looked through the opened doorway its already getting dark sir you dont feel like waiting for the dawn before we take off nothing id like better than to wait for the dawn but we have this duty to our fellow man we have to be brave noble and selfsacrificing the sooner we take off the easier will lie the heads along the potomac not to mention of course those on the kilcharran and ariadne denholm looked from talbot to van gelder his face registered an expression of near incredulity am i to understand captain that you and lieutenantcommander van gelder are sailing on the angelina talbot shook his head i suppose it had to come to this number one junior officers questioning our nautical expertise i dont understand sir why on earth are you and number one going along on the angelina i mean we are not going along on the angelina we are taking the angelina professor wotherspoon and his wife are the people who are not going they dont know that yet of course the good professor is going to be very wroth but its difficult to please everybody i see sir yes i see i should have guessed id like to come along sir yes and no you shall come along but not on the angelina you will take the launch you wont start up the engine until were at least three miles clear we dont want you understand to precipitate any premature big bangs and then we follow you at that distance not so much follow us as circle us at of course the same prudent distance of three miles your purpose again of course is to ward off and warn off any unsuspecting vessels that come too close and then help tow you back here when weve dumped the mine and sailed on a sufficiently safe distance well start the engine and head back a tow would help or perhaps the admiral will fetch us in the ariadne we havent decided yet and at the moment its not important but what im about to say is important you will take along with you chief petty officer mckenzie marine sergeant brown and petty officer myers to operate the radio most importantly you will also take with you suitably wrapped in plastic the krytron detonating device and conceal it well i suggest under the floorboards of the wheelhouse you will instruct petty officer myers to take along the smallest portable transceiver he can lay hands on and conceal it in the same place make sure the floorboards are securely nailed down afterwards may i ask the reason for this excessive secrecy sir you may not for the excellent reason that i have no reason to give you the best i can do is to wave a vague hand and say that i am preparing for unforeseen eventualities the trouble with the unforeseen is that it is unforeseeable you understand i think so sir i suggest you go now and alert your crew and for gods sake dont let anyone see you wandering around with the krytron under your arm lieutenant denholm left hawkins said there are times captain when i feel i have to say with regret of course that the truth is not always with you i mean the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i agree sir van gelder said sets a very bad example for junior officers talbot smiled be ye as pure as snow ye shall not escape calumny something like that we captains become inured to such injustices i have the odd feeling all right all right vincent lets settle for just a few microscopic traces of highland blood that andropulos is going to be asking the odd casual question at table tonight i suggest we have dr wickram up here andropulos did indeed have the odd casual question to ask at table that night but he was in no hurry to introduce them it was not until after they had finished the main course that he said we do not wish to pry captain nor ask questions about purely naval matters which should be none of our concern but whatever is happening surely does concern us whether directly or indirectly and we are but human and very very curious we can all see that the angelina is alongside with that highly suspect atomic mine lashed down in its cradle on the deck i thought the intention was to sail it away with all possible speed we shall be doing just that mr andropulos in the fullness of time by which i mean after weve finished dinner you will not be happy until it is gone i confess i will feel a considerable degree of relief when i see the angelina disappearing over the horizon and with a clear sky and an almost full moon we should be able to see that selfish cowardly maybe maybe not andropulos sighed i do not see myself in the role of hero i dont see myself as such no sensible person does but surely well that atomic mine is still highly unstable is it not i dont think its quite so highly dangerous as it was but why ask me youre sitting next to the expert of course dr wickram how do you see things now sir the captain is right or i hope he is the radioactive emanations of the hydrogen missiles from which of course the atomic mine is now separated have an extremely limited range they are no longer affecting the mine which should be now slowly beginning to stabilize itself but i have to emphasize that its a slow process how long will it be before it has fully stabilized itself by which i mean when will it reach a condition when a passing vessels engines will have no effect on it ah well now wickrams tone was the verbal equivalent of a shrug as ive said were in the realms of the unknown die untested but i have been making some calculations difficult calculations involving some rather advanced mathematics so i wont bother you with those but my estimate is that the mine should be quite safe in twelve hours at the most possibly even in six hours at a lesser time than that well the risk would be unacceptably high damn you to hell talbot wotherspoon said his voice was low and controlled but the ivoryknuckled fists showed the depths of his anger its my boat youre talking about its not the property of your damned navy i am aware of that professor and im most damnably sorry about it talbot was with hawkins wotherspoon and his wife in the admirals cabin but you are not coming along did you honestly imagine that the royal navy would idly stand by and let you civilians risk your lives for us talbot smiled its not only our duty but were getting paid for it its not only bloody highhanded its piracy hijack that sort of illegal behaviour youre sworn to destroy you are of course prepared to resort to force in order to restrain me if we have to yes talbot nodded to the opened darkened doorway wotherspoon turned caught sight of three large figures halfhidden in the gloom when he turned back he was literally speechless with fury its the last thing we wan to do talbot said and its totally unnecessary he let an element of coldness creep into his voice quite frankly wotherspoon my primary concern is not your welfare i think youre being most extraordinarily selfish and totally inconsiderate how long have you been married mrs wotherspoon how long have she tried to smile but her heart wasnt in it almost six months less than six months talbot looked at wotherspoor without enthusiasm and yet youre willing to expose her to danger and the chance is very real to send her to her death because your stiffnecked pride has been wounded you must be proud of yourself do you really want to go mrs wotherspoon angelina the correction was automatic and this time she did smile almost certainly because of the incongruity of it in the circumstances you put me in an impossible situation she paused then went on quickly no no you dont i dont want to go i dont want james to go either delving around m antiquities is our business not violence and death heaven knows im no latterday amazon and if there are any dragons waiting around to be killed i dont want my husband to be st george please james hawkins spoke for the first time i make no appeal to your emotions professor all i ask you is to put yourself in commander talbots position i think you would agree it is a pretty impossible one yes wotherspoon had unclenched his fists i see that i think three signals are in order john hawkins said the wotherspoons had left one to the white house one to general carson in rome and one to rearadmiral blyth the same signal coded of course to each how about settled weather with favourable northwest wind angelina about to sail with armed mine transfer of hydrogen missiles from plane to kilcharran continuing smoothly that should fit the bill admirably it should come as quite a shock to them all we havent of late i must admit been sending them much in the way of good news a small knot of interested spectators were gathered round the head of the gangway the foot of which offered easy access to both the stern of the angelina whose sails were already hoisted and the bows of the ariadnes launch among the more interested of the spectators was andropulos he turned to talbot and said how much longer now captain ten minutes thereabouts andropulos shook his head as if in disbelief and then all our troubles will be over its beginning to look that way isnt it it is indeed tell me why is the launch there simple its coming with us going with you i dont understand wont the sound of its engines maybe trigger off the mine the launch wont start up until were at least three miles clear it will then proceed to circle us again at a distance of three miles to warn off any vessels powered vessels that is that threaten to come too close to us we havent come this far mr andropulos to take any chances the thought the precaution never occurred to me alas i fear i will never make a man of action talbot gave him what andropulos misinterpreted as a kindly smile one cannot be all things to all men sir you are ready to go captain hawkins said he had just joined them a few minutes sir sails are filling rather nicely arent they you are going captain andropulos seemed a trifle disconcerted certainly ive always rather fancied myself as the skipper of an aegean lugger you seem rather surprised mr andropulos i am rather i was but not now he looked down to the deck of the angelina where van gelder was adjusting a halyard on the foresail and of course inevitably lieutenantcommander van gelder handpicked men eh captain handpicked by yourself of course i congratulate you i also salute you i suspect that this is a much more dangerous mission than you have led us to understand a mission so perilous that you have chosen not to delegate some members of your crew to carry it out nonsense mr andropulos you exaggerate well admiral were off taking a median estimate on dr wickrams time limits we should be disposing of this mine in nine hours time six am tomorrow if the wind holds theres no guarantee that it will of course well be well on our way to the kasos strait by then hawkins nodded and with luck although i dont see why the factor luck should enter into it we should be picking you up in the early afternoon tomorrow we shall remain with captain montgomery until he has finished loading the hydrogen missiles and until the destroyer ive radioed for comes to pick him up and escort him to thessalonika that should be between nine and ten in the morning then well come looking for you he turned his head youre off mr andropulos i should have thought you would have remained to witness this rather historic moment i intend to do just that i also intended to record this historic moment i go to fetch my trusty leica well lieutenant denholms trusty leica he lent it to me less than an hour ago talbot chatted briefly with hawkins said his goodbye climbed down the gangway had a brief word with denholm on the launch and then boarded the angelina van gelder had already pulled in and coiled the bow rope talbot stooped over the cleat on the poopdeck to do the same with the stern rope when he became aware of a certain commotion and exclamations about his head he straightened and looked up andropulos had made his reappearance not with his trusty leica but with what was probably an equally trusty and much more unpleasant navy colt the muzzle of which was pressed against the temple of a plainly terrified angelina wotherspoon behind him loomed alexander and aristotle both men similarly armed and both with the muzzles of their pistols similarly pointed at temples those of irene charial and her friend eugenia neither of whom looked any happier than angelina which was to say that they looked very unhappy indeed having a pistol grinding into ones temple is an unpleasant sensation for even the most hardened for three young ladies whose nearest previous approach to violence must have been the printed page or some of the lessregarded tv psychodramas the effect must have been traumatic dont cast off quite yet captain andropulos said were coming with you what in gods name is the meaning of this devilry hawkinss expression reflected an equal degree of shock and anger have you taken leave of your senses we have not taken leave of our senses we are just taking leave of you i dont understand hawkins said i just dont understand this is the way you repay us for having saved your lives and offered you every hospitality we thank you both for your care and your kindness however we have no wish to overstay our welcome or impose upon you further he jabbed angelinas temple with a force that made her gasp with pain after you mrs wotherspoon the six of them descended the gangway in succession and boarded the angelina andropulos transferred the attention of his colt from angelina to talbot and van gelder nothing rash or heroic or gallant if you please andropulos said especially gallant it could only have the most distressing consequences both for you and the three young ladies is this a joke talbot said ah do i detect a certain loss of composure a crack in the monolithic calm if i were you captain i would not take me for a joker i dont talbot made no attempt to conceal his bitterness i took you for a wealthy businessman and a man of honour i took you at your face value i suppose we all learn from our mistakes you are too late to learn from this mistake you are correct in one respect i freely confess to being a wealthy businessman a very wealthy one as to the second charge he shrugged his indifference honour is in the eye of the beholder let us not waste time instruct this young man denholm standing in the bows of the launch was less than six feet away to follow his orders precisely the orders i understand that you have given him captain that is not to start his engines until we have put three miles away from him and then to circle us at that same distance to fend off unwanted intruders lieutenant denholm understands his orders perfectly clearly in which case cast off the wind was fresh but not strong and it took the angelina quite some time to overcome its initial inertia and reach a speed of three or four knots slowly the ariadne dropped astern and after fifteen minutes it was at least a mile distant excellent andropulos said rather gratifying is it not when things go exactly according to plan there was no hint of undue satisfaction in his voice tell me commander talbot would you believe me when i say that i am genuinely fond very fond of my niece and her friend eugenia and might even come to regard mrs wotherspoon in the same light i dont know why i should believe you and i dont see why it should concern me it could be and would you believe me when i say i wouldnt harm a hair of their heads im afraid i do afraid osiers wouldnt believe it or wouldnt know whether to believe it or not which makes them perfect hostages exactly i dont need to say that they will come to no harm in my hands he looked thoughtfully at talbot you are singularly incurious as to the reasons for my conduct i am very curious but one does not become a wealthy businessman by engaging in idle tittletattle if i were to ask you you would tell me exactly what you wanted to tell me no more no less how very true now a different point entirely the three young ladies pose absolutely no threat to me yo u and van gelder are a very different kettle of fish my two friends and i regard you as highly dangerous individuals we think you are capable of concocting devious and cunning plans and using a great deal of violence in putting those plans to the test if that is you thought there was the slightest chance of success you will understand therefore that we will have to immobilize you i will remain by the wheel here you two gentlemen accompanied by the three ladies will proceed to the saloon where aristotle who as you will readily understand is very good at knots will tie you hand and foot while alexander who is every bit as proficient with a gun as aristotle is with ropes will ensure that proceedings are conducted in a peaceful fashion hawkins was bent over professor wotherspoon who was lying half proppedup on a sofa in the wardroom wotherspoon dazed and making odd choking noises that were part way between moans and curses was struggling to open his eyes finally with the aid of his fingers he managed to do just that what the hell has happened the watchers had to strain to catch his words which were no more than an asthmatic croak where am i take this hawkins put an arm around his shoulders and a glass of brandy to his lips wotherspoon sipped gagged then drained the contents what has happened youve been banged over the back of the head grierson said and not lightly either sapped i believe is the current term by the butt of the revolver i should guess wotherspoon struggled to a sitting position who andropulos hawkins said or one of his criminal friends some more brandy is in order doctor normally no grierson said in this case yes i know the back of your head must hurt badly professor but dont touch it bruised bleeding puffy but no fracture andropulos has hijacked your vessel hawkins said along of course with the atomic mine he has also taken hostages wotherspoon nodded and winced at the pain it caused him my wife of course is one of them i am sorry along with irene charial and her friend eugenia there was no way we could stop them did you try would you have tried if you saw the barrel of a colt screwing into your wifes temple and two other guns screwed into the temples of the two other ladies i hardly think so wotherspoon shook his head im trying to come to terms with the situation with a head like an overripe pumpkin about to burst its noteasy talbot and van gelder whats happened to them we dont know of course clapped in irons handcuffed or some such i should imagine or permanently disposed of what in gods name is behind all this admiral do you think this fellow andropulos has gone off his rocker by his own standards hes probably under the impression that hes perfectly sane we have every reason to believe that he is alongterm and highly professional criminal operating on a hitherto unprecedented international scale terrorism and drugs would appear to be his forte there is no time to go into that at the moment the immediate point is that lieutenant denholm is very shortly leaving in the launch to follow them do you feel up to accompanying him follow them board and capture them i should say as you as much as said yourself professor your mind isnt yet firing on all cylinders if the launch were to go within a couple of miles of the angelina its engine beat would probably detonate the atomic mine as you say im not at my best but if you have any spare rifles or pistols there would be no harm in taking them along just in case there will be no firearms if there were to be any exchange of fire you know where the first bullet would lodge dont you yes you do put things so nicely less than an hour ago you were prepared to restrain me at all costs you seem to have changed your mind admiral its not my mind that has changed its the circumstances a rapid change in circumstances the president said does give one a rather more balanced view of life i wouldnt go so far as to say that i enjoyed that lunch but then a couple of hours ago i didnt expect or wish to have any today although the memory of the treachery will be with us for a long time one has to admit that the discreet if tragic settlement of the pentagon question removes a major burden of worry but that was only a local and let us confess it a basically selfish concern he waved the paper he held in his hand this of course is what matters the good ship angelina with this damned bomb aboard is heading steadily southeast and with every second that passes it is putting another yard or is it two between itself and all the horrors of santorini it is not too much to say gentlemen that a holocaust of unimaginable proportions has been averted he raised his glass i give you a toast sir john the royal navy the president had barely returned his glass to the table when a messenger entered the president glanced at him briefly looked away then looked at him again all traces of satisfaction drained from his face bad news johnson im afraid so mr president the worst the very worst not the very worst but bad enough the president took the message read it in silence then looked up and said im afraid our celebrations have been rather premature the angelina has been hijacked nobody repeated the word hijacked nobody said anything there didnt seem to be anything to say message reads angelina and armed mine hijacked by andropulos and two criminal associates five hostages taken commander talbot lieutenantcommander van gelder and three ladies one of whom is andropuloss niece physically impossible for angelina to return to area so major danger no longer exists will keep you posted hourly our major and only concern now recovery of hostages dear me dear me sir john said this is distressing both ominous and confusing here we have this madman or genius who knows how much truth there is in the old maxim that they are the two sides of the same coin loose in the levant with an armed atomic mine aboard does he know that its armed one rather suspects he doesnt where have the three ladies suddenly appeared from and what were they doing aboard one of her majestys frigates in the first place why of all improbabilities should this villain elect to kidnap his own niece and why not to mention how did this same villain kidnap the captain of the frigate and one of his senior officers and where in the name of all thats holy does he hope to sail his ship cargo and prisoners when he must know that every ship and plane in nato will be searching for him but he does so hope that is obvious his long and spectacularly successful criminal career undetected until now proves that he is a devious cunning and brilliant operator he has another scheme in mind not a man as we have now learnt to our cost and should have known from his record to be underestimated a villain indeed but a very resourceful villain indeed the president said one can only hope that commander talbot proves to be even more resourceful i have the uncomfortable feeling sir john said that at the present moment talbot is in no position to prove anything chapter on the hour of midnight eastern mediterranean time commander talbot was in no position to prove anything and judging from his uncomfortable position on a sofa in the angelinas saloon with his ankles lashed together and his hands bound behind his back it didnt seem that he would be in a position to prove anything for quite some time to come van gelder equally uncomfortable at the other end of the sofa was in no better case aristotle with a wholly unnecessary pistol held loosely across his knee was seated very comfortably indeed in a large armchair facing the sofa the three ladies were in smaller armchairs towards the after end of the saloon and didnt look at all comfortable they hadnt exchanged a word for upwards of two hours there didnt seem to be much to talk about and all three understandably enough were preoccupied with their own thoughts talbot said tell andropulos i want to speak to him do you now aristotle lowered the glass from which he had been sipping you are not in a position captain to give orders to anyone would you kindly present my compliments to the captain and say i would like to talk to him that is better aristotle rose crossed to the short flight of steps leading up to the wheelhouse and said something in greek andropulos appeared almost at once he too was needlessly armed there was a relaxed and confident even cheerful air about him when you were aboard my ship talbot said we catered for your every desire whatever you wanted you had but to ask j wish i could say the same for greek hospitality well your version of it i think i take your point it cant be easy for you to lie there and watch aristotle steadily lowering the level in a bottle of retsina you are thirsty yes thats easily remedied in very short order aristotle had their bonds quickly and skilfully rearranged with talbots left wrist and van gelders right loosely but securely attached to each other their free hands now held a glass apiece i am becoming suspicious captain andropulos said he neither looked nor sounded suspicious you seem totally unconcerned as to the immediate past and the immediate future i find it very curious indeed theres nothing curious about it its your behaviour that i find extraordinarily curious although i have to admit that that is based entirely on my complete ignorance of what is going on i fail to understand why you a very wealthy and i assume highly respected businessman should suddenly decide to put yourself outside the bounds of law i dont have to tell you that by hijacking the angelina you have done just that i cant even begin to understand why you should jeopardize your career perhaps even risk a prison sentence although i have no doubt that with the kind of money you must possess you wouldnt have too much trouble in bending the law in your direction most of all i dont understand how you can possibly hope to get away with it by six oclock possibly seven tomorrow morning every ship and plane in nato will be looking for you and you must know that it will take very little time to locate you you have this famous royal navy signal locate engage and destroy locate yes destroy no andropulos was quite undisturbed not with the kind of cargo and very select group of hostages i have on board as for jeopardizing my career well i think the time comes in many peoples lives when they should abandon the old ways and strike out in a fresh direction dont you captain not where im concerned and perhaps where you are concerned its not a choice but a necessity you appear to have taken a fresh step along the road to crime its just possible its difficult to imagine but it is possible that many of your past steps have led along that same road and that your past is catching up with you but thats just empty speculation i really dont know and to be honest i no longer care could i have some more wine what are you going to do with us irene charial was trying to keep her voice steady but the undercurrent of strain was there what is going to happen to us dont be ridiculous my dear nothing is going to happen to you you heard me saying that to commander talbot when we came aboard unthinkable that you should come to any harm at my hands where are you taking us im not taking you anywhere oh dear that does sound ominous to what will probably be my lifelong regret i shall be parting company with you dear dear that doesnt sound much better within a very short time i shall be transferring you aboard the ariadnes launch and bidding you farewell and the two officers here do you shoot them or just tie their hands up again and throw them overboard i must protest irene van gelder said dont go around putting ideas into the mans head i had looked for more intelligence from my niece andropulos said if it had been my intention to dispose of them i should have done so immediately we came aboard whats to stop them from coming after you you know they can call for help the lord help us van gelder said one shudders to think of the minimal levels of university entrance these days im afraid i have to agree with both van gelder and your uncle talbot said you are naive he cocked his fingers pistol fashion poof exit engine poof exit radio andropulos smiled as you say a double poof should do it nicely denholm looked out at the light flickering from the north what does the angelina say myers stop two miles southeast of us and cut engines how shall i answer sir we dont have any option wilco he waited until myers had triggered the reply then said whats the latest news about the taormina the ariadne had been monitoring the radio traffic between the angelina and the taormina for almost three hours and had the position of the taormina and themselves pinpointed to within a few hundred yards just ten miles north of avgo island and moving pretty slowly north proceeding in what one might say in happier circumstances with admirable caution the ariadne had picked up andropuloss warning to the taormina of the danger of their coming together too soon how long before they make contact three hours give or take a bit longer i should think if the angelina stops off alongside for a bit do you think wotherspoon said that they might have in mind to sink us lieutenant i would be grateful professor if you didnt even think of such things under the watchful eyes of three men with three guns mckenzie and brown took and secured the ropes of the angelina as it came alongside first aboard was andropulos himself followed by angelina wotherspoon who immediately seemed bent on strangling the professor then the two girls talbot and van gelder with their hands still bound behind their backs and finally alexander and aristotle the last carrying a bag we will not stay long andropulos said one or two small things to attend to first then we shall be on our way may one ask what is in that bag wotherspoon said a delayed action bomb mankind has so little trust in one another these days andropulos said he shook the bag gently and a slight tinkling noise resulted to while away the time while you await rescue commander talbots idea really after all its your liquor wotherspoon this i take it is the radio do me a last favour talbot said a favour to all of us dont blow it apart with a bullet just tap it gently with the butt of your revolver similarly with the engine it requires very little effort to destroy the distributor and the plugs he nodded towards the armed mine lying in its cradle im not at all sure how our friend here would react to the explosive crack of a pistol shot a well taken point andropulos said we just dont know how temperamental that mine is he reversed his grip on the pistol levered open the faceplate of the radio and swept the butt across the transistors it took him scarcely more time to attend to the engine he next turned his attention to the signalling lamp smashed it thoroughly and turned to myers is there a spare myers swore at him softly and andropulos raised his gun talbot said dont be a fool myers give it to him myers tightlipped handed over a small handsignalling lamp andropulos broke the face and threw it into the water he then turned his attention to a small metal box attached to the deck just outside the wheelhouse and jerked his gun in mckenzies direction the distress flares there over the side with them if you please he was silent for a moment as if considering engine radio signalling lamps distress flares no i dont think theres any other way you can communicate with anyone not that theres anyone around to communicate with i trust you do not have too long and uncomfortable a wait before you are picked up he turned to irene charial well then my dear i will say goodbye she did not answer him did not even look at him andropulos shrugged stepped across the gunwales and disappeared inside the angelinas wheelhouse alexander and aristotle followed him aboard retrieved the lines that had secured them to the launch and pushed off with boathooks the angelina got slowly under way and headed off once more towards the southeast mckenzie used his seamans knife to slice through the ropes that bound the wrists of talbot and van gelder someone he said certainly used a lot of enthusiasm to tie those knots that they did talbot flexed painful and swollen wrists and hands and looked at the bag aristotle had brought aboard however using two hands i might just be able to hold something in them irene charial looked at him is that all you have to say make it a generous measure she stared some more at him looked away and reached for the bag wotherspoon said are you sure youre all right captain how can you be so abnormally calm youve lost out havent you lost out all along the line thats one way of putting it the wind was fresh the sky cloudless and the full moon abnormally large and bright laid a golden bar across the sea of crete even at the distance of half a mile every detail of the angelina was startlingly clear the world of course will say that andropulos has lost out andropulos and his two murderous friends irene was still staring at him her expression blank and uncomprehending things never quite work out the way you want them to im sure you know what youre talking about wotherspoons tone of voice left no doubt that he was quite sure that talbot didnt know what he was talking about and you took a hell of a chance there if i may say so captain he could have killed you and van gelder he could have tried then he would have died himself himself alexander and aristotle you had your hands tied behind your back and van gelder wotherspoon was openly incredulous how could you chief petty officer mckenzie and marine sergeant brown are highly trained and highly qualified marksmen the only two on the ariadne with handguns they are quite deadly that is why they are along andropulos and his friends would have died without knowing what had hit them show the professor chief mckenzie reached under the small chart table brought out two navy colts and handed them without a word to wotherspoon quite some seconds passed in silence then he looked up from the guns and said in a quiet voice you knew those guns were there i put them there you put them there he shook his head as if in disbelief you could have used those guns killed them you mean well no that wouldnt have been necessary wounded them perhaps or just taken them prisoner what were your orders chief shoot to kill shoot to kill it was a night for silences but you didnt did you i elected not to irene charial clutched her arms and shivered as if a sudden chill had fallen on the evening air nor was she alone in sensing the sudden and almost tangible drop in temperature both eugenia and angela wotherspoon were staring at him their eyes wide with uncertainty then with fear and then with a sudden sick foreknowledge talbots words still hung in the air the fading echo of a sentence of execution talbot said to myers the radio if you would chief two minutes sir myers moved aft returned with a hammer and chisel and began to attack the floorboards of the wheelhouse he pulled up a creaking plank reached under and brought out a small compact radio with speaker attached you talk in here sir reply comes from the box after that is youve cranked the handle talbot nodded and spun the handle hms ariadne here the voice was very distinct very clear and unquestionably the voice of admiral hawkins talbot sir the three ladies van gelder and i have been returned to the launch well and unharmed andropulos and his two friends are on their way again moving southeast well thank god for that anyway damn your eyes talbot youve guessed right again youve made up your mind what to do i have sir for the record do you want a direct order off or on the record no order will be necessary but thank you do you have an estimate of their meeting time sir yes i do at their current speeds the taormina is still drifting along and on their converging courses about two hours threethirty thank you sir ill call again in one hour the taormina wotherspoon said who or what the hell is the taormina a diving ship in which andropulos has an interest by interest i mean that he probably owns the damn thing commander talbot irene charials voice was very low yes admiral hawkins said youve guessed right again what did he mean by that just what he meant i suppose please she essayed a smile but gave up you all seem to think that im not very bright but i dont deserve that im sorry im beginning to think that youre not much given to guessing she looked at the two guns you didnt guess that those were here i dont think you guessed i think you knew that my uncle and the other two were armed i knew how jenkins our wardroom steward had been writing a letter to his family for some reason maybe hed forgotten something he went back up to the wardroom he came across your uncle or his associates opening up a box in the passageway outside the wardroom that box its a standard fitting on most naval ships contained colt so they killed jenkins and threw him over the side i am sorry irene really and truly sorry i know how terrible all this must be for you this time she did manage a smile although it was a pretty wan attempt terrible yes but not as terrible as i thought it might be did you guess that my uncle would try to hijack the angelina yes and take the two of you hostages yes did you guess he would take three young ladies as hostages no i make guesses and i take chances but i would never have taken a chance like that if id even dreamed of the possibility id have killed them there and then on the ariadne i made a mistake about you captain you talk a lot about killing but i think youre a very kind man i wouldnt go as far as to say that talbot smiled you made a mistake irene is a pretty fair judge of character sir van gelder said she had you down as a cruel and inhuman monster i said nothing of the kind when you talked to my uncle on the angelina you said you knew nothing about what was going on that wasnt true was it you knew all along well its as you say im a pretty fair old guesser i have to admit that i had a lot of help from lieutenantcommander van gelder and lieutenant denholm is no slouch at the guessing game either im afraid youll have to know about your uncle some time and you may as well know now it sounds an exaggeration but it is not to say that hes a criminal in the world class if not in a class of his own and a totally ruthless killer he specializes in organizes and dominates international drugsmuggling and international terrorism god only knows how many hundreds more likely thousands lie dead at his hands we know and know beyond any doubt that he is as guilty as any man can be but it might take months even years to amass the necessary proof by that time he would have disappeared thats what hes doing now disappearing even in the past couple of days hes been doing not too badly he murdered the engineer cook and steward on the delos they found out too much what we shall probably never know how on earth can you know this all the colour had left her face and her face registered pure shock not grief or horror just shock how on earth can you guess that far less prove it because van gelder and i went down to examine the hull on the bottom he also blew up his own yacht in order to get aboard the ariadne you werent to know this of course neither unfortunately for your uncle did he for good measure hes also been responsible for the suicides of a very senior general and a very senior admiral both americans in the past few hours he doesnt know that but if he did im sure it might cost him anything up to a minutes sleep he looked at mckenzie chief this retsina is dreadful can you do no better than this for your longsuffering captain it is pretty awful sir ive tried it all respects to professor wotherspoon but im afraid greek plonk is very much an acquired taste there seems to be a bottle of scotch and one of gin in a locker in the wheelhouse dont know how it got there sergeant brown appears to think that its marked up in your mess bill ill courtmartial you both later meantime dont just hang around hes going to die isnt he sir brown said im sorry miss but if half of what the captain says is true then hes an inhuman man who doesnt belong in a human world and i believe everything the captain has said is true i know jenkins was your best friend sergeant and i cannot say how sorry i am he will die and by his own hand he is his own executioner talbot turned to eugenia you heard him mention the words manhattan project yes i did i didnt know what he meant neither did we at first but we worked it out andropulos wasnt interested in the hydrogen bombs theres no way you can use a hydrogen bomb as a terrorist weapon its too final it would achieve nothing and no terrorist would dare admit the responsibility of using it it would have been impossible for any terrorist to transport anyway but he was interested in atomic mines and he knew there were three of those aboard this plane his original plan we think was to dump those in the sea approaches to some of the worlds greatest seaports like san francisco new york london or rotterdam and let the respective countries know of it he would inform those countries that he had the means to detonate those mines by means of a longrange preset radio signal and that any attempt to locate remove or neutralize them might or might not activate the mine and of course destroy the investigating vessel it would have effectively paralysed all seaborne trade and passenger traffic in and out of those ports it would also have had the additional holierthanthou advantage that if any such atomic explosion did occur the fault would lie squarely at the door of the country responsible for the explosion and not at the door of the terrorists the manhattan project mine would have been laid somewhere in the ambrose channel on the approaches to the lower new york bay it was a brilliant scheme typical of a brilliant but twisted mind it had one drawback it wouldnt have worked andropulos had no means of knowing that but we did how in the world could you know that wotherspoon said ill come to that so andropulos gets his bomb perfect for his purposes or so he thinks but there was something else he didnt know when the plane crashed it activated a timing mechanism inside the mine when that mechanism ran out the mine was armed and ready to explode at the first sound of a ships engines any kind of engine in fact that mine aboard the angelina is armed but andropulos fell for that gobbledygook that wickram fed him about its being temporarily unstable because of the radioactive emanations from the hydrogen bombs its permanently unstable and just waiting to go chief you are being strangely remiss sorry sir mckenzie handed over a glass of scotch you can hardly blame me sir a man doesnt often get a chance to listen to a story like this talbot sampled his drink it is to be hoped that you will never hear another like it again so whats going to happen wotherspoon asked one of two things could happen he could try to transfer the mine to the taormina the sound of whose engines would blow them all to a better world well in the case of andropulos and his friends we would hope a much worse world the crew of the taormina may be a relatively innocent bunch or he could elect to sail it to tobruk his final destination dont forget he would think it perfectly safe to do so because as far as he knows the world would still think that he has five hostages aboard at the sound of the first ships or industrial engine in tobruk the mine is activated how many guiltless people dead ten thousand a minimum estimate lieutenant denholm i grow tired of my own voice you are alleged to be the ariadnes electronics officer would you show them this device and explain its purpose its called the krytron denholm said looks like a small and rather oldfashioned portable radio doesnt it this is what the captain meant when he said that if andropulos knew of the existence of this instrument he wouldnt have gone to all the vast trouble of obtaining an atomic mine by carrying out a very few simple actions it is in fact an extraordinarily complex mechanism and i know practically nothing about it you can send an electronic impulse on a selected wavelength and detonate an atomic bomb if andropulos were to have laid this mine in the ambrose channel it could have been destroyed from almost any given distance without a ship or a plane going anywhere near it wotherspoon said is one allowed to ask how you so conveniently came by this lethal instrument we sent to america for it it arrived yesterday that implies two things you had prior knowledge of the existence of this device and youve known for quite some time about exactly what andropulos was up to did anyone else know the captain disapproves of his officers gossiping wotherspoon turned to talbot youre going to blow up the angelina my angelina well yes i dare say there will be some form of compensation what compensation how should i know im not sufficiently senior to make any offers ill have to ask the admiral does it have to be done this way irene said you do have a radio couldnt you just tell him to drop the bomb over the side and then have him picked up later apart from the fact that he wouldnt believe me i wouldnt do it anyway i have told you that obtaining proof against him might take months even years i suggest that you and eugenia ask your respective fathers about him you will find that they will totally agree with what i am about to do and that is not to let a mad dog run loose in the world van gelder said this is what you meant by saying not once but many times that andropulos would never come to trial he has been tried at am talbot called up the ariadne and was through to the admiral immediately its twothirty sir has the kilcharran brought all the hydrogen missiles aboard it has so we go two small points sir professor wotherspoon seems somewhat peeved by the imminent ah demise of the angelina tell him its all in a good cause yes sir do you think the ministry of defence could run to a replacement guaranteed he also mentioned something about goldplated taps in his bathroom good god the other small point a mercifully small point one trusts a bagatelle sir how do you view the suggestion that after all their harrowing experiences the crew of the ariadne deserves some leave precisely the same thought had occurred to me a week i think where do you suggest piraeus sir i thought it would be rather a nice gesture to take the two girls back home it would also be an excellent centre for professor wotherspoon and his lady to start looking round for goldplated taps we will call again in five minutes talbot replaced the telephone and said to mckenzie and brown a couple of sweeps out if you please and have the bows lined up to the southeast well professor what do you think of the admirals generous offer im staggered so you might well be as the admiralty was under no obligation whatsoever to replace it you must be well aware that andropulos intended to sink it anyway lieutenant denholm pass me the krytron its my job sir you cant have forgotten that im your electronics officer its also your job to call to mind the rules and regulations about seniority van gelder said pass it to me talbot reached out and took the krytron already connected to a battery from denholm neither of you when we get to piraeus i think that those two young ladies will feel under a moral obligation to show you around the university precincts and indulge in other suchlike cultural activities i dont think somehow that they would feel entirely comfortable in the presence of whoever pressed this button talbot cracked both orange domes with the hammer rotated the switches through degrees and pressed the button commander talbot has elected to destroy and has destroyed the angelina by detonating the atomic mine he had my one hundred per cent encouragement and support andropulos and his two friends were aboard the angelina the president shook his head in disbelief and laid the message down this commander talbot a totally ruthless and highly resourceful man not ruthless sir sir john said a kind and thoughtful man if he were ruthless he could have permitted the destruction of a ship or a city but resourceful yes i rather think he is
