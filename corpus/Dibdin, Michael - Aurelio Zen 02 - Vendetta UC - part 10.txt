 sunday perhaps if the kidnap attempt had not occurred when he had been driving back from it oscar burolo might have shown his appreciation to the local church by donating a set of real bells it was the kind of showy gesture he was fond of stagemanaged to look like an impulsive act t generosity although in fact he would have costed the whole thing down to the last lira and got a massive dis count from the foundry in return for some building work using materials recycled from another contract neverthe less the village church would have got its bells as it was it had to make do with a gramophone record of a carillon played through loudspeakers and it was this that woke aurelio zen shortly before dawn the following morning the gramophone record was very old with a loud scratch which zens befuddled brain translated as highvelociti shots being fired at him by a marksman perched in thv belltower luckily by the time they reached his room the bullets had slowed down considerably and in the ena they just hovered in the air about his face darting this wax and that like dragonflies a harmless nuisance as the recorded bells finally fell silent zen opened his eyes on a jumble of colours and blurred shapes impossible to sort by size or distance he waited patiently for things to start making sense but when minutes went by and hi surroundings still refused to snap into focus he began tc worry that he had done some permanent injury to his brain pe hauled himself upright in bed slumping back against the wooden headboard things improved somewhat true he still had a spit ting headache and felt like he might throw up at any moment hut to his relief the objects in the room began a little reluctantly it seemed to assume the shapes and relationships he vaguely remembered from the previous cfay there was the large plywood wardrobe with the cfoor that wouldnt close properly and the wire coat pangers hanging like bats from a branch there was the small table with its cumbersome ceramic lamp and the three cheap ugly wooden chairs squatting like refugees awaiting bad news from a ceiling the colour of spoiled milk a long rusty chain supported a dim light whose irregular thick glass bowl must have looked very futur istic in about there was the washbasin the rack for glasses below the mirror and the dud bulb above the metal rubbish bin with its plastic liner the barred window lying open into the room he must have forgotten to close it when he went to bed that was why the air seemed stiff with cold and why the sound of the bells had wakened him he didnt feel cold in bed though probably because he was still fully dressed apart from his shoes and jacket he laboriously transferred his gaze to the floor a chilly expanse of speckled black and white aggregate polished to a hard shine there they were the two shoes on their sides and the discarded jacket on its back above them like the outline drawing of a murder victim he lay back exhausted by this effort trying to piece together the events of the previous evening quite apart from resulting in the worst hangover he had ever experi enced he knew that what had happened hadnt been good news but what had happened he remembered arriving back at the hotel the bar was empty except for the old man called tommaso and a younger man playing the pinball machine in the corner the proprietor called zen over and handed him his identity card and a bill the hotels closing for repairs you didnt tell me when i checked in im telling you now the pinball player had turned to watch them and zen recognized him he even knew his name patrizio although he had no recollection of how or where they had met what had he been doing all evening abandoning this intractable problem zen swung his feet down on to the icy fioor and stood up this was a mistake previously he had had to deal with the electrical storm in his head a stomach badly corroded by the toxic waste swilling around inside it limbs that twitched joints that ached and a mouth that seemed to have been replaced by a plaster replica the only good news in fact had been that the room wasnt spinning round and round like a fairground ride that was why it had been a mistake standing up washing shaving dressing and packing were so man stations of the cross for aurelio zen that morning but it wasnt until he lit a cigarette in the mistaken belief that it might make him feel better and found tucked inside thc packet of marlboros a book of matches whose cover reaa pizzeria ii nuraghe that the merciful fog obscuring the events of the previous evening suddenly lifted he collapsed on one of the rickety wooden chairs its feet scraping atrociously on the polished floor slabs ze n didnt notice he wasnt in his hotel room any longer he was sitting at the table in the pizzeria drunker than he had ever been in his life horribly monstrously terminally drunk five men three seated and two standing were staring at him with expressions of pure malignant hos tility the situation was totally out of control nothing he could say or do would have any effect whatsoever for a moment he thought that they might be going to assault him but in the end furio padedda and his friend patrizio had just turned away and walked out then the man called turiddu threw some banknotes on the table and he and his companions left too without a word putside the air was thick with scents brought out by the rain creosote wild thyme wood smoke urine motor oil yo judge by the stillness of the street it might have been tpe small hours then a motorcycle engine opened up the night like a crude tinopener all jagged torn edges the pike emerged from the shadows of an alley and moved slowly and menacingly towards zen by the volatile oonlight he recognized the rider as furio padedda the sardinian bestrode the machine like a horse urging it on with tightenings of his knees from a strap around his shoulders hung a doublebarrelled shotgun then a figure appeared in the street some distance ahead cf zen one ahead and one behind the classic ambush the correct procedure was to go on the offensive take out one oi the other before they could complete the squeeze but if zen had been following correct procedures he would never have been there in the first place without any backup even in his prime twenty years ago he couldnt have handled either man never mind both of them as zen approached the blocker he saw that it was turiddu with drunken fatalism he kept walking ten metres five two one he braced himself for the arm across the throat the foot to the groin then he was past and nothing had happened he sensed rather than saw turiddu fall in behind him his footsteps blending with the raucous murmur of padeddas motorcycle zen forced himself not to hurry or look round he walked on past rows of darkened windows closed shutters and locked doors followed by the two men until at last he reached the piazza and the hotel now mulling it over in his room his thoughts crawling through the wreckage of his brain like the stunned sur vivors of an earthquake zen realized that he owed his escape to the enmity between the two sardinians each had no doubt intended to punish the impostor but neithe was prepared to allow the other that honour and co operation was out of the question back at the hotel the proprietor alerted by padeddas associate patrizio had delivered his ultimatum there was no other accom modation in the village and in any case there was no point in zen remaining now that reto gurtner had been exposed as a fraud whatever he said or did everyone would assume that he was a policeman a government spy the farce was over he would drive to cagliari that morning and book a ticket on the night ferry to the main land when he returned to the village it would be in his official capacity at least that way he could compel respect his inability to do so at present was amply demon strated by the length of time it took him to get breakfast in the bar downstairs at least halfadozen of the locals had drifted in and out again replete with cappuccinos and pastries before zen was finally served a lukewarm cup of coffee that tasted as though it had been made from second hand grounds and watered milk goodbye for now he told the proprietor as he stalked out the remark elicited a sharp glance that expressed anxious defiance as well as hostility it gladdened zen for a moment until he reflected that his implied threat was the first step on the path which had led to the gestapo tactics of the past the weather had changed the sky was overcast grey and featureless the air still and humid zens hangover felt like an octopus clinging to every cell of his being although weakening the monster had plenty of life in it yet every movement involved an exhausting struggl against its tenacious resistance he found himself looking forward to sinking luxuriously into the mercedes leather upholstery and driving away from this damned village listening to the radio broadcasts from rome that lovely civilized city where tania was even now rising from her bed sipping her morning coffee even thinking of him perpaps he could allow himself to dream given all hed been through hed surely earned the right to a little harm less selfindulgence halfway across the piazza beside the village war memorial zen had to stop put his suitcase down and catch his breath the dead of the war covered two sides of the rectangular slab the same surname often repeated six or eight times like a litany the sardinians pad formed the core of the italian armys mountain divi sions and half the young men of the village must have died at isonzo and on the piave the later conflicts had taken a lesser toll thirty had died in four in spain and five in abyssinia as zen picked up the leaden suitcase again he noticed a tall thin man in a beige overcoat staring at him curiously his deception would be common knowledge by now he realized and his every action a cause for suspicion he dumped the suitcase in the boot of the mercedes got inside and turned the ignition on nothing happened it was a measure of his befuddlement that it took him several minutes to realize that nothing was going to happen no matter how many times he twisted the key at first he thought he might have drained the battery by leaving the lights on but when he tried the windscreen wipers they worked normally he had invented problems with the mercedes as a way of breaking the ice with turiddu and his friends the night before and the wretched car was apparently now taking its revenge by playing up just when he needed it most then he noticed the envelope tucked under one of the wiper blades like a parking ticket zen got out of the car and plucked it free the envelope was blank inside was a single sheet of paper furio padkdda is a liar he read he was not in the bar the night the foreigners were killed but the melega clan of orgosolo know where he was the message had been printed by a hand seemingly used to wielding larger and heavier implements than a pen the letters were uneven and dissimilar laboriously crafted starting big and bold but crowded together at the righthand margin as though panicked by the prospect of falling off the edge of the page despite his predicament zen couldnt help smiling so the humiliating disaster of the previous night had worked to his advantage after all turiddu had seen an opportu nity to even the score with his rival no doubt easing his conscience with the reflection that zen had not yet been officially identified as a policeman if the information was true it might be just what zen needed to fabricate a case against padedda and so keep palazzo sisti off his back unfortunately turiddus hatred for the foreigner from the mountains whatever its cause did not make him a very reliable informant nevertheless there was some thing about the note which made zen feel that it wasnt pure fiction although in his present condition he couldnt work out what it was he stuffed the letter into his pocket wondering what to do next for no reason at all he decided to ring tania the phone was of the new variety that accepted coins as well as tokens zen fed in his entire supply of change and dialled the distant number never had modern technology seemed more miraculous to him than it did then stranded in a hostile povertystricken sardinian village listening to a telephone ringing in tanias flat a universe away in rome yes it was a mans voice abrupt and badtempered signora biacis please whos speaking im calling from the ministry of the interior for christs sake dont you know this is sunday certainly i know he replied impatiently the coins were dropping through the machine with alarming fre quency do you think i like having to work today either what do you want with my wife i am afraid thats confidential just let me speak to her please oh no certainly not and dont bother ringing any more signore because she isnt in she wont be in nog ever not for you understand dont think i dont know wpats going on behind my back you think im a fool gont you a simpleton well youre wrong about that ill peach you to play games with a bevilacqua understand i know what youve been doing and ill make you pay for it adulterer fornicator at this point zens money ran out sparing him the rest of mauro bevilacquas tirade he walked despondently pack to the mercedes by now the octopus had slackened its grip somewhat but it still took zen five minutes tp work out how to open the bonnet once he had done so however he realized at once why the car would not start this was no credit to his mechanical knowledge which was nonexistent but even he could see that the spray of wires sticking out of the centre of the motor each cut cleanly through meant that some essential component had been deliberately removed he closed the bonnet and looked around the piazza the phone box was now occupied by the man in the beige overcoat with a deep sigh zen reluctantly returned to the hotel why on earth should anyone want to prevent him from leaving did padedda need time to cover his tracks or was this sabotage turiddus way of reconciling his anonymous letter with the burdensome demands of omerta the proprietor greeted zens reappearance with a per fectly blank face as though he had never seen him before my cars broken down zen told him is there a taxi service a car hire anything like that theres a bus what time does it leave six oclock in the evening in the morning zen gritted his teeth then he remembered the railway down in the valley it was a long walk but by now he was prepared to consider anything to get out of this cursed place and the train doesnt run on sunday the proprietor added as though reading his thoughts a phone started ringing in the next room the pro prietor went to answer it zen sat down at one of the tables and lit a cigarette he felt close to despair just as he had received information that might well make his mission a success every door had suddenly slammed shut in his face at this rate he would have to phone the carabinieri at lanusei and ask them nicely to come and pick him up it was the last thing he wanted to do to avoid compromising his undercover operation he hacf left behind all his official identification so involving the rival force would involve lengthy explanations and verifi cations in the course of which his highly questionabe business here would inevitably be revealed probabli stymieing his chances of bringing the affair to a satisfac tory conclusion but there appeared to be no alternative unless he wanted to spend the night in the street or cave like the beggar woman he looked up as the thin man in the beige overcoat walked in instead of going up to the bar he headed for the table where zen was sitting good morning dottore zen stared at him you dont recognize me the man asked he seemed disappointed zen inspected him more carefully he was about forty years old with the soft pallid look of those who work indoors at first sight he had seemed tall but zen now realized that this was due to the mans extreme thinness and to the fact that zen had by now adjusted to the sardinian norm as far as he knew he had never seen him before in his life why should i he retorted crossly the man drew up a chair and sat down why indeed its like at school isnt it the pupils all remember their teacher even years later but you cant expect the teacher to recall all the thousands of kids who pave passed through their hands at one time or other but i still recognize you dottore i knew you right away you havent aged very much or perhaps you were already old even then he took out a packet of the domestic toscani cigars and broke one in half replacing one end in the packet and putting the other between his lips have you got a light zen automatically handed over his lighter he felt as though all this was happening to someone else someone who perhaps understood what was going on certainly he didnt the man lit the cigar with great care rotating it constantly never letting the flame touch the tobacco when it was glowing satisfactorily he slipped the lighter into his pocket but thats mine zen protested like a child whose toy has been taken away you wont be needing it any more ill keep it as a souvenir he stood up and took his coat off draping it over a chair then walked over to the bar and rapped on the chrome surface with his knuckles eh service the proprietor emerged from the back room scowling furiously give me a glass of beer something decent not any of your local crap shorn of his coat the mans extreme thinness was even more apparent it gave him a disturbing twodimensional appearance as though when he turned sideways he might disappear altogether the proprietor banged a bottle and a glass down on the counter ooo lire the thin man threw a banknote down negligently theres five have a drink on me maybe itll cheer you up he carried the bottle and glass back to the table ang proceeded to pour the beer as carefully as he had lit the cigar tilting the glass and the bottle towards each other so that only a slight head formed miserable fuckers these sardinians he commented to zen forgive me if i dont shake hands someone once told me that its bad luck and i certainly dont need any more of that strange though you not remembering my face maybe the name means something vasco spadola time passed a lot perhaps or a little the thin man sat and smoked and sipped his beer until zen finally found his voice how did you know where i was it was a stupid question but perhaps all questions were stupid at this point spadola picked up his overcoat patted the pockets and pulled out the previous days edition of la nazione which he tossed on the table i read about it in the paper zen turned the newspaper round halfway down the page was a photograph of himself he barely recognized it must have been taken years ago dug out of the news papers morgue he thought he looked callow and cock sure ridiculously selfimportant beneath the photograph was an article headed new evidence in burolo affair zen skimmed the text according to sources close to the family of renato favelloni accused of plotting the murders at the villa burolo dramatic new evidence has recently come to light in this case resulting in the reopening of a line of esggation previously regarded as closed a senior of the ministrys elite criminalpol squad vice questore aurelio zen is being sent to sardinia to assess ang coordinate developments at the scene further announcements are expected shortly zen put the paper down of course he should have guessed that palazzo sisti would take care to publicize his imminent trip to the area in order to ensure that the dramatic new evidence he fabricated got proper attention from the judiciary shame i missed you in rome spadola told him giuliano spent over a week setting the whole thing up watching your apartment picking the locks leaving those little messages to soften you up by that friday we were all set to go i didnt know youd sussed the car though giuliano was always a bit careless about things like that same with that tape he took instead of your wallet it comes of being an eldest son i reckon mammas favourite you think you can get away with anything he paused to draw on his cigar when the cops rolled up i had to beat it out the back way i was lucky to get away carrying the gun and all i had to dump it in a rubbish skip and come back for it later all that effort gone to waste and what was worse theyd got giuliano i knew he wouldnt have the balls to hold out once they got to work on him i reckoned id have to lie low for months waiting for you to get fed up being shepherded about by a minder or holed up in some safehouse i certainly didnt expect to be sitting chatting to you in a cafe two days later he broke out in gleeful laughter even when i read the report in the paper i never expected it to be this easy i thought you would be staying in some barracks somewhere guarded day and night escor ted around in bulletproof limousines still i had to come you never know your luck i thought but never in my wildest dreams did i imagine anything like this the door of the bar swung open to admit tommaso and another elderly man they greeted the proprietor loudly and shot nervous glances at zen and spadola zen ground out his cigarette all right so youve found me what now spadola released a breath of cigar smoke into the air above zens head what now why im going to kill you of course he took a gulp of beer thats why i didnt want to shake hands one of the people i met in prison used to be a soldier for the parioio family in naples you worked there once didnt you gianni ferrazzi does the name ring a bell it might have been after your time anyway this lad had twenty or thirty hits to his credit he couldnt remember himself exactly how many and everything went fine until he shook hands with the victim before doing the job he hadnt meant to he knew it was bad luck but they were introduced the man stuck out his paw what was he supposed to do it would have looked suspicious if hed refused he still went ahead and made the hit though even though he knew hed go down for it thats what i call real professionalism to be honest i thought that it would be a bit like that with you impersonal i mean anonymous like a paid hit thats the way it was with bertolini unfortunately i just hadnt thought the thing through that first time the bastard never even knew why he died i had enough to cope with what with his driver pulling a gun and his wife screaming her head off from the house i realized after wards that i wanted a lot more than that otherwise i might just as well hire it out and save myself the trouble i mean the victims got to understand hes got to know who you are and why youre doing it otherwise what kind of revenge is it so i swore that you and parrucci would be different i certainly got my moneys worth out of him but you were ore difficult once this terrorist scare started after i shot gertolini it seemed too risky to try and kidnap someone m the ministry they would have cracked down hard i gad no intention of getting caught ive done twenty years for a murder i didnt commit so they owe me this one free he leant back in his chair with a blissful smile ah but i never imagined anything like this to sit here like two old friends chatting at a table and tell you that im going to kill you and you knowing its true that youre going to die and all the time those two old bas tards over there are discussing the price of sheeps milk or some fucking thing and the barmans cleaning the coffee machine and the televisions blatting away next door and the icecream freezer in the corner is humming and youre going to die im going to kill you while all this is going on and itll still go on once youre dead because youre not needed zen none of us are have you ever thought about that i have i spent twenty years thinking about it twenty years locked up for a murder i didnt even do spadola squeezed the last puff of acrid smoke from his cigar and threw that butt on the floor you want to know who killed tondelli his cousin thats who it was over a woman a barroom scuffle once he was dead the tondellis saw a way to use it against me and paid that cunt parrucci to perjure himself you bas tards did the rest but even supposing i had killed him so what people die all the time one way or another it doesnt make a fucking bit of difference to anything thats what you cant admit you others thats what scares you shitless and so you make little rules and regu lations like at school and anyone who breaks them has to stand in the corner with a dunces cap on what a load of bullshit the truth of it is that youre the first to break the rules to cheat and lie and perjure yourselves to get a lousy rise a better job or a fatter pension youre the ones who ought to be punished and believe it or not my friend thats whats going to happen just this once take it in zen youre going to die soon today and im telling you this warning you and you know its true and yet therc absolutely nothing whatsoever that you can do about it not a single fucking thing spadola put his fingers to his lips and blew a kiss up into the air like a connoisseur appreciating a fine wine this is the ultimate ive never felt anything like it it makes up for everything well no lets not exaggerate nothing could make up for what ive been through but it its any consolation youve made me a very happy man today you destroyed my life its true but you have also given me this moment my mother may she rest in peace used to say that i was destined to great sorrows and great joys and she was right she was so right he broke off biting his lip tears welled up in his eyes i suppose its no use telling you that i had nothing to do with the evidence against you being faked zen said dully spadola rocked violently back and forth in his chair as though seized by an involuntary spasm i dont believe it this is too much its too good to be true he panted for breath do you remember what you said that morning at the farm near melzo i told you i was innocent i told you i hadnt done it i knew id been betrayed and that made it all the harder to bear if id really knifed that fucking southerner youd never have got a word out of me but knowing it was all a fix i thought id go crazy and do you know what you said when i screamed my innocence in your face you said yes well you would say that wouldnt you and you looked at me in that sly way you educated people have when youre feeling pleased with yourselves of course you had nothiny to do with it dottore just like this whatshisname th politician in this murder case youre investigating he didnt have anything to do with it either did he people like you never do have anything to do with it i dont mean that i didnt plant the knife myself i mean i digng even know that it had been planed it was done witgoup my knowledge behind my back then youre an incompetent bastard it was your case your responsibility ive spent twenty years of my life the only one ill ever have shut up in a stinking damp cell witg parely room to turn around locked up for hours in tpe freezingcold darkness he broke off shuddering uncontrollably his cheeks glistening wet qo on take a good look im not ashamed of my tears why should i be theyre pearls of suffering my suffering i should make you lick them up one by one before i blow your evil head off cut the crap spadola zen exploded ven if you didnt do the tondelli job you were guilty as hell of at least four other murders what about ugo trocchio and his brother you had them killed and you know it we knew it everyone knew it we couldnt prove it because people were too scared to talk and so it went on until some of my colleagues decided that it was time you were taken out of circulation since they couldnt do it straight they did it crooked as i say i didnt know if i had known i would have tried to stop it but the fact remains that you earned that twentyyear sentence several times over thats not the point spadola shouted so loudly that the men at the bar turned to stare at him christ almighty if everyone who broke the law in this country was sent to prison whod be left to guard them wed need a whole new set of politicians for a start but it doesnt work that way does it its a game and i was good i was fucking brilliant you couldnt pin a damn thing on me i had you beat inside out so you moved the goal posts thats part of the game too spadola drained off his beer and stood up maybe but the game stops here zen what happens now is real his voice was perfectly calm again he stood staring down at zen i know what youre thinking you think im crazy telling you what im going to do warning you giving you a chance to escape theres no way i can get away with thats what youre thinking isnt it not in broad daylight in the middle of this village well well see maybe youre right i agree that thats a possibility maybe youre cleverer than me maybe youll figure out a way to save your skin this time around that doesnt worry me ill get you in the end whatever happens and meanwhile that slim hope is part of your punishment zen just like i was tormented with talk of appeals and parole that never came to anything he put on his overcoat youve probably noticed that your cars not working i removed the distributor and cut the leads just to save you time ill tell you that the phone box is out of order now too as for the locals i doubt it theyd tell you the time by the clock on the wall i showed them the paper you see told them who you are oddly enough they didnt seem terribly surprised between the two of us i think they must have sussed you out already so ill see you later dottore i cant say when exactly thats part of the punishment too it could be in a few minutes i might suddenly get the urge or it might not be until late tonight it all depends on my mood how im feeling ill know when the moment has come ill sense it dont worry about the pain itll be quick and clean i promise nothing fancy like with parrucci i really had it in for him in a big way they used to call him the night ingale didnt they because of how beautifully he sang i suppose he turned out to be more of a screamer though in the end i had to take a walk i couldnt handle it myself he was tougher than he looked though when i got back an hour or so later he was still whimpering what was left i had to finish him off with a pistol sickening reagg well im off for a piss pe walked across the restaurant area and disappeared through a door marked toilets let me use your phone zen told the proprietor that man is an excriminal he has threatened to kill me im a picequestore at the ministry of the interior if you dont pelp youll be an accessory to murder the proprietor gazed at him stonily but your name is reto gurtner ive seen your papers youre a swiss businessman from zurich my name is aurelio zen im a highranking official prove it let me use the phone quickly before he comes back theres no phone here but i heard it ringing when i came in that was the television given a few more minutes zen might have been able to change the mans mind with a combination of threats and pleas but the few seconds before vasco spadola re appeared were too precious to gamble on that slim possi bility besides it would take the carabinieri at least fifteen minutes to reach the village and that would be plenty of time for spadola to carry out his threat zen turned and ran outside in the piazza people had begun to gather for the promenade before lunch zen stood uncertainly by the door who could he turn to angelo confalone but it was sunday the lawyers office would be closed and zen had no idea where he lived for a moment he thought of appealing to the crowd of throwing himself on their mercy but there was no time to indulge in public oratory and besides he had been branded a spy a proven liar an agent of the hated government in rome anyone who helped him would risk placing his own position in the community in jeopardy spadola was right he was on his own then he saw the mercedes and realized that there was just one faint hope it hung by the narrowest of threads but he had nothing to lose anything was better than skulking about the village hiding in corners waiting to be routed out and killed as he shoved his way unceremoniously through the knots of bystanders zen noticed turiddu standing in a group of other men they were all staring at him talking in iow voices and pointing at a yellow fiat uno with rome number plates parked nearby to one side all alone stood elia the mad beggar woman zen belatedly noted the resemblance between her and turiddu and realized that he must he the brother she had rejected that explained his anger on finding her at the pizzeria the night before a community like this a mentally ill relative would be perpetual source of shame he released the handbrake of the mercedes and put the gearleaver into neutral then he got out and started to push with all his might struggling to overcome the vehicles inertia and the slight inclin leading up to th main street his headache sprang back into achve life and his aching limbs protested after a violent effort the cir rolled on to the cracked concrete slabs of the street zen turned the wheel so that it was facing downhill then got moving and jumped back inside soon the car was rolliny quite fast down the steeply inclined main street and round the curve leading out of the village he wasnt in the clenr yet not by a long way but he was exhilarated by his initial success by the time he reached the new houses on the outskirts the car was travelling as fast as he would wanted to go anyway he even had to use the horn several times to warn groups of villagers of his silent approach when i saw him leaving i thought everything was lost ld followed him everywhere gun in hand flitting through the shadows like a swift at dusk all for nothing there was always someone there foiling my plans as though some god protected him and now he was beyond my reach he thought he was safe i thought id failed what neither of us understood was that his death was already installed in him lodged in his body like our sins in the bleeding heart above the fireplace i used tn think the ireart was from one of the pigs father hgd slaughtered i kept expecting to find the beasts guts on another wall and its cock and balls nailed to the door once the lunp went out in the middle of a thunderstorm and mother made me get down on my knees and pray to be forgiven or god would strike us dead on the spot so i knelt to the great pig in the sky whosefarts terrified mother praying it wouldnt shit all over us which is just what it did a little later on be careful what you pray for you might give god ideas i wandered off neither knowing nvr caring where i went all places were equal noxo mygeet brought me here like a horse that knows its own way home he would be far away i thought speeding through the corridors of light in his big white car but there was only one exit from the maze in which we both were trapped even as i despaired he was on his way there bringing me the death i needed
