 walter sherwoods probation by horatio alger jr author of facing the world hectors inheritance helping himself jacks ward etc etc chapter i walter sherwoods letter heres a letter for you doctor mack said the housekeeper as she entered the plain room used as a library and sittingroom by her employer doctor ezekiel mack its from walter i surmise this was a favorite word with miss nancy sprague who though a housekeeper prided herself on having been a schoolmistress in her earlier days indeed nancy let me see it walter is really getting attentive his last letter came to hand only two days since he hasnt forgotten his old guardian oh no sir hell never do that he has a predilection for his old home his heart is in the right place just so i wish i felt as sure about his head doctor mack adjusted his spectacles for he was rising sixty and his eyes required assistance and opened the letter as he read it his forehead contracted and he looked disturbed a perusal of the letter may help us to understand why it ran as follows dear guardian you will be surprised at hearing from me so soon again but i am really forced to write i find college life much more expensive than i supposed it would be a fellow is expected to join two or three societies and each costs money i know you wouldnt have me appear mean then the students have been asked to contribute to a fund for the enlargement of the library and almost every day there is a demand for money for one object or another as it is nearly the end of the term i calculate that with a check for an extra hundred dollars i can get along i am awfully sorry to ask for it but it will come out of the money father left me and i am sure he would wish me to keep up appearances and not fall behind the rest of the boys i stand fairly well in my studies and i expect to be stroke oar of the college boat club besides this i have been elected catcher of the college baseball club i am thought to excel in athletic sports and really enjoy my college life very much please send me the check by return of mail affectionately yours walter doctor mack laid the letter on the table and slowly removed the glasses from his nose one hundred dollars he repeated that is the second extra check he has written for this term then his regular term bills will come due in two weeks he is spending more than three times as much as i did when in college forty years have made a difference no doubt but not so great a difference as that i hope the boy isnt falling into extravagant habits i care for that more than for the money his father left a good fortune of which fact he is unfortunately aware but i dont mean that it shall spoil him now what shall i do shall i send him the check or not doctor mack leaned back in his chair and thought busily he felt anxious about his ward who had entered college early and was now only seventeen walter sherwood was a boy of excellent talent and popular manners but he was inclined to be selfindulgent and had a large capacity for enjoyment his guardian had fondly hoped that he would lead the class in scholarship but instead of this he was only doing fairly well in his studies to be sure he excelled in athletic sports but as doctor mack reflected this was not generally considered the chief aim in a college course except by some of the students themselves i wish i knew just how walter is making out thought the doctor then after a pause he resumed with a sudden inspiration why shouldnt i know ill go over to euclid tomorrow with out giving walter any intimation of my visit and see for myself it may be stated here that walter sherwood was a member of the sophomore class in euclid college situated in the town of the same name if the reader does not find euclid in a list of american colleges it is because for special reasons i have thought it best to conceal the real name of the college not wishing to bring the institution into possible disrepute there are some who might misjudge the college because it contained some students who made an unprofitable use of their time nancy said doctor mack at the suppertable you may pack a handbag for me i shall start on a journey tomorrow morning where to sir if i may make so bold as to inquire i think of going to euclid to see master walter exactly you havent heard any bad news i hope said the housekeeper anxiously oh no then he isnt sick quite the contrary he is quite strong and athletic i should judge from his letter he will be glad to see you sir well perhaps so but you know nancy young people dont miss their parents and guardians as much as they are missed at home they have plenty of excitement and society at college yes sir thats true but im sure master walter wont forget his old home if you have room for some cookies i will put some into the bag walter is fond of them no i think you neednt do it nancy he has a good boardinghouse and no doubt he gets all the cakes he wants by the way i want to take the boy by surprise so dont write and let him know im coming no sir i wont this was exactly what the housekeeper had intended to do for she presumed upon her long service in the family to write a few lines occasionally to the boy whom she had known from the age of six of course i shall be pleased to give him any message from you thank you doctor mack tell him if he catches cold i can send him some camomile camomile tea is excellent in such cases my mother and grandmother used it all their lives you seem to forget that i am a doctor nancy not that i object to camomile tea in its place though i can truly say that i never hankered after it how long will you be gone doctor i cant say exactly you see euclid is nearly two hundred miles off and i dont know whether i can make connections oh well dont hurry no doubt walter will want to keep you with him as long as possible i dont feel so sure of that thought the doctor shrewdly boys are not usually so fond of the society of their guardians though i dont doubt walter has a sincere regard for me he is a warmhearted boy doctor mack was no longer in active practice three years before he had selected an assistant a young doctor winthrop in whom his patients had come to feel confidence so that when he wanted to go away for a few days there was no serious objection unlike some elderly practitioners doctor mack did not feel in the least jealous of his young assistant but was very glad to note his popularity if any one calls for me nancy he said say that i am away for a day or two and they cant do better than go to doctor winthrop there are some that like you best sir no doubt no doubt theyre used to me you know theres a good deal in that any that please can wait for me but my advice to them is to go to doctor winthrop nancy packed the doctors handbag putting in a change of linen a comb and brush an extra pair of socks and a couple of handkerchiefs then seeing that there was plenty of room she slipped in a small box of cookies and a little camomile the doctor discovered them soon after he started on his journey and with a smile tossed the camomile out of the window while he gave the cookies to a poor woman who was traveling with a couple of small children in the same car as himself so that nancy spragues thoughtfulness was not wholly lost though the intended recipient did not benefit by it doctor mack had to wait over at a junction for three hours owing to some irregularities of the trains and did not reach euclid till rather a late hour in the afternoon he went to the euclid hotel and entered his name e mack albany without adding md and substituting albany for the small village thirty miles away where he made his home strategy doctor strategy he said to himself i have come to spy out the land and must not make myself too conspicuous i am traveling as it were incognito chapter ii dr mack gets some information the euclid hotel was distant about half a mile from the college buildings it would hardly have paid expenses but for the patronage it received from the parents and friends of the students who especially on public occasions were drawn to visit euclid and naturally put up at the hotel then the students tired perhaps of the fare at the college commons dropped in often and ordered a dinner so take it all in all euclid hotel benefited largely by the presence of the college no students however were permitted to board there as it was thought by the college professors that the atmosphere of the hotel would be detrimental to college discipline and the steady habits they desired to inculcate in the young men under their care i wonder thought doctor mack after supper was over whether i had better go round to the college and make an evening call on walter he was tempted to do so for he was fond of his young ward and would have enjoyed seeing him but then he wished unobserved to judge for himself whether walter was making good use of his privileges and this made it injudicious for him to disclose his presence in the college town he strolled out into the tavern yard and observed a young man engaged in some light duties good evening sir said the young man respectfully good evening i suppose you are connected with the hotel yes sir but i would rather be connected with the college then you have a taste for study yes sir i began to prepare for college and had made some progress in latin and greek when my father died and that put an end to my prospects that was a pity has it destroyed your taste for study no i spend an hour after i am through work in keeping up my latin and greek but of course i make slow progress naturally now i have no doubt there are many students who do not appreciate their privileges as much as you do i know it sir there are pretty lively boys in college have you a son there no i didnt know but what you might have what do you mean by lively i mean they care more to have a good time than to get on in their studies what do they do well some of them belong to societies and have a good time whenever they meet frequently they give little suppers at the hotel here and keep it up till a late hour do the faculty know of this they may surmise something but they dont interfere of course it pays mr daniels the landlord for he charges a good round sum and as there is no other place for the boys to go they must pay it theres going to be a supper here tonight indeed it is given by one of the sophomores walter sherwood what name did you mention asked doctor mack startled walter sherwood do you know him i know a family by the name of sherwood answered doctor mack evasively what sort of a young man is he i dont call him a young man he is only seventeen or eighteen one of the youngest members of the class he is very popular among his mates a regular jolly boy he is does he stand well in his scholarship the young man laughed i dont think he troubles himself much about studies he replied from all i hear but he is pretty smart learns easily and manages to keep up respectably doctor macks heart sank within him was this the best that could be said about his ward the son of his old friend do you think he is dissipated he asked uneasily not that i ever heard he is fond of having a good time and drinks wine at his suppers but he isnt what you would call intemperate he would do better work in college if he wasnt so rich so he is rich then he must be for he spends a good deal of money pendleton one of his classmates told me that he spent more money than any one in the class that is why he needs so many extra checks thought the guardian soberly i am sorry he doesnt make better use of his privileges he said aloud yes sir it is a pity if he didnt care so much for a good time he might stand at the head of his class so pendleton thinks if he were a poor boy now you think the result would be different asked doctor mack thoughtfully yes sir i have no doubt of it when does the supper commence at halfpast eight oclock how long will it keep up till near midnight the landlord makes it a point to have them close before twelve i hope they wont disturb you sir are they likely to make much noise well sir they make speeches and do a good deal of singing then college songs are naturally noisy yes so i hear what is the number of your room number nine why you are nearly opposite the room where they will have their supper i am afraid you wont stand much chance of sleeping early oh never mind i shall get an idea of what a college supper is like so you will if you open the transom over your door you will have the full benefit of all that goes on that will suit me very well thought doctor mack if you would like to be farther away the landlord would no doubt change your room oh no said the doctor hastily it will suit me very well for once to listen to college songs and get an idea of how college boys enjoy themselves a very sensible old gentleman thought james holden some men of his age would make a fuss a little before the time when the students were expected to arrive doctor mack shut himself up in his room taking care to open the transom he had ascertained from the young man his informant that supper had been engaged for twelve and that the price charged per plate was two dollars and a half all to be paid by walter sherwood that makes thirty dollars he reflected no wonder walter writes for extra checks i wonderin this thirty dollars is to figure as a contribution to the library from his window he could see the students as they approached the hotel finally he caught sight of walter with a college friend on each sides with whom he was chatting gaily what a change thought doctor mack it seems only yesterday that walter started for college a bashful unformed boy full of good resolutions and determined to distinguish himself in scholarship now he has become a gay butterfly and what is worse he has learned to deceive his old guardian and his chief aim seems to be to have a good time what can i do to change his course the good doctors face assumed a thoughtful look i can tell better after what i shall hear tonight he said to himself it was not long before the guests were all assembled and the feast was to begin some one rapped for attention and then doctor mack recognized the voice of his young ward gentlemen he said i am glad to welcome you to this festal board after spending ten or a dozen hours in hard study laughter and applause we find it pleasant to close our books to relax our learned brows more laughter and show our appreciation of the good things of life as horace your favorite says i wont insult you by offering to translate his wellknown words dulce est desipere in loco that is what has brought us here tonight we want to desipere in loco so we do good for you exclaimed one and another i regret walter continued that all the professors have declined my urgent invitation to be present on this occasion professor griggs the professor of mathematics said he would not break away from his regular diet of logarithms and radicals great laughter i have expressly requested mr daniels to provide no logarithms tonight they dont agree with my constitution nor with mine nor with mine echoed one and another i shall expect you all after the banquet to do something for the general entertainment i stipulate however that none of the company address us in latin or greek we wont we wont sufficient for the recitationroom is the evil thereof but i have spoken long enough there are times when silence is golden and one of those times is at hand brethren the feast awaits you pitch in the speaker took his seat and then there was a noise of clinking glasses and knives and forks came to the front the banquet had begun chapter iii a college banquet there was a rattling of knives and forks a clink of glasses and a buzz of conversation doctor mack was able to hear considerable of it there were anecdotes of the professors accounts of narrow escapes from flunking in the recitationroom and remarks by no means complimentary to some of the textbooks in use in college it was evident that the collegians assembled cared more for a good time than for study yet these seemed to be the chosen associates of his ward the doctor reflected as the feast proceeded he grew more sober he felt that college life however much it was doing for the faithful students was only fostering selfindulgence in his ward something must be done reflected doctor mack desperate diseases require desperate remedies again the chairman rapped for order and again walters voice was heard brothers he said the material part of our banquet is ended we have gratified our appetites with the savory dishes provided by our friend daniels we have quaffed the rare falernian wine of a vintage unknown to horace we have quickened our wits as i trust under those favorable conditions and the time has now come for the feast of reason and the flow of soul exhausted as we are by our labors in the classroom great laughter we have sought refreshment in the way that is most agreeable its a way we have at old euclid sing immediately the assembled company started up the wellknown college song its a way we have at old euclid its a way we have at old euclid its a way we have at old euclid to drive dull care away its a way we have at old euclid its a way we have at old euclid to drive dull care away and we think it is no sin sir to take the freshmen in sir and ease them of their tin sir to drive dull care away its a way we have at old euclid its a way we have at old euclid to drive dull care away there were other verses but these will serve as specimens all joined in the chorus and doctor mack who remembered his own college life felt almost tempted to add his voice to those of the young men in the opposite room but pshaw he thought what would walter and his friends think to hear an old graybeard like me taking part in the convivial songs there is no great harm in singing college songs if it is accompanied by good work in the recitationroom brothers resumed walter we will do our best to drive dull care away let us forget this happy evening that there are such things as logarithms and sines and tangents and greek tragedies tonight our hearts shall be uplifted by sentiment and song brother corbett you will oblige us with rumsty ho a young man with a pleasant voice sang this song one unfamiliar to the doctor a beggar man laid himself down to sleep rumsty ho rumsty ho a beggar man laid himself down to sleep by the banks of the mersey so high and steep rumsty ho rumsty ho two thieves came walking by that way rumsty ho rumsty ho two thieves came walking by that way and they came to the place where the old man lay rumsty ho rumsty ho they stole his wallet and they stole his staff rumsty ho rumsty ho they stole his wallet and they stole his staff and then broke out in a great horselaugh rumsty ho rumsty ho there was more of this song too next came crambambuli and then cocachlunk both of which were familiar to the doctor then walter said brothers i have great pleasure in stating that professor griggs has concluded to honor our dinner by his learned presence and has consented to address us permit me to introduce professor theophilus griggs one of the company had made up as the mathematical professor in a nasal tone he made a rambling speech in which he introduced mathematical allusions and used some of the favorite phrases of the rather dull and prosy instructor with whom all the students were familiar some to their sorrow it seemed to be very amusing to the boys present as shown by their hearty laughter but of course doctor mack could not appreciate it other songs and other speeches followed though for the most part college songs there were some of a more serious character time slipped by and at length doctor mack saw by his watch that it was halfpast eleven how long will they keep it up i wonder he asked himself i feel drowsy he was answered by the chairman brothers he said time waits for no man the hour has arrived when according to agreement we must wind up our festivities hand in hand we will sing auld lang syne hoping at some auspicious season after the coming vacation is over to have another good time i thank you all for accepting my invitation and hope you have enjoyed yourselves three cheers for sherwood cried one of the company they were given with a will then the parting song was sung and the students retired to their rooms in one of the college dormitories doctor mack went thoughtfully to bed it is well i came he reflected walter has done nothing decidedly wrong as yet but it is evident he is not improving well said james holdens as he met doctor mack the next morning did you hear the boys last night i couldnt very well help it answered the doctor smiling that young sherwood seems to be very popular yes sir he is very free with his money in what other way does he spend it mr daniels keeps half a dozen horses to let to students and others sherwood hires a team at least twice a week and of course it counts up i was not able to spend money in that way when i attended college then you are a college graduate said holden yes did you graduate at euclid no i am a yale man i congratulate you sir i should like to graduate from yale i hope you may some time my young friend you would derive more benefit ill be bound than those young roysterers of last evening i hope they didnt keep you awake sir they certainly did as long as they stayed i should have gone to bed soon afterward but that i had something on my mind by the way dont mention to any of the students that they had an unseen listener no sir doctor mack took the first train after breakfast and returned to his home without seeing his ward nancy sprague questioned him eagerly and how is master walter she asked very well indeed nancy was he surprised to see you he didnt see me nancy he didnt see you ejaculated the housekeeper no the fact was i went away on a matter of business and it was not convenient to call on walter but i heard him i dont see how you could have been near him without seeing him i shall see him soon nancy and so will you in two weeks vacation will be here examinations are near and i might have interfered with his studies the doctor added with a little innocent evasion to be sure sir to be sure i make no doubt master walter is a great scholar i have very strong doubts on that point myself thought doctor mack but he did not care to express himself thus to nancy i am so glad the dear boy is coming home soon murmured the housekeeper he has been studying so hard he needs a good long rest i will make some cookies expressly for him after he comes i dont believe he gets any at college i wonder what nancy would say if she could have seen walter presiding at the supper and heard the songs thought doctor mack chapter iv the day after the feast the same morning in a comfortably furnished room in simpson hall sat or rather lounged walter sherwood i feel sleepy this morning gates he said to his chum i cant fix my mind on this confounded logic no wonder sherwood you have good reason to be tired after last evening thats so we had a good time though i am sorry you couldnt accept my invitation i couldnt afford it sherwood you know we are very differently situated you are rich while i am the oldest son of a country minister with all i can do to get through college as it is i shall be in debt why not be in debt to me you never would accept anything from me yes i did i have let you go to the entire expense of furnishing this room though i have an equal share in it oh thats nothing you pay me in helping me through my lessons when i am behind if you hadnt read my horace to me the other day i should have flunked as sure as can be it would be better for you to get your own lesson walter well i suppose it would answered his roommate yawning i wish you could drive this logic into my head i suppose i am unusually stupid this morning suppose we go over it together fifteen minutes later walter said complacently thanks old fellow you have made it as plain as a pikestaff and very likely you will get a higher mark at the recitation than i well perhaps so laughed walter i suppose it is because i have more cheek than you you can do better on slight preparation certainly you talk like a professor when you are on your feet you want to be a professor some time gates dont you yes answered his chum his face flushing i should be proud to become a professor in old euclid it would be awfully slow i think returned walter stifling a yawn what then is your ambition i want to go out among men i want to take an active part in the world you will have to work harder than you do in college then i suppose i shall but i am young gates i am only seventeen and i am nineteen and look twentyone all the better the older you look the better if you are going to be a college instructor i would have to wait a long time if i wanted to even if i were a good deal wiser than i am now i am so young in short that i can afford to have a good time it seems to me that is all you think of sherwood oh well ill reform in time and become a sober old duffer like you and walter sherwood laughed carelessly i hope at any rate that you will change your views of life you know what longfellow says life is real life is earnest oh yes i know that by heart but its no use gates you cant make an old man of me before my time will it disturb you if i play a tune or two on my violin well to tell the truth it will i want to get my greek lesson and you had better do the same no i will read a novel and you can read over the greek to me when you have dug it out i will if you wish but i am afraid i am spoiling you by doing your studying for you remember i was out late last night you have something almost every evening walter oh well ill turn over a new leaf next term why not begin now if you knew how stupid i feel you wouldnt ask walter stretched himself out on a comfortable lounge and took up a new novel which he had partially read while gates spread the big greek lexicon on the studytable and opening his aristophanes began slowly and laboriously to translate it into english fifteen minutes passed when a knock was heard at the door come in called out walter he looked up eagerly hoping the visitor might prove to be one of his jovial comrades of the night before but he did not look so well pleased when as the door opened he caught sight of the pudgy figure and shrewd face of elijah daniels the proprietor of the euclid hotel good morning mr daniels he said rather apprehensively so you have found me out no i have found you in returned the landlord with a smile i hope i dont intrude upon your studies young gentlemen well i am taking a little rest from my labors said walter you were up rather late last evening mr sherwood thats a fact and you gave us a firstclass supper daniels you did yourself proud i did my best mr sherwood and i am glad you were satisfied all the fellows praised the supper thats good i know what you young gentlemen like and i get it no matter what it costs i dont make much on the suppers i give the college boys but of course i like to please them your price is quite reasonable i think i am glad you do i have brought in the bill for last nights entertainment and if you can let me have the money i shall be glad well the fact is daniels i havent got the money by me this morning the landlords countenance changed i like prompt pay he said it is a good deal of trouble and as i said there isnt much money to be made thats all right you wont have to wait long how long mr sherwood i expect a check for a hundred dollars from my guardian today i wrote three days since for i knew you wouldnt like to wait a hundred dollars repeated the landlord feeling a little easier in mind yes perhaps your guardian may object to sending it oh no hes a nice old fellow doctor mack is he is very indulgent what name did you mention doctor mack ezekiel mack indeed why we had a gentleman stopping at the hotel last night of that name what ejaculated walter in astonishment do you mean to tell me that doctor mack my guardian was at the hotel last night it cant be he would have called on me it may not have been the same man now i come to think of it he didnt put himself down on the book doctor mack he just put himself down e mack he seemed a plain sort of man where did he register from asked walter eagerly from albany is he at the hotel now he went away by the morning train then it couldnt have been he said walter in a tone of relief he doesnt live in albany besides he would have called on me no it must have been some other mack perhaps you wouldnt have liked to have him catch you at a gay supper mr sherwood said the landlord shrewdly well no id a little rather receive him in my room with a book open before me he might object to pay out money for such doings he wont know anything about it just leave your bill mr daniels and as soon as i get the check ill call round and pay it theres another bill too a livery bill i brought that along too how much is it asked walter anxiously eighteen dollars i didnt think it was as much as that bills mount up faster than you young gentlemen think for i suppose however you can afford to pay it oh yes said walter carelessly your uncle may think it rather steep eh i wrote him that i had some extra expenses this time then i suppose you cant do anything for me this morning no daniels just leave both bills and i feel quite sure that i can pay you in a day or two i suppose you can change a check ill manage to the landlord retired leaving the bills behind him do you know sherwood said his chum gravely i think you are foolishly extravagant well perhaps i am you are spending three times as much as i am ill do better next term i wish my guardian would hurry along that check two days later a letter came for walter in the familiar handwriting of doctor mack he tore it open hastily and as he read it he turned pale and sank into a chair whats the matter asked gates matter enough answered walter in a hollow voice my money is lost and ive got to leave college chapter v walter takes matters philosophically walters announcement recorded at the close of the preceding chapter fell like a thunderbolt on his roommate you have lost your money repeated gates in a tone of incredulity you dont mean it read that letter gates said walter pushing it over to his chum the letter was of course from doctor mack and ran thus dear walter your letter asking for an extra check for one hundred dollars came to hand three or four days since i have delayed answering for two reasons i am satisfied that you are spending more money than is necessary and moreover i have shrunk from communicating to you some unpleasant intelligence upon me have devolved the investment and management of your property and while i have tried to be cautious there have been losses which i regret in one case threefourths of an investment has been lost of course you didnt know this or you would have been less free in your expenditures i am not prepared to tell you how you stand i think it will be prudent for you to leave college at the end of this term and for a year to seek some employment during that time i will do what i can to settle matters on a better footing and perhaps at the end of that time you will be able to return to your studies you are so young i think you must be younger than the majority of your classmates that you can afford to lose the time i send you a check for sixty dollars in place of a hundred i wish you to have your regular term bills sent to me and i will forward checks in payment i will see that you leave euclid owing no man anything when you come home for the vacation we can consult as to the future i hope you will not be much depressed or cast down by the news i send your money is not all lost and i may be able in the course of twelve months to recover in a large measure what has been sunk your affectionate guardian ezekiel mack a regular sockdolager isnt it gates said walter i dont see that its so bad answered gates slowly your money isnt all lost but i must leave college true but as your guardian says you are young and if you come back at the end of a year you will still be a year younger than i for your standing of course i am sorry to have you go i am sure of that gates is the prospect of working for a year so unpleasant to you walter no i cant say it is said walter brightening up not if i can choose my employment i shouldnt like to go behind the counter in a grocery store or black boots for a living well hardly said walter laughing probably your guardian will consult your preferences i wish i could arrange to travel i should like to see something of the world why not you might get an agency of some kind one college vacation last summer i traveled about as book agent how did you like it not very much i met with a good many rebuffs and was occasionally looked upon with suspicion as i could see still i made a living and brought back thirty dollars to start me on my new term just what my supper cost the other evening yes i didnt think it wise to spend the money in the same way you have cheered me up gates i really believe i shall like to spend a year in some kind of business write your guardian to that effect he may be blaming himself for his agency in your misfortune and a cheerful letter from you will brighten him up all right i will walter sat down and dashed off the following note dear guardian your letter just received i wont pretend that i am not sorry for the loss of my money but i am sure that you acted for the best dont trouble yourself too much about the matter perhaps it will all come out right in a year or so in the meantime i think i shall find it not unpleasant to work for a year if you will let me select the kind of business i am to follow i will make the money you sent me do for the present and will send you my term bills as you desire you can depend upon my settling up as cheap as possible though i confess i have not hitherto been nearly as economical as i might have been now that i know it is necessary you shall have no reason to complain of me your affectionate ward walter sherwood what do you think of that gates asked walter giving the letter to his chum to read excellent it shows the right spirit i am glad you think so do you know walter i think i have more occasion for regret than you i must bid farewell to my roommate and this pleasant room to your roommate yes but not necessarily to the room i shall have to furnish it in very different style for the present i am not sure that i can afford a carpet the luxury of my present surroundings i am afraid will spoil me for humble quarters dont borrow any trouble about that i shall leave you the furniture as it stands and when i come back to college even if we are in different classes you must take me in again of course i will agree to an arrangement so much in my favor but perhaps your guardian will think you had better sell the furniture and realize what you can no i am sure he wont theres nothing mean about doctor mack you can take in any one you please in my place only i am to come back at the end of a year if things turn out well i heartily hope you will come back and if you will excuse my saying so with a more earnest spirit and a determination to do justice to your really excellent talents good advice ill adopt it ill begin to do better at once i was intending to take a drive this evening but it would cost me two dollars and i will stay at home and save the money come with me on a walk instead i will we will go to the top of mount legar at sunset there will be a fine view from there i must stop on the way and pay mr daniels what i owe him he will lose a good deal by my going away true but his loss will be your gain at the outset of their walk the two students called at the hotel and found mr daniels on the piazza glad to see you mr sherwood said the landlord briskly i think you will be mr daniels for i have come to pay your bills money is always welcome mr sherwood you have no idea how much i lose by trusting students there was green of the last graduating class left college owing me fortyfive dollars he has gone west somewhere and i never expect to get a cent of my money you came pretty near losing by me daniels how is that queried the landlord looking surprised ive lost a lot of money or my guardian has for me and ive got to leave college at the end of this term you dont say so ejaculated mr daniels regretfully its all true my guardian wrote me about it this morning i suppose youre a good deal cut up about it mr sherwood well i was at first but i may be able to come back after a year or two i shall go into some business and meanwhile my guardian will do what he can to recover the money lost it isnt so bad after all i shall be sorry to have you go mr sherwood you will miss my bills at any rate i wouldnt have given that supper the other evening if i had known how things stood i would have put the thirty dollars to better use well youve paid up like a gentleman anyway i hope youll come back in a year as rich as ever you wanted a team tonight james told me that was before i got my guardians letter i shall walk instead of taking a carriageride i will let the account stand if you wish no i cant afford to run up any bills good night mr daniels you did right walter said gates it is a bad thing to run up bills especially when you are poor it seems odd to be poor i am used to it walter you dont seem very sad over it i am not that is what puzzles me i really begin to think i like it chapter vi true friend and false a college community is for the most part democratic a poor student with talent is quite as likely to be a favorite as the heir to a fortune often more so but there are always some snobs who care more for dollars than sense so walter was destined to find out for he made no secret of his loss of fortune most of his college friends sympathized with him but there was one who proved unreliable this was harvey warner the son of a man who had made a fortune during the civil war some said as a sutler harvey professed to be very aristocratic and had paid especial attention to walter because he too had the reputation of being wealthy he had invited walter to pass a couple of weeks at the summer residence of the warners near lake george this however was before he had heard of walters loss of fortune as soon as be learned this he decided that the invitation must be withdrawn this would be awkward as he had been on very intimate terms with our hero and had been a guest at the banquet not foreseeing the effect of his changed circumstances on the mind of his late friend walter meeting him on the campus the day afterward called out familiarly how are you old fellow why didnt you come round to my room last evening i had another engagement sherwood answered warner stiffly you ought to give me the preference said walter not observing the others change of manner ahem a man must judge for himself you know by the way is it true that you have lost all your money i dont know how much i have lost but i am not coming back to college next year you are in hard luck said warner coldly by the way i think we shall have to give up that plan for the summer what plan why you know i invited you to visit me at lake george walter began to comprehend why are you not going to be there he asked yes but the house will be full of other fellows dont you know so that there will be no room for me said walter calmly looking warner full in the face awfully sorry and all that sort of thing drawled warner besides i suppose you will have to go to work yes i expect to go to work after awhile probably i shall take a few weeks for rest by the way when did you find out that your home would be full of other fellows got a letter from my sister this morning besides in your changed circumstances dont you know you might find it awkward to be living in a style you couldnt keep up thank you warner you are very considerate i really didnt give you credit for so much consideration dont mention it of course with your good sense you understand i think i do and by the way i believe you borrowed two dollars of me last week if it is inconvenient for you to pay the whole at once you might hand me a dollar and i called that fellow my friend said walter to himself you are very considerate again but i think i would rather pay the whole at once can you change a ten harvey warner looked surprised he had jumped to the conclusion that walter was the next thing to a pauper and here he was better supplied with money than himself i am not sure that i have as much money here he said then come with me to the drugstore i am going to buy a bottle of toothwash and will change the bill there warner accepted this proposal id better make sure of my money while he has it he reflected i hope youre not very much disappointed about the visit he said not at all i should have had to decline i have been invited to spend a month at the adirondacks with frank clifford you dont mean it ejaculated warner enviously clifford was a member of an old family and an invitation from him was felt to confer distinction warner himself would have given a good deal to be on sufficiently intimate terms to receive such a compliment when did he invite you he asked suggestively walter saw what was in his mind and answered with a smile he invited me this morning had he heard of my loss of fortune oh yes but why should that make any difference i wouldnt go if i were you why not you are going to be a poor man i dont know about that you are poor now at any rate well perhaps so but am i any the worse for that i thought you would understand my meaning i do but i am glad that all my friends dont attach the importance you do to the possession of fortune good morning i suppose its the way of the world thought walter as his quondam friend left him but thank heaven all are not mercenary ive got a few friends left anyhow a few rods farther on he met victor creswell perhaps the richest student in the junior class whats this i hear walter he asked have you lost your money some of it i believe and you are not coming back to college i shall stay out a year perhaps i can come back then you neednt leave at all my governor allows me a hundred dollars a month for my own use spending money you know ill give you half of it if that will enable you to pull through walter was touched you are a friend worth having creswell he said but i really think i shall enjoy being out of college for a year i shall find out what is in me but i shant forget your generous offer better accept it sherwood i can get along well enough on fifty dollars a month i wont accept it for myself but ill tell you something my chum gates is very hard pushed you know he depends wholly on himself and twentyfive dollars just at this time would be a godsend to him he is worried about paying his bills if now you would transfer a little at your generosity to him i dont know him very well but if you speak well of him that is enough i shall be glad to help him let me see how much i can spare he drew out a wallet and from it four ten dollar bills here are forty dollars he said give them to him but dont let him know where they came from creswell youre a trump said walter shaking his hand vigorously you dont know how happy you will make him oh thats all right but im sorry you wont let me do something for you i will if i need it good said creswell in a tone of satisfaction now mind you dont hesitate walter happy in the happiness he was going to confer made his way quickly to his own room gates sat at the table with a troubled brow writing some figures on a piece of paper what are you about gates asked his chum i have been thinking said gates wearily that perhaps i ought to do what you have decided to do whats that leave college but why i am so troubled to pay my bills i wrote to my uncle last week he is a welltodo farmer asking him if he wouldnt send me fifteen dollars to help pay my term bills i promised to come and help him in the farm work during july what does he say asked walter smiling gates couldnt understand why that he never pays for work in advance he doesnt approve of it he could afford it oh yes hes got a good sum in the savingsbank but he is a very cautious man i dont see how im going to get through perhaps i had better take a year away from college there is no need of that i have some money here for you some money for me yes and walter placed four tendollar bills on the table but walter you are in no position to lend me money true the money doesnt come from me but who besides you would do me such a great favor one of the rich fellows in college no i cant tell you his name you can take it without hesitation but it must have been to you that he lent it no he understands that it is to be given to you will it help you will it help me it will carry me through gloriously and gates was radiant with pleasure are you going to leave college now no this help is providential i will never be distrustful again i wish creswell could see how much happiness his gift has brought with it thought walter chapter vii walters experiment begins after a conference between walter and his guardian it was decided that he should wait till the first of september before seeking for any business position walter who was somewhat impulsive was disposed to start at once but doctor mack said no you are entitled to a vacation when your class resumes study at euclid it will be time for you to begin to earn your living i am not sure that i deserve a vacation said walter frankly i have not studied as hard at i ought very probably you have not been in earnest you are a year older now and you have a better understanding of your position you are very charitable my dear guardian said walter doctor mack smiled i am quite aware he said that old heads are not often to be found on young shoulders then you think it will be right for me to enjoy myself this summer i want you to do so one of my college friends frank clifford has invited me to pass a month with him in the adirondacks the cliffords have a lodge not far from blue mountain lake franks mother and sisters will be abroad and he wants me to keep him company i can think of no objection how shall you spend your time in hunting and fishing there are splendid chances for both up there so clifford says go and have your good time when you come back we will talk of your future plans walters stay was prolonged to eight weeks and when he returned it was already nearing the end of august he was browned by exposure and looked the picture of health now i am ready to go to work doctor mack he said have you any plans for me how would you like to go into a drugstore i have a college classmate who is a very successful druggist in syracuse walter shrugged his shoulders i dont believe i have a taste for making pills he said i thought not what do you think of entering a drygoods store i am acquainted with the head of a prominent establishment in new york it is a very respectable position but i should feel cabined cribbed confined in it i am at the end of my tether have you formed any plans of your own well not exactly but you have thought somewhat on the subject yes answered walter if at all possible i shall let you have your own way you may think me foolish said walter hesitatingly i dont know let me hear what you have to propose i thought said walter eagerly i would like to go out west what would you do when you got there there must be lots of things to do very likely you might buy an ax and clear the virgin forests i am afraid i wouldnt be a success at that you have no definite idea as to what you would do no i could tell better when i got out there now about the expense how much money would you need you would require to live till you begin to earn something how much will it cost me to get to chicago say about twentyfive dollars i think guardian if you will advance me a hundred dollars that will be sufficient for how long a time for a year you see i expect to earn my own living by the time i have spent fifty dollars in all i should go to a cheap boardingplace of course i should be able to pay my way you will be content then with a hundred dollars walter yes perhaps i could make it do on less no you shall have a hundred if absolutely necessary you can send for more no said walter confidently i wont do that i shall get along somehow i want to make a man of myself that is a commendable ambition still sometimes a young man finds it hard to obtain employment if you had a trade now it might be different suppose for instance you were a journeyman tailor you could readily find a place in chicago or any goodsized city i shouldnt care to be a tailor i shouldnt care to employ you if you were said his guardian smiling one thing i would like to guard you against dont be too particular about what you take up with so small an outfit as you have stipulated for you will have to go to work at something soon then again you wont be able to live as well as you have been accustomed to do here and in college i understand that and am prepared for it i want to rough it possibly you will have your wish granted i dont want to discourage you walter i only want to prepare you for what may and probably will come do you know any one in chicago doctor mack i might find it pleasant to have an acquaintance yes i know a retired merchant named archer he lives on indiana avenue i dont remember the number but you can easily find his name in the directory his name is allen archer walter noted the name in a new memorandum book which he had purchased where would you advise me to put up on my arrival in chicago he asked there are several good houses the sherman tremont palmer house but they will be beyond your means indeed any hotel will be still you might go to some good house for a day that will give you time to hunt up a modest boardinghouse an excellent plan said walter in a tone of satisfaction do you know my dear guardian i shall go out in the best of spirits i feel in shakespeares words that the world is mine oyster i hope you will be able to open it walter you have my best wishes dont forget that you will have to depend on yourself i wont forget it i wish it was time for me to start it will come soon enough you had better get out your clothes and get them mended if necessary and put in order nancy will do all she can for you and the tailor will do the rest better not take much with you when you get settled i will forward your trunk by express when nancy sprague heard of walters plans she was much disturbed oh master walter she said in a tragic tone is it true that youve lost all your money and have got to go out into the cold world to make a living i believe i have lost some money nancy but i rather like the idea of working for my living oh you poor child you little know what it is i cant bear to think of it i cant see how doctor mack can let you go i should be very sorry if he refused it isnt so bad to work for a living havent you always done it yes but thats different i was always poor and i am used to it im going to get used to it walter dont tell your guardian what i am saying but ive got two hundred dollars in the savings bank and i shall be very glad to give you some of it you will take it now wont you i can get it out tomorrow nancy you are a true friend said walter really moved by the unselfish devotion of the housekeeper but i shant need it i shall take a hundred dollars with me and long before it is gone i shall be earning my living youll send for it if you need it yes if i find i am very hard up and there is no other way i will send for it nancy brightened up much pleased and relieved by this assurance i couldnt bear to think of your suffering for a meal of victuals when we have so much in the house i dont see why you cant stay at home and get a place in the village walter laughed it wouldnt suit me at all nancy i am going west to grow up with the country i wish i could be somewhere near to look after you it would be of no use nancy women are in great demand out there at any rate in dakota and youd be married in less than no time if you went you are only joking now master walter not at all i read the other day that of ten schoolmaams who went out to dakota last fall eight were married within three months nobody could marry me against my will said nancy resolutely perhaps he would find a way of overcoming your objections said walter laughing but i am afraid doctor mack couldnt do without you he couldnt spare you and me both thats true assented nancy who had not been so much alarmed at the matrimonial dangers hinted at by walter as might have been anticipated had a good opportunity offered i am inclined to think nancy would have been willing to change her name after all she was only fortynine and i have known more than one to surrender single blessedness with all its charms at and beyond that age at last the day of departure came valise in hand walter jumped aboard the stage that was to convey him to the railroadstation he shook hands with his guardian and nancy the driver whipped up his horses and a new period in walters life had commenced i wonder how hell come out mused doctor mack thoughtfully have i acted for the best in letting him go well time alone can tell chapter viii walter buys a watch walter was tempted to stop over at niagara as his ticket would have allowed him to do but he was also very anxious to reach chicago and get to work i can visit niagara some other time he reflected now i can spare neither the money nor the time hour after hour sped by until with a little thrill of excitement walter learned by consulting his railroad guide that he was within fifty miles of chicago he looked out of the car window and surveyed with interest the country through which they were speeding at the rate of thirtyfive miles an hour his attention was drawn from the panorama outside by a voice is this seat engaged walter looked up and his glance rested on a man of perhaps thirtyfive dressed in a light suit and wearing a tall white hat no sir answered walter politely removing his gripsack from the seat i dont want to incommode you said the stranger as he took the place thus vacated you dont in the least said walter i suppose you are going to chicago yes sir are you going farther out to dakota for instance no sir chicago is far enough west for me at present i live in dakota i have a long journey to make after we reach chicago i dont know about dakota is it a good place for business it is going to be yes dakota has a bright future i have a pleasant little home out there i had to go east on business and stayed a little longer than i intended in fact i spent more money than i anticipated and that makes me a little short it struck walter that his new acquaintance for a stranger was very confidential is it possible he will propose to borrow money of me he asked himself he did not quite know what to say but politeness required him to say something i am sorry he replied in a sympathizing tone i should like to take a train this evening for my home continued the stranger i hope you will be able to do so well theres one drawback i havent got money enough to buy a through ticket under these circumstances i am going to offer you a bargain walter looked surprised and expectant the stranger drew a gold watch from his pocket a very handsome gold watch which looked valuable you see that watch he said how much do you think it is worth it looks like a nice watch i am no judge of values it cost me ninety dollars six months since now i need the money and i will sell it to you for twentyfive but that would be a great sacrifice so it would but i need the money of course if you havent got the money i have that amount of money said walter but i havent got it to spare i might need it then all you need to do is to sell the watch or pawn it you could sell it for fifty dollars without trouble why dont you do that asked walter shrewdly because i havent the time i want if possible to go on tonight if you had a wife and two children waiting for you whom you had not seen for two months you wouldnt mind losing a few dollars for the sake of seeing them a little sooner very likely answered walter to whom his companions explanation seemed plausible walter was tempted but he reflected that twentyfive dollars represented a third of the money he had with him so he put away the temptation but with reluctance he had a silver watch bought for him when he entered college at a cost of fifteen dollars and like the majority of boys of his age he felt that he should much prefer to carry a gold one still he must be prudent no he said shaking his head i dont think i had better buy the watch i presume you will find some one else on the train who would be glad of the bargain very likely but we are near chicago and i havent time to look around come ill make you a still better offer though i ought not to do so you may have the watch for twenty dollars that money will get me through and i wont haggle about five dollars twenty dollars repeated walter thoughtfully yes look at the watch isnt it a beauty yes i like the appearance of it very much if you get out of money you can easily pawn it for more than the sum i ask for it certainly this was an important consideration walter felt that he would be foolish to lose so good a chance it was a pity that the stranger should be forced to make such a sacrifice yet it really seemed that he would be doing him a favor as well as benefiting himself by accepting his proposition you will guarantee it to be solid gold he said with momentary suspicion certainly you will see that it is an elgin watch of course you know the reputation of that make they dont make any sham watches at their factory i thought the case might be gilt said walter half ashamed of his suspicions you do well to be cautious but i will guarantee the watch to be all i represent it i only wish you were a jeweler then you could judge for yourself it sounded very plausible then the watch was a very handsome one let me open it and show you the works the stranger did so walter was no judge of the mechanism of a watch but what he saw impressed him favorably the stranger seemed very frank and fairspoken walter knew of course that in traveling one was likely to meet with sharpers but that did not justify him in suspecting everybody he met it would look very nice at the end of my chain he thought i suppose i cannot afford it but as he says i can raise money on it at any time well young man what is your decision you must excuse me for hurrying but we are not far from chicago and i want to make sure that i can continue my journey tonight i shall telegraph to my wife that i am coming i will take the watch said walter there doesnt seem to be much risk in doing so bosh i should say not young man i congratulate you you have made the best bargain of your life have you got the money handy walter took out two tendollar bills and handed them to his companion receiving the watch in exchange well that settles my mind said the stranger in a tone of satisfaction i shall see the old woman and the kids very soon thanks to your kindness dont mention it said walter complacently i feel indebted to you rather as you have given me much more than an equivalent for my money that is true but under present circumstances money is worth a good deal to me now if you dont mind i will go into the smokingcar and have a little smoke before we arrive will you join me no sir thank you i dont smoke goodday then hope we shall meet again walter responded politely and the stranger rising walked forward to the front part of the car and disappeared walter detached the silver watch from the plated chain to which it was attached substituted the new gold watch and put the silver watch in his pocket it occurred to him that if he should really need money it might be better for him to sell the silver watch and retain the gold one i have made thirty dollars at the very least on my purchase he reflected for i am sure i can sell the watch for fifty dollars if i wish to do so this is a white day for me as the romans used to say i accept it as a good omen of success i wish doctor mack and nancy were here to see it i think the doctor would give me credit for a little shrewdness the car sped on perhaps a dozen miles farther when the door opened and the conductor entered followed by a stout man of perhaps fifty years of age who looked flushed and excited this gentleman has been robbed of his gold watch explained the conductor he is convinced that some one on the train has taken it of course no one of you is suspected but i will trouble you to show me your watches as walter heard these words a terrible fear assailed him had he bought a stolen watch chapter ix an ingenious scheme the passengers though somewhat surprised generally showed their watches with a good grace one old man produced a silver watch fifty years old that watch belonged to my grandfather he said you dont claim that do you wouldnt take it as a gift said the loser crustily you couldnt get it in exchange for yours retorted the owner presently they came to walter if he had not attached the gold watch to his chain instead of his old silver one he would have been tempted to leave it in his pocket and produce the less valuable one but he was saved from the temptation as this would now have been impossible besides had the gold watch been found on him afterward it would have looked very suspicious well youngster said the stout man show us your watch with a flushed face and an uneasy feeling walter drew out the gold timepiece is that your watch he said yes almost shouted the stout passenger fiercely so you are the thief no sir answered walter pale but firm i am not the thief where did you get it then i bought it you bought it thats a likely story why it was taken from me this very afternoon that may be but i bought it all the same the owner was about to protest when the conductor said quietly listen to the young fellows explanation walter proceeded a man came to my seat and told me he wanted to raise enough money to get to dakota he offered me the watch for twentyfive dollars though he said it cost him ninety six months ago and you paid him twentyfive dollars no i had no money to spare but when he offered it for twenty and told me i could more than get my money back either by pawning or selling it i made up my mind to purchase and did so where is this man asked the conductor he said he was going into the smokingcar thats a likely story sneered the stout gentleman do you charge me with taking the watch demanded walter hotly i have never left this car have you seen me before no but you are probably a confederate of the man from whom you got it but i am not sure if there was any such man i will describe him said walter as he did so the conductor said there was such a man on the train he got off at the last station i dont know anything about that said the claimant but ill trouble you young man for that watch will you return me the twenty dollars i gave for it asked walter of course not i dont propose to buy back my own watch an elderly gentleman who sat just behind walter spoke up here it is rather hard on the boy he said i can confirm his story about the purchase of the watch i heard the bargaining and saw the purchasemoney paid that makes no difference to me said the claimant ive identified the watch and i want it walter removed it from his chain and was about to hand it to the claimant when a quietlooking man dressed in a drab suit rose from a seat farther down the car and came forward he was a small man not over five feet five inches in height and he would not have weighed over one hundred and twenty pounds but there was a look of authority on his face and an accent of command in his voice you neednt give up the watch my boy he said walter drew back his hand and turned round in surprise the claimant uttered an angry exclamation and said testily by what right do you interfere the watch isnt yours said the small man nonchalantly it isnt hey well of all the impertinent stop there jim beckwith you see i know you as the stout man turned pale and clutched at the side of the seat who are you he demanded hoarsely detective green the claimant lost all his braggadocio air and stared at the detective with a terrified look that isnt my name he managed to ejaculate very likely not said the detective calmly but it is one of your names it is a very clever game that you and your confederate are playing he sells the watch and you demand it claiming that it has been stolen from you i was present when the watch was sold and the reason i did not interfere was because i was waiting for the sequel how many times have you played this game theres some mistake gasped the other perhaps so but i have some doubts whether you came by it honestly i assure you it is my watch cried the other uneasily how much did you pay for it young man asked the detective twenty dollars very well sir give the boy twenty dollars and i shall advise him to give the watch back to you as it may be stolen property which he would not like to have found in his possession but that will be paying twenty dollars for my own property it was not to me he paid the money you will have to look to your confederate for that i am not sure but i ought to make you give twentyfive dollars this hint led to the stout mans hastily producing two tendollar bills which he tendered to walter its an outrage he said making a man pay for his own property are you sure that your statements in regard to this man are true asked an importantlooking individual on the opposite side of the car to my mind your interference is unwarrantable not to say outrageous justice has been trampled upon the detective looked round sharply do you know the man he asked no well i do i first made his acquaintance at joliet prison where he served a term of years for robbing a bank is that true or not jim beckwith the man known as beckwith had already started to leave the car but although he heard the question he didnt come back to answer it i generally know what im about continued the detective pointedly as those who are unwise enough to criticise my actions find out sooner or later the important gentleman did not reply but covered his confusion by appearing to be absorbed in a daily paper which he held up before his face you let him off easy said the gentleman in the rear seat you allowed him to take the watch i was surprised at that yes for strange as it may seem it was probably his though the money with which he bought it may have been stolen that watch has been probably sold a dozen times and recovered the same way were it a stolen watch the risk would be too great as it is i had no pretext for arresting him was it really a ninetydollar watch asked walter with interest no i know something about watches as i find the knowledge useful in my official capacity the watch would be a fair bargain at fortyfive dollars but it is showy and would readily be taken for one worth seventyfive or even ninety dollars i shouldnt think the trick would pay said the gentleman in the rear seat why not twenty dollars isnt a large sum to be divided between two persons especially when theres money to be paid for car fare sometimes the watch is sold for more generally i fancy but the price was reduced because the purchaser was a boy besides these men doubtless have other ways of making money they are wellknown confidence men if i hadnt been on board the train our young friend would have lost his twenty dollars it would have been a great loss to me said walter i am very much obliged to you mr green ah you remember my name let me give you my card some time you may get into difficulty and want to consult me boys of your age are not a match for an experienced swindler he handed walter a card bearing the name silas green h street walter put it into his pocket with a polite expression of thanks meanwhile of course the cars were steadily approaching chicago at length they entered the great union depot and with the rest of the passengers walter alighted carrying his valise in his hand a few feet in front of him walked jim beckwith but walter did not care to join him he half turned and as his glance fell on walter he said with a scowl if you ever meet me again youll know me yes i shall answered walter with emphasis chapter x at the indiana house walter paused before a modest hotel on monroe street we will call it the indiana house and entering went up to the desk and inquired the rates of board are you commercial asked the clerk not at present sir we make special terms for commercial travelers we will give you a small room on the third floor for one dollar and a half a day this was as cheap as walter expected to find it at a hotel and he signified his acceptance front called the clerk a redhaired boy about walters age came forward take this young man up to no said the clerk yessir answered the bellboy pronouncing the two words in one there was no elevator in the house and walter followed the boy up two flights of stairs to the third landing the boy opened the door of a room with a small window looking out into an inner court here you are he said and he put the valise on the floor thank you said walter as he spoke he drew a dime from his vest pocket and deposited it in the hand of the redhaired attendant the effect was magical the bellboys listless manner vanished his dull face lighted up and his manner became brisk thank you sir is there anything you want if you do ill get it for you walter looked about him soap water towels all were in sight not just now he answered but i am going to take a wash and shall probably use up all the water some time this evening you may bring me some more all right sir just you ring when you want it he went off and walter was left alone first he took a thorough wash which refreshed him very much after his long and dusty ride then he changed his linen brushed his clothes with a handbrush he had brought in his valise and carefully combed his hair i feel a hundred per cent better he soliloquized here i am in chicago and now the battle of life is to begin walter was sanguine and full of hope his life had always been easy and he did not know what it was to work for a living besides the fact may as well be told he had a very comfortable opinion of his own abilities he felt that he was no common boy was he not a sophomore or rather a juniorelect of euclid college did he not possess a knowledge more or less extensive of latin greek and mathematics with a smattering of french and german not to speak of logic rhetoric etc for one of his age he considered himself quite accomplished and he persuaded himself that the world would receive him at his own estimate it would be very strange if he could not earn a living when hundreds and thousands of his age without a tithe of his knowledge managed to live walter went downstairs and as it would not be suppertime for two hours went out to walk he wanted to get some idea of the busy city which was for a time at least to be his home he walked through monroe street until he reached state at the corner he caught sight of a palatial structure nearly opposite what building is that he asked of a boy wheres year eyes returned the boy thats the palmer house walter gazed admiringly at the showy building and wished that he could afford to put up there it was as far ahead of the indiana house as a city is ahead of a country village he continued his walk until he reached the lake front and looked with interest at the great sheet of water which spread out before him like an inland sea he walked along the lake front for a few squares and then striking back into the city saw the tremont house the courthouse the sherman house and other handsome buildings on his way he met hundreds of people walking briskly and all seeming occupied if all these people make a living why shouldnt i he asked himself i think i am as smart as the average secretly walter thought himself a great deal smarter it must be remembered that walter was not quite eighteen a selfconceited age and he overestimated his strength and ability on the whole it is fortunate that the young do not comprehend the difficult struggle that lies before them or they would become discouraged before they had fairly entered upon it it is well that they should be hopeful and sanguine they are more likely to succeed walter wandered around in a desultory way and it was more than an hour before he reached the hotel at which he was stopping as he entered the public room he started back in surprise as his glance rested on a man wearing a white hat surely this was the man who had sold him the gold watch how did it happen that he was not on the way to dakota he coughed with a view to attracting the attention of his railroad acquaintance the ruse succeeded the man turned and evidently recognized walter he looked doubtful not having yet met his confederate nor learned how the plot had come out i believe i met you on the train said walter smiling the smile decided the other that it would be safe to acknowledge the acquaintance yes i remember you now you sold me a watch yes answered the other hesitating i thought you wanted to take a train to dakota this evening went on walter so i do but it doesnt go till eight oclock may i ask what time it is you know i sold you my watch i suppose that is chicago time said walter pointing to a clock on the lefthand side of the office i wonder whether hes got the watch still thought the other he must have as he makes no fuss about it walter was waiting cunningly to see if his railroad acquaintance would betray himself im awfully sorry to part with the watch he said if you keep it i may buy it back some time im sorry i cant oblige you said walter but i have sold it already sold the watch already ejaculated the man in the white hat did you sell it since you reached chicago no i sold it on the train you dont mean it exclaimed the other in amazement who did you sell it to jim beckwith answered walter jim beckwith the man in the white hat stared at walter with an air of startled perplexity that almost made our hero laugh yes thats what he said his name was or rather somebody told me it was his name jim beckwith bought that watch of you repeated the stranger slowly yes do you know him i have heard of him said the other oh i nearly forgot to say that he claimed the watch as his said you had stolen it from him jim beckwith said that yes and you gave it up to him yes but not till he paid me the twenty dollars i gave for it the other was more and more mystified jim beckwith gave you twenty dollars he said yes that leaves me all right if you want to buy it back at any time you must apply to him the man in the white hat stared at walter as if he was a museum freak boy he said in a tone of enforced admiration youre smart i am glad you think so sir returned walter you pay me a compliment how old are you seventeen a seventeenyearold boy who can get the better of jim beckwith is smart and no mistake perhaps you wouldnt mind telling me whether its true that the watch belongs to mr beckwith as he says i bought it of another man who may have stolen it from him said he of the white hat cautiously well youll have to settle with him im out of it while walter was speaking an extraordinary change came over the countenance of the man in the white hat the color faded from his cheeks and he half rose from his seat he was not looking at walter but beyond him toward the door walter turned following his look and when he saw who had entered he understood the situation chapter xi the man from dakota the man who had just entered the readingroom was no other than detective green he nodded pleasantly to walter so you have put up here he said well it is a good place and is this gentleman a friend of yours indicating the man in the white hat i bought the watch from him ha i thought so i see you know me steve ashton yes sir answered ashton nervously i hope you are well you are very kind then you really hope i am well of course why shouldnt i well there are some of your companions i hear who are not so cordial jim beckwith for instance by the way you have some business arrangements with jim beckwith i know him sir answered astern hesitatingly you know him well i suspect so you sold my young friend here a watch yes sir at a remarkable sacrifice yes sir it was worth more than he paid for it and yet it seemed likely to be a losing bargain for him it would have been but for me ashton looked at walter inquiringly the latter smiled you gave me credit for being smarter than i was said walter mr green here came to my assistance i think mr ashton said detective green with suavity that you have a wife and family in dakota i sir yes and it was to obtain money to join them that you sold your watch on the train yes sir answered ashton faintly i am going to give you a bit of advice it will be wise for you to go to dakota as you planned this is a wicked city in spots and i am afraid you have been keeping bad company how long have you known beckwith about six months and he drew you into this business yes sir i thought so you are new to the profession still i knew you i make it a point to get acquainted with the new men is the watch honestly yours yes sir get it back from beckwith and then drop his acquaintance if necessary leave chicago have you a trade yes sir i am a machinist it is a good trade go back to it is that advice friendly yes sir answered ashton with more confidence i didnt expect to get friendly advice from detective green perhaps not you didnt know me that was all you looked upon me as an enemy i suppose yes sir i am an enemy to those who are incurably bad i think you were meant for an honest man so i was sir i should be still if i hadnt met with jim beckwith have done with him then if you follow my advice you need not fear meeting with me again the detective went up to the desk bought a cigar and then left the room with a nod to ashton and walter will you follow his advice asked walter yes i will hereafter i will depend upon honest work for an honest livelihood what is your name walter sherwood then walter sherwood i am glad i did not succeed in robbing you yet i am glad i met you it will lead to my reformation will you give me your hand willingly steve ashton shook the proffered hand energetically if i can do you a favor at any time i shall be glad to do so perhaps you can i cannot afford to live at a hotel can you recommend me to some respectable but modestpriced boardinghouse yes the widow of a machinist who used to be employed in the same shop as myself keeps a few boarders i think she would take you for six dollars a week or five if you have a friend to room with you can you show me the place after supper that is unless you are in a hurry to start for dakota he added with a smile i never was in dakota in my life said ashton i told you a lie i was beginning to think so but i shall drop all that from this time on you can trust me after supper walter went round with ashton to a house in harrison street the boardinghouse referred to the door was opened by a careworn woman of middle age how do you do mr ashton she said with an inquiring look very well thank you mrs canfield have you any rooms vacant are you asking for yourself no for my young friend here mr sherwood do you want a large room or a small one asked mrs canfield brightening up a little that depends a little on the price answered walter i can give you a hall bedroom and board for five dollars and a half a week can you show me the room be kind enough to follow me walter followed the landlady up a narrow staircase or rather two of them and was shown a hall bedroom which seemed to be uncomfortably full though it only contained a bedstead a chair a very small bureau and a washstand there was scarcely room for him to stand unless he stood on the bed it was indeed vastly different from his nice college room and from his comfortable chamber at home i should like to see a larger room said walter not venturing to make any comment on the hall room he was shown an adjoining apartment about ten feet by twelve it was small but decidedly preferable to the other how much do you charge for this room mrs canfield i shall have to charge you six dollars if you occupy it alone but if you can get another young gentleman to occupy it with you i will say ten dollars for the two i will take it alone at first can i move in tomorrow morning i will have it ready for you by eleven oclock that will do how do you like it asked ashton when they were in the street i think i can make it do i suppose you have been used to something better yes i can direct you to a better house thank you but six dollars a week is all i can afford at present i have no income but i shall look for a place at once you havent any trade have you no answered walter with a smile brought up as he had been it seemed odd to be asked if he had a trade some trades pay very well i have a nephew who is a bricklayer he gets from three to four dollars a day i am afraid i should not like that business besides it would take a good while to learn it walter smiled to himself as he pictured some of his aristocratic college friends seeing him laying bricks he was not a snob nor would he have disdained to notice a friend or school companion filling such a position but he felt that providence must have something in store for him more congenial though perhaps less lucrative i have a cousin who is a carpenter proceeded ashton he makes two dollars and a half a day and supports a wife and three children in comfort i wonder if i could support a family on fifteen dollars a week thought walter fortunately i have only to support myself i ought to be able to do that in a large city like chicago reared in comfort walter knew very little of the competition and struggles of workingmen and had an idea that he would be able easily to command a salary of ten dollars a week though he was wholly disqualified for any special line of business this he set down as the minimum paying six dollars a week for board he calculated that he could get along on this salary with extreme economy fortunately he was pretty well provided with clothing or would be when he had sent for his trunk and would not find it necessary for some time to come to purchase anything except probably a pair of shoes a necktie or some trifle then probably his pay would soon be raised and this would make him comfortable that evening walter went to hooleys theater and occupied a dollar seat it was hardly prudent but he had seventy dollars still and that seemed to him a large sum he enjoyed the play and got a sound nights rest after it the next morning he settled his hotel bill took his gripsack in his hand and walked over to his new boardinghouse chapter xii in search of employment wanted a young man of seventeen or eighteen in an insurance office no la salle street this notice attracted the attention of walter as he ran his eyes over the advertising columns of the chicago times on the second day after his arrival in the city i think that will suit me he said to himself it is a nice respectable business and i think i should like it i will go to the office and make inquiries he entered a large building devoted to offices and ascended to the third story where he found the office of perkins windermere the names given in the advertisement a young man of about his own age was coming out of the office as he entered an unsuccessful applicant walter inferred opening the door he saw a man of about forty seated in a revolving chair at a desk i believe you advertised for an assistant began walter as the occupant of the chair turned round yes replied mr perkins for it was he eying walter with a scrutinizing glance i would like to apply for the position humph do you know anything of the insurance business not practically sir thats against you i think i could soon familiarize myself with it so as to make myself useful how old are you very nearly eighteen do you live in chicago i do now i have recently come from the east what education have you i spent two years at euclid college answered walter with conscious pride so you are a college student yes sir humph that wont do you any good i hope it wont do me any harm sir said walter somewhat nettled no unless it has made you conceited i am a graduate of the peoples college i dont think i have heard of that sir i mean the common school dont think much of college myself they dont help in our business they didnt have any insurance companies in greece or rome did they i never heard of any sir i thought not you see we of today are rather ahead of demosthenes and cicero and those old fellows i suppose rome was quite a sizable place i have always heard so answered walter ill bet a quarter it wasnt as big or as smart a place as chicago i dont believe they had any such hotel there as the palmer house or any drygood store as big as marshall fields i dont believe they did walter admitted did rome ever win the baseball championship demanded mr perkins no sir i thought not then whats the use in spending four years over those old fellers how is it going to help you i dont expect it will help me to earn a living sir do you think you can employ me what are your ideas as to a salary young man i thought of ten dollars said walter hesitatingly ten dollars ejaculated mr perkins just what i thought because youve been to college you think you are worth a big salary do you call that a big salary sir asked walter disconcerted it wouldnt be if you had a couple of years experience but for a beginner it is simply enormous what did you expect to pay asked walter in a depressed tone five dollars is about the figure i couldnt work for that sir it wouldnt pay my board where are you boarding at the palmer house inquired perkins rather sarcastically no sir i am at a cheap boardinghouse on harrison street where i pay six dollars a week answered walter with spirit then i dont think we can make a bargain although i rather like your looks this at any rate was a little encouraging but i cant pay your figure ill tell you what youd better do i shall be glad of any advice become an agent you look as if you had a gift of the gab a successful life insurance agent will make a good deal more than ten dollars a week can i get such a position asked walter hopefully yes ill employ you myself on a commission of course youll be paid according to your work ive known an agent to make a hundred and twentyfive dollars in a single week if you think i can do it sir ill try very well hare you ever studied life insurance no sir but i have a general idea of it i will give you some documents instructions to agents etc take these home study them and come to me when you think you understand it well enough to talk people into it mr perkins opened his desk and selecting some papers handed them to walter when you come again if there is anything you dont see into let me know and ill explain it to you thank you sir walter went home and set himself to studying the insurance documents given him by mr perkins here he found his college training of service it was like studying a science and walter who went to work systematically soon came to understand the system with the arguments for and against it he made calculations of the expenses attending the different classes of life insurance selecting the ages of thirty forty and fifty as illustrations the result was that when he went round to the office the next day he felt considerable confidence in his ability to talk up insurance mr perkins seemed surprised to see him so soon do you think you understand the duties of a canvasser he asked yes sir you havent devoted much time to it you only took the documents yesterday true sir but i have spent several hours in examining them were there any things you did not understand walter mentioned one or two points now that i may get an idea of your working ability suppose you try to insure me i will take the part of an ordinary business man who is unfamiliar with the subject walter was not bashful and saw at once the value of this suggestion without going into details it may be stated that he acquitted himself very creditably you surprise me mr perkins admitted you seem to have made yourself quite familiar with the subject i will take you into my employment as an agent and allow you half commission do you wish me to operate in the city it will be better for you to start outside i will send you to elm bank about fifteen miles distant once there i shall leave you to your own discretion i will pay your fare there and back and trust to your doing something to repay me for the outlay very well sir walter took the necessary directions and after dinner took a train out to the suburban town which i have called elm bank though this is not the real name he congratulated himself on so soon obtaining employment though it remained to be seen how he would succeed however walter was sanguine not as yet having put himself in a position to meet the rebuffs which are sure to lie in wait for agents of any kind he thought over his prospects with pleased anticipations he felt that the position was much higher than that of a boy in an office it was one usually filled by men of maturity and business experience besides if successful the rewards would be ample the thought of the agent who made a hundred and twentyfive dollars in a single week occurred to him and encouraged him he would have been content with a salary of ten dollars a week but here was a business which might lead to a great deal more he seated himself next to a girl of sixteen with a pleasant face and frank cordial manner presently the girl tried to raise the window she occupied the seat next to it but it resisted her efforts will you allow me to try asked walter politely thank you you are very kind walter leaned over and succeeded in raising it thank you said the young lady i am only going to elm bank but i like the fresh air even for a short distance here was a surprise for walter are you going to elm bank he said so am i chapter xiii a young insurance agent you dont live in elm bank said the young girl inquiringly no answered walter swelling with pardonable pride i am going there on business have you ever been there before asked his fair companion no you look young to be in business i havent been in business long returned walter wondering if he looked so very young then he added with a sudden impulse i am an insurance agent are you i i thought what did you think asked walter a little curious i would rather not say it i wish you would you will promise not to be offended yes i have been told that insurance agents are very cheeky walter laughed i dont know about that he said i havent been in the business long enough yet do you know if any insurance agents have visited elm bank lately no i dont think so perhaps you would like to have your life insured said walter with a humorous look can you insure me fifty cents worth i am afraid not then i must put it off for that is all the money i have conversation drifted into other channels and was kept up till the cars slowed down and the conductor putting his head in at the door called out elm bank walter and his companion rose and leaving the car stepped out on the platform walter asked leave to carry a small bundle belonging to the young lady could you recommend any one who is likely to want his life insured he asked his companion pointed to a small house some quarter of a mile distant but plainly visible on account of its high location that house belongs to a german named louis fishbach she said he has a little money and earns good wages in a shoe shop he has a wife and four young children perhaps he will be willing to insure thank you i will try him i will leave you here as i live in a different direction i am sure i am much obliged to you for your politeness mr here she hesitated sherwood supplied walter mr sherwood my name is jennie gilbert good afternoon miss jennie said walter politely removing his hat he stopped a moment and watched the retreating figure of the young girl i hope i shall meet her again some time he said to himself i say who be you walter turned quickly and found himself confronted by a stout hulking young fellow broadshouldered and dressed in country fashion he was judging from his appearance about twentyone years of age his tone and face indicated that he was displeased why do you want to know asked walter coldly why do i want to know ill tell you why i want to know i aint goin to have any city dude chinning up to my best girl is miss jennie gilbert your best girl asked walter well she can be if she wants to be i picked her out a year ago and as soon as she is old enough im goin to let her know it then she isnt your best girl now no matter whether she is or not i aint goin to have you paying tentions to her i dont see what business it is of yours retorted walter youll find out if i give you a lickin growled the other handling the stick which he carried in a suggestive manner walter was inclined to retort in kind but all at once it struck him as foolish to get into a quarrel about a girl whom he had known less than an hour if it will make you feel any better he said ill tell you that i got acquainted with miss gilbert in the cars this afternoon i never met her before and as i live in chicago i dont suppose i shall ever meet her again the young mans face cleared up come thats honest he said i thought you wanted to cut me out if miss gilbert likes you i shant interfere said walter now im going to talk business i would like to insure your life whats that you aint a doctor be you no walter proceeded to explain in as simple terms as he could command the object and methods of life insurance the young man scratched his head when do i get the money he asked it is paid after your death then it wont do me any good no but suppose you have a wife and children you would like to leave them something wouldnt you i might live longer than my wife suggested the young man triumphantly walter found that his new acquaintance could only be influenced by considerations of personal advantage and was compelled to give up the attempt to insure him he kept on his way till he reached the house of mr fishbach to whom he had been recommended fortunately for his purpose the shoe shop in which the german was employed was closed for the day and walter found him at home mending a wagon in the back yard good afternoon mr fishbach said walter raising his hat politely i dont know who you are answered mr fishbach with a scrutinizing glance i should like to insure your life you want to insure my life whats dat if you will tell me your age i will explain to you i was fortynine next christmas you aint the census man eh no that is quite another matter now mr fishbach continued walter referring to a pamphlet in his hand if you will pay to the company which i represent fortyfour dollars every year when you die a thousand dollars will be paid to your wife or any one else you may name you wont pay me till i am dead eh no how will i know you pay then we do business on the square we keep our promises you pay the money to my widow eh yes if you pay twice as much we will pay two thousand dollars what good will that do me eh you will leave your wife comfortable wont you if she gets much money shell maybe marry again perhaps so and the money will go to her second husband eh if she chooses to give it to him by jiminy that wont suit me i will spend my money myself but if you die how will your wife and children get along what makes you think im goin to die eh do i look delicate as walter surveyed the stout rotund figure of mr fishbach he could not help laughing at the idea of his being delicate you look likely to live he was forced to admit still life is uncertain you cant scare louis fishbach young man my father lived till seventyseven and my mother was seventyfive my children can take care of themselves when i die and they can look after the old woman walter used such other arguments as occurred to him but his german friend was not to be moved and he rather despondently put his documents into his pocket and went out into the street i had no idea i should find it so difficult he reflected life insurance seemed to him so beneficent and so necessary a protection for those who would otherwise be unprovided for that he could not understand how any one who cared for his wife and children could fail to avail himself of its advantages after leaving the house of mr fishbach he kept on in the same direction being unacquainted in elm bank he had to trust to chance to guide him a little distance beyond was an oldfashioned twostory house perhaps i had better call thought walter and he entered the path that led to the side door he had scarcely taken three steps when he was startled by a scream that seemed to proceed from the interior help help was the cry that reached him he started to run and on reaching the door opened it without ceremony the sight that confronted him was one to test his courage chapter xiv an exciting encounter to understand the scene in which walter became an actor a brief explanation is necessary the occupant of the house was a woman of perhaps thirtyfive her husband ephraim gregory was employed in chicago and went to and from the city every day it was somewhat inconvenient to live at elm bank but both he and his wife were fond of the country and were willing to submit to some inconvenience for the sake of the sweet pure air and rural surroundings they had one child a little girl of five twenty minutes previous mrs gregory had been sitting at her sewing with little rosa on the floor beside her when without the ceremony of a knock the outer door was opened and a tall powerful man whose garb and general appearance indicated that he was a tramp entered the room what do you want asked mrs gregory rising in alarm im hungry answered the tramp in a hoarse voice he might be hungry but his breath indicated that he had been drinking mrs gregory would gladly have dismissed him but she was afraid to do so if only her husband had been at home sit down she said and i will find you something she went to the pantry and returned with some bread and cold meat which she set before her uncouth visitor if you will wait five minutes i will make you some tea she said i dont want any slops said her visitor scornfully give me brandy i have none then whisky gin anything we dont keep liquors in the house my husband and i never drink them at this he swore in a manner that terrified his unwilling hostess and anathematized her for a temperance crank this aroused her spirit if you want liquor she said you may go where it is sold i wont supply it to you or anybody else if you want hot tea you can have it give it to me then mrs gregory hastened to steep some tea she had hot water all ready and set it before the ruffian he ate and drank eagerly voraciously and did not leave a crumb behind him he had certainly spoken the truth when he said he was hungry then he arose and she hoped he would go but he turned to her with a significant look i want money he said i can give you none she answered her heart sinking oh yes you can are you a thief she demanded with a flash of spirit you can call me that if you like there was little hope of shaming him she saw look here missis he went on roughly youve got money in the house and i must have it how do you know that i have money in the house your husband brought some home last night it is here now this was true and she was startled to find how much this man knew do you know my husband she asked yes i know him his name is ephraim gregory he had some money paid him yesterday and it is here i dont know where it is but you do get it and be quick about it mrs gregory saw by this time that her visitor was a desperate villain and that she was in a critical position he might since he knew so much know the amount of money which her husband had entrusted to her for safekeeping if she could buy him off for five dollars she would do so will you go if i give you five dollars she asked he laughed no i wont why should i take five dollars when you have a hundred here she turned pale the worst was true then this man had in some mysterious manner discovered the exact sum which she had in charge why had not her husband kept it in his own possession it would have been more prudent i cant give you the money she said pale but resolute oh yes you will he answered mockingly go away please she said in a pleading tone i have given you a meal though you had no claim on me let that be sufficient you cant fool me he replied roughly bring me the money or it will be the worse for you i cannot she gasped then by heaven ill brain you as he spoke he raised the chair on which he had been sitting and held it in position above his head ready to bring it down upon the helpless woman then it was that she uttered the piercing scream which brought walter into the house his astonished glance rested on the terrified woman with her little girl clinging in alarm to her dress cowering beneath the chair which seemed ready to descend upon her walter did not hesitate a moment though the tramp was possessed of twice his strength he darted forward and grasped him by the arm what are you about he demanded sternly the tramp turned at the unexpected interference and partially lowered the chair what business is it of yours you impudent young jackanapes he growled i will make it my business said walter bravely i wont see a lady struck down by a ruffian take care how you talk i can twist you round my finger you manikin what does this man want asked walter turning to mrs gregory he demands money was her answer so he is a thief exclaimed walter contemptuously ill fix you for that growled the tramp with a frown walter quickly explored the room in search of a weapon for he saw that he would have to defend himself there was a fireplace in the apartment and resting beside it was a poker of large size walter sprang for this and grasping it firmly brandished it in a threatening manner go upstairs madam he said and lock yourself in i will attend to this man the tramp burst into a contemptuous laugh why you young whippersnapper he said i could handle half a dozen boys like you i dont like to leave you in the power of this man said mrs gregory he will kill you right you are maam growled the giant thats just what i am going to do the lady turned pale she was frightened but her concern for walters safety overcame her fear for herself i shall stay here she said it would be cowardly to leave you take my advice boy growled the tramp and clear out of here it is no concern of yours walter did not answer but keen alert vigilant he fixed his eye warily on his formidable opponent well youngster said the tramp impatiently did you hear me yes i heard you leave this room or ill smash you smash away retorted walter though he was barely five feet six inches in height while the tramp was fully six feet his muscles had been toughened by exercise in the college gymnasium and by rowing in the college crew and he was wonderfully quick in his motions feeling that the time for forbearance was over and irritated beyond measure by walters audacity the tramp prepared to carry out his threat he raised the chair and with a downward sweep aimed at walters head had the blow taken effect this story would never have been written but walters quick eye foresaw the movement and springing aside he dodged the blow and brought down the poker on the muscular part of the giants arm with what force he could command there was a howl of pain and the tramps arm hung limp and lifeless at his side while with the other he clasped it in evident suffering you murderous young villain he shrieked ill kill you for that walter felt that he was in a dangerous position leave the room please he said to mrs gregory you will be in my way she obeyed for her champion had shown himself worthy to command and walter sprang to the other side of the table placing it between him and his foe by this time the tramp had got ready for an attack he dashed round the table after walter and finally succeeded in spite of the boys activity in grasping him by the shoulder ah he said with a deep sigh of content ive got you now ill pay you for that blow walter felt that he had never been in such a tight place before chapter xv the excitement deepens walter was fortunate enough not to lose his head under any circumstances he noticed that his opponent held him by his right hand and it was his right arm which had been lamed naturally therefore it had lost some of its strength this was his opportunity with a sudden twist he wriggled out of the giants grasp and understanding that it was dangerous to be at too close quarters he threw open the outer door and dashed into the yard whether this would on the whole have helped him was uncertain as the tramp could probably outrun him but just in the nick of time a team appeared driven by a young man perhaps twentyfive of remarkable size hiram nutt was six feet six inches in height the tallest man in the county and he was as athletic as he was tall he tipped the scales at two hundred and ten pounds and was famous for his feats of strength he was a farmers son and lived at elm bank when he saw walter dash out of the house pursued by an illlooking tramp he thought it high time to interfere whats up he demanded still retaining his seat in the wagon none of your business retorted the tramp too angry to be prudent the kids been impudent and im going to pound him to a jelly meanwhile walter was leading the tramp a chase round the wagon narrowly escaping seizure help me exclaimed walter panting if you do ill lay you out exclaimed the pursuer who had been too much occupied to notice the formidable size of the young man in the wagon hiram nutt smiled a smile of conscious strength jump in the wagon boy he said ill take care of you walter obeyed directions and the tramp tried to follow him but in an instant hiram had risen to his full height and leaping to the ground hurried to the rear of the vehicle and caught hold of the tramp the latter tried to resist but he was like a child in the grasp of a man he looked up in amazement for he was proud of his strength what museum did you escape from you monster he panted hiram laughed never mind he said its well im here now boy who is this man i found him in that house ready to strike down the lady who lives there because she would not give him what money she had hiram nutts brows contracted why you thieving scoundrel he cried vigorously shaking his captive you dared to threaten mrs gregory did he hurt the lady he added anxiously no i heard her cry for help and rushed in then he turned upon me he might have killed you i wish i had ejaculated the tramp with a scowl where is mrs gregory now i told her to go upstairs just then the lady who from an upper window had observed the discomfiture and capture of her enemy came out oh mr nutt she exclaimed i am so glad you came along i was afraid this brave boy would get hurt it isnt he that will get hurt now said nutt significantly how came this fellow in your house he came in half an hour ago and asked for food and you gave it to him yes i got ready a lunch for him and made him some tea though he wanted liquor and this was the way of repaying the favor he had heard in some way that my husband brought home some money last evening and he demanded it i wish mr nutt you would take charge of it till my husband comes home i dont dare to have it in the house it wont be necessary for there comes your husband it was true ephraim gregory turned the corner of the street and paused in surprise at the spectacle before him whats the matter lucy he asked she briefly explained i am so glad you are at home she sighed but how do you happen to come so early i think it was a presentiment of evil i thought of the money i had left with you and it occurred to me that it might expose you to danger so i got leave of absence and took an early train for elm bank what shall i do with this fellow mr gregory asked hiram ill go into the house and get a rope to tie him then well take him to the lockup let me go said the tramp uneasily i was only joking you carried the joke too far my friend said hiram significantly ill take you round to the lockup by way of joke and judge jones will sentence you to the penitentiary just to help the joke along let me go whined the tramp now thoroughly subdued i am a poor man and thats what led me to do wrong i suppose you never indulged in such a little joke before no this is the first time probably you are a church member when you are at home said hiram in a tone of sarcasm youre a good man gone wrong aint you yes said the tramp you look like it such good men as you are better off in jail ill leave town and never come back i will on my honor pleaded the tramp earnestly i dont put any confidence in what you say ah heres the rope now hold still if you know whats best for yourself the tramp attempted resistance but a little vigorous shaking up by his captor soon brought him to terms in five minutes with his hands and feet firmly tied he was on his way to the lockup mr gregory and walter accompanied him in the wagon now mr sherwood said gregory when their errand was completed i want to thank you for your brave defense of my wife i only did what any one would do under the same circumstances said walter modestly any one of the requisite courage you put yourself in danger i didnt think of that mr gregory no i suppose not but it is proper that i should think of it you have placed me under an obligation that i shall not soon forget you must do me the favor to come home to supper with me and pass the night will it interfere seriously with your business i am a lifeinsurance agent said walter or at least i am trying to be but have not yet succeeded in writing a policy i have been thinking of insuring my life for a small sum if you come home with me you may talk me into doing it then i will certainly accept your invitation said walter smiling my wife made me promise to keep you she wants to show her gratitude besides you may be wanted to appear against the prisoner tomorrow morning i shall be glad to help him to his deserts said walter the sooner he is locked up the better it will be for the community walter had no reason to regret his acceptance of the invitation mrs gregory exerted herself to the utmost in providing an appetizing supper far in advance of anything he would have had set before him at his boardinghouse mrs canfield being an indifferent cook generally her butter was strong and her tea weak while the contrary should have been the case and her biscuit heavy with saleratus walter thoroughly enjoyed his supper and was almost ashamed of his appetite but it gave his hostess great pleasure to see his appreciation of the meal and she took it as a compliment to herself as a cook after supper walter and mr gregory sat down to business he explained the methods of the insurance company for which he was acting as agent and found mr gregory an interested and intelligent listener you may write me a policy for a thousand dollars he said you will need to pass a medical examination said walter certainly will our village physician do yes then take your hat and walk over with me it is only halfamile distant the whole matter was adjusted that evening and walter was pleased to feel that he had made a successful start in his new business the next morning the tramp was brought before justice jones who arranged to hold court early to oblige walter and mr gregory and the prisoner received a sentence of a years confinement he gave the name of barney fogg and under that name received his sentence he scowled fiercely while walter was giving his evidence and as he was taken from the courtroom handcuffed he turned toward our hero and said its your turn now young bantam but ill be even with you yet what a terrible man said mr gregory shuddering i hope i shall never see him again chapter xvi walter goes into a new business one swallow doesnt make a summer and one policy doesnt establish the success of an insurance agent walter received from mr perkins five dollars commission on the policy he had written at elm bank and this encouraged him to renewed efforts but in the fortnight following he only succeeded in writing a policy for two hundred and fifty dollars for a man who designed it to meet his funeral expenses for this walter received one dollar and a quarter he made numerous other attempts but he found though he understood the subject thoroughly that his youth operated against him he decided that he was wasting his time and one morning he waited on mr perkins and resigned his agency have you anything else in view asked that gentleman no sir then why dont you keep on till you have secured another position because it takes up my time and prevents my getting anything else i dont know but you are right mr sherwood you have made a good beginning and if you were ten years older i think you would make a successful agent i cant afford to wait ten years returned walter with a smile if ever you want to come back i will start you again walter thanked mr perkins and left the office he now began to explore the columns of the daily papers in the hope of finding some opening but met with the usual rebuffs and refusals when he called upon advertisers at length he saw the following advertisement in the chicago tribune wanted a confidential clerk at a salary of fifteen dollars per week as a guarantee of fidelity a small deposit will be required locke green no state street fifteen dollars a week repeated walter hopefully that will support me very comfortably if i get it i will change my boardingplace for i dont like mrs canfields table i shall feel justified in paying a little more than i do now the only thing that troubled him was as to the deposit though he had economized as closely as he knew how he had made quite an inroad upon his small capital and had only fortysix dollars left he had been in chicago four weeks and had not yet been able to write home that he had found a permanent position he had written about his insurance agency and had not failed to chronicle his first success this letter doctor mack had read to his housekeeper miss nancy sprague well nancy he said walter is at work you dont say so doctor what is he doing he is a lifeinsurance agent is that a good business walter writes that one agent is making a hundred and twentyfive dollars a week answered the doctor with a humorous twinkle in his eye im glad master walter has got such a good business said the housekeeper brightening up thats a great sum for a boy like him to make it isnt he that has made it nancy there are very few that do and those have to be old and experienced men well hell make a good living anyhow perhaps so answered the doctor dubiously for he understood better than nancy how precarious were the chances of an inexperienced agent he was not at all surprised when walter wrote later that though he had met with some success he thought it better to look for a situation with a regular salary attached hes gaining a little knowledge of the world thought the guardian i dont think hell be able to indulge in luxurious living for the present it wont be long probably before he runs out of money it was with a hopeful spirit that walter started for the office of locke green he was pretty well acquainted with chicago by this time and had no difficulty in locating any office in the business part of the city no indication was given in the advertisement of the business carried on by locke green as to that however walter felt indifferent his chief concern was the weekly salary of fifteen dollars which he needed very much arrived at the number indicated walter ran upstairs and with some difficulty found the office in a small room on the fourth floor a card on the door bore the names locke green again there was no clue to the business carried on by the firm walter was not sure whether he ought to knock but finally decided to open the door and enter he found himself in a room scarcely larger than a small bedroom with a small desk in one corner at this sat a man with long hair industriously writing in a large blank book he glanced at walter as the door opened wait a moment young man he said in a deep bass voice i will be at leisure in two minutes he wrinkled up his face turned back several pages appeared thoughtfully considering some problem and then wrote again rapidly finally he turned he was seated in a revolving chair and placing his two hands together palms inward said abruptly well young man what can i do for you i believe you advertised in the tribune this morning for a confidential clerk yes i should like to apply for the position if it is still vacant we have not yet filled the place said mr locke we have had several applications but the post is a very responsible one and we are of course very particular i am afraid my chance is very small then thought walter still i like your appearance and it is possible that you may suit have you business experience not much sir indeed till a short time since i was a college student yale or harvard no sir euclid college ahem small but very respectable your name walter sherwood how long were you in college two years left of your own accord oh yes sir just so i thought perhaps you might have been suspended or expelled i can refer you on that point to the president or any of the professors oh i will take your word for it i left college on account of losing my property ah indeed said mr locke doubtfully perhaps you noticed that we require a small deposit as a guarantee of fidelity yes sir i have a little money mr locke looked relieved of course continued he loftily doing the business we do money is of comparatively little importance to us except as a guarantee of fidelity how much did you say you had i didnt say sir i could deposit twentyfive dollars with you mr locke shrugged his shoulders that is very little he said true sir but it is a good deal to me it will be enough to insure my fidelity we had a young man here this morning said mr locke musingly who was willing to deposit a hundred dollars with us indeed sir i wonder you did not take him we should so far as the money went but i could see by his appearance that there was no business in him our clerk must be quick sharp alert the young man was very much disappointed i couldnt deposit any such sum as that mr locke it will not be necessary still twentyfive dollars is very small you couldnt say thirty could you that is merely equal to two weeks salary yes sir i might be willing to deposit thirty dollars may i ask what business you are interested in we have control for the western states of a valuable patent a foldingtable and we have several hundred agents out who report in general by letter that accounts for the small office thought walter come here a moment and i will give you an idea how we carry on business here for instance is a page devoted to b schenck he is operating for us in minnesota you will observe that his remittances for the last four weeks aggregate three hundred and sixtyseven dollars he has been doing very well but we have others who do better on the next page is our account with g parker his months work amounts to two hundred and eightynine dollars what would my duties be sir to keep the office when i am out receive letters and answer them and see agents i think i could do that sir hours from nine to five i think you will suit me if at the end of the week i dont find you satisfactory i will pay you your wages and return your money very well sir i accept the position you may as well hand me the money and go to work today walter drew out thirty dollars the greater part of his little store and handed it to mr locke mr locke tucked it carelessly into his vest pocket and taking his hat said sit down here and if any agents come in tell them i will be back at one oclock that is all you will need to do today chapter xvii walters visitors walter sat down at the desk complacently he had parted with thirty dollars but it was on deposit with his new employer and would be returned to him whenever his engagement terminated he only hoped that his services would prove satisfactory he meant to do his best on fifteen dollars a week he could live very comfortably and even save money he felt that it would be prudent to do this as he did not wish to call upon his guardian for any remittances during the year i shant have to work very hard thought walter in default of any other employment he looked over the large ledger committed to his charge it appeared to contain certain accounts with different agents all of whom seemed to be meeting with very good success judging from the amount of remittances credited to them in about halfanhour there was a knock at the door come in called out walter a man of about thirtyfive entered briskly he was rather shabbily dressed and his red face indicated possible indulgence in intoxicating liquor is mr locke in he asked no sir i wanted to see him i am his confidential clerk said walter proudly are you an agent yes i am an agent i suppose i ought to see him he will be back at one oclock i cant stop as i have been away for some weeks and want to go out and see my family at barrington if you wish to leave any message i will give it to mr locke as soon as he returns perhaps that will do my name is jerome grigson tell mr locke i have met with excellent success in ohio in the last four weeks i have sold goods to the amount of four hundred and seventeen dollars i should think it was doing remarkably well observed walter it is but any one could sell for locke business chiefly in mr lockes hands how long have you been in the office not long answered walter who did not care to admit that his term of service covered less than an hour youve a good place with a rising firm mind you keep it i will try to said walter earnestly theyre square men locke green i never worked for squarer men this was pleasant to hear walter felt that he had made no mistake in parting with his thirty dollars well i must be going have you taken down my name yes sir jerome grigson right say i will look in some time tomorrow and bring in a check for four hundred and seventeen dollars very well sir mr grigson left the office twenty minutes later a boy of about his own age opened the door he glanced at walter diffidently you advertised for a confidential clerk he said is is the place filled yes answered walter in a tone of satisfaction you dont want anybody else do you asked the youth looking disappointed not at present but we might be able to employ you as an agent is it hard work well of course you will have to exert yourself said walter condescendingly toying with a pen as he spoke but successful men can earn good wages with us he was talking as if he was one of the partners but it is a way young clerks have are yon one of the firm asked the young man doubtfully no answered walter not exactly mr locke will be in about one oclock and if you will come round a little after that you can talk with him about an agency i will put in a good word for you he added in a patronizing tone thank you sir id like to get a place the youth departed and walter was left alone but not for long a middleaged man entered and looked inquiringly at walter are you mr green he asked no sir i have seen mr locke but i thought you might be mr green walter felt flattered to be taken for one of the firm i am the confidential clerk he said can i do anything for you i wanted to see mr locke and pay him some money i will take it and receipt for it said walter briskly well i suppose that will do as you are the clerk what name asked walter opening the book jonas damon here is a check on the corndish national bank of illinois for two hundred and twentyseven dollars i have made it payable to locke green all right said walter in a businesslike tone if you wish to see mr locke he will be in at one oclock he added as he put the check in his vest pocket no i am obliged to go out of town in halfanhour it isnt necessary to see him he would rather see the check mr damon laughed and so did walter it made him feel quite like a business man to be installed in an office receiving and crediting checks have you been long in our employment he asked about six months i hope you have found it satisfactory yes i have made an excellent living how much salary do you get fifteen dollars a week answered walter rather complacently you look like a smart young fellow youd easily make double the money as an agent thank you for the suggestion i may undertake that some time i have been a lifeinsurance agent did it pay not as well as i hoped i think i shall like my present place better i must be going tell mr locke i will be in tomorrow all right it is evident thought walter that i am in the employ of a substantial and prosperous firm the duties are certainly very light and pleasant i am in luck to get a clerkship here it is rather surprising mr locke didnt ask for references then it occurred to him that the deposit was taken as a substitute for references then again walter flattered himself that his personal appearance might have produced a favorable impression upon his employer and had some influence in leading to an engagement his next caller was a young man dark and sallow with a slight mustache is this the office of locke green he asked yes sir will you describe mr locke to me asked the young man who appeared to be laboring under some excitement walter was rather surprised at such a request but complied with it yes hes the man said his visitor slapping his hands together impetuously hes the man that cheated me out of fifty dollars you must be mistaken said walter how did he cheat you out of it one moment are you his confidential clerk yes i thought so returned the young man laughing wildly so was i you were his clerk yes for two weeks i paid him fifty dollars good money as security you did repeated walter with some anxiety yes at the end of two weeks he told me i would not suit but he paid you your wages and returned you your money no he didnt exploded the young man he told me to come round on monday morning and he would pay me well i called monday and he was gone he had moved the scoundrel i should like to choke him was it this office no let me see that book ah it is the same that i kept have you too given him money i deposited thirty dollars ah it is the same old game you will never see a cent of it again but said walter i dont understand he is doing a good business i have had calls from two of his agents one of them handed me this check and he drew out the check mr damon had given him the young man took it and laughed bitterly i dont believe there is any such bank he said i never heard of it then why should the agent hand me the check to pull wool over your eyes these agents are in league with this man locke that wasnt his name when he engaged me what was it then he called himself libby libby richmond that was the name of the firm what made you think he might have changed his name because the advertisement reads the same and you really think it is the same man yes i feel sure of it he will be back at one oclock if you will wait till then you can see for yourself ill wait said the young man grinding his teeth i will confront the swindler face to face i will demand my money the door opened and some one put in his head but before walter or his visitor could see who it was it closed again fifteen minutes later a telegraph boy entered the office chapter xviii walter is turned adrift mr sherwood said the telegraph messenger inquiringly that is my name answered walter a message for you walter opened the note and read as follows i am called out of the city you may close up at four and leave the key with the janitor report for duty tomorrow morning locke what is it asked the young man eagerly walter showed him the note it looks to me like some trick said the stranger but i dont see any object in it he has your thirty dollars and i have a check for over two hundred i would rather have the thirty dollars what shall you do there is nothing to do but follow directions the young man shrugged his shoulders then you will come round tomorrow morning he said certainly ill look in upon you i want to see this mr locke though i doubt if that is his name walter was disposed to think the young man too suspicious he was of a sanguine temperament and he tried to persuade himself that there was really no good reason to suspect mr locke of unfair dealing he laid considerable stress upon the favorable reports of the agents who had called upon him during the day at length four oclock came and he closed up the office leaving the key with the janitor he went home not quite knowing whether he was to be congratulated or not he decided not to say anything just yet about his engagement lest it might turn out to be deceptive had he been quite sure that it was substantial and to be relied upon he would have written to his guardian to announce the good news but he thought it best to wait the next morning he went to the office arriving at the hour agreed upon please give me the key to locke greens office he said to the janitor mr lockes given up the room was the startling reply walter was dismayed given up the room have you seen him he inquired yes when he called yesterday afternoon an hour after you went away and got the key from me in about ten minutes he came down again carrying a ledger in his hand i have taken another office he said this is not large enough for me have you told your clerk i asked him yes i have sent a message to him he replied carelessly walter sank against the door he felt limp and helpless mr locke had gone off and carried his thirty dollars with him there was hardly room to doubt that it was a case of deliberate swindling true he had the check in his possession a check for two hundred and twentyseven dollars but even if it were genuine it was made out in favor of locke green and would be of no service to him though in that case it would insure mr lockes calling upon him should such be the case he determined that he would not give up the check till his thirty dollars were returned walter walked slowly out of the building when he reached dearborn street he went into the office of a private banker and showing the check asked is there any such bank as this i never heard of any said the banker walter turned pale then you think it is bogus very likely under what circumstances did you receive it walter explained i am sorry to say that you are probably the victim of a confidence man or firm i think i saw an expose of some similar swindlers in the interocean a few weeks since did you give the fellow any money yes sir thirty dollars you will have to whistle for it in all probability walters heart felt as heavy as lead he had less than twenty dollars now and his small balance would last him less than three weeks what should he do then should he write to his guardian for more money he hated to do this and above all he hated to confess that he had been victimized in the next three days he answered several advertisements and made personal applications for employment but no one seemed to want him in one case he was offered three dollars a week as an office boy but he had not got quite so low down as to accept this place and salary it struck walter as very singular that one who had spent two years at college and possessed a fair knowledge of latin greek and mathematics should be in so little request he envied the small office boys whom he saw on the street and even the busy newsboys who appeared to be making an income they had work to do and he had none he decided that he must reduce his expenses and accordingly hired a poor hallbedroom for a dollar and a quarter a week and took his meals at restaurants one day he went into kinsleys restaurant on adams street feeling the need of a good meal and sat down at a table he gave his order and ate his dinner with appetite he was about to rise from the table when casting his eye about the room he started in surprise as at a neighboring table he saw the familiar face of mr jonas damon whose check he held in his pocket instantly his resolve was taken he would speak to mr damon and try to ascertain something about the check he walked over to the table and touching damon on the shoulder said mr damon i believe the man looked up quickly and a little change in his countenance showed that he recognised walter but he assumed a stolid look and said were you speaking to me young man yes sir what did you call me mr damon youre off the track that isnt my name perhaps not said walter resolutely but when you called at locke greens office and handed me a check you said your name was jonas damon ho ho laughed damon so i gave you a check did i yes for two hundred and twentyseven dollars thats news to me im not in a position to give such checks as that i have got the check with me now why didnt you cash it it was not made payable to me then why didnt you give it to the party it was made out to because he disappeared thats a strange story do you know what i think no but i should like to i think you are a confidence man and are trying to take in a poor countryman but ive read about you fellows in the papers and i am on my guard youd better go away or i may call a policeman this certainly was turning the tables on walter with a vengeance for a fellow like damon to accuse him of being a confidence man was something like the wolfs charge against the lamb in aesops fable damon saw that walter looked perplexed and followed up the attack if anybody has given you a check he said i dont see what youve got to complain about youd better make use of it if you can do you deny that your name is damon of course i do my name is kellogg nelson kellogg of springfield illinois i am in the city to buy goods and you dont know mr locke of locke green never heard of the gentleman if youve got a check of his youd better advertise for him i wish my name was locke i shouldnt mind receiving it myself here the waiter came up with mr damons order and that gentleman addressed himself to disposing of it walter left the restaurant slowly and walked in a dejected manner in the direction of the palmer house he began to think that he was a failure when he was a student of euclid college he was in his own estimation a person of importance now he felt his insignificance if the world owed him a living it seemed doubtful if it was inclined to pay the debt chapter xix walter meets professor robinson two weeks passed walter applied for all sorts of situations but obtained no engagement meanwhile his money steadily diminished till he awoke one morning to find only seventyfive cents in his purse things were getting decidedly serious i wonder if there is any poorhouse in chicago thought walter not wholly in jest it is not the sort of home i should prefer but it is better than genteel starvation he went out breakfasted and at the restaurant picked up a copy of the chicago times this was a piece of luck for it saved him from the small expenditure necessary to secure it he turned to the department of help wanted and looking down the column came to this notice wanted by a traveling lecturer a young man who can make himself generally useful one who plays the violin preferred apply to professor robinson hotel brevoort walter knew this hotel it was located on madison street and was on the european plan that will suit me he said to himself i must lose no time in making application i can play the violin fairly well if it will help me to a position i will bless the violin in ten minutes he was at the hotel inquiring for professor robinson he is in his room said the clerk you can go up at once guided by a bellboy walter reached the door of no and knocked come in said a deep bass voice opening the door he found himself in the presence of a stout man inclined to be tall with a long full beard who glanced at him inquiringly professor robinson i believe said walter i am the man answered the professor i have come to apply for a position i have read your advertisement in the times just so let me look at you walter blushed a little while the professor transfixed him with his glittering eye he anxiously hoped that he would bear inspection humph i think youll do how old are you eighteen in fact walters birthday had been passed in chicago you are rather young can you play on the violin yes sir let me hear you the professor pointed to a violin on the bed i am glad he doesnt expect me to furnish the violin walter said to himself he took the instrument from its case and trying the strings began to play a series of familiar airs the violin was not a stradivarius but it was of good quality and responded satisfactorily to the efforts of the young musician professor robinson listened attentively and nodded his approval you play better than the last young man i had walter was glad to hear it i may as well tell you the nature of your duties in case i engage you i call myself a traveling lecturer but this may convey an erroneous idea i am the discoverer of professor robinsons liquid balm which is warranted to cure more diseases than any other patent preparation in existence i wont go into particulars for these can be read in my circular now it is my custom to go from one town to another engage a hall if the weather requires otherwise gather a crowd around me in a public place and lecture about the merits of my remarkable preparation you besides assisting me in a general way are expected to draw and entertain the crowd by your performance on the violin can you sing walter shook his head i am afraid he said that if i should undertake to sing it would drive away the crowd very well it isnt necessary though it would have helped now what are your ideas as to compensation as the professor spoke he leaned back in his chair and awaited a reply i hardly know what it would be right to ask returned walter hesitatingly how much did you pay your last assistant i paid him fifteen dollars a month and his traveling expenses this was a good deal more than walter had made since he had undertaken to earn his own living yet there seemed small chance of laying up anything out of it may i ask sir he inquired do you meet with pretty good success in disposing of your balm yes the public knows a good thing when it is brought to its attention would you be willing to pay my expenses and ten per cent commission on sales why do you prefer this to a stated salary because it would be an incentive to do my best then if i helped you to a successful sale i should be paid in proportion i have an idea you look blooming and healthy are you willing i should advertise you as one who has been snatched from death by my celebrated balm i dont think i would like it sir it would be imposing upon the public i merely suggested it but i wont insist upon it i suppose you are thoroughly honest and reliable walter smiled i dont know that my assurance will satisfy you but i can truly say that i am you look it and i trust a good deal to appearances i will accept your assurance thank you sir can you join me at once yes sir then i will expect you to bring your baggage here during the day the sooner the better you will then receive your instructions walter was very glad to hear this for his purse was so nearly exhausted that it was comforting to think his lodging and meals would hereafter be paid by some one else when he came to reflect upon the nature of his duties general assistant to a quack doctor playing on village commons and in country halls to draw a crowd of prospective customers he felt that it was hardly a thing to be proud of with his college training he ought to be qualified for something better but the cold hard fact stared him in the face that it was the only employment that offered and he must accept it or starve walter had become practical his limited acquaintance with the world had made him so and he was not going to refuse bread and butter because it was offered by a quack doctor within an hour walter had given up his room the rent had been paid in advance and transferred his luggage to the hotel brevoort where he was assigned a small apartment on the upper floor i shall leave the city in two days said the professor i have put an advertisement into the daily papers which brings customers to the hotel but i depend chiefly upon my sales on the road do you travel on the cars asked walter no i have a neat wagon in which i carry a supply of bottles of balm and this enables me to stop where i like i prefer villages to very large towns and cities it is better for me to visit places where there are no drugstores as the people are more dependent on what is brought to them when you are in the city shall i get my commission ahem i am not clear as to that answered professor robinson thoughtfully you see you are not called upon to play suppose you give me five per cent in chicago and large places very well i will do so i will settle with you at the end of every week if that will be satisfactory yes sir two days afterward a light wagon drew up in front of the hotel drawn by a strong horse and walter helped the professor to put a trunk of medicine in the back part then he seated himself with professor robinson on the front seat and they set out in the direction of the suburbs a new life was opening before walter what it would lead to he could not guess at any rate it promised him a living and this was a practical advantage which he had learned to appreciate how long have you been in this business professor he asked ten years answered the professor how did you happen to go into it ill tell you ten years ago i found myself in a tight place i was on my uppers as the actors say a friend who was a drug clerk gave me the recipe for my balm i borrowed a hundred dollars had a quantity made up and set out on the road and now now i am worth fifteen thousand dollars well invested and can make a good living every year all this was encouraging to walter he was eager to begin his work chapter xx on the road on a small common near the center of the village of brandon for special reasons i do not give the real names of places visited by the travelers professor robinson halted his wagon and signed to walter to commence playing give em something popular he said walter struck up annie rooney and followed it up with mcginty within ten minutes fifty persons were gathered about the wagon then the professor held up his hand and walter stopped gentlemen began the professor my young assistant will soon charm you again with the dulcet strains of his violin but it is necessary for me to combine business with pleasure and it affords me satisfaction to call your attention to the surpassing merits of my liquid balm only twentyfive cents a bottle it is a sovereign remedy for most of the diseases that flesh is heir to all diseases of the stomach liver and lungs are if not cured very greatly mitigated by this wonderful medicine it is the only remedy for consumption that can be relied upon why gentlemen a year since i was selling in a small town in ohio among those who gathered about me was a hollowcheeked man with a churchyard cough he asked me if i would undertake to cure him i answered that i would guarantee nothing but was convinced that his life would be prolonged by the use of my balm he bought halfadozen bottles where do you think that man is now voice in the crowd in the grave not a bit of it gentlemen he is hale and hearty his face is full his color healthy and he tips the scales at one hundred and seventyfive pounds i was myself surprised at the extraordinary efficacy of my wonderful medicine he used in all a dozen bottles giving me a second order later on and so for the paltry sum of three dollars was drawn back from the brink of the grave and restored to life and health now who will buy a bottle this appeal sold eight bottles a saffronfaced man came forward and asked if the balm could cure livercomplaint my friend said the professor if you will try the balm you ought to have halfadozen bottles as it is uncertain when i shall come this way again your liver will become o k and your face will be as fresh and blooming as that of a twelveyearold boy this prospect seemed so encouraging that the saffronfaced man bought four bottles and took the professors address at the end of about twenty minutes walter struck up again a lively dancing tune and was listened to with evident pleasure when all who desired the balm seemed to have invested the professor brought out a supply of toilet soaps and sold to the amount of a couple of dollars at the end of two hours he packed up his wares walter took a seat beside him and they started for the next village you had a pretty good sale professor said walter yes as well as i can calculate i took in about ten dollars walter reflected with pleasure that his commission would amount to a dollar the professor had another way of utilizing remedies when he put up for the night at a hotel he usually succeeded in paying a part of his hotel bill in medicine or toilet articles as his average profits on the former were seventy per cent and on the latter forty it may be seen that this was greatly to his advantage walter did not wonder that he had already accumulated a small competence on the fourth evening as walter was leaving the suppertable a tall young man looking something like the stock pictures of uncle sam came up to him say young fellow he commenced some of us young people are going to have a dance at the schoolhouse hall but we havent got no fiddler peter jackson who generally plays for us has got the lumbago and cant play whatll you charge what do you generally pay mr jackson asked walter three dollars an evening do you think i can play as well as he you kin play enough sight better he cant play no tunes that aint fifty years old very well i will charge you the same that is if the professor doesnt object go ahead and see him and let me know walter sought the professor and laid the matter before him all right was the answer ive no objection you can give me onethird of the money and keep the rest yourself is that satisfactory perfectly so sir walter played till one oclock he felt rather tired when he got through but he saw that he was making a favorable impression and the two dollars which he would receive for himself would be of great service the man who first spoke to him paid him the money i hope i gave satisfaction said walter yes you did and no mistake but some of the girls were sorry they couldnt have you for a partner walter blushed i am afraid he said that i couldnt play and dance too at his age few young men are indifferent to the favorable opinion of young ladies and walter would have been glad to have participated in the dancing however just at present money was more acceptable to him than anything else when the week was concluded the professor looked over his accounts and ascertained that walters commission amounted to nine dollars and sixty cents the two dollars he had received for outside services carried his weeks earnings to nearly twelve dollars he had been out with professor robinson a month when he had a surprise it was in the town of glenwood his violin drew the usual crowd who were listening with complimentary attention when a young man who casually paused to judge of the musicians merits started in amazement by jove he exclaimed to a young lady who accompanied him thats my classmate sherwood what do you mean hugh asked the young lady i mean that the young man who is playing the violin is my college classmate walter sherwood but what on earth can have put him in such a position is he poor he had the reputation of being rich in college but i remember that at the close of the sophomore year he was reported to have lost his money he is nicelooking said the young lady after a critical examination of walter yes and hes no end of a nice fellow i am truly sorry that he is so reduced shall you go and speak to him yes but i shall have to wait till he is at leisure then i will go home by myself and leave you to confer together and by the way hugh you know we are to have a little company tonight do you think your friend would play for us he really plays uncommonly well i will invite him as a guest i shouldnt want to treat him as a professional performer we can afford to treat him as an equal for he is of good family and brought up as a gentleman i am quite willing to receive him as such hugh longwood remained in the crowd and when the playing was over pushed up to the wagon walter was assisting the professor in serving out bottles of the famous balm you may give me a bottle walter said longwood by gracious hugh longwood exclaimed walter who would have expected to see you here this is my home but we certainly do meet under strange circumstances what on earth led you into this business thrift thrift hugh answered walter with a smile let me tell you that i am making a good living and benefiting my fellow men but it is such a change from euclid college true such a come down i dont know about that i am afraid my career there was not particularly creditable now i am working and earning my own living can you wait till we get through here then i will talk with you as long as you like agreed i am curious to hear of your adventures professor robinson proposed to stay in glenwood overnight so that walter had plenty of time to see his friend my sister is to have a party of friends this evening and she commissions me to invite you but hesitated walter i have no dress suit here you look well enough besides i am filling a very humble position we know who you are and that you are a gentleman that is enough will you come yes i will answered walter heartily it will be like a taste of the old life and if we should ask you to favor us on the violin i shall be glad to contribute to the pleasure of the evening but you havent told me why you are not back at college my father is anxious to have me help him in his business his health is not what it was not being likely to set the river on fire in any literary profession i decided to give up the college for the countingroom i think you did right chapter xxi miss longwoods party at eight oclock walter reached the longwood mansion it would have been early for a party in the city but glenwood people were sensible and beginning early were able to close in good season the house was a handsome one and the rooms tastefully furnished were blazing with light and already half full walter was quite at home in society and advancing greeted hugh and his sister by whom he was cordially received and introduced to other members of the family about nine oclock dancing commenced walter did not think it out of place to ask the hand of laura longwood being so intimate with her brother she had just accepted his invitation to dance when a darkcomplexioned young man dressed in the extreme of the fashion and evidently possessing a very high opinion of his appearance and position approached and with a ceremonious bow said miss longwood may i have the pleasure of dancing with you not this time mr murdock answered the young lady i am engaged to mr sherwood murdock upon this turned his glance upon walter whose dress it must be confessed was scarcely befitting the occasion but it will readily be understood that he could not carry a dress suit about with him oh said murdock and his scornful glance spoke volumes let me introduce you to mr sherwood my brothers friend continued the young lady i am indeed honored by the introduction said murdock bowing very low walter colored for it was evident that the tone was ironical he bowed coldly but did not speak the music struck up and the dancing began though walter was plainly dressed he was a good dancer and miss longwood had no occasion to be ashamed of her partner murdock approached hugh longwood who was busy in forming sets and was not dancing who is that dancing with your sister he asked abruptly a college friend of mine walter sherwood he looks poor i believe he has met with a reverse of fortune his face looks familiar i am quite sure i have seen him somewhere he only arrived in town today i have it he was playing the violin for a faker on the town common this afternoon yes it was there i met him good heavens and you invited him to your party why not demanded hugh coldly the assistant and companion of a wandering faker no mr murdock i did not invite him for my sister saved me the trouble i dont see how you could sanction her doing it it strikes me murdock you are interfering beyond your province walter sherwood you will be good enough to remember is a gentleman by birth and education and a college classmate of mine that may all be but think of his position suppose we drop this discussion said hugh frigidly i shall invite whom i please and shall ask advice of no one oh if you take it that way i will be silent it will be as well the dance was over and murdock approaching miss longwood once more asked her hand for the next dance she accepted and they took their places on the floor i can hardly expect to equal your last partner said murdock in an illtempered tone laura longwood looked at him for a moment without speaking she was ashamed of his ill breeding perhaps not she answered composedly mr sherwood is a very good dancer i did not refer to that i referred rather to his social position he is of good family i believe but you need not be too modest as regards yourself you overwhelm me returned murdock with an exaggerated bow and you really think me the equal of mr sherwood is it necessary to discuss this question asked laura becoming more and more disgusted with her partner i think i saw the gentleman this afternoon playing the violin on the wagon of a traveling faker yes i saw him also it is an excellent position for a young man of family continued murdock with a scornful curl of the lip suppose we change the subject mr murdock said laura longwood with dignity if you desire a similar position you can speak to mr sherwood you are really very very amusing miss longwood said murdock biting his lip i really dont aspire to such prominence besides i dont play on the violin that is a pity it is a very fine instrument when the dance was concluded murdock sought another but was rather curtly refused his efforts to injure walter had only led to his own discomfiture when a little later he saw walter a second time dancing with miss longwood he began to hate him during the last hour walter obligingly consented to play on his favorite instrument and his performance gave pleasure to the entire company murdock alone excepted when the party broke up it chanced that murdock and walter took leave at the same time walter was slightly in advance when murdock quickening his pace came up with him mr sherwood i believe he said yes sir answered walter i believe i am addressing mr murdock you are i hope you will pardon my giving you a little kindly advice i certainly will if it is friendly answered walter then dont you think you were a little out of place this evening what do you mean asked walter quickly where was i out of place at miss longwoods party why should i be she invited me no doubt as her brothers friend and classmate that is all very well but you dont seem to consider your present position will you be good enough to tell me what is my present position you know better than i can tell you you are the assistant of a low faker i accompany professor robinson as a musical assistant if that is what you mean professor robinson repeated murdock scornfully where did he get his title you will have to ask him said walter smiling that is not the point however you are in his employ well and yet you attend an evening party given by a young lady of high social position mr murdock you may be surprised to learn that it is by no means the first social party of the kind that i have attended that was before you became a faker you will oblige me by not calling me a faker i am earning my living honestly i dont know your business i am a lawyer said murdock haughtily i wish you success in your chosen profession you are truly kind said murdock in an unpleasant tone walter looked at him gravely mr murdock he said you have volunteered to give me advice which you are not inclined to take because i consider you officious in offering it now let me give you some advice i shall be grateful i am sure then let me advise you hereafter to mind your own business you are impertinent said murdock angrily that is my opinion of you one thing more you are quite at liberty to advise miss longwood not to take any notice of me i shall do so and you may be sure that i shall not call upon her without an invitation it is hardly necessary to say this as i leave town tomorrow and it may be a long time before i visit glenwood again murdock heard this with satisfaction for walters good looks and the evident favor with which he was regarded by laura longwood had made him jealous he could not help however launching a final sarcasm dont think me unkind my good fellow he said patronizingly i feel kindly disposed and as a proof will ask you to send round a bottle of your balm to my office shall i pay for it in advance no i will mention your request to the professor and he will probably be glad to furnish you with his medicine goodnight they had reached the hotel and walter entered that fellow is a snob he said to himself he wishes me to feel that one in my position cannot be a gentleman if he is one i dont want to be all his sneers wont make me ashamed of earning my living by an honest use of any gift that god has given me chapter xxii an adventure three months passed without any incident worth recording professor robinsons success was variable but upon the whole he had reason to feel encouraged he was an excellent salesman and his balm though it could not perform all the wonderful cures claimed for it really had merit and this helped materially so far as walter was concerned he found the professor an indulgent and honorable employer whose word was as good as his bond every saturday night there was a statement of sales for the week and walter was paid his commission of ten per cent though he was obliged to make some disbursements the largest being for a suit of clothes he found himself at the end of fourteen weeks possessed of a balance of a hundred dollars this was a source of great satisfaction to walter who had known in chicago how inconvenient it was to be without money one day the professor found himself in a minnesota village he had secured a vacant lot on the principal street for the display of his merchandise he met with rather unusual success a local celebration having drawn a considerable crowd to the town of warwick walter after playing on the violin passed among the crowd with a supply of bottles of balm while the professor was expatiating in an eloquent manner upon its merits among the crowd his attention was drawn to a roughly dressed man in hunting costume wearing a sombrero with a broad brim his face was dark and his expression sinister his eyes were very black and keen he looked like a spaniard and the thought came to waiter that he would make an ideal highwayman he was leaning carelessly against the fence that separated the lot from the street as walter approached he moved slightly and accosted him say young feller is it all true that he with a jerk of his hand toward the professor says about this balm yes sir answered walter in a businesslike tone it is a very valuable remedy in all cases of bruise sprain rheumatism headache and other kindred troubles can i sell you a bottle well i dont mind and the stranger drew out a silver quarter and tendered it in payment do you sell much of this stuff he asked carelessly yes we have large sales you are making money fast i reckon we are doing very well answered walter cautiously its an easy life to lead not so very easy we are on the road early and late do you stop here overnight no i think we will push on to fremont youll get there late perhaps so we shall not commence our sales till tomorrow why is he so inquisitive thought walter and as he turned back to scan once more the face of his recent customer he became more and more distrustful of him does that man live in town he inquired of a boy who that man leaning against the fence yes the boy shook his head i never saw him before he said i guess he came to the celebration when the sale was over walter and the professor went to the hotel for supper walter caught sight of the mysterious stranger in the barroom and could not avoid seeing that he himself was an object of attention why this should be he did not understand if only he were a mindreader and could interpret the mans thoughts it would have relieved his anxiety for in spite of himself he was becoming anxious and apprehensive though he could not explain why at supper the stranger sat opposite him he ate heartily and with great rapidity yet found time to glance repeatedly at walter and his employer as if he felt an interest in them walter sought the professor after supper and communicated to him his fears professor robinson shrugged his shoulders your imagination is running away with you he said i dont see anything extraordinary about this stranger except that he is far from goodlooking dont you think he has a sinister look he is as homely as the ace of spades if that is what you mean suppose he is all homely men are not suspicious characters if they were how would we be judged and the professor laughed in a jolly way you have quite decided to go through to fremont this evening yes i want to reach stillman on saturday there is to be a county fair there and to make it in time we must be moving tonight of course there was no more to be said walter did not care to interfere with the professors plans and he was ashamed to admit that he was nervous and alarmed perhaps his fears were groundless he began to think so when at seven oclock the stableboy brought round a powerful black horse to the front of the inn and the stranger who had given him so much anxiety vaulted into the saddle and rode away without even turning to look at him who is that fellow he asked of an old man who stood near smoking a clay pipe the old man looked thoughtfully at the stranger who had now ridden out of the yard seems to me ive seen that face before he said slowly but i cant rightly tell where he doesnt look like a farmer no if he lived anywhere within twenty miles id know him hes a stranger his looks dont recommend him youre right there boy i shouldnt be surprised to hear that he was an outlaw one of jesse james band mayhap suggested the old man with a smile yes he looks it well hes gone so he wont trouble us this was a consoling thought to walter he carried a hundred dollars in his pocket and he had worked too hard for it to feel reconciled to its loss the stranger judging from his appearance was quite capable of relieving him of it but now he had ridden away doubtless on business of his own and the chances were that they would never meet again about eight oclock professor robinsons team was brought round to the door and he and walter clambered upon the seat and were under way were you ever robbed professor asked walter the professor smiled yes he said by a highwayman no by my assistant a young man who occupied your place he had been with me four weeks and i reposed a good deal of confidence in him as i do in you i hope you wont repent your confidence in me professor i am sure i shall not but to come back to my story charles wright was a goodlooking smoothfaced fellow of twenty and had a good turn for business the trouble with him was that he was extravagant and never had a cent ahead did he earn as much as i do yes for business with me was unusually good at the time he was with me however he never could save money usually we occupied different rooms at the hotels we stopped at but one night the hotel was crowded and we were obliged to room together now as you know i am a sound sleeper i am asleep five minutes after my head touches the pillow and even a thunderstorm during the night would scarcely waken me on some accounts this is an advantage but as you will see it turned out unluckily for me on the night i am speaking of i awoke at the usual time seven oclock and on opening my eyes i saw at once that my young assistant was not in the room this gave me no uneasiness i presumed that he had waked after a good nights sleep and was taking a morning walk i rose from the bed put on my clothes leisurely and it was only after i was completely dressed that i felt in my pocket for my wallet then i made a startling discovery the wallet was gone was there much money in it about a hundred and ten dollars fortunately i had about fifty dollars besides in another pocket so that i was not left quite penniless was your assistant the thief there is no doubt about it he had gone downstairs at five oclock told the clerk he was going for a walk and did not show up after that have you seen or heard of him since no i may meet him again some time but i doubt if i should have him arrested he injured himself more than he did me i lost a hundred dollars or more but he lost a good place and his character for honesty depend upon it walter honesty is the best policy in the long run i am sure of that sir four miles from the hotel they entered a wood through which the road ran for half a mile it was dark but not completely dark a few stars sent down a faint light by the light of these stars walter descried a man mounted on a large horse stationed motionless in the middle of the road apparently waiting for them to come up professor he exclaimed clutching his employer by the arm thats the man we saw at the hotel chapter xxiii walter and the highwayman the professor was startled at the exclamation but was unwilling to believe that the man before him was a highwayman my friend he said wont you move to one side you are in my path we have a little business together said the horseman grimly as he drew out and presented a revolver that must be attended to first do you wish a bottle of balm inquired professor robinson in a tremulous voice no you may need one yourself unless we come to terms what do you mean hand over your pocketbook old man and be quick about it i presume you are joking said the professor nervously you wont find it much of a joke are you a highwayman gasped the professor the other gave a quick short laugh you may call me that if you like he said now professor robinson had as was natural a decided objection to surrendering his money and though there seemed little chance of producing an effect on the mind of the outlaw ventured to remonstrate my friend he said if you are in want i will lend nay give you five dollars out of a spirit of humanity but i trust you will not jeopardize your liberty by descending to robbery five dollars wont do old man hand over your wallet with all there is in it and dry up that sundayschool talk what shall i do walter asked the poor professor i am afraid you will have to let him have it professor thats where your head is level boy said the highwayman approvingly just fling over your wallet and be quick about it tell him to ride up and get it said walter in an undertone though the professor did not understand walters object in suggesting this he was in a mood to be guided by any one and repeated walters words anything to oblige said the stranger dont give it to him till i say the word whispered walter the highwayman lowering his revolver rode up alongside of the wagon and held out his hand for the wallet walter had conceived a bold scheme for disarming him and rendering him harmless give the wallet to me professor he said his employer meekly obeyed then walter rising dropped the wallet on the floor of the wagon and reaching over suddenly grasped the revolver from the unsuspecting robber and before he recovered from his amazement brought down the whip with terrible force on the flanks of his horse the startled animal gave a spring that nearly unseated his rider and dashed madly down the road the robber was furious as soon as he could he regained control of his steed and galloped back give me that revolver he shouted in a rage walter held the weapon in his hand and steadily pointed it at its late owner ill give you the contents if you dont ride off confound you you young rascal if you dont give me back my weapon ill kill you it was an empty threat as walter well knew do you hear me he said quietly the robber scanned him curiously he had thought him a mere boy without spirit or courage now he was compelled to revise his opinion of him threats would not answer he must have recourse to strategy youre smart youngster ill give you credit for that he said in a milder tone youve got the best of me i admit yes answered walter i have the advantage of you i meant to take your money but i wont do it now thank you said walter with an ironical smile just give me back that weapon of mine and ill ride off and let you alone i dont think it would be wise the highwayman frowned dont be a fool youngster he said do you doubt my word i dont know you well enough to decide whether you are to be trusted but i guess ill keep the revolver then you will have robbed me walter said the professor nervously perhaps you had better give him back his weapon he has promised not to molest us further thats where you talk sense old man said the robber approvingly youre a gentleman you are you hear walter yes youngster you hear give me back my weapon and well part friends and i trust my friend you will see the error of your ways and adopt some honest business i will old man believe me said the robber in a melodramatic tone i was not always thus you will have my best wishes for your prosperity and if you are in need i will give you five dollars no i will not take advantage of your liberal offer only give me the revolver and i will ride away come walter give the man his revolver professor said walter quietly you must excuse me i cant comply with your request this man is humbugging you if i give him back the revolver you will have to give him your wallet too didnt i promise to ride away demanded the outlaw angrily yes but i have no confidence in your promise now go at once or i fire walter pointed the revolver full at the robbers head he met the unflinching gaze of walters resolute eyes and saw that our hero was in earnest do you mean to keep my property he demanded hoarsely no come round to the hotel in fremont tomorrow morning and you shall have your weapon with an execration the outlaw turned his horse and dashed off at full speed there he is gone said walter sinking back in his seat with an air of relief his nerves had been at high tension though he was outwardly calm for he knew that he had to deal with a desperate man and feared a sudden attack which might have resulted disastrously for him i dont know whether you have done right walter said the professor in a tone of mild deprecation surely professor you would not have had me give back the revolver he promised to ride off and leave us to ourselves what is the word of such a man worth he would have ridden off but he would have carried with him your wallet and mine was there much money in yours two hundred and fifty dollars thats too much to lose take my advice professor and put the greater part of the money in one of your pockets that is what i have done for i suspected that this gentleman would lie in wait for us what put it into your head to seize the pistol walter if your attempt had miscarried he might have shot you i dont propose to give up my money without a struggle when the time came to act i moved suddenly upon the enemy i did not propose to fail you were very quick you were like a flash of lightning i meant to be said walter smiling i havent attended a gymnasium for nothing do you think he will attack us again asked the professor timidly no he has no revolver and i have besides i dont mean to be taken at a disadvantage if yon will drive i will hold the revolver ready for instant use there was no further interruption during their ride and about ten oclock they drew up in front of the hotel in fremont rooms were secured and both walter and the professor retired to rest about seven oclock the next morning there was a knock at walters door he opened it half dressed and found a boy of sixteen with a note in his hand a gentleman gave me this for you he said walter opened the note and read these lines which had been hastily scribbled give the bearer my revolver i have a long journey before me and shall need it you know who where is the gentleman who gave you the note asked walter down the road a piece he asked me to be quick tell him said walter putting the note in his vest pocket that he will have to come here himself he finished his toilet and went down to breakfast but the robber did not put in an appearance he probably thought that walter was laying a trap for him chapter xxiv an attempt to recover the revolver as walter had been brought up with a strict sense of honesty he was somewhat in doubt whether he ought to keep the revolver which was a handsome one silvermounted he decided however that it would be quixotic to disarm himself and put the outlaw in a position to renew his attack as he undoubtedly would if only because he would wish to get even with the boy who had humiliated him walter had to be sure promised to give it up if the owner called for it but he meant at the same time to secure his arrest he did not mention to the professor that he had received a letter from the owner of the weapon as his employer would have insisted upon his giving it up professor robinson was a timid man and though he was of stout build and possessed a fair measure of strength he had not as much spirit as some boys of ten what are you going to do with the revolver walter he asked uneasily as they set out on their way from fremont to stilwell i am going to carry it with me professor then you had better withdraw the charges why should i the weapon might go off i mean that it shall if the owner makes another attack upon us you dont think he will asked the professor nervously i think it very probable i wish we had never met him said the unhappy professor so do i but as we have we must make the best of it if you had only given him back the revolver we should have had no more trouble pardon me professor i think we should have had a great deal of trouble once give the fellow his old advantage over us and he would use it i never had such an experience before complained the professor looking at walter reproachfully as if he thought that somehow it was the fault of his young assistant walter smiled do you know professor he said your remark reminds me of a statement in an irish paper to this effect several persons have died during the last year who never died before i dont see the point said the professor peevishly they were about halfway to the next town when walter heard the sound of a galloping horse behind him looking out of the side of the wagon he saw the now familiar figure of the outlaw as he rode up alongside he looked critically at walter and saw that the coveted revolver was in our heros hand ready for action why didnt you give the revolver to my messenger this morning boy he demanded with a frown i didnt think it would be safe walter answered significantly didnt you know it was my property i wasnt sure of it what do you mean by that i didnt know whether you had paid for it you are impudent professor robinson will you make the boy give me back my revolver i have told him to answered the professor in an apologetic tone but he wont obey me then why dont you discharge him i wouldnt keep a boy in my employ who disobeyed me i am well satisfied with him except on this point i am ready to leave you professor if you say the word said walter and he made a motion as if to jump out of the wagon no no exclaimed the professor in alarm i dont want you to leave me then i wont i think it might be bad for you if i did said walter with a significant look at the horseman well boy said the outlaw harshly i cant waste my time here you sent me a message to come for my revolver myself if i wanted it yes well here i am now give me the weapon i think i shall have to decline are you going back on your word demanded the outlaw not exactly then what do you propose to do keep along with us till we reach stilwell then we will go before a magistrate you will make your demand for the weapon and in his presence i will surrender it do you take me for a fool thundered the robber no and i want you to understand that i am not a fool either you are acting like a fool and a knave i should certainly be acting like a fool if i gave up the revolver and had it immediately pointed at me or my companion with a demand for our money but i gave you my word of course you did but i put no confidence in your word while this conversation was going on the poor professor looked on and listened with an expression of helplessness on his broad face he was essentially a man of peace and was by no means fitted to deal with a highwayman look here said the outlaw after a pause and in a milder tone i have a special attachment for that weapon or i would drop the whole matter and buy another one but this was given me by an old pal now dead and i set great store by it professor although the revolver is mine by rights i will waive all that and offer you twentyfive dollars for it that will pay you for all the trouble i have put you to professor robinson though not a mean man was fond of money and this offer tempted him it would be getting twentyfive dollars for nothing and that was a piece of good luck not likely to present itself every day i accept your offer he said gladly but i dont put in walter calmly allow me to say that the professor has no claim to the weapon i took it with my own hand and it has never been in his possession all right then ill give you twentyfive dollars for it i decline your offer id like to wring your neck you young thief i have no doubt you would once more and for the last time will you give me back that revolver i have told you when and on what conditions i would surrender it when at stilwell in the presence of a magistrate you are very crafty you want me to be arrested for attempted robbery yes that is my wish ive a great mind to snatch the revolver from you come on then said walter holding it firmly pointing at the outlaw youve got the drop on me youngster but mark my word ill have that weapon yet and ill punish you for giving me all this trouble have you anything more to say no then suppose you ride on we have been delayed long enough the robber did go but aimed a volley of imprecations at walter of which the latter took no notice in the early evening they arrived at stilwell and secured rooms at the hotel among the guests was a cattleman from dakota who had been to chicago with a herd of cattle and was now on his way back he was loud in his complaints of a highwayman whom he had met two days previous who had relieved him of a wallet containing five hundred dollars wont you describe him asked walter struck by a sudden suspicion the cattle dealer did so his description tallied with the personal appearance of walters enemy was he on foot asked walter no he was on a black horse walter nodded i know him he said has he robbed you no i have robbed him what do you mean inquired the cattle dealer in wonder do you recognize this and walter exhibited the revolver yes it looks like the revolver he pointed at me probably it is but how do you happen to have it i took it from him you a mere boy exclaimed the cattle dealer incredulously yes i will tell you about it and walter gave an account of the circumstances under which the revolver had come into his possession it is a handsome weapon said the cattle dealer taking it into his hands and examining it it must be worth a hundred dollars i think i shall keep it for my own use said walter quietly ill give you seventyfive dollars for it i would rather not part with it indeed i should not feel justified in selling it considering the way it came into my hands well boy youre a smart one but i surmise you havent seen the last of the owner the speaker was right chapter xxv dick ranneys scheme dick ranney for the first time we give the name of the highwayman had no intention of going away without his revolver it had been his constant companion for years and had served him well during his connection with the famous band of jesse james now his leader dead he was preying upon the community on his own account so daring and so full of resources was he that he had never been arrested but once and then managed to escape from the cabin in which he was temporarily confined the weapon he was so anxious to recover had been given him by his old commander and for this reason and also because the revolver was a very handsome and valuable one he was willing to expose himself to the risk of capture in order to recover it the opposition he met with from a beardless boy as he styled walter irritated and surprised him he was fifty pounds heavier than walter and he had expected that a mere boy would give in almost immediately but he saw that he had misjudged the lad he was little more than a boy in years and appearance but he evidently had a mans courage and spirit ranney would have secured another revolver if he had not felt so certain of recovering his own after his last failure he began to consider what course to adopt it was easy to find out the professors route he knew that he was to stay a night at stilwell and to stilwell he went he did not venture into the village until nightfall and then for reasons easy to divine he abstained from visiting the hotel looking about for a confederate his attention was drawn to a boy of sixteen who was sawing wood in front of a humble cottage half a mile from the village i see you know how to work said dick ranney affably as he leaned carelessly against the fence i know how but i dont like it answered the boy pausing in his task i dont blame you i dont like that kind of work myself i guess you dont have to do it now answered the boy glancing at the neat and expensive attire of his new acquaintance well no i can do better are you in business yes answered ranney vaguely i am traveling for a house in new york i should like that give me your name i may be able to give you a place some day my name is oren trott dick ranney took out a notebook and put the name down greatly to the boys satisfaction by the way went on ranney do you want to earn half a dollar yes answered oren with alacrity perhaps i can put you in the way of doing so do you know the hotel people yes sir i worked there for a short time all the better then you know about the house the location of rooms etc yes sir there are two parties staying there in whom i am interested one is professor robinson yes i know the man that sells bottles of balm the same i saw him come into town with his wagon well i want to find what room he will occupy tonight the fact is he continued as he noted orens look of surprise the man owes me quite a sum of money and is trying to evade payment he doesnt look like that kind of man said oren thoughtfully my boy you are young and are hardly qualified to judge of a man by his appearance the man looks honest i admit but hes slippery and by the way did you notice a young fellow in the wagon with him yes sir he isnt much larger than i am exactly so well i want to find out what room he occupies also yes sir answered oren looking a little surprised you see explained dick ranney i want to make the professor a call and i can perhaps tell from the outside whether he is in or not he will avoid meeting me if he can now do you think you can find out for me what i require yes sir then go at once shall i find you here when i get back asked oren cautiously yes i wouldnt like to take all that trouble for nothing you wont here is a quarter in advance and i will give you the fifty cents besides if you find out what i wish good for you youre a gentleman said oren with an expression of satisfaction on his honest country face two hours later walter and the cattle dealer returned from a walk they had taken together walter found his new acquaintance though not an educated man an agreeable companion and by no means deficient in shrewdness though he had allowed himself to be robbed by dick ranney they went up to the desk for their keys will you two gentlemen do me a favor asked the clerk what is it asked the cattle dealer a gentleman and lady have just arrived and want to stay here tonight but the number of our rooms is limited and we are full now if you sir will go into mr sherwoods room there are two beds there we shall be able to give the party yours i have no objection if he hasnt said the cattle dealer i have none whatever said walter cheerfully then we can fix it i am sure i am very much obliged to you both by the way mr sherwood there was a boy here a little while since who was anxious to find out what room you occupied also what room was professor robinsons a boy repeated walter puzzled yes a village boy oren trott i dont know any such boy he is a good industrious lad that may all be but what does he want to know about my room for thats the question i put to him i found him very closemouthed at first but finally he admitted that he was employed by some man a stranger in the village to find out walter and the cattle dealer exchanged glances the same thought had come to each did he describe the man no it seems he did not take much notice of him was that all the boy wanted to know yes he didnt say what the mans object was in seeking this information no probably he didnt know walter and his new friend whom we will call manning went upstairs what does it all mean mr manning asked walter it probably means that our old friend proposes to make a call upon you during the night do you really think so asked walter naturally startled at the suggestion yes you still have his revolver you know i think he will find me ready for him said walter resolutely he will find us ready you mean corrected manning you know i am going to be your roommate i am glad of that under the circumstances so am i i should like to recover the money the fellow robbed me of i should like to know his name i can tell you that i was examining the revolver this afternoon when i saw a name engraved upon it in very small letters what name r ranney then said manning in excitement he is the famous dick ranney formerly with jesse james i never heard of him he is well known in this western country why there is a reward of a thousand dollars offered for his apprehension i should like to earn that money said walter you shall and this very night if i can bring it about half of the reward should be yours i am rich enough without it as to the money the fellow robbed me of i shall try to recover that though the loss wont in the least embarrass me how do you think ranney will try to get into the room through the window the casements are loose and nothing could be easier walter went to the window and found that there was no way of fastening it i think we could fasten it with a knife i dont want it fastened said manning why not i want mr ranney to get into the room once in we must secure him if we are smart our enterprising visitor will find himself in a trap chapter xxvi the events of a night in the country it may safely be assumed that by twelve oclock at night every sound and healthy person will be asleep dick ranney gave an extra margin of half an hour and thirty minutes after midnight made his appearance in the hotel yard thanks to the information given by his young messenger oren trott who of course did not know that in this way he was assisting a dishonest scheme he was able to fix at once upon the windows of the rooms occupied by walter and the professor he decided to enter walters chamber first partly because he wanted his revolver which would be of service to him in case he were attacked then again he wanted the satisfaction of triumphing over the boy who had had the audacity to defy him a fullgrown man and one whose name had carried terror to many a traveler there was a long ladder leaning against the stable dick ranney could not call this providential without insinuating that providence was fighting on the side of the transgressor but he called it appropriately a stroke of luck as indeed it seemed at the time he secured the ladder and put it up against the window of walters room the window as he could see was partly open it being a summer night dick ranney observed this with a grim smile of satisfaction hes making things easy for me he said to himself as softly and cautiously as a cat he ascended the ladder but not softly enough to escape the vigilant ear of manning who was expecting him manning at the sound stepped from the bed he had thrown himself on the outside without undressing and stepped into a closet as he did not wish ranney to learn that there were two persons in the chamber walter was awake but he lay in bed motionless and with his eyes closed the revolver was in mannings hands but he had placed his clothing temptingly over a chair between the bed and the window but in such a position that his companion on coming out of the closet would be between the window and the burglar dick ranney stood on the ladder and looked in what he saw reassured him walter was in bed and seemed to be fast asleep the coast is clear he murmured softly now where is the revolver he could not see it but this did not trouble him probably the boy had it under his pillow and in that case he could obtain it without trouble meanwhile it would be well to secure the boys pocketbook though he underrated walters wealth he thought he might have twenty dollars and this would be worth taking he lifted the window softly and entered the room in order to deaden the sound of his steps he had taken off his shoes and placed them on the ground beside the foot of the ladder having entered the room he strode softly to the chair over which walter had thrown his clothes and began to feel in the pockets of his pantaloons there was a purse in one of the pockets which contained a few small silver coins but it is needless to say that walter had disposed of his stock of bank bills elsewhere he felt that prevention of robbery was better than the recovery of the goods stolen meanwhile manning whose hearing was keen was made aware through it that the burglar had entered the room he opened the door of the closet and walking into the center of the apartment placed himself revolver in hand in front of the window though his motions were gentle the outlaws ears were quick he turned swiftly and with a look of dismay realized that he had walked into a trap he had not felt afraid to encounter a boy of eighteen but here was a resolute man who had the advantage of being armed and well armed dick ranney surveyed him for a minute in silence but was very busily thinking what were his chances of escape well said manning we meet again again repeated ranney in a questioning tone yes when we last met you had the drop on me and relieved me of my wallet tonight i have the drop on you dick ranney paused for reflection thats so he said do you want your wallet back yes then well make a bargain give me that revolver promise not to raise the house and i will give you back your wallet with all the money inside yes i dont think i will said manning after a pause dont be a fool come be quick or the boy will wake up he is awake already said walter raising his head from the pillow were you awake when i entered the room asked dick ranney quickly yes fooled again exclaimed ranney bitterly boy i believe you are my evil genius till i met you i thought myself a match for any one you were more than a match for me said manning but he wins best who wins last well what do you mean to do asked ranney doggedly to capture you dick ranney and hand you over to the law which you have so persistently violated that you will never do said ranney and he dashed toward the window thrusting manning to one side but what he saw increased his dismay the ladder had been removed and if he would leave the room he must leap to the ground a distance of over twenty feet confusion he exclaimed the ladder is gone yes i directed the stableboy to keep awake and remove it explained manning i may be taken but i will be revenged first shouted dick ranney and he flung himself on manning who unprepared for the sudden attack sank to the floor with ranney on top but the outlaws triumph was shortlived walter sprang to mannings rescue seized the revolver and aiming it at the burglar cried quickly get up or ill fire dick ranney rose sullenly he paid walter the compliment of believing he meant what he said its your turn boy he muttered stay where you are ordered walter and he walked slowly backward still covering the robber with the revolver till he reached the door opening into the entry dick ranney watched him closely and did not offer any opposition for it occurred to him that the opening of the door would afford him a better chance for flight no sooner therefore was the door open than he prepared to avail himself of the opportunity running the risk of a bullet wound when his plans were frustrated by the entrance of two village constables strong sturdy men dick ranney do you surrender asked walter in a clear resolute tone ranney looked slowly from one to the other and calculated the chances the ladder was gone and he found himself facing four foes three of them strong men some of them armed its all up with me he said quietly i surrender you do wisely remarked manning now will you restore my wallet the outlaw took it out of his pocket and handed it over there it is he said i suppose you wont me to pay interest for the use of the money the two constables advanced and one of them took out a pair of handcuffs hold out your hands he said the burglar did so he saw that opposition would not benefit him and he yielded to the inevitable with a good grace it seems i walked into a trap he said if you dont mind telling me were you expecting me yes answered walter did the boy betray me he asked quickly no the boy suspected nothing wrong but his questions excited suspicion dick ranney said the outlaw apostrophizing himself youre a fool i should like to kick you i think you were imprudent mr ranney said manning it was this revolver that undid me said ranney i wanted to recover it for it was given me by my old captain it was never out of my possession till that boy snatched it from me i suppose it was to be and he sighed comforted perhaps by the thought that it would have been useless to struggle against fate chapter xxvii walter becomes a capitalist professor robinson slumbered on blissfully unconscious of the events that had made the night an exciting one when he came downstairs early in the morning he strayed accidentally into the room where dick ranney was confined under guard being shortsighted he did not see the captive until ranney hailed him good morning professor the professor skipped nimbly back and gazed at the prisoner in alarm you here he exclaimed yes answered dick grimly but how did it happen i came to the hotel a little after midnight to make you a call but went first to the room of your assistant what after midnight yes it is hardly necessary to explain what happened here i am ah my friend said the professor this may be fortunate for you if it leads you to consider and reflect upon the errors of your life oh stow that exclaimed ranney in disgust im not that kind of a man i follow my own course and take the consequences the professor shook his head sadly and went out later when he heard what had happened he said to walter if that man had come into my room at midnight i should have died of fright there was no occasion to be alarmed returned walter we were prepared for him i i am afraid i was never cut out for a hero said the professor my nervous system is easily upset the plain truth was that professor robinson was a born coward though he was stronger and more muscular probably than grant sherman or sheridan but it is not brawn and muscle that make a hero but the spirit that animates the man and of this spirit the professor had very little yet in after years when he had retired from business and was at leisure to live over again his past life he used to tell with thrilling effect how he and walter had trapped and captured the daring outlaw dick ranney and received admiring compliments upon his courage and prowess which he complacently accepted though he knew how little he deserved them it so chanced that stilwell was the county seat and court was in session at that time and nearly ready to wind up its business it was owing to this circumstance that the trial of dick ranney was held at once by request walter and the professor remained to bear testimony against the prisoner and manning also strengthened the case against him within less than a week the trial was concluded a verdict of guilty was brought in and the prisoner sentenced to a ten years term of imprisonment dick ranney heard the sentence with philosophical calmness my good friend said the professor i trust that in your long years of confinement you will reflect upon dont worry about that interrupted dick i shant be in prison three months but i thought bolts and bars can be broken professor when i do get out i will inquire what part of the country you are in and will make you a visit this promise so far from cheering professor robinson seemed to disconcert him extremely and he shortened his talk with his road acquaintance after the trial was over walter was waited upon by an official who tendered him the reward of one thousand dollars offered for the capture of dick ranney mr manning has waived his claim in your favor explained the official and therefore there is no question that to you belongs the reward there are two others whose services deserve recognition said walter the two constables who made the arrest there is no additional sum at our command explained the official none is needed returned walter i shall pay each a hundred dollars out of the reward which has been awarded to me it is needless to say that the two constables both of whom were poor men with large families were very grateful for this substantial recognition of their services chapter xxviii walter goes out of business by the time walter received his prize of eight hundred dollars he had saved enough out of his wages to make nearly a thousand he reflected with pride that this money had not been left him but was the fruit of his own exertions he resolved to say nothing in his letters home of his good fortune but wait till he returned when he would have the pleasure of taking his guardian by surprise a day later he received a letter from doctor mack which had been forwarded from one place to another and was now nearly three weeks old it ran thus dear walter you give but scanty intelligence of your progress and success or want of it i respect you for your determination to support yourself but i dont want you to carry your independence too far as you have never fitted yourself for any kind of business i presume your earnings are small i should not be surprised to hear that you are straitened for money if you are dont let your pride prevent your informing me i can easily send you fifty dollars for your property was not all lost and it is not fitting that you should deprive yourself of the comforts of life when there is no occasion for it nancy often speaks of you and indeed i may say that we both miss you very much and wish the year were up so that you might return to us i have hopes of righting your property so that you may go back to euclid college at the beginning of the fall session i am glad to learn by your last letter that your health is excellent once more dont hesitate to write to me for money if you need a remittance your affectionate guardian ezekiel mack walter smiled as he finished reading the letter i wonder what my good guardian would say he soliloquized if he knew that i had nearly a thousand dollars saved up he would open his eyes i fancy he sat down at once and made a reply in the course of which he said dont trouble yourself to send me money i can get along with the wages i receive when i left home i made up my mind not to call upon you for help and i am glad to say there is no occasion to do so as yet i think my years absence from college will do me good i am ashamed when i consider how poorly i appreciated the advantages of study and how foolishly i spent my time and money if i ever go back to college i shall turn over a new leaf i have seen something of the world and gained some experience of life and feel about half a dozen years older than when i left college when doctor mack a week later read these lines he smiled contentedly my experiment is working well he said it is making a man of walter he has been a drone hitherto now he has become a worker and though i may not like him better for he was always near to my heart i respect him more a week later walter on returning from a walk found a middleaged stranger in conversation with professor robinson the professor seemed a little embarrassed when walter entered i have some news for you walter he said i am afraid it will not be welcome to you please let me hear it professor said walter this gentleman is nahum snodgrass of chicago who has been for some years a traveler for a large wholesaledrughouse i am glad to meet you mr snodgrass said walter politely snodgrass who was a thin drylooking man nodded briefly i have just sold out my business to him went on professor robinson and henceforth shall aim to live more easily and enjoy the presence of my family i congratulate you professor said walter i think you deserve a life of leisure mr snodgrass is willing to take you into his employ but he does not think he can afford to pay you as much as i did no said snodgrass clearing his throat i find that professor robinson has been foolishly liberal the ten per cent commission which he has paid you is simply stu pendous walter smiled i have not been in the habit of taking that view of it he said perhaps not but i do said snodgrass firmly you are a very young man and ought not to expect much pay i will give you two dollars a week and pay your traveling expenses i beg to decline your offer mr snodgrass said walter politely i have thought of changing my business before but was unwilling to leave the professor as we are strangers i need have no further hesitation young man said snodgrass i think you are making a mistake it will not be so easy getting another place as you suppose perhaps not but i can afford to live a few weeks without work your savings will soon go snodgrass knew nothing of walters prize money and then what will you do trust to luck answered walter lightly nahum snodgrass shook his head gloomily he thought walter a very foolish young man had walter lost his position two months earlier it would have been a serious matter to him but now with a capital of nearly a thousand dollars he could afford to be independent as he expressed it he could afford to be idle for a few weeks still he didnt wish to remain unemployed for a long time he felt happier when at work but wished to secure some employment that would be congenial mr snodgrass said the professor i think you are making a mistake in not employing walter sherwood nahum snodgrass shrugged his shoulders i dont mean to pay away all my profits to an assistant he said but you cant get along alone very well i will try unless i can find some one that will take what i am willing to pay he finally succeeded in doing this a young man of eighteen employed in a drugstore in town who was on the point of being discharged agreed to take the position and stepped into walters place to anticipate a little he disappeared two weeks later carrying with him fifty dollars belonging to his employer walter stayed two days longer at the hotel and then sending his valise ahead to burnton twenty miles farther on started to walk the distance he was in a mountainous country and the scenery was wild and attractive so that he felt that this arrangement would prove agreeable to him he provided himself with a stout staff and started at good speed he had accomplished about eight miles when he was overtaken by a shabbily dressed traveler riding on the back of a fine horse the horseman slackened his pace when he reached walter good morning stranger he said good morning responded walter turning his head i am glad to have company its a lonesome stretch of road here yes answered walter carelessly but there isnt any danger is there well there might be a friend of mine was stabbed and robbed here three months since indeed yes and though i havent much money with me i shouldnt like to be robbed of what i have it would be inconvenient do you carry much money with you asked the other in a careless tone walter was not disposed to take a stranger into his confidence not much he responded you are prudent are you armed walter drew out dick ranneys revolver which he still carried the stranger eyed him respectfully thats a mighty handsome weapon he said just let me look at it walter began to think he had fallen in with a highwayman again chapter xxix walter buys a horse you can look at the pistol as i hold it said walter in response to the request recorded at the close of the preceding chapter i say remarked the stranger suddenly dont you want to buy a horse how much do you ask for the horse he inquired i want to get her off my hands give me fifty dollars and shes yours walter had a pad in his satchel and a fountain pen in his pocket he hastily wrote out the following form in consideration of fifty dollars by me received i give and transfer to walter sherwood my roan horse here followed a brief description of the animal now put your name there and i will hand you the money said walter thank you stranger youve got a good bargain i agree to that said walter i suppose the horse is sound he said inquiringly sound as a die dont you take no trouble about that it goes to my heart to give her up goodby old gal walter touched the horse lightly with his whip and she bounded forward after a few miles he reached a town of good size riding along the main street his attention was drawn to a printed notice in front of a store it read thus horse stolen stolen from the subscriber on the evening of the twentyfifth a roan mare eight years old and sixteen hands high with a white mark between the eyes answers to the name of bess whoever will return her to the subscriber or give information that will lead to her recovery will receive a suitable reward colonel richard owen shelby a terrible suspicion entered walters mind he recognized the white mark then he called bess the mare half turned her head and whinnied chapter xxx walter finds himself in a tight place walter had hardly time to consider what to do in the light of the discovery he had made before the matter was taken out of his hands young feller youd better get off that hoss fell on his ears in a rough voice he turned and saw two stalwart men eyeing him suspiciously gentlemen said walter earnestly till i read this notice i had no idea that the horse was stolen thats neither here nor there youd better get off the hoss walter felt that this was a command and obeyed at once very well gentlemen he said i will leave the horse in your hands and depend upon you to return it to the owner as walter spoke he turned to walk off but the man who had first accosted him got in his way i dont want to have any trouble with you sir please get out of my way and let me go not by a long shot what do you propose to do with me take you to the lockup walter was now really alarmed youll have to go with us young feller said crane and leave the hoss asked penton wed ought to take charge of it and get the reward thats so penton you go and get a constable well stand by the hoss penton hurried off and returned shortly with a constable in uniform whats up he asked this young fellers rid into town with colonel richard owens hoss but id ought to secure the hoss said the constable who felt that perhaps he might be entitled to the reward offered look here cyrus stokes you secure the thief thats your lookout gentlemen said walter i object to being called a thief i have already told you i did not steal the horse the constable seized walter by the arm and walked off with him to add to his mortification people whom they met on the street looked at him curiously chapter xxxi in the lockup the lockup was a basement room under the enginehouse there were four cells about four by eight and into one of these walter was put the cell opposite was occupied by a drunken tramp who looked up stupidly as walter entered and hiccoughed glad to see you sonny and i must stay in here overnight with that man hossstealers mustnt be particular said the constable can you tell me where colonel owen lives the man that owns the horse you ought to know that is there any lawyer in this village yes theres two an old man and a young one i should like to see one of them can you ask one of them to come here its a leetle out of my way suggested constable stokes the constable pocketed with alacrity the halfdollar our hero tendered him and said briskly ill send him right off i shay interjected the tramp send me a lawyer too the same man will do for you replied the constable a lawyer wont do you no good though were victims of tyrannical pression said the tramp gloomily what are you in for young feller im charged with stealing a horse smart boy said the tramp admiringly i didnt think you was up to hossstealin i am not the charge is false thats right stick to it deny everything thats what i do half an hour later the outer door was opened and the constable reappeared followed by a young man of about thirty this is mr barry the lawyer he said mr barry here is the key you can keep it and let yourself out if you will be responsible for the safe custody of the prisoner yes mr stokes i will give you my word that he shall not escape which is my client you dont look like a criminal certainly said the lawyer with a rapid survey of his new client i hope not but one cant go by appearances wholly as your lawyer for i will undertake your case i must ask you to trust me entirely and give me your full confidence first let me ask your name walter sherwood it will now be necessary for you to tell me frankly whether you stole the horse or not of course i did not answered walter indignantly you must excuse my asking the question i did not believe you guilty but it was necessary for me to know positively from your own lips you must not be sensitive i have no right to be but i find myself in a very trying position of course but i will try to get you out of it now will you tell me in detail how the horse came into your possession walter told the story and the lawyer listened attentively have you any proof of what you assert he asked when walter finished there was no one present i suppose not did no papers pass between you and this man oh yes answered walter quickly and he drew out the receipt which he had drawn up and got hank wilson to sign come this is very important said mr barry cheerfully it is a very valuable confirmation of your story will you trust me with it certainly sir is there any suggestion you have to offer mr sherwood sometimes i find that my clients give me valuable assistance that way i wish you would telegraph to colonel owen to come here probably he has been sent for but if not i will request him to come do you know the colonel no sir i never heard his name till i read the advertisement do you know anything of him mr barry he is the owner of a large estate in shelby and is a thorough gentleman of the old school all the better i would rather deal with such a man besides by describing the man of whom i bought the horse i may put him in the way of capturing the real thief well thought of may i ask mr sherwood if you are from this part of the country no i am a native of new york state a year ago i was a member of the sophomore class of euclid college that is strange ejaculated barry what is strange colonel owen the owner of the horse is an old graduate of the same institution is it possible exclaimed walter in genuine amazement it is quite true i am glad to have made the discovery it will prepossess him in your favor and this i need hardly say will be a great point gained well i believe i have obtained all the data i require and i will now go home and think over your case i wish i could take you with me i wish you could i hate to be left in such a place cheer up mr sherwood it wont be for long i predict you may rest assured of my best efforts in your behalf i will at once telegraph for colonel owen the evening glided wearily away walter threw himself on his pallet and was nearly asleep when a confused noise was heard outside and heavy blows were rained upon the outer door what does it mean asked walter bewildered he listened intently and there came to his ears a shout which made him turn pale with terror chapter xxxii an awful moment bring out the hoss thief lynch him lynch him whats up asked the tramp drowsily opening his eyes bring out the hoss thief cried a dozen rough voices as the battering at the door was repeated they want you young feller he continued as he caught the meaning of the cry what shall we do asked walter helplessly they dont want me returned the tramp complacently its you they want you will stand by me implored walter eager for any help wont do no good theres a crowd of them youre in a bad box young feller have you got a pistol no then it flashed upon walter that he still had the revolver which belonged to dick ranney i will sell my life dearly thought walter they shant kill me without some resistance open the door or itll be wuss for ye cried a rough voice the door was strong but it did not long withstand the fierce attacks made upon it walter by the light that came in through a crevice saw it sway and gradually yield to the impetuous attacks of the mob heres the hoss thief exclaimed the leader throwing the light into the cell occupied by the inebriate the tramp was alarmed and completely sobered by the terrible suggestion i aint the man he said its that young feller yonder the man with the lantern turned in the direction of the other cell hes only a kid he said doubtfully all the same hes the hoss thief said the tramp earnestly is he telling the truth asked the leader turning to the men who were just behind him he looks most like the hoss thief said dan muggins the others a milkandwater chap just out of boardinschool youre right smash in the cage chapter xxxiii walter saves anothers life meanwhile the feelings of walter were hard to describe he saw that perhaps his only chance of life lay in remaining quiet and letting the mistake remain uncorrected on the other hand the poor wretch was as much entitled to life as he hes the hoss thief shrieked the tramp ask him if he isnt the leader who had him by the collar paused and the words of the captive seemed to make some impression on him we dont want to make no mistake he said mebbe we might ask him you hear what this man says yes answered walter in husky accents is it true are you the hoss thief no and the poor tramp would have been dragged away but walter his face pale but resolute held up his hand to secure attention listen he said i am not a horse thief but i was put here charged with stealing the horse of colonel owen just as i said gentlemen chimed in the inebriate then weve got the wrong one said the leader here you can go we must have you went on the leader approaching walters cell what do you want to do with me asked walter with sinking heart string you up thats the way we serve hoss thieves gentlemen said walter you are making a terrible mistake didnt you say just now you was the thief no i said i was put in here charged with horsestealing an assault was made on the door of his cell and within three minutes walter was dragged out he began to speak but was roughly ordered to shut up the line of march was resumed and a quarter of a mile distant they passed through a gate and began the ascent of a hill at the summit of which was a grove of tall trees walter shuddered and his heart sank within him for he understood only too well what fate was in store for him chapter xxxiv a terrible ordeal at the summit of the hill walters captors came to a halt young man said the leader sternly your hours are numbered have you anything to say i have a good deal to say answered walter finding his voice and speaking indignantly even if i were guilty which i am not you have no right to condemn me to death untried one of the masked men who had hitherto stood in the background came forward and in clear ringing accents spoke the lad says right he has not been proved guilty and i for one believe him innocent i thank god said walter that there is one among you whose heart is not wholly hardened i stand here a boy barely eighteen years old is there no one among you who has a son of my age the boy is right said another in a deep voice men we are acting like cowards and brutes so say i a third man broke in and he ranged himself beside the other two this is all folly exclaimed the leader angrily you men are milksops and chickenhearted walters face flamed will you allow this he exclaimed as the leader seized him by the collar and drew him to a tree i wont said the first man to pronounce in his favor seth pendleton let go your hold look out cried pendleton fiercely or you may swing too you hear what he says said walters friend why are you so hard on the boy why am i so hard on horse thieves ill tell you ten years ago i had a horse that was as dear to me as a brother one morning i found the stable door open and the horse gone i followed him but i never recovered him who stole him a man named dick ranney who has since become a noted highwayman this was astonishing news to walter do you know where dick ranney is now he asked i heard that he had been captured i am the one who captured him and for this i received a reward of a thousand dollars answered walter chapter xxxv the empty jail walter drew from his pocket a folded paper read that he said mr walter sherwood i have pleasure in sending you the reward for the capture of the noted criminal dick ranney miles gray sheriff shall i tell you the story asked walter yes yes exclaimed more than one walter gave an account of the affair in a clear distinct manner now gentlemen said walter as he concluded do you believe that i would stoop to steal a horse there were shouts of no no and walter might have gone scot free had he chosen but he did not choose no gentlemen he said take me back to the lockup the door is broken that will make no difference with me i prefer to stand trial and let my innocence be proved hes a brave lad said more than one i wish my john would turn out like him added one of walters original supporters you shall go with me and have the best bed in the house he continued walter accepted this proposal with thanks of all that had passed during the night constable stokes was blissfully unconscious at an early hour he bent his steps toward the jail when he saw the door broken he was astounded he felt it necessary to report what had happened to some magistrate he had walked but a few steps when he met mr barry walters lawyer and how is my young client this morning stokes inquired the lawyer pleasantly blessed if i know hes bolted that is amazing let me see how it was done the door was broken from the outside he said after a pause was it of course it was then you dont think the men could have done it chapter xxxvi colonel richard owen at this moment a boy of fifteen made his way from the street to the rear entrance it was arthur waters the son of a jeweler perhaps i can tell you something about it he said last night i heard a noise in the street and getting up i went to the window i saw a lot of men filing through the street all wearing masks they must have been in search of the prisoners to lynch them said the lawyer turning pale and you think they broke open the doors mr barry yes and what would they do with the prisoners hang them i fear without judge or jury i dont mind the man sir but i hope the boy escaped thank you constable i am alive and well as you see both the lawyer and the constable looked up and there to their great relief stood walter where did you come from asked the lawyer quickly walter told his story adding constable stokes i give myself into your hands perhaps as i am his counsel said the lawyer i had better take him with me yes that will be the best way said the constable walter was ushered into the office of the lawyer at this moment the office door opened and an old gentleman entered the lawyer rose from his seat with alacrity colonel owen he exclaimed i am glad to see you yes sir i received your telegram and came by the first morning train so the man who stole my horse has been caught the man who is charged with the theft has been caught said mr barry mr barry you have not introduced me to this young gentleman continued colonel owen eyeing walter with favor i didnt know that you would care for an introduction said the lawyer demurely why not asked the old gentleman opening his eyes in surprise because he is the horse thief chapter xxxvii walter is vindicated bless my soul ejaculated the colonel surely you are joking no i assure you i am not then how does it happen that mr sherwood is sitting here in your office instead of being in the lockup yes i was taken to the lockup colonel owen said walter but about midnight a lynching party broke it open and took me out but i made an appeal to my captors and was able to prove to them i received a reward not long since for the capture of the famous outlaw dick ranney colonel owen sank into a chair i never heard the like he was heard to say do you mind telling me young man why you were arrested or why you fell under suspicion i was arrested while on the horses back ha but how did that happen i bought her of a man whom i met on the highway gentlemen said the lawyer i find that the court is in session and all is ready for the trial by the way colonel are you not a graduate of euclid asked the lawyer yes sir and i am proud of the dear old college rejoined the colonel warmly i agree with you said walter i have passed two years in the college then young man heres my hand my heart is always warm toward a euclid man even if you have to prosecute him for horsestealing suggested lawyer barry slyly really this is very painful said the colonel i wish i could get rid of it you can say in court that you are convinced of the young mans innocence and i will and afterward i shall insist on mr sherwoods driving home with me and making me a visit great was the surprise of mr crane and mr penton when they saw the horse thief approach the court room arm in arm with colonel owen the trial began and presently crane and penton were called on to testify did you see the prisoner steal the mare demanded barry sharply no but it stands to reason that he did or he wouldnt have had her in his possession mr sherwood you may take the stand walter gave a brief account of the way in which he became possessed of bess does mr sherwoods story seem probable now remarked the judge i am convinced that it is true said the colonel promptly the judge saw how matters stood and discharged the prisoner were left said crane in a tragic whisper now mr sherwood said the colonel taking walters arm you must accompany me to shelby chapter xxxviii an opening at shelby at length they reached shelby colonel owen lived in a large and handsome mansion with ample grounds yes he said i have a comfortable home but my boys are away and my wife and i feel lonely in this large house it will brighten us both to have a young face at the table how could walter feel otherwise than pleased he was charmed with mrs owen i am glad to see you she said may i call you walter i wish you would mrs owen said walter did you find your horse richard she added yes my dear did you see the man that stole it yes my dear with a quiet wink at walter i invited the horse thief to come and make us a visit mrs owen certainly was amazed you did she ejaculated when is he coming he is here already i dont understand you at all richard you seem to be joking not at all there he stands and the colonel pointed to walter what walter perhaps i had better go to the hotel suggested walter no no i cant believe anything evil of a young man with your face said mrs owen i am glad my husband brought you home with him i am sure you will both be kind to me said walter earnestly and i shall appreciate it the more because i have neither father nor mother one afternoon colonel owen came in radiant well walter he said ive got some work for you to do mr hayward the teacher of our classical school is summoned to his home the question is who shall take his place till the end of the school year i have mentioned your name to the trustees who are ready to accept you on my recommendation there is nothing i should like better he said but do you think i am competent you ought to be able to teach any of the classes that will come under your charge how are you in mathematics i dont think i shall have any difficulty there sir then youre better off than i am how much salary shall i receive asked walter who was beginning to grow interested twentyfive dollars a week thats what the trustees authorize me to offer you that will be quite satisfactory how my old chums will stare when i tell them i am getting twentyfive dollars a week for teaching a classical school i suppose added walter hesitating i ought to look out for a boardingplace what and leave us asked the old lady reproachfully but colonel owen remember that i shall be earning a good salary you can find a use for it it will help make up for some of the losses you have incurred shall i say you will accept the post yes sir i will try it and hope to succeed chapter xxxix the new master on the platform of the main schoolroom in the shelby classical institute stood colonel owen and walter sherwood my young friends began colonel owen you are all aware that your respected teacher mr haywood is obliged to be absent for the remainder of the term i have been able to secure as his substitute mr walter sherwood who will do his best to carry on the work which mr haywood has so auspiciously commenced i hope you will receive him cordially and uphold him in his task walter felt some diffidence as he realized what a responsibility had been placed upon him he cleared his throat and spoke a few words colonel owen has introduced me to you and expressed a hope in which i join him that you will receive me cordially and uphold me in my work i will now go about among the seats make inquiries as to your progress and arrange the classes this short speech made a favorable impression upon all the pupils with two exceptions these were the largest scholars ben buffum and enoch snow what they thought of walter may be gathered from their conversation as they walked home together what do you think of the new master ben said enoch i spose hell do he ought to if hes been to college but ill tell you what enoch it riles me to have a boy of my own age set over me me ditto he would do for a primary school but when it comes to young men like us i dont like to let people know that hes my teacher its all right for the others to obey him but you and i are just as strong as he and maybe stronger i guess i could floor him in wrestling youre too much for me ben and i think i can stand up to him and maybe lick him its likely you can now there was hayward he was a big man i didnt mind obeying him are you talking about mr sherwood asked harry howe a boy of fourteen no im not im talking about mr hayward how do you like the new teacher hes only a boy hell have a hard row to hoe wholl make it hard for him enoch and i then it will be a shame he seems to be a perfect gentleman gentleman hes only a boy like ourselves at any rate he knows enough to teach us that may be but he cant keep order why cant he youll see whether he can or not said ben significantly are you going to make trouble it isnt best for small boys to know too much walter had not failed to notice the halfrebellious demeanor of his two oldest pupils moreover he had been warned by the janitor of the building that they would be likely to give him trouble chapter xl ben is subdued ben buffum was biding his time in the seat in front of ben sat albert frost a much smaller boy one day toward the close of the afternoon a loud shriek was heard in the neighborhood of ben buffums desk walter looked up and saw albert in tears what is the matter albert asked walter ben buffum stuck a pin in my leg answered the boy is that true buffum demanded walter sternly yes it is answered ben with provoking calmness walters temper was stirred but he asked in his ordinary tones why did you do it because i chose answered ben then said walter giving full vent to his scorn you are a contemptible coward and brute you forget that in this schoolroom i am the master and consider it my duty to defend my pupils even the smallest from the violence of brutes hell have to pay for this he muttered to himself i can lick you walter he said with an insolent leer he had hardly got the words out of his mouth when walter was upon him he was wonderfully quick in his movements whereas ben though powerful was slow and before he well knew what was going to happen he was dragged by the collar from his seat into the middle of the floor walter let go for a minute and ben mad all over prepared to grasp him in a bearlike hug a stinging blow in the face convinced him that he had entirely underrated the powers of the teacher he tried to return the blow but unable to defend himself found his own blow parried and another planted in his chest causing him to stagger then ben lost all caution and with a furious cry rushed upon walter in hope of throwing him down by wrestling but instead he found himself lying on his back on the floor looking up at the teacher ben got up slowly and pitched in once more but in about a minute he found himself again in a recumbent position have you had enough asked walter i hit my head answered ben in a sulky tone i hope you are not seriously hurt said walter quietly if you would like to be dismissed now you may go i shall be glad to see you back here tomorrow without a word but looking intensely mortified ben took his hat and slunk out of the room when he had gone walter said scholars i want to ask of you a favor ben is mortified by what has happened i wish you would all abstain from reminding him of it in that case the lesson he has received may do him good the next day ben buffum stayed at home and did not show himself on the street till evening when he found that no one spoke to him of the affair he took courage to go to school the day after walter overtook him on the way and hailed him in a friendly manner with we will forget all about that little affair day before yesterday ben you are pretty strong i couldnt do nothin against you no because i have taken lessons in boxing id like to box if youll come round and see me this evening ben ill give you the first lesson the scholars were very much surprised to see ben and the teacher walking to school together and were further surprised at the wonderful change for the better that took place in the once rebellious pupil chapter xli conclusion mrs deborah simpkins a near neighbor of doctor mack was an illnatured gossip and had always disliked walter because he once interfered to prevent a boy of hers from abusing a young companion one day about two months later she put on her bonnet and with a smile of malicious satisfaction walked over to the doctors house how do you do mrs sprague she said i thought id run over and have a chat with you come in mrs simpkins said nancy civilly but not cordially for she did not like her visitor ive got something unpleasant to tell you went on the widow as she sat down in a rocker im awful sorry are you said nancy dryly whats it all about i got a letter from my niece sophrony out in iowa yesterday and she sent me a cuttin from an old paper its somethin awful is it yes and its about walter sherwood continued mrs simpkins triumphantly he hasnt met with an accident has he inquired nancy turning pale its wuss than that answered the widow nodding her head ominously worse than an accident yes leastways i call it so let me hear it then mrs simpkins here tis you can read it for yourself this was the paragraph a young man named walter sherwood was arrested yesterday charged with stealing a valuable mare belonging to colonel richard owen we understand his trial is to take place this morning when is the paper dated asked nancy who did not appear so much overcome as her visitor expected over two months since walter sherwood is probably in jail now i feel for you and the doctor said mrs simpkins in a tone far from sympathetic fixing her beadlike eyes on the housekeeper thats very good of you but as we got a letter from walter yesterday there aint no call to be troubled did he write from the jail dont be a fool mrs simpkins he wrote from the town of shelby where he has been teaching a classic school and he inclosed the program of the exhibition perhaps you would like to look at it mrs simpkins took the paper and looked intensely disappointed as she saw that nancy had only told the truth he teach school a boy like him she ejaculated yes mrs simpkins and its been a great success they want him to go back next year but the doctor prefers to have him finish out his college course were expecting him home every day there was a noise heard as of the front door opening and a moment later walter was in the room oh walter exclaimed nancy overjoyed in her excitement throwing her arms around his neck im so glad to see you and i am glad to see you nancy hows my guardian hes well and will be home soon good afternoon mrs simpkins said walter politely mrs simpkins has just been telling me that you were in jail for horsestealing said nancy she is much pleased to find it all a mistake walter laughed i am still more pleased he remarked i find schoolteaching much pleasanter i guess i must be goin said mrs simpkins hurriedly when doctor mack returned he welcomed walter with a joy not inferior to that of his housekeeper and so you have succeeded he said yes the trustees of the shelby classical school want me to come back as my predecessor has accepted a position in new york but i think i had better return to college and finish out my course i have a thousand dollars saved up and a little more and i think with economy i can pay my own way for the remainder of the course it wont be necessary walter but as my property is lost you must forgive me walter for deceiving you but you have just as much property as ever indeed more as you only drew one hundred dollars in the past year but doctor why then did you lead me to think otherwise it wasnt altogether a falsehood about a hundred dollars had been lost in an investment and i made that a pretext for withdrawing you from college i saw that you were wasting your time and acquiring expensive habits so i thought the best remedy would be a year of active life in which you would be thrown upon your own resources you are right doctor it has made a man of me i shall go back to old euclid and work in earnest i have been a teacher myself and i understand what a teacher has a right to expect from his pupils then my experiment has been a success and your year of probation has done you good i hope to prove it to you my dear guardian walter returned to college and two years later graduated valedictorian of his class the money he had earned in his year of probation he devoted to helping the needy members of his class to obtain an education gates alone received three hundred dollars and it saved the poor fellow from leaving college a year before graduation walter intends to study law and it is predicted that he will win success at the bar for whatever success he may achieve he will be inclined to give the credit to his year of probation the end
