 ray bradbury the foghorn out there in the cold water far from land we waited every night for the coming of the fog and it came and we oiled the brass machinery and lit the fog light up in the stone tower feeling like two birds in the grey sky mcdunn and i sent the light touching out red then white then red again to eye the lonely ships and if they did not see our light then there was always our voice the great deep cry of our fog horn shuddering through the rags of mist to startle the gulls away like decks of scattered cards and make the waves turn high and foam its a lonely life but youre used to it now arent you asked mcdunn yes i said youre a good talker thank the lord well its your turn on land tomorrow he said smiling to dance the ladies and drink gin what do you think mcdunn when i leave you out here alone on the mysteries of the sea mcdunn lit his pipe it was a quarter past seven of a cold november evening the heat on the light switching its tail in two hundred directions the fog horn bumbling in the high throat of the tower there wasnt a town for a hundred miles down the coast just a road which came lonely through dead country to the sea with few cars on it a stretch of two miles of cold water out to our rock and rare few ships the mysteries of the sea said mcdunn thoughtfully you know the oceans the biggest damned snowflake ever it rolls and swells a thousand shapes and colours no two alike strange one night years ago i was here alone when all of the fish of the sea surfaced out there something made them swim in and lie in the bay sort of trembling and staring up at the tower light going red white red white across them so i could see their funny eyes i turned cold they were like a big peacocks tail moving out there until midnight then without so much as a sound they slipped away the million of them was gone i kind of think maybe in some sort of way they came all those miles to worship strange but think how the tower must look to them standing seventy feet above the water the godlight flashing out from it and the tower declaring itself with a monster voice they never came back those fish but dont you think for a while they thought they were in the presence i shivered i looked out at the long grey lawn of the sea stretching away into nothing and nowhere oh the seas full mcdunn puffed his pipe nervously blinking he had been nervous all day and hadnt said why for all our engines and so called submarines itll be ten thousand centuries before we set foot on the real bottom of the sunken lands in the fairy kingdoms there and know real terror think of it its still the year before christ down under there while weve paraded around with trumpets lopping off each others countries and heads they have been living beneath the sea twelve miles deep and cold in a time as old as the beard of a comet yes its an old world come on i got something special i been saving up to tell you we ascended the eighty steps talking and taking our time at the top mcdunn switched off the room lights so thered be no reflection in the plate glass the great eye of the light was humming turning easily in its oiled socket the fog horn was blowing steadily once every fifteen seconds sounds like an animal dont it mcdunn nodded to himself a big lonely animal crying in the night sitting here on the edge of ten billion years calling out to the deeps im here im here im here and the deeps do answer yes they do you been here now for three months johnny so i better prepare you about this time of year he said studying the murk and fog something comes to visit the lighthouse the swarms of fish like you said no this is something else ive put off telling you because you might think im daft but tonights the latest i can put it off for if my calendars marked right from last year tonights the night it comes i won t go into detail youll have to see it yourself just sit down there if you want tomorrow you can pack your duffel and take the motorboat into land and get your car parked there at the dinghy pier on the cape and drive on back to some little inland town and keep your lights burning nights i wont question or blame you its happened three years now and this is the only time anyones been here with me to verify it you wait and watch half an hour passed with only a few whispers between us when we grew tired waiting mcdunn began describing some of his ideas to me he had some theories about the fog horn itself one day many years ago a man walked along and stood in the sound of the ocean on a cold sunless shore and said we need a voice to call across the water to warn ships ill make one ill make a voice like all of time and all of the fog that ever was ill make a voice that is like an empty bed beside you all night long and like an empty house when you open the door and like trees in autumn with no leaves a sound like the birds flying south crying and a sound like november wind and the sea on the hard cold shore ill make a sound thats so alone that no one can miss it that whoever hears it will weep in their souls and hearths will seem warmer and being inside will seem better to all who hear it in the distant towns ill make me a sound and an apparatus and theyll call it a fog horn and whoever hears it will know the sadness of eternity and the briefness of life the fog horn blew i made up that story said mcdunn quietly to try to explain why this thing keeps coming back to the lighthouse every year the fog horn calls i think it comes but i said sssst said mcdunn there he nodded out to the deeps something was swimming towards the lighthouse tower it was a cold night as i have said the high tower was cold the light coming and going and the fog horn calling and calling through the ravelling mist you couldnt see far and you couldnt see plain but there was the deep sea moving on its way about the night earth flat and quiet the colour of grey mud and here were the two of us alone in the high tower and there far out at first was a ripple followed by a wave a rising a bubble a bit of froth and then from the surface of the cold sea came a head a large head darkcoloured with immense eyes and then a neck and thennot a bodybut more neck and more the head rose a full forty feet above the water on a slender and beautiful dark neck only then did the body like a little island of black coral and shells and crayfish drip up from the subterranean there was a flicker of tail in all from head to tip of tail i estimated the monster at ninety or a hundred feet i dont know what i said i said something steady boy steady whispered mcdunn its impossible i said no johnny were impossible its like it always was ten million years ago it hasnt changed its us and the land thatve changed become impossible us it swam slowly and with a great dark majesty out in the icy waters far away the fog came and went about it momentarily erasing its shape one of the monster eyes caught and held and flashed back our immense light red white red white like a disc held high and sending a message in primaeval code it was as silent as the fog through which it swam its a dinosaur of some sort i crouched down holding to the stair rail yes one of the tribe but they died out no only hid away in the deeps deep deep down in the deepest deeps isnt that a word now johnny a real word it says so much the deeps theres all the coldness and darkness and deepness in the world in a word like that whatll we do do we got our job we cant leave besides were safer here than in any boat trying to get to land that things as big as a destroyer and almost as swift but here why does it come here the next moment i had my answer the fog horn blew and the monster answered a cry came across a million years of water and mist a cry so anguished and alone that it shuddered in my head and my body the monster cried out at the tower the fog horn blew the monster roared again the fog horn blew the monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the fog horn itself lonely and vast and far away the sound of isolation a viewless sea a cold night apartness that was the sound now whispered mcdunn do you know why it comes here i nodded all year long johnny that poor monster there lying far out a thousand miles at sea and twenty miles deep maybe biding its time perhaps its a million years old this one creature think of it waiting a million years could you wait that long maybe its the last of its kind i sort of think thats true anyway here come men on land and build this lighthouse five years ago and set up their fog horn and sound it and sound it out towards the place where you bury yourself in sleep and sea memories of a world where there were thousands like yourself but now youre alone all alone in a world not made for you a world where you have to hide but the sound of the fog horn comes and goes comes and goes and you stir from the muddy bottom of the deeps and your eyes open like the lenses of twofoot cameras and you move slow slow for you have the ocean sea on your shoulders heavy but that fog horn comes through a thousand miles of water faint and familiar and the furnace in your belly stokes up and you begin to rise slow slow you feed yourself on great slakes of cod and minnow on rivers of jellyfish and you rise slow through the autumn months through september when the fogs started through october with more fog and the horn still callin g you on and then late in november after pressurizing yourself day by day a few feet higher every hour you are near the surface and still alive youve got to go slow if you surfaced all at once youd explode so it takes you all of three months to surface and then a number of days to swim through the cold waters to the lighthouse and there you are out there in the night johnny the biggest damn monster in creation and heres the lighthouse calling to you with a long neck like your neck sticking way up out of the water and a body like your body and most important of all a voice like your voice do you understand now johnny do you understand the fog horn blew the monster answered i saw it all i knew it allthe million years of waiting alone for someone to come back who never came back the million years of isolation at the bottom of the sea the insanity of time there while the skies cleared of reptilebirds the swamps dried on the continental lands the sloths and sabretooths had their day and sank in tar pits and men ran like white ants upon the hills the fog horn blew last year said mcdunn that creature swam round and round round and round all night not coming too near puzzled id say afraid maybe and a bit angry after coming all this way but the next day unexpectedly the fog lifted the sun came out fresh the sky was as blue as a painting and the monster swam off away from the heat and the silence and didnt come back i suppose its been brooding on it for a year now thinking it over from every which way the monster was only a hundred yards off now it and the fog horn crying at each other as the lights hit them the monsters eyes were fire and ice fire and ice thats life for you said mcdunn someone always waiting for someone who never comes home always someone loving some thing more than that thing loves them and after a while you want to destroy whatever that thing is so it cant hurt you no more the monster was rushing at the lighthouse the fog horn blew lets see what happens said mcdunn he switched the fog horn off the ensuing minute of silence was so intense that we could hear our hearts pounding in the glassed area of the tower could hear the slow greased turn of the light the monster stopped and froze its great lantern eyes blinked its mouth gaped it gave a sort of rumble like a volcano it twitched its head this way and that as if to seek the sounds now dwindled off into the fog it peered at the lighthouse it rumbled again then its eyes caught fire it reared up threshed the water and rushed at the tower its eyes filled with angry torment mcdunn i cried switch on the horn mcdunn fumbled with the switch but even as he flicked it on the monster was rearing up i had a glimpse of its gigantic paws fishskin glittering in webs between the fingerlike projections clawing at the tower the huge eye on the right side of its anguished head glit tered before me like a cauldron into which i might drop screaming the tower shook the fog horn cried the monster cried it seized the tower and gnashed at the glass which shattered in upon us mcdunn seized my arm downstairs the tower rocked trembled and started to give the fog horn and the monster roared we stumbled and half fell down the stairs quick we reached the bottom as the tower buckled down towards us we ducked under the stairs into the small stone cellar there were a thousand concussions as the rocks rained down the fog horn stopped abruptly the monster crashed upon the tower the tower fell we knelt together mcdunn and i holding tight while our world exploded then it was over and there was nothing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the raw stones that and the other sound listen said mcdunn quietly listen we waited a moment and then i began to hear it first a great vacuumed sucking of air and then the lament the bewilderment the loneliness of the great monster folded over and upon us above us so that the sickening reek of its body filled the air a stones thickness away from our cellar the monster gasped and cried the tower was gone the light was gone the thing that had called to it across a million years was gone and the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds the sounds of a fog horn again and again and ships far at sea not finding the light not seeing anything but passing and hearing late that night mustve thought there it is the lonely sound the lonesome bay horn alls well weve rounded the cape and so it went for the rest of that night the sun was hot and yellow the next afternoon when the rescuers came out to dig us from our stonedunder cellar it fell apart is all said mr mcdunn gravely we had a few bad knocks from the waves and it just crumbled he pinched my arm there was nothing to see the ocean was calm the sky blue the only thing was a great algaic stink from the green matter that covered the fallen tower stones and the shore rocks flies buzzed about the ocean washed empty on the shore the next year they built a new lighthouse but by that time i had a job in the little town and a wife and a good small warm house that glowed yellow on autumn nights the doors locked the chimney puffing smoke as for mcdunn he was master of the new lighthouse built to his own specifications out of steelreinforced concrete just in case he said the new lighthouse was ready in november i drove down alone one evening late and parked my car and looked across the grey waters and listened to the new horn sounding once twice three four times a minute far out there by itself the monster it never came back its gone away said mcdunne its gone back to the deeps its learned you cant love anything too much in this world its gone into the deepest deeps to wait another million years ah the poor thing waiting out there and waiting out there while man comes and goes on this pitiful little planet waiting and waiting i sat in my car listening i couldnt see the lighthouse or the light standing out in lonesome bay i could only hear the horn the horn the horn it sounded like the monster calling i sat there wishing there was something i could say
