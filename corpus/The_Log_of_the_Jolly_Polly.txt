 the log of the jolly polly temptation came to me when i was in the worst possible position to resist it it is a way temptation has whenever i swear off drinking invariably i am invited to an ushers dinner whenever i am rich only the highbrow publications that pay the least want my work but the moment i am povertystricken the manicure girls magazine and the rot and spot weekly spring at me with offers of a dollar a word temptation always is on the job when i am down and out temptation always is up and at me when first the farrells tempted me my vogue had departed on my name and past performances i could still dispose of what i wrote but only to magazines that were just starting the others knew i no longer was a bestseller all the real editors knew it so did the theatrical managers my books and plays had flourished in the dark age of the historicalromantic novel my heroes wore gauntlets and long swords they fought for the cardinal or the king and each loved a highborn demoiselle who was a ward of the king or the cardinal and with feminine perversity always of whichever one her young man was fighting with people who had never read guizots history of france my books were popular and for me made a great deal of money this was fortunate for my parents had left me nothing save expensive tastes when the tastes became habits the public left me it turned to whiteslave and crook plays and to novels true to life so true to life that one felt the author must at one time have been a masseur in a turkish bath so my heroines in black velvet and my heroes with long swords were scrapped as one book reviewer put it to expect the public of today to read the novels of fletcher farrell is like asking people to give up the bunny hug and go back to the lancers and to make it harder i was only thirty years old it was at this depressing period in my career that i received a letter from fairharbor massachusetts signed fletcher farrell the letter was written on the business paper of the farrell cotton mills and asked if i were related to the farrells of duncannon of the county wexford who emigrated to massachusetts in o the writer added that he had a grandfather named fletcher and suggested we might be related from the handwriting of fletcher farrell and from the way he illtreated the kings english i did not feel the ties of kinship calling me very loud i replied briefly that my people originally came from youghal in county cork that as early as they had settled in new york and that all my relations on the farrell side either were still at youghal or dead mine was not an encouraging letter nor did i mean it to be and i was greatly surprised two days later to receive a telegram reading something to your advantage to communicate wife and self calling on you thursday at noon fletcher farrell i was annoyed but also interested the words something to your advantage always possess a certain charm so when the elevator boy telephoned that mr and mrs farrell were calling i told him to bring them up my first glance at the farrells convinced me the interview was a waste of time i was satisfied that from two such persons nothing to my advantage could possibly emanate on the contrary from their lack of ease it looked as though they had come to beg or borrow they resembled only a butler and housekeeper applying for a new place under the disadvantage of knowing they had no reference from the last one of the two i better liked the man he was an elderly pleasantfaced irishman smoothshaven redcheeked and with white hair although it was july he wore a frock coat and carried a new high hat that glistened as though he thought at any moment it might explode he held it from him and eyed it fearfully mrs farrell was of a more sophisticated type the lines in her face and hands showed that for years she might have known hard physical work but her dress was in the latest fashion and her fingers held more diamonds than out of a showcase i ever had seen with embarrassment old man farrell began his speech evidently it had been rehearsed and as he recited it in swift asides his wife prompted him but to note the effect he was making she kept her eyes upon me having first compared my name fame and novels with those of charles dickens walter scott and archibald clavering gunter and to the disadvantage of those gentlemen farrell said the similarity of our names often had been commented upon and that when from my letter he had learned our families both were from the south of ireland he had a premonition we might be related duncannon where he was born he pointed out was but forty miles from youghal and the fishing boats out of waterford harbor often sought shelter in blackwater river had any of my forebears he asked followed the herring alarmed lest at this i might take offense mrs farrell interrupted him the fletchers and ofarrells of youghal she exclaimed were gentry what would they be doing in a trawler i assured her that so far as i knew being before my time they might have been smugglers and pirates all i ever heard of the farrells i told her begins after they settled in new york and there is no one i can ask concerning them my father and mother are dead all my fathers relatives are dead and my mothers relatives are as good as dead i mean i added we dont speak to my surprise this information appeared to afford my visitors great satisfaction they exchanged hasty glances then exclaimed mr farrell eagerly if i understand you you have no living relations at all barring those that are dead exactly i agreed he drew a deep sigh of relief with apparent irrelevance but with a carelessness that was obviously assumed he continued since i come to america he announced i have made heaps of money as though in evidence of his prosperity he flashed the high hat in the sunlight it coruscated like one of his wifes diamonds heaps of money he repeated the mills are still in my name he went on but five years since i sold them we live on the income we own harbor castle the finest house on the whole waterfront when all the windows are lit up interjected mrs farrell its often took for a fall river boat when i was building it farrell continued smoothly they called it farrells folly but not now in friendly fashion he winked at me standard oil he explained offered half a million for it they wanted my wharf for their tank steamers but i needed it for my yacht i must have sat up rather too suddenly for seeing the yacht had reached home mr farrell beamed complacently his wife smoothed an imaginary wrinkle in her skirt eighteen men she protested with nothing to do but clean brass and eat three meals a day farrell released his death grip on the silk hat to make a sweeping gesture they earn their wages he said generously arent they taking us this week to cap may theyre taking the yacht to cape may corrected mrs farrell not me the sea does not agree with her explained farrell were going by automobile mrs farrell now took up the wondrous tale its a high flyer model she explained green with white enamel leather inside and red wheels outside you can see it from the window somewhat dazed i stepped to the window and found you could see it from almost anywhere it was as large as a freight car and was entirely surrounded by taxistarters bellboys and nursemaids the chauffeur and a deputy chauffeur in a green livery with patentleather leggings were frowning upon the mob they possessed the hauteur of ambulance surgeons i returned to my chair and then rose hastily to ask if i could not offer mr farrell some refreshment mebbe later he said evidently he felt that as yet he had not sufficiently impressed me harbor castle he recited has eighteen bedrooms billiardroom musicroom art gallery and swimmingpool he shook his head and no one to use em but us we had a boy he stopped and for an instant as though asking pardon laid his hand upon the knee of mrs farrell but he was taken when he was four and none came since my wife has a niece he added but but interrupted mrs farrell she was too high and mighty for plain folks and now there is no one we always took an interest in you because your name was farrell we were always reading of you in the papers we have all your books and a picture of you in the billiardroom when folks ask me if we are any relation sometimes i tell em we are as though challenging me to object she paused its quite possible i said hastily and in order to get rid of them i added ill tell you what ill do ill write to ireland and farrell shook his head firmly you dont need to write to ireland he said for what we want what do you want i asked we want a son said farrell an adopted son we want to adopt you you want to what i asked to learn if mrs farrell also was mad i glanced toward her but her expression was inscrutable the face of the irishman had grown purple and why not he demanded you are a famous young man all right and educated but theres nothing about me im ashamed of im worth five million dollars and i made every cent of it myself and i made it honest you ask dun or bradstreet ask i attempted to soothe him thats not it sir i explained its a most generous offer a most flattering complimentary offer but you dont know me i don t know you choosing a son is a very ive had you looked up announced mrs farrell the pinkertons give you a high rating i hired em to trail you for six months i wanted to ask which six months but decided to let sleeping dogs lie i shook my head politely but firmly i delivered my ultimatum it is quite impossible i said firmly mrs farrell continued the debate she talked in a businesslike manner and pronounced the arrangement one by which both sides would benefit there were thousands of other farrells she pointed out any one of whom they might have adopted but they had selected me because in so choosing they thought they were taking the least risk they had decided she was pleased to say that i would not disgrace them and that as a literary author i brought with me a certain social asset a clever young businessman they did not want their business affairs they were quit able to manage themselves but they would like as an adopted son one who had already added glory to the name of farrell which glory he was willing to share we wouldnt tie you down she urged but we would expect you to live at harbor castle a part of your time and to call us ma and pa you would have your own rooms and your own servant and there is a boathouse on the harbor front where you could write your novels at this knowing none wanted my novels i may have winced for misreading my discontent farrell hastily interrupted you wont have to work at all he protested heartily my son can afford to live like a lord youll get all the spending money you want and if youre fond of foreign parts you can take the yacht wherever you please the farther the better exclaimed mrs farrell with heat and when you get it there i hope youll sink it maybe your friends would come and visit you suggested farrell i thought a trifle wistfully theres bathing tennis eight bedrooms billiardroom art gallery you told him that said mrs farrell i was greatly at a loss their offer was preposterous but to them it was apparently a perfectly possible arrangement nor were they acting on impulse mrs farrell had admitted that for six months she had had me trailed how to say no and not give offense i found difficult they were deeply in earnest and i could see that farrell at least was by instinct generous human and kind it was in fact a most generous offer but how was i to tell them tactfully i was not for sale that i was not looking for readytowear parents and that if i were in the market they were not the parents i would choose i had a picture of life at harbor castle dependent upon the charity of the farrells i imagined what my friends would say to me and worse what they would say behind my back but i was not forced to a refusal mr farrell rose we dont want to hurry you he said we want you to think it over maybe if we get acquainted mrs farrell smiled upon me ingratiatingly why dont we get acquainted now she demanded were motoring down to cape may to stay three weeks why dont you come along as our guest and see how you like us i assured them almost too hastily that already was deeply engaged as they departed farrell again admonished me to think it over and look me up at duns and bradstreets he advised ask em about me at the waldorf ask the head waiters and bellhops if i look twice at a five spot it seemed an odd way to select a father but i promised i escorted them even to the sidewalk and not without envy watched them sweep toward the waldorf in the high flyer model i caught myself deciding were it mine i would paint it gray i was lunching at the ritz with curtis spencer and i looked forward to the delight he would take in my story of the farrells he would probably want to write it he was my junior but my great friend and as a novelist his popularity was where five years earlier mine had been but he belonged to the new school his novels smelled like a beauty parlor and his heroines while always beautiful were on occasions virtuous but only when they thought it would pay spencer himself was as modern as his novels and i was confident his view of my adventure would be that of the great world which he described so accurately but to my amazement when i had finished he savagely attacked me you idiot he roared are you trying to tell me you refused five million dollars just because you didnt like the people who wanted to force it on you where he demanded is cape may well follow them now well close this deal before they can change their minds ill make you sign tonight and then he continued eagerly well take their yacht and escape to newport and youll lend me five thousand dollars and pay my debts and give me back the ten you borrowed and you might buy me a touringcar and some polo ponies and and oh lots of things ill think of them as we go along meanwhile i cant afford to give luncheons to millionaires so you sign for this one and then well start for cape may are you mad i demanded do you think id sell my honor for five million dollars cried spencer dont make me laugh if they want a real novelist for a son they can adopt me i replied with dignity that i would not disgrace the memory of my parents you have disgraced them retorted spencer with your musketeer novels for infants you need money to get it you may be tempted to write more novels heres your chance stop robbing the public and lead an honest life think of all the money you could give to the poor think of all the money you and i could lose at monte carlo when he found i would not charter an automobile and at once pursue the farrells he changed his tactics if i would not go to cape may then he begged i would go to fairharbor he asked that i would at least find out what i was refusing before making their offer for six months the farrells had had me looked up but without knowing anything of them after a talk of ten minutes i had turned them down was that he asked intelligent was it fair to the farrells he continued to tempt me they told you to think it over he persisted very well then think it over at fairharbor for the next three weeks the farrells will be at cape may the coast is clear go to fairharbor as somebody else and be your own detective find out if what they tell you is true get inside information get inside harbor castle count the eighteen bedrooms and try the beds never mind the art gallery but make sure there is a wine cellar you cant start too soon and i will go with you i told him where he could go we then tossed to see who should pay for the lunch and who should tip the head waiter i lost and had to tip the head waiter we separated and as i walked down the avenue it seemed as though to the proprietor of every shop i passed i owed money owing them the money i did not so much mind what most distressed me was that they were so polite about it i had always wanted to reward their patience a favorite dream of mine was to be able to walk down fifth avenue my pockets stuffed with yellow bills paying off my debts compared with my steadily decreasing income how enormous my debts appeared but when compared with the income of a man worth sayfive million dollars how ridiculous i had no more than reached my apartment than a messengerboy arrived with an envelope it contained a ticket for a round trip on the new bedford line boat leaving that afternoon a ticket for a stateroom and a note from curtis spencer the latter read the boat leaves at six tonight you arrive at new bedford seven tomorrow morning new bedford and fairharbor are connected by a bridge cross it i tore the note in tiny fragments and tossed them through the open window i was exceedingly angry as i stood at the window adding to the name of curtis spencer insulting aliases the street below sent up hot stifling odors the smoke of taxicabs the gases of an open subway the stale reek of thousands of perspiring unwashed bodies from that one side street seemed to rise the heat and smells of all new york for relief i turned to my worktable where lay the opening chapters of my new novel the white plume of savoy but now in the light of spencers open scorn i saw it was impudently false childish sentimental my head ached the humidity sapped my strength at heart i felt sick sore discouraged i was down and out and seeing this temptation like an obsequious floorwalker came hurrying forward and what may i show you today asked temptation he showed me the upper deck of the new bedford boat feeling her way between the green banks of the sound a cool wind swept past me bearing clean salty odors on the saloon deck a band played and from the darkness the lighthouses winked at me and in friendly greeting the stars smiled temptation won in five minutes i was feverishly packing and at fivethirty i was on board i assured myself i had not listened to temptation that i had no interest in fairharbor was taking the trip solely because it would give me a nights sleep on the sound i promised myself that on the morrow i would not even look toward harbor castle but on the evening following on the same boat return to new york temptation did not stop to argue but hastened after another victim i turned in at nine oclock and the coolness and the salt air blessed me with the first sleep i had known in weeks and when i woke we were made fast to the companys wharf at new bedford and the sun was well up i rose refreshed in body and spirit no longer was i discouraged even the white plume of savoy seemed a perfectly good tale of romance and adventure and the farrells were a joke even if i were at fairlharbor i was there only on a lark and at the expense of curtis spencer who had paid for the tickets distinctly the joke was on curtis spencer i lowered the window screen and looked across the harbor it was a beautiful harbor at ancient stone wharfs jay ancient whalers with drooping davits and squared yards at anchor whitebreasted yachts flashed in the sun a gray manofwars man flaunted the weeks laundry a fourmasted schooner dried her canvas and over the smiling surface of the harbor innumerable fishing boats darted with delight i sniffed the odors of salt water sundried herring of oakum and tar the shore opposite was a graceful promontory crowned with trees and decorous grayshingled cottages set in tiny gardens that reached to the very edge of the harbor the second officer was passing my window and i asked what the promontory was called fairharbor he said he answered with such proprietary pride and smiled upon fairharbor with such approval that i ventured to guess it was his home thats right he said i used to live at the new york end of the runin a flat but never again no place for the boy to play but in the street i found i could rent one of those old cottages over there for the same money i paid for the flat so i cut out new york my boy lives in a bathing suit now and he can handle a catboat same as me we have a kitchen garden and hens and the fishermen here will give you all the fish you can carry away fish right out of the water i guess ive smashed the high cost of living problem all right i wouldnt go back to living in new york now not if they gave me the pilgrim as though trying to prod my memory i frowned it was my conception of the part of a detective hasnt fletcher farrell i asked a house in fairharbor harbor castle said the mate promptly its on the other side of the point id as soon live in a jail why i exclaimed but he was no longer listening he pointed at the shore opposite see that flag running up the staff in that garden he cried thats my boy signalling i got to get to the boat deck and wave back i felt as a detective i had acquired important information the mate a man of judgment preferred fairharbor to new york also to living in harbor castle he preferred going to jail the boat on which i had arrived was listed to start back at six the same evening on her return trip to new york so at the office of the line i checked my valise and set forth to explore new bedford the whaling vessels moored to a nearby wharf i inspected from hatches to keels and by those on board was directed to a warehouse where were stored harpoons whalebone and wooden figureheads my pleasure in these led to my being passed on to a row of antique shops filled with relics of the days of whaling and also with genuine piecrust tables genuine flintlock muskets genuine liverpool pitchers i coveted especially oldtime engravings of the whalers and was told at hatchardsons bookstore on the main street others could be found in profusion hatchardsons proved to be a place of great delight as you entered there were counters for magazines and postcards popular music and bestselling novels while in the rear of the shop tables and shelves were stocked with ancient volumes and on the wall surrounding them hung engravings prints and woodcuts of even the eighteenth century just as the drugstore on the corner seemed to be a waiting station for those of new bedford who used the trolleycars so for those who moved in automobiles or still clung to the family carriage hatchardsons appeared to be less a shop than a public meetingplace i noticed that the clerks most of whom were women were with the customers on a most friendly footing addressing them and by them being addressed by name finding i was free to wander where i pleased i walked to the rear of the shop and from one of the tables picked up a muchworn volume it was entitled the log of the jolly polly and was illustrated with wood cuts showing squarerigged ships and whales spouting for five minutes lost to my surroundings i turned the pages and then became conscious that across the table some one was watching me i raised my eyes and beheld a face of most surprising charm intelligence and beauty it was so lovely that it made me wince the face was the fortune and judging from the fact that in her hand she held a salesbook the sole fortune of a tall young girl who apparently had approached to wait on me she was looking toward the street so that with the bookshelves for a background her face was in profile and i determined swiftly that if she were to wait on me she would be kept waiting as long as my money lasted i did not want the log of the jolly polly but i did want to hear the lovely lady speak and especially i desired that the one to whom she spoke should be myself what is the price of this i asked with magnificent selfcontrol i kept my eyes on the book but the lovely lady was so long silent that i raised them to my surprise i found on her face an expression of alarm and distress with reluctance and yet within her voice a certain hopefulness she said fifty dollars fifty dollars was a death blow i had planned to keep the young lady selling books throughout the entire morning but at fifty dollars a book i would soon be owing her money i attempted to gain time it must be very rare i said i was afraid to look at her lest my admiration should give offense so i pretended to admire the book it is the only one in existence said the young lady at least it is the only one for sale we were interrupted by the approach of a tall man who from his playing the polite host and from his not wearing a hat i guessed was mr hatchardson himself he looked from the book in my hand to the lovely lady and said smiling have you lost it the girl did not smile to her apparently it was no laughing matter i dont know yet she said her voice was charming and genuinely troubled mr hatchardson for later i learned it was he took the book and showed me the titlepage this was privately printed in he said by captain noah briggs he distributed a hundred presentation copies among his family and friends here in new bedford it is a most interesting volume i did not find it so for even as he spoke the young girl still with a troubled countenance glided away inwardly i cursed captain briggs and associated with him in my curse the polite mr hatchardson but at his next words my interest returned still smiling he lowered his voice miss briggs the young lady who just left us he said is the granddaughter of captain briggs and she does not want the book to go out of the family she wants it for herself i interrupted eagerly but it is for sale mr hatchardson reluctantly assented then i will take it i said fifty dollars is a great deal of money but the face of the young lady had been very sad besides being sad had it been aged plain and illtempered that i still would have bought the book is a question i have never determined to mr hatchardson of my purpose to give the book to miss briggs i said nothing instead i planned to send it to her anonymously by mail she would receive it the next morning when i was arriving in new york and as she did not know my name she could not possibly return it at the postoffice i addressed the log to miss briggs care of hatchardsons bookstore and then i returned to the store i felt i had earned that pleasure this time miss briggs was in charge of the postcard counter and as now a postcard was the only thing i could afford to buy at seeing her there i was doubly pleased but she was not pleased to see me evidently mr hatchardson had told her i had purchased the log and at her loss her very lovely face still showed disappointment toward me her manner was distinctly aggrieved but of the log i said nothing and began recklessly purchasing postcards that pictured the show places of new bedford almost the first one i picked up was labelled harbor castle residence of fletcher farrell i need not say that i studied it intently according to the postcard harbor castle stood on a rocky point with water on both sides it was an enormous widespreading structure as large as a fort it exuded prosperity opulence extravagance great wealth i felt suddenly a filial impulse to visit the home of my wouldbe forefathers is this place near here i asked miss briggs told me that in order to reach it i should take the ferry to fairbarbor and then cross that town to the buzzards bay side you cant miss it she said its a big stone house with red and white awnings if you see anything like a jail in ruffles thats it it was evident that with the home i had rejected miss briggs was unimpressed but seeing me add the postcard to my collection she offered me another this she explained is harbor castle from the bay that is their yacht in the foreground the postcard showed a very beautiful yacht of not less than two thousand tons beneath it was printed harbor lights steam yacht owned by fletcher farrell i always had dreamed of owning a steam yacht and seeing it stated in cold type that one was owned by fletcher farrell even though i was not that fletcher farrell gave me a thrill of guilty pleasure i gazed upon the postcard with envy harbor lights is a strange name for a yacht i ventured miss briggs smiled not for that yacht she said she never leaves it i wished to learn more of my wouldbe parents and i wished to keep on talking with the lovely miss briggs so as an excuse for both i pretended i was interested in the farrells because i had something i wanted to sell them this fletcher farrell must be very rich i said i wonder i asked if i could sell him an automobile the moment i spoke i noticed that the manner of miss briggs toward me perceptibly softened perhaps from my buying offhand a fiftydollar book she had thought me one of the rich and had begun to suspect i was keeping her waiting on me only because i found her extremely easy to look at many times before in a similar manner other youths must have imposed upon her and perhaps also in concealing my admiration i had not entirely succeeded but when she believed that like herself i was working for my living she became more human what car are you selling she asked i am trying to sell i corrected her the blue bird six cylinder i never heard of it said miss briggs nor has any one else i answered with truth that is one reason why i cant sell it i arrived here this morning and i added with pathos i havent sold a car yet miss briggs raised her beautiful eyebrows skeptically have you tried she said a brilliant idea came to me in a side street i had passed a garage where photaix cars were advertised for hire i owned a phoenix and i thought i saw a way by which for a happy hour i might secure the society of miss briggs i am an agent and demonstrator for the phoenix also i said glibly maybe i could show you one show me one exclaimed miss briggs one sees them everywhere they are always under your feet i mean i explained might i take you for a drive in one it was as though i had completely vanished so far as the lovely miss briggs was concerned i had ceased to exist she turned toward a nice old lady what can i show you mrs scudder she asked cheerily and how is that wonderful baby i felt as though i had been lifted by the collar thrown out upon a hard sidewalk and my hat tossed after me greatly shaken and mentally brushing the dust from my hands and knees i hastened to the ferry and crossed to fairharbor i was extremely angry by an utter stranger i had been misjudged snubbed and cast into outer darkness for myself i readily found excuses if a young woman was so attractive that at the first sight of her men could not resist buying her fiftydollar books and hiring automobiles in which to take her driving the fault was hers i assured myself that girls as lovely as miss briggs were a menace to the public they should not be at large an ordinance should require them to go masked for miss briggs also i was able to make excuses why should she not protect herself from the advances of strange young men if a popular novelist and especially an expopular one chose to go about disguised as a drummer for the blue bird automobile and behaved as such and was treated as such what right had he to complain so i persuaded myself i had been punished as i deserved but to salve my injured pride i assured myself also that any one who read my novels ought to know my attitude toward any lovely lady could be only respectful protecting and chivalrous but with this consoling thought the trouble was that nobody read my novels in finding harbor castle i had no difficulty it stood upon a rocky point that jutted into buzzards bay five acres of artificial lawn and flowerbeds of the cemetery and railroadstation school of horticulture surrounded it and from the highroad it was protected by a stone wall so low that to the passerby of the beauties of harbor castle nothing was left to the imagination over this wall roses under conflicting banners of pink and red fought fiercely one could almost hear the shrieks of the wounded upon the least thorny of these i seated myself and in tender melancholy gazed upon the home of my childhood that is upon the home that mighthavebeen when surveying a completed country home to make the owner thoroughly incensed the correct thing to say is this place has great possibilities harbor castle had more possibilities than any other castle i ever visited but in five minutes i had altered it to suit myself i had ploughed up the flowerbeds dug a sunken garden planted a wind screen of fir spruce and pine and with a huge brick wall secured warmth and privacy so pleased was i with my changes that when i departed i was sad and downcast the boathouse of which mrs farrell had spoken was certainly an ideal workshop the tenniscourts made those at the newport casino look like a ploughed field and the swimmingpool guarded by white pillars and overhung with grapevines was a cool and refreshing picture as hot and perspiring i trudged back through fairharbor the memory of these haunted me that they also tempted me it is impossible to deny but not for long for after passing through the elmshaded streets to that side of the village that faced the harbor i came upon the cottages i had seen from the new bedford shore at close range they appeared even more attractive than when pointed out to me by the mate of the steamboat they were very old very weatherstained and covered with honeysuckle flat stones in a setting of grass led from the gates to the arched doorways hollyhocks rose above hedges of box and from the verandas one could look out upon the busy harbor and the houses of new bedford rising in steps up the sloping hills to a skyline of treetops and church spires the mate had told me that for what he had rented a flat in new york he had secured one of these charming old world homes and as i passed them i began to pick out the one in which when i retired from the world i would settle down this time i made no alterations how much the near presence of miss briggs had to do with my determination to settle down in fairharbor i cannot now remember but certainly as i crossed the bridge toward new bedford thoughts of her entirely filled my mind i assured my self this was so only because she was beautiful i was sure her outward loveliness advertised a nature equally lovely but for my sudden and extreme interest i had other excuses her in dependence in earning her living her choice in earning it among books and pictures her pride of family as shown by her efforts to buy the family heirloom all these justified my admiration and her refusing to go joyriding with an impertinent stranger even though the impertinent stranger was myself was an act i applauded the more i thought of miss briggs the more was i disinclined to go away leaving with her an impression of myself so unpleasant as the one she then held i determined to remove it at least until i had redeemed myself i would remain in new bedford the determination gave me the greatest satisfaction with a light heart i returned to the office of the steamboat line and retrieving my suitcase started with it toward the parker house it was now past five oclock the stores were closed and all the people who had not gone to the baseball game with fall river were in the streets in consequence as i was passing the postoffice miss briggs came down the steps and we were face to face in her lovely eyes was an expression of mingled doubt and indignation and in her hand freshly torn from the papers in which i had wrapped it was the log of the jolly polly in action miss briggs was as direct as a submarine at sight of me she attacked did you send me this she asked i lowered my bag to the sidewalk and prepared for battle i didnt think of your going to the postoffice i said i planned youd get it tomorrow after id left when i sent it i thought i would never see you again then you did send it exclaimed miss briggs as though the book were a hot plate she dropped it into my hand she looked straight at me but her expression suggested she was removing a caterpillar from her pet rosebush you had no right she said you may not have meant to be impertinent but you were again as though i had disappeared from the face of the earth miss briggs gazed coldly about her and with dignity started to cross the street her dignity was so great that she glanced neither to the left nor right in consequence she did not see an automobile that swung recklessly around a trolleycar and dived at her but other people saw it and shrieked i also shrieked and dropping the suitcase and the log jumped into the street grabbed miss briggs by both arms and flung her back to the sidewalk that left me where she had been and the car caught me up and slammed me head first against a telegraph pole the pole was hard and if any one counted me out i did not stay awake to hear him when i came to i was conscious that i was lying on a sidewalk but to open my eyes i was much too tired a voice was saying do you know who he is miss the voice that replied was the voice of the lovely miss briggs but now i hardly recognized it it was full of distress of tenderness and pity no i dont know him it stammered hes a salesman he was in the store this morning hes selling motorcars the first voice laughed motorcars he exclaimed thats why he aint scared of em he certainly saved you from that one i seen him miss briggs and he most certainly saved your life in response to this astonishing statement i was delighted to hear a welltrained male chorus exclaim in assent the voices differed some spoke in the accents of harvard pure and undefiled some in a down east dialect others suggested italian peanut venders and portuguese sailors but all agreed that the life of miss briggs had been saved by myself i had intended coming to but on hearing the chorus working so harmoniously i decided i had better continue unconscious then a new voice said importantly the marks on his suitcase are f f new york i appreciated instantly that to be identified as fletcher farrell meant humiliation and disaster the other fletcher farrells would soon return to new bedford they would learn that in their absence i had been spying upon the home i had haughtily rejected besides one of the chorus might remember that three years back fletcher farrell had been a popular novelist and might recognize me and miss briggs would discover i was not an automobile agent and that i had lied to her i saw that i must continue to lie to her i thought of names beginning with f and selected frederick fitzgibbon to christen yourself while your eyes are shut and your head rests on a curbstone is not easy and later i was sorry i had not called myself fairchild as being more aristocratic but then it was too late as fitzgibbon i had come back to life and as fitzgibbon i must remain when i opened my eyes i found the first voice belonged to a policeman who helped me to my feet and held in check the male chorus the object of each was to lead me to a drink but instead i turned dizzily to miss briggs she was holding my hat and she handed it to me her lovely eyes were filled with relief and her charming voice with remorse i i cant possibly thank you she stammered are you badly hurt i felt i had never listened to words so original and well chosen in comparison the brilliant and graceful speeches i had placed on the lips of my heroines became flat and unconvincing i assured her i was not at all hurt and endeavored jauntily to replace my hat but where my head had hit the telegraph pole a large bump had risen which made my hat too small so i hung it on the bump it gave me a rakish air one of the chorus returned my bag and another the log not wishing to remind miss briggs of my past impertinences i guiltily concealed it then the policeman asked my name and i gave the one i had just invented and inquired my way to the parker house half the chorus volunteered to act as my escort and as i departed i stole a last look at miss briggs she and the policeman were taking down the pedigree of the chauffeur of the car that had hit me he was trying to persuade them he was not intoxicated and with each speech was furnishing evidence to the contrary after i had given a cold bath to the bump on my head and to the rest of my body which for the moment seemed the lesser of the two i got into dry things and seated myself on the veranda of the hotel with a cigar to soothe my jangling nerves i considered the position of miss briggs and myself i was happy in believing it had improved on the morrow there was no law to prevent me from visiting hatchardsons bookstore and in view of what had happened since last i left it i had reason to hope miss briggs would receive me more kindly of the correctness of this diagnosis i was at once assured in front of the hotel a district messengerboy fell off his bicycle and with unerring instinct picked me out as mr fitzgibbon of new york the note he carried was from miss briggs it stated that in the presence of so many people it had been impossible for her to thank me as she wished for the service i had rendered her and that mrs cutler with whom she boarded and herself would be glad if after supper i would call upon them i gave the messengerboy enough gold to enable him to buy a new bicycle and in my room executed a dance symbolizing joy i then kicked my suitcase under the bed i would not soon need it now that miss briggs had forgiven me i was determined to live and die in new bedford the home of mrs cutler where miss briggs lodged and boarded was in a side street of respectable and distinguished antiquity the street itself was arched with the branches of giant elms and each house was an island surrounded by grass and over the porches climbed roses it was too warm to remain indoors so we sat on the steps of the porch and through the leaves of the elms the electric light globe served us as a moon for an automobile salesman i was very shy very humble twice before i had given offense and i was determined if it lay with me it would not happen again i did not hope to interest miss briggs in myself nor did i let it appear how tremendously i was interested in her for the moment i was only a stranger in a strange land making a social call i asked miss briggs about new bedford and the whaling about the books she sold and the books she liked it was she who talked when i found we looked at things in the same way and that the same things gave us pleasure i did not comment on that astonishing fact but as an asset more precious than gold stored it away when i returned to the hotel i found that concerning miss briggs i had made important discoveries i had learned that her name was polly that the jolly polly had been christened after her grandmother that she was an orphan that there were relatives with whom she did not hit it off that she was very well read possessed of a most charming sense of humor and that i found her the most attractive girl i had ever met the next morning i awoke in an exalted frame of mind i was in love with life with new bedford and with polly briggs i had been in love before but never with a young lady who worked in a shop and i found that loving a lady so occupied gives one a tremendous advantage for when you call she must always be at home nor can she plead another engagement so before noon knowing she could not deny herself i was again at hatchardsons purchasing more postalcards but miss briggs was not deceived nor apparently was any one else the bedford mercury had told how the previous evening frederick fitzgibbon an automobile salesman from new york had been knocked out by an automobile while saving miss polly briggs from a similar fate and mr hatchardson and all the old ladies who were in the bookstore making purchases congratulated me it was evident that in miss briggs they took much more than a perfunctory interest they were very fond of her she was an institution and i could see that as such to visitors she would be pointed out with pride as was the new bronze statue of the whaleman in court house square nor did they cease discussing her until they had made it quite clear to me that in being knocked out in her service i was a very lucky man i did not need to be told that especially as i noted that miss briggs was anxious lest i should not be properly modest indeed her wish that in the eyes of the old ladies i should appear to advantage was so evident and her interest in me so proprietary that i was far from unhappy the afternoon i spent in fairharbor from a real estate agent i obtained keys to those cottages on the waterfront that were for rent and i busied myself exploring them the one i most liked i pretended i had rented and i imagined myself at work among the flowerbeds or with my telescope scanning the shipping in the harbor or at night seated in front of the open fire watching the green and blue flames of the driftwood later irresolutely i wandered across town to harbor castle this time walking entirely around it and coming upon a sign that read visitors welcome do not pick the flowers assuring myself that i was moved only by curiosity i accepted the invitation nor though it would greatly have helped the appearance of the cemeterylike beds did i pick the flowers on a closer view harbor castle certainly possessed features calculated to make an impecunious author stop look and listen i pictured it peopled with my friends i saw them at the long mahogany table of which through the french window i got a glimpse or dancing in the musicroom or lounging on the wicker chairs on the sweeping verandas i could see them in flannels at tennis in bathingsuits diving from the springboard of the swimming pool departing on excursions in the motorcars that at the moment in front of the garage were being sponged and polished so that they flashed like mirrors and i thought also of the twothousandton yacht and to what far countries to what wonderful adventures it might carry me but all of these pictures lacked one feature in none of them did polly briggs appear for as i very well knew that was something the ambitions of mrs farrell would not permit that lady wanted me as a son only because she thought i was a social asset by the same reasoning as a daughterinlaw she would not want a shopgirl especially not one who as a shopgirl was known to all new bedford my mood as i turned my back upon the golden glories of harbor castle and walked to new bedford was thoughtful i had telegraphed my servant to bring me more clothes and my phoenix car and as i did not want him inquiring for fletcher farrell had directed him to come by boat to fall river accordingly the next morning i took the trolley to that city met him at the wharf and sent him back to new york i gave him a check with instructions to have it cashed in that city and to send the money and my mail to frederick fitzgibbon this alias i explained to him by saying i was gathering material for an article to prove one could live on fifty cents a day he was greatly relieved to learn i did not need a valet to help me prove it i returned driving the phoenix to new bedford and as it was a saturday when the store closed at noon i had the ineffable delight of taking polly briggs for a drive as chaperons she invited two young friends of hers named lowell they had been but very lately married and regarded me no more than a chauffeur they had hired by the hour this left polly who was beside me on the front seat and myself to our own devices our devices were innocent enough they consisted in conveying the selfcentred lowells so far from home that they could not get back for supper and were so forced to dine with me polly for as polly i now thought of her discovered the place it was an inn on the edge of a lake with an indian name we did not get home until late but it had been such a successful party that before we separated we planned another journey for the morrow that one led to the cape by way of bourne and woods hole and back again to the north shore to barnstable where we lunched it was a grand day and the first of others just as happy after that every afternoon when the store closed i picked up the lowells and then polly and we sought adventures sometimes we journeyed no farther than the baseball park but as a rule i drove them to some inn for dinner where later if there were music we danced if not we returned slowly through the pine woods and so home by the longest possible route the next saturday i invited them to boston we started early dined at the touraine and went on to a musical comedy where i had reserved seats in the front row this nearly led to my undoing late in the first act a very merry party of young people who had come up from newport and narragansett to the coatesislip wedding filled the stage boxes and at sight of me began to wave and beckon they were so insistent that between the acts i thought it safer to visit them they wanted to know why i had not appeared at the wedding and who was the beautiful girl the next morning on our return trip to new bedford polly said i read in the papers this morning that those girls in that theatre party last night were the bridesmaids at the coatesislip wedding they seemed to know you quite well i explained that in selling automobiles one became acquainted with many people polly shook her head and laughed then she turned and looked at me you never sold an automobile in your life she said with difficulty i kept my eyes on the road but i protested vigorously dont think i have been spying said polly i found you out quite by accident yesterday a young man i know asked me to persuade you to turn in your phoenix and let him sell you one of the new model i said you yourself were the agent for the phoenix and he said that on the contrary he was and that you had no right to sell the car in his territory i grinned guiltily and said well i havent sold any have i that is not the point protested polly what was your reason for telling me you were trying to earn a living selling automobiles so that i could take you driving in one i answered oh exclaimed polly there was a pause during which in much inward trepidation i avoided meeting her eyes then polly added thoughtfully i think that was a very good reason in our many talks the name of the fletcher farrells had never been mentioned i had been most careful to avoid it as each day passed and their return imminent and in consequence my need to fly grew more near and the name was still unspoken i was proportionately grateful but when the name did come up i had reason to be pleased for polly spoke it with approval and it was not of the owner of harbor castle she was speaking but of myself it was one evening about two weeks after we had met and i had sidestepped the lowells and was motoring with polly alone we were talking of our favorite authors dead and alive you may laugh said polly and she said it defiantly and i dont know whether you would call him among the dead or the living but i am very fond of fletcher farrell my heart leaped i was so rattled that i nearly ran the car into a stone wall i thought i was discovered and that polly was playing with me but her next words showed that she was innocent she did not know that the man to whom she was talking and of whom she was talking were the same of course you will say she went on that he is too romantic that he is not true to life but i never lived in the seventeenth century so i dont know whether he is true to life or not and i like romance the life i lead in the store gives me all the reality i want i like to read about brave men and great and gracious ladies i never met any girls like those farrell write about but its nice to think they exist i wish i were like them and his men too they make love better than any other man i ever read about better than i do i asked polly gazed at the sky frowning severely after a pause and as though she had dropped my remark into the road and the wheels had crushed it she said coldly talking about books no i corrected we were talking about fletcher farrell then said polly with some asperity dont change the subject do you know she went on hurriedly that you look like him like the pictures of him as he was heavens i exclaimed the mans not dead you know what i mean protested polly as he was before he stopped writing nor has he stopped writing i objected his books have stopped selling polly turned upon me eagerly do you know him she demanded i answered with caution that i had met him oh she exclaimed tell me about him i was extremely embarrassed it was a bad place about myself i could not say anything pleasant and behind my back as it were i certainly was not going to say anything unpleasant but polly relieved me of the necessity of saying anything i dont know any man she exclaimed fervently i would so like to meet it seemed to me that after that the less i said the better so i told her something was wrong with the engine and by the time i had pretended to fix it i had led the conversation away from fletcher farrell as a novelist to myself as a chauffeur the next morning at the hotel temptation was again waiting for me this time it came in the form of a letter from my prospective fatherinlaw it had been sent from cape may to my address in new york and by my servant forwarded in an envelope addressed to frederick fitzgibbon it was what in the world of commerce is called a followup letter it recalled the terms of his offer to me and improved upon them it made it clear that even after meeting me mr farrell and his wife were still anxious to stand for me as a son they were good enough to say they had found me a perfect gentleman they hoped that after considering their proposition i had come to look upon it with favor as his son mr farrell explained my annual allowance would be the interest on one million dollars and upon his death his entire fortune and property he would bequeath to me he was willing even anxious to put this in writing in a week he would return to fairharbor when he hoped to receive a favorable answer in the meantime he enclosed a letter to his housekeeper dont take anything for granted he urged but go to fairharbor and present this letter see the place for yourself spend the week there and act like you were the owner my housekeeper has orders to take her orders from you dont refuse something you have never seen this part of the letter made me feel as mean and uncomfortable as a wet hen the open almost too open methods of mr farrell made my own methods appear contemptible he was urging me to be his guest and i was playing the spy but against myself my indignation did not last a letter bearing a special delivery stamp which arrived later in the afternoon from mrs farrell turned my indignation against her and with bitterness she also had been spying her letter read the pinkerton i employed to report on you states that after losing you for a week he located you at new bedford that you are living under the name of fitzgibbon and that you have made yourself conspicuous by attentions to a young person employed in a shop this is for me a great blow and disappointment and i want you to clearly understand mr farrells offer is made to you as an unmarried man i cannot believe your attentions are serious but whether they are serious or not they must cease the detective reports the pair of you are now the talk of fairharbor you are making me ridiculous i do not want a shopgirl for a daughterinlaw and you will either give up her acquaintance or give up harbor castle i am no believer in ultimatums in attaining ones end they seldom prove successful i tore the note into tiny pieces and defiantly with polly in the seat beside me drove into the open country at first we picked our way through new bedford from the sidewalks her friends waved to her and my acquaintances smiled the detective was right we had indeed made ourselves the talk of the town and i was determined the talk must cease we had reached ruggles point when the car developed an illness i got out to investigate on both sides of the road were tall hemlocks and through them to the west we could see the waters of sippican harbor in the last yellow rays of the sun as it sank behind rochester overhead was the great harvest moon polly had taken from the pocket of the car some maps and guidebooks and while i lifted the hood and was deep in the machinery she was turning them over what she asked is the number of this car i forget as i have said i was preoccupied and deep in the machinery that is with a pair of pliers i was wrestling with a recalcitrant wire unsuspiciously i answered eighttwoeight a moment later i heard a sharp cry and raised my head with eyes wide in terror polly was staring at an open book without appreciating my danger i recognized it as whos who in automobiles the voice of polly rose in a cry of disbelief eighttwoeight she read owned by fletcher farrell hudson apartments new york city she raised her eyes to mine is that true she gasped are you fletcher farrell i leaned into the car and got hold of her hand that is not important i stammered what is important is this will you be mrs fletcher farrell what she said may be guessed from the fact that before we returned to new bedford we drove to fairharbor and i showed her the cottage i liked best it was the one with the oldest clapboard shingles the oldest box hedge the most fragrant honeysuckles and a lawn that wet its feet in the surf polly liked it the best too by now the daylight had gone and on the ships the riding lights were shining but shining sulkily for the harvest moon filled the world with golden radiance as we stood on the porch of the empty cottage in the shadow of the honeysuckles polly asked an impossible question it was how much do you love me you will never know i told her but i can tell you this i love you more than a twothousandton yacht the interest on one million dollars and harbor castle it was a wasteful remark for polly instantly drew away what do you mean she laughed fletcher farrell of harbor castle i explained offered me those things minus you but i wanted you i see cried polly he wanted to adopt you he always talks of that i am sorry for him he wants a son so badly she sighed softly poor uncle poor what i yelled didnt you know exclaimed polly that mrs farrell was a briggs she was my fathers sister then you i said are the relation who was too high and mighty polly shook her head no she said i didnt want to be dependent and you gave up all that i exclaimed and worked at hatchardsons just because you didnt want to be dependent i like my uncleinlaw very much explained polly but not my aunt so it was no temptation no more she cried looking at me as though she were proud of me than it was to you in guilty haste i changed the subject in other words i kissed her i knew some day i would have to confess but until we were safely married that could wait before confessing i would make sure of her first the next day we announced our engagement and polly consented that it should be a short one for as i pointed out already she had kept me waiting thirty years the newspapers dug up the fact that i had once been a popular novelist and the pictures they published of polly proved her so beautiful that in congratulation i received hundreds of telegrams the first one to arrive came from cape may it read my dear boy your uncle elect sends his heartiest congratulations to you and love to polly dont make any plans until you hear from me am leaving tonight fletcher farrell in terror polly fled into my arms even when not in terror it was a practice i strongly encouraged we are lost she cried they will adopt us in spite of ourselves they will lock us up for life in harbor castle i dont want to be adopted i want you i want my little cottage i assured her she should have her little cottage i had already bought it and during the two weeks before the wedding when i was not sitting around boston while polly bought clothes we refurnished it polly furnished the library chiefly with my own books and the log of the jolly polly i furnished the kitchen for a man cannot live on honeysuckles alone my future uncleinlaw was gentle but firm you cant get away from the fact he said that you will be my nephew whether you like it or not so be kind to an old man and let him give the bride away and let her be married from harbor castle in her white and green high flier car and all of her diamonds mrs farrell called on polly and begged the same boon we were too happy to see any one else dissatisfied so though we had planned the quietest of weddings we gave consent somehow we survived it but now we recall it only as that terrible time when we were never alone for once in the hands of our rich relations the quiet wedding we had arranged became a royal alliance a field of the cloth of gold the chief point of attack for the movingpicture men the youths who came from new york to act as my ushers informed me that the ushers dinner at harbor castlefrom which after the fish course i had fled was considered by them the most successful ushers dinner in their career of crime my uncleinlaw also testifies to this he ought to know at four in the morning he was assisting the ushers in throwing the best man and the butler into the swimmingpool for our honeymoon he loaned us the yacht take her as far as you like he said after this she belongs to you and polly and find a better name for her than harbor lights it sounds too much like a stayathome and i want you two to see the world i thanked him and suggested he might rechristen her the jolly polly that was the name i pointed out of the famous whaler owned by captain briggs your wifes father and it would be a compliment to polly too my uncleinlawelect agreed heartily but made one condition ill christen her that he said if you will promise to write a new log of the jolly polly i promised this is it
